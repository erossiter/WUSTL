SEN. DOMENICI REPORTS $7.3 MILLION FOR HEAD START PROGRAMS IN NEW MEXICO
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that several New Mexico organizations, including Home Education Livelihood Program (HELP - New Mexico), Inc. in Albuquerque, have received over $7.3 million from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve and expand Head Start programs.  
   HELP - New Mexico, Inc. received $1.2 million for its Head Start services. The organization provides family support services throughout the state (http://www.helpnm.com). 
   "Head Start programs give children an opportunity to prepare children for a successful education," said Domenici. "I am pleased that these funds will help provide improved Head Start programs throughout the state." 
   The following organizations received funding for Head Start services statewide: 
   * Child & Family Services, Inc. in Hobbs received a $1.1 million grant for its services in Lea County (http://www/cfsnm.net); 
   * Southeast New Mexico Community Action Corporation in Carlsbad received $3.2 million for its head start services in southeast New Mexico, including programs in Eddy, Lea, Chaves, Otero, and Lincoln counties (http://www.snmcac.org); 
   * Las Cruces School District #2 received $1.6 million. 
   Funds were administered through the HHS Head Start Projects program. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that helps determine annual funding for federal programs, including those administered by HHS. Last week, the Senate approved the FY2008 Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill, which includes $3.75 million to support the new Health Sciences Education Building at UNM. The bill now awaits consideration by a conference committee where it will be reconciled with the House-passed version.
