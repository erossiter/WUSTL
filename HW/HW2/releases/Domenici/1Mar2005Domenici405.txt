SEN. DOMENICI ENCOURAGES NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO APPLY FOR NEW FEMA GRANTS, DEADLINE APRIL 8
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will accept applications for the next cycle of Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program awards that help fire departments acquire equipment, vehicles and training.  
   New Mexico fire departments have from March 7-April 8 to apply for funding. Fire stations may also pre-register immediately to provide an opportunity for a smoother application process. DHS will use pre-registration information to update its database of applicants from prior years and to make necessary changes to past records. Pre-registration is encouraged but not required. 
   "New Mexico's fire departments have received millions in funding each consecutive year to keep our first responders alert and ready to handle emergencies," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
   "I encourage volunteer, combination and career fire departments to apply for grants that could help their station improve and deliver better service to their community," he said. 
   New Mexico received over $3.2 million from DHS in approximately 40 grants that have been awarded to fire stations around the state in 2004. 
   Congress provided $750 million in 2004 for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) and an additional $65 million in FY2005 to support a new firefighter hiring program called SAFER. DHS will solicit applications under this program in a separate application period that will follow the March 7-April 8 period for traditional AFGP applications. Notification for the open application period will follow at a later date. 
   Program guidance for FY2005 AFGP applications can be found at www.firegrantsupport.com or for additional information applicants may call the fire grant help line toll free at 866-274-0960.
