SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES UPWARD BOUND GRANTS FOR FOUR ADDITIONAL N.M. SCHOOLS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced that four additional New Mexico schools have been awarded federal funding to support Upward Bound programs to help disadvantaged students attain a college education.  
   Domenici announced that a total of $1.34 million has been awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to support Upward Bound programs offered by: the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council Inc., San Juan Pueblo; New Mexico Highlands University at Las Vegas; Northern New Mexico College at Espa?ola; and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in Albuquerque. The funding is expected to allow 320 students to take part in Upward Bound. 
   "These Upward Bound awards are good news for hundreds of students who might not otherwise consider a college education an option," Domenici said. "I'm pleased these schools have been included in this new round of grant awards." 
   Specifically, the Education Department will provide the following Upward Bound grants: 
   * Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council - $250,000 to support 50 participants 
   * NMHU - $595,491 to support 160 participants 
   * Northern New Mexico College - $250,000 to support 60 participants 
   * SIPI - $249,342 to support 50 participants 
   These grants follow the May award of more than $2.22 million to seven other New Mexico campuses to serve almost 500 students. Those awards went to Clovis Community College, Eastern New Mexico University at Portales, ENMU-Roswell; New Mexico Junior College at Hobbs, New Mexico State University at Las Cruces, University of New Mexico at Albuquerque, and UNM-Valencia County. 
   Upward Bound is a college-based program that provides academic instruction for low-income, disadvantaged high school students who are in the first generation of their families to consider getting a college education. During the summer, Upward Bound students live on the college campus and are involved in an extensive academic program with an emphasis on English, math, and science. Upward Bound has been found to significantly increase a student's likelihood of finishing college. 
   President Bush in November vetoed the FY2008 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill that Domenici, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped craft. That bill included $858.1 million for the federal TRIO/Upward Bound program. Appropriators are now working to retool the measure in a manner that will be accepted by the White House.
