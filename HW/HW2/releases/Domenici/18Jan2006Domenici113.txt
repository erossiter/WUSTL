SEN. DOMENICI: LOS LUNAS GROUP GETS SECOND USDA LOAN FOR ADULT RESIDENTIAL CENTER EXPANSION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that SC Inc. in Los Lunas has been awarded a second low-interest loan to expand its Senior Living Systems-Center for Ageless Living facility for adult residential care.  
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development agency has approved a $588,651 low-interest loan (40 years at 4.5 percent interest) to expand the Los Lunas facility to accommodate an additional 15 residents. In 2004, SC Inc. received an initial USDA Community Facility Direct Loan for $1.56 million loan to begin the facility expansion. The Los Lunas center can currently serve 30 residents. 
   "I am pleased the USDA Rural Development is making these additional resources available to expand this Los Lunas facility. As this community grows, there will more demand for residential care services, and this federal investment is intent on helping primarily rural areas meet those needs," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   The USDA loan funds are supporting the construction of a 6,000-square-foot facility and remodeling of the existing residential program to expand to five additional private rooms, new bathroom facilities and an entertainment room.
