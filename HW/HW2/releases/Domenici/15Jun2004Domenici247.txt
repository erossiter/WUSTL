SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR 17 COUNTIES TO PAY COST OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT INCARCERATION
  Seventeen New Mexico counties have been awarded over $679,399 in federal funds to help pay a portion of the cost involved in incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants, according to Sen. Pete Domenici, who is a member of the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee.  
   The funding was provided through the Department of Justice's (DOJ) State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) and will be used to reimburse expenses incurred by Bernalillo ($248,295) and Valencia ($18,650) counties as well as 15 others and the State of New Mexico. The CJS Subcommittee sets funding levels for the SCAAP program. 
   "It just makes sense that counties are given a means to offset the escalated cost of detaining and incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants," Domenici said. "Border states have a number of responsibilities to oversee, but immigration as a whole is a federal issue that should not be left up to the states to manage. Budgets for border enforcement are stretched as it is so I am very pleased that a good number of New Mexico counties will benefit from this award cycle." 
   The following counties were also awarded SCAAP funding, in addition to $193,023 for the State of New Mexico: Chaves ($16,920); Colfax ($5,556); De Baca ($1,759); Lea ($35,807); Otero ($25,532); Rio Arriba ($22,264); Santa Fe ($19,813); Taos ($4,641); Do?a Ana ($63,669); Grant ($5,955); Hidalgo ($1,742); Luna ($4,549); Quay ($1,397); Roosevelt ($5,107); and Sierra ($4,720). 
   Domenici is an original cosponsor of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) Reauthorization Act of 2003 (S. 460) which reauthorizes SCAAP through 2010 and authorizes appropriations of $750 million in FY04, $850 million in FY05, and $950 million annually from FY2006 to FY2010 to support the program. 
   Created by Congress in 1995, SCAAP funds reimburse states and local governments for costs incurred in detaining or incarcerating illegal immigrants accused of, or convicted of, felony or misdemeanor crimes in the United States. Reimbursable expenses can include court, detention, county attorney, clerk, and indigent defense costs. 
   Domenici recently asked the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee to reject a Justice Department proposal to eliminate all funding for SCAAP, and instead provide $850 million in FY2005 for the program so New Mexico counties continue to see some compensation. 
   In this same request, Domenici urged the subcommittee to provide $50 million for the Southwest Border Prosecutors initiative. These funds assist states such as New Mexico that share the border with Mexico in prosecuting criminal cases associated with illegal immigration, illegal drug trafficking, and other illegal activities.
