SEN. DOMENICI BRIEFED BY GEN. PETRAEUS FROM IRAQ
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today issued the following statement following a classified briefing he received at the Pentagon with General David Petraeus, commander of Multi National Forces-Iraq, and David Crocker, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. Petraeus and Crocker addressed the Senators from Iraq.  
   "I appreciate General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker meeting with us and giving us a first-hand assessment of the situation in Iraq now. Their dedication and that of our fighting forces in Iraq is admirable. But the more I learn of the lack of progress by the Iraqi government only further convinces me that we should change our policies in Iraq. Specifically, I believe we should adopt the Iraq Study Group recommendations as our official guide for future American involvement in Iraq and the region. I will continue to push that message." 
   Domenici is cosponsoring a bipartisan Salazar-Alexander bill (S.1545) that would implement the 79 recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group as U.S. policy in Iraq. These policies would shift American forces away from direct combat missions and into more support roles, including counterterrorism and special operation missions. 
   The Senate majority leader on Wednesday suspended debate on the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill after failed attempts to pass an amendment mandating an arbitrary withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq beginning in 120 days. Domenici voted against that amendment. It is uncertain when the bill will be called up for further consideration.
