SEN. DOMENICI LAUDS USDA RESOLUTION OF CHILE IMPORT HALT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has heeded his call to quickly resolve an emergency halt to chile imports from Mexico, which would have had a serious negative impact on the processing industry in New Mexico.  
   Importation of chiles from Mexico was halted because of a Mediterranean fruit fly problem in the Mexico state of Baja California. Only sealed containers were being allowed to cross the border until the Mexican government provided an acceptable plan for containing fruit fly infestation. 
   Upon learning of the problem, Domenici placed a call to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman to tell her of the seriousness of the situation and urge a speedy resolution. Vegetable processors believed that the sealed container requirement was impractical on such short notice and would threaten hundreds of chile shipments. 
   Early this morning, the USDA lifted the closed container requirement for trucks entering through New Mexico ports. Instead, only a phyto-sanitary certificate, which most truck carriers already have, will be required. The New Mexico Department of Agriculture will closely monitor processing plants to ensure that there are no fruit flies in the shipments from New Mexico. 
   "I'm very pleased that the USDA acted so quickly to save these chile shipments. While I certainly want to safeguard the United States from fruit fly infestation, I explained to Secretary Veneman that delaying these shipments would have a deep, negative economic impact. This solution will allow for the shipments to be made and processed with proper checks to make sure that fruit flies are not present," Domenici said. 
   An estimated 40 shipments of red chile were being held up on the U.S.-Mexico border, with another 250 expected in the near future. Many of those shipments were headed to New Mexico for processing by Border Foods in Deming and other smaller processors.
