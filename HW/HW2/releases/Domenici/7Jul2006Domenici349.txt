CARLSBAD GETS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT FOR DUI EQUIPMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded $11,335 to the city of Carlsbad to assist local law enforcement agency initiatives. 
   The Eddy County Division I Magistrate Court will utilize the funds to enhance its DWI/Drug Court Program. The court will purchase a device that provides secure, continuous, remote alcohol monitoring (SCRAM) services, which measures alcohol consumption through skin's perspiration.
   "DWI and drug use is such a big problem throughout our state and these funds have consistently supported local initiatives aimed at keeping our streets safe. Purchasing devices, such as SCRAM, will help effectively monitor individuals which will increase the chances that the program will be a success and efficiently help its participants," Domenici said.
   The DOJ grant was awarded as part of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) and can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support and information systems.
   The grant was awarded through the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Domenici serves on the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding limits for the DOJ and its grant programs.
   Earlier this year, Domenici supported a Senate amendment to the budget resolution to restore Byrne grant funding for FY2007 to its FY2003 level of $900 million. Congress last year appropriated $634 million for the Byrne program in FY2006.
