SEN. DOMENICI MOURNS PASSING OF LONG-TIME FRIEND 'DOC' STEWART OF CLOVIS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the death of his long-time friend Dr. Earnest O. "Doc" Stewart of Clovis.  
   "We've all lost a great friend in the passing of Doc Stewart. I've visited with his beloved wife Martha and expressed my condolences. 
   "Doc's life was an example of a sacrifice and commitment. He gave so much to his family, the community of Clovis, his church and the military, particularly the men and women at Cannon Air Force Base. My service as your Senator has been greatly blessed by having Doc Stewart as a constituent. He did so much, and he will be missed as we proceed toward a greater Clovis and a greater Cannon." 
   Domenici in late January was at the Pentagon to applaud Stewart as he received the 2005 Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award from the Air Force. The award was based on Stewart's nearly four decades as a community leader in Clovis and his support for members of the Armed Forces and their families--particularly at Cannon Air Force Base. 
   At the time, Domenici said of Stewart, a World War II veteran: "Doc has been the heart and soul of Cannon's community leadership since 1968. He has positively affected every major quality of life, infrastructure and training decision at Cannon since that time. His ability to understand and articulate Cannon's strategic position in the overall Air Force mission is critical to what makes Cannon so special."
