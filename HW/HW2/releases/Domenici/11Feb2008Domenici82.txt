   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici discusses the Economic Stimulus Package passed by Congress that will provide tax rebates to New Mexicans-$600 for individuals and $1,200 for families with income caps set at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for families. The plan also has a $300 credit per child. Domenici notes his support for the broader plan proposed by Democratic leaders in the Senate. 
   04:30 Domenici assesses the pros and cons of President Bush's FY2009 budget plan for New Mexico, noting that it is generally good for the national laboratories and for military construction at the state's Air Force Bases. He also touches on the lack of funding for such projects as the Valles Caldera National Preserve. 
   08:42 Domenici explains the difficulty facing the Democrats as they take the President's budget and attempt to craft a FY2009 Budget Resolution that makes up funding cuts for programs. He says their response to the budget could include $30 billion or more than the president's proposal. 
   10:22 Domenici says he believes the economic stimulus package will help spur economic growth because it will be enacted before a there is a full-scale recession. He says the economy can still be helped if a majority of Americans use the rebates to pay down their own personal debts. 
   13:27 Domenici says he is unsure whether the proposed FY2009 cuts to Medicaid and Medicare are warranted, and says that restoring that funding will require Congress agreeing to spend more on the federal budget than envisioned by President Bush. 
   15:32 Domenici says he understands that U.S. intelligence agencies are no longer using waterboarding as an interrogation technique. He says he agrees that it should not be used, but he does not see Congress trying to determine on a piecemeal basis what techniques can or cannot be used by intelligence agencies. 
   17:59 Domenici says it is understandable that the president's FY2009 budget might be characterized as a "guns vs. butter" plan. He says American war activities require the nation put an emphasis on supporting U.S. troops. He says war and defense funding will have to be reined in sooner that most people understand. He also says the U.S. federal budget will also have to seriously address entitlement spending reforms, and predicts that the next president--whether Republican or Democrat--will have to undertake this challenge. 
   22:23 Domenici discusses some of his legislative priorities during his last year in office, including trying to enact legislation to fund Indian water settlements in New Mexico, as well as a new national mental health parity law. He mentions a new nuclear waste policy bill he would like to introduce. 
   24:23 Domenici says he hopes Congress will succeed in reforming the 1872 Mining Law, but says it will have to be a moderate package to get enacted.
