SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN WITH BENEFITS FOR SOUTHERN OTERO, EDDY COUNTIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a $10 million loan to Rio Grande Electric Cooperative, Inc. to provide electric services in 18 counties in Texas and New Mexico, including Eddy and Otero counties. 
   The loan, approved through the Rural Development program, will be used to serve 250 new consumers, build 38 miles of new distribution line, and make other system improvements. The Rio Grande Electric Coop will utilize more than $302,400 of the USDA loan to provide electric service improvements in rural areas of southern Eddy and Otero counties.
   "Electric coops, like the Rio Grande, provide a tremendous service in providing rural electric services throughout our state. I am pleased at the size of this loan, which will ensure that many residents of both New Mexico and Texas rural areas will benefit from these services," Domenici said.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that designates the funding levels for the USDA and Rural Development program.
   The term of the loan will be provided for 35 years at U.S. Treasury loan interest rates.
