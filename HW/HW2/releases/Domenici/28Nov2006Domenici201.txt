SEN. DOMENICI: FEDERAL OIL, GAS ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO NEW MEXICO GROW TO EXCEED HALF BILLION DOLLARS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that federal royalty payments to New Mexico for oil and gas production on federal lands has exceeded half a billion dollars, reflecting a steady increase in energy production in the state.  
   The federal Mineral Management Service (MMS) has distributed $573.4 million in royalty payments to New Mexico for FY2006--$129.1 million above the $444.29 million it received last year. 
   Only one other state, Wyoming, received more in FY2006 royalty payments-$1.0 billion of the $2.2 billion paid to 34 states that produce oil, natural gas and coal on federal lands. 
   "New Mexico is a producing state that is helping to serve an energy-thirsty nation. Production and pricing has meant our royalty share has passed the half-billion mark, which means the state will have more to meet public education and other critical needs," said Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   "As we move toward greater diversity in our energy supplies, we must still work where suitable to tap the oil, gas and other resources owned by the American people," he said. 
   New Mexico's share of MMS payments have steadily increased over the past five years, from $193 million in FY2002, to $292 million in FY2003, to $364 million in FY2004, to $444.29 million in FY2005. 
   The MMS is the federal agency responsible for collecting, auditing and disbursing revenues associated with mineral leases on federal and tribal lands. Disbursements are made to states on a monthly basis as royalties, rents, bonuses and other revenues are collected by MMS. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the Interior Department and MMS.
