SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE VOTE AGAINST RESTORING WEAPONS FUNDING IN FISCAL 2008 LABS BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement regarding the vote in the House of Representatives to defeat an amendment offered by Rep. Tom Udall to restore $192 million in DOE weapons funding to the House FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill:  
   "I'm disappointed in the House vote on the Udall amendment. The road ahead remains difficult. The House is steering a course that would be very troublesome to U.S. nuclear deterrent and nonproliferation policy. 
   "I disagree with arguments in the House that portrayed efforts by Representatives Udall and the delegation to restore weapons funding as a New Mexico jobs protection exercise. The fact is that the House plan represents a seismic shift in American nuclear weapons policy with national and international implications. Instead, the House bill singles out Los Alamos and Sandia for significant cuts without offering any realistic or clear alternative to a true national security concern."
