SEN. DOMENICI REVELS IN U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH FIGURES, NEW MEXICO JOBLESS RATE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reveled in news that the American gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2006, saying the extraordinary growth is reflected in New Mexico's jobless rate. 
   The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Friday reported 4.8 percent growth in GDP, which is significantly higher than the 1.7 percent GDP in the last three months of 2005. It is the highest growth since the third quarter of 2003. New Mexico added 23,000 new jobs in 2005 and the state's jobless rate is 4.0 percent.
   "I am very happy with the new economic numbers that show the American GDP grew a fantastic 4.8 percent in the first quarter of this year.
   "It was the best quarter in almost two years, and is the 18th consecutive quarter of growth. In fact, we've now experienced 54 straight months of growth since fall 2001.
   "Why is this significant? Because it shows that the American economy has withstood terrorist attacks, historic natural disasters and now rising energy prices. We have remained strong.
   "This strength is apparent in New Mexico where we continue to see robust economic activity and growth. In the last year, New Mexico has added 23,000 new jobs. Our state's unemployment rate has dropped from 5.4 percent to just 4.0 percent--the second biggest drop in the entire country.
   "We in Congress need to continue looking at ways to make it easier for workers and families do even better economically. But today we can enjoy evidence of a very strong and robust economy."
   Growth in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy prices, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of consumer price inflation, declined to an annualized 2.0 percent in the 1st quarter from 2.4 percent in the 4th quarter.
