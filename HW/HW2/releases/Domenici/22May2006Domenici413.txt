SEN. DOMENICI HOLDS HEARING ON NUCLEAR POWER PLANS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee regarding plans to build nuclear power plants across the country. 
   The Senator heard testimony from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory today that, as of last week, 16 utility companies had serious plans to build 25 new nuclear power plants.
   "The testimony today affirmed what I have observed in a year of meetings with industry. We are indeed in the early days of a nuclear power renaissance in this country. I am pleased to see utilities moving forward with their plans for new plants while we on Capitol Hill continue to work on the matter of spent fuel," Domenici said.
   Witnesses at the hearing testified that the nuclear power provisions in the energy bill - the loan guarantees, production tax credit, stand-by support insurance and reauthorization of Price Anderson - have triggered the nuclear energy revival in America which the committee had intended to spark.
   James Asselstine, managing director of Lehmann Brothers, testified that the nuclear industry does not need a final resolution on the spent nuclear fuel issue to go forward with new nuclear power plants.
   "I remain committed to integrating GNEP and Yucca. I intend to fully-fund GNEP and find even more money for the program if I can. In the meantime, I am working to help DOE get Yucca back on track. I'm delighted by the momentum in this country toward new nuclear power. This is something I have been working toward for more than a decade," Domenici said.
