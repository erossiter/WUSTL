SEN. DOMENICI: NEW SUB IS FITTING TRIBUTE TO NEW MEXICANS IN ARMED FORCES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today called the Navy's decision to name a Virginia class nuclear submarine after New Mexico a fitting tribute to the state's veterans and active duty members of the Armed Forces.  
   In a ceremony today in Albuquerque, Navy Secretary Gordon England formally dedicated the sub, which will be built next year, the U.S.S. New Mexico. This is the second time a ship has borne that name. The first U.S.S. New Mexico was a battleship that served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet during World War II. 
   "The legacy of the battleship New Mexico will live on with this new nuclear submarine. It is a fitting tribute to New Mexicans that have served our country in the past and those that are currently fighting for us abroad. The sub will truly be a floating testament to the genius of U.S. technology, much of it connected to the work being done in our own state. 
   "I am grateful to the Navy for selecting our state for this honor, and I know that the work this sub will do to protect freedom abroad will be looked upon with pride by New Mexicans," Domenici said. 
   Domenici had been campaigning for the U.S.S. New Mexico since April of 2000. The request to name the sub after New Mexico was renewed in a January, 2003 letter to the Secretary of the Navy by Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman, and Representatives Heather Wilson, Tom Udall, and Steve Pearce. 
   The U.S. Navy currently has two nuclear attack submarines named for cities in New Mexico - the U.S.S. Albuquerque and the U.S.S. Santa Fe. 
   Twenty-two states already have namesake submarines. More information on the Navy's Virginia-class submarines is available at: http://vaclass.navy.mil/.
