SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF 'PARK AND RIDE' MONIES FOR SANTA FE, TRANSIT FUNDS FOR TAOS, ALAMOGORDO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that Santa Fe County has been awarded funds by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support the area's 'Park and Ride' program.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also said the Federal Transit Administration funding will back the purchase of seven new 15-passenger buses for Taos and a new van to expand the city of Alamogordo's Z-Trans program. 
   "The 'Park and Ride' program has been extremely successful in helping commuters between Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Espa?ola. Alamogordo and Taos will also be able to bolster their public transit systems with these funds," Domenici said. "I secured these funds in FY02 and I will continue to support these communities in the future." 
   Domenici regularly requested these funds during the FY2002 appropriations process and uses his position on the Senate Appropriations Committee to regularly seek money for New Mexico public transit. The committee and the Senate are expected to act on the FY2004 Transportation Appropriations Bill in September.
