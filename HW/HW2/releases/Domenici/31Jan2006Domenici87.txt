SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO CONFIRM SAMUEL ALITO AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined the Senate to approve the nomination of Samuel Alito to be an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.  
   Yesterday, Domenici took to the floor of the Senate to argue on Alito's behalf and decry an unsuccessful attempt by 25 Senate Democrats to filibuster the nomination. Today, the Senate confirmed Alito on a 58-42 vote. He will replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the court. 
   "While today's vote is closer than it should have been, I'm pleased that Judge Sam Alito was confirmed and will be joining the Supreme Court. Throughout his career and his confirmation process, he has shown himself to be exceptionally qualified for this position. I have full confidence that he will serve this nation well for many years to come," Domenici said. 
   "It is a shame that his nomination turned into such a political war. In the past, I've been called on to evaluate Supreme Court nominees whose philosophies differed from mine. Although they wouldn't have been my choice, I determined that they were well qualified for the Court and voted to confirm them anyway. I hope the Senate can come together for future nominations and return to evaluating nominees on their qualifications," he continued. 
   Judge Alito comes to the Supreme Court from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where he served for over 15 years. His judicial experience is more extensive than any nominee in history, and the American Bar Association gave him its highest rating. 
   Alito is expected to be sworn in as a Justice today by Chief Justice John Roberts, whose nomination was approved by the Senate late last year.
