SEN. DOMENICI JOINS MORIARTY, LOS ALAMOS STUDENTS COMPETING IN NATIONAL HISTORY DAY CONTEST
  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated three New Mexico students who were selected to present their history projects at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. as part of National History Day's national competition.  
   Ryan Andrews-Armijo and Ashley Page of Moriarty Middle School, and Shannon Burns from Los Alamos Middle School each presented projects at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Domenici met with the students at the Gallery prior to their presentations. 
   "I am always encouraged to see young people take responsibility for their education and make the most of its many opportunities," said Domenici. "I am confident that the experiences and skills they gain while researching and presenting their projects will pay off exponentially further on in their educational experience. I commend these students for their hard work." 
   Andrews-Armijo and Page presented their project concerning the racial challenge of the Texas Western College basketball team, while Burns's project dealt with the obstacles of Irish immigrants in the late 1800s. 
   The students were selected for the National History Day contest following the state contest, where the first and second-place finishers were chosen to advance to the national contest. 
   National History Day is an organization that promotes historical awareness among young people. It holds activities and projects year-round with the goal of drawing in students in grades 6 through 12 for the annual contest at the University of Maryland. Students have the option of presenting their projects in a documentary, exhibit, paper, or performance format.
