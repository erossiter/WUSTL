SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE FIRM GETS EXPANDED NAVY CONTRACT FOR HAND-HELD ISOTOPE DETECTORS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced that the Navy has approved a modified contract worth $28.4 million to a Santa Fe company to produce additional hand-held radiation detection devices.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said Thermo Eberline LLC of Santa Fe, the western service center for Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., has been awarded a maximum $28.4 million contract to provide additional "IdentiFINDER" devices. 
   The contact is a modification of a previous award, increasing the quantity of devices ordered from 160 to 362 units. The contact is to be completed by June 2012, with most work to be performed in Germany. 
   "This is a significant contact to a Santa Fe firm for high-tech devices that can help keep our military personnel safe," Domenici said. "The contract is further evidence of the growing attention being earned by the high-technology sector in New Mexico." 
   The IdentiFINDER is a lightweight hand-held device used to identify isotopes when radiation is present or suspected. These devices are part of the Thermo Eberline LLC work to manufacture analytical biochemistry and biopharmaceutical instruments. 
   The modified contact was issued by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
