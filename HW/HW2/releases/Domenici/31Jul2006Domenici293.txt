   REVIEW:
   00:00 - Domenici says he expects an overwhelming Senate vote in favor of his bill to open areas of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and natural gas production. He says he regrets opposition to his plan, but says his bill is necessary to allow the United States to produce more of its own energy resources and attempt to stabilize prices for industry and consumers.
   02:38 - Domenici says there is not direct comparison to Gulf of Mexico energy production and the drive to open a small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy exploration. He notes that the royalty cost-share plan in S.3711 will set precedent and possibly encourage other coastal states to agree to energy production.
   03:41 - Domenici says he is hopeful a ceasefire in the battle between Israel and the Hizbollah militant faction in Lebanon will allow humanitarian aid to get to refugees and set the state to a lasting peace. He discusses the need to end the conflict and civilian deaths.
   05:30 - Domenici says he completely disagrees with notions that the state of New Mexico should divest itself of investments linked to Israel. He says recriminations against Israel are not worthwhile and recalls that the conflict was started by Hizbollah attacks into Israel. He reiterates his believe that peace talks should begin soon.
   06:44 - Domenici expresses his strong support for plan passed by the House early Saturday to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour by 2009, and to implement permanent reforms to the federal death tax. He discusses the benefits of both plans, and adds that he also likes the House-passed plan to ensure pension solvency and fix the fund related to abandoned mine claims.
   10:41 - Domenici says raising the minimum wage, last increased in 1996, is long overdue and that he believes the phased-in increase will be acceptable to most small businesses.
   12:02 - Domenici says he is ready to enter into talks with the House on how best to fund and more forward with a new facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory to house plutonium activities. He supports the need to replace decrepit existing facilities and says House leaders sometimes dismiss the apparent needs at LANL and the national laboratories.
