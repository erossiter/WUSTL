   REVIEW:
   00:00 - Domenici says the Defense Department may be considering testing the so-called "Divine Strake" weapon at White Sands Missile Range, but says everyone should understand that this would be a non-nuclear test of bunker busting technology.
   01:31 - Domenici discusses the fifth anniversary of the September 11, and says the nation is still experiencing the ramifications of the terrorists attacks. He says attacks fundamentally changed how Americans view the world and that defining success in the Global War on Terror will be hard to determine in the years to come. He says the battle has evolved into one in which the enemy are "anti-freedom" forces.
   06:10 - Domenici says the pending Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) initiative will include a review of the technical challenges for nuclear waste recycling and advanced reactor technologies. He discusses the Lea and Eddy county pact to compete for a waste recycling facility. (9:30 a.m., Thursday, Sept. 14, Room 138, Dirksen.)
   10:15 - Domenici says he was pleased to gain $468,000 to support the ChildSafe/Ni?osSeguros child abuse prevent program because it has broad community support. He says he believes the Community Foundation of Southern New Mexico will put the Justice Department funding to good use to protect children.
   11:30 - Domenici says he is interested in learning more of the details behind Governor Richardson's trip to the Sudan to free New Mexico journalist Paul Salopek.
   12:39 - Domenici says the squabbles between House and Senate appropriators are delaying completion of the FY2007 appropriations bill to fund DOE and its national laboratories next year. He says this situation makes it difficult for lab directors to budget, and that he does not fault them for reducing personnel costs through attrition.
   15:40 - Domenici says he remains convinced that the Valle Vidal is adequately protected and that legislation to bar potential energy development there is unnecessary. At this point, he says the Forest Service should be able to continue its resource use study on the Valle Vidal. Domenici also discusses his responsibility as Energy Committee chairman to try to improve the United States' overall energy situation.
   18:17 - Domenici says he has not seen any evidence that the Bush administration has acted in an unconstitutional manner in the war on terror, nor has he seen evidence that the CIA secret prisons in Europe were unconstitutional. He says critics of President Bush could hurt the country as they try to destroy him with repeated charges that the President is acting unconstitutionally while trying to carry out a war.
   20:52 - Domenici reviews several of the New Mexico impacts included in the Senate-passed FY2007 Defense Appropriations Bill, including $4.0 million for a range-wide environmental impact statement at White Sands Missile Range and ongoing Navy R&D support for a desalination program in Otero County.
