SEN. DOMENICI ASSESSES NEW IRAQ WAR STRATEGY
  Sen. Pete Domenici on Wednesday evening issued the following statement after President Bush's national address on American military involvement in Iraq. Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, met with President Bush Monday to discuss this new plan.  
   "We need a new strategy in Iraq, and I'm willing to give the plan the President has outlined a chance. My support, however, is not unconditional. 
   "My support will be based on whether the Iraqi government will meet its obligations that are a part of this new plan. For instance, will the Iraqis field dependable brigades to secure their own country? Will the Iraqi government meet funding commitments for economic improvements in the region? Will Iraqi soldiers forcefully take on both the radical Shiite and Sunni elements? Will the Iraqi government commit to securing the Anbar province? Will other benchmarks set by the President be met? 
   "American involvement in Iraq cannot be open-ended or indefinite. It is well past time for the Iraqis to live up to their commitments and responsibilities toward establishing a self-sufficient and stable government."
