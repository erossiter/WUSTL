SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES COUNSELING GRANT FOR JEMEZ MOUNTAIN SCHOOLS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Jemez Mountain School District has been awarded a $274,844 grant by the U.S. Department of Education for school counseling programs.  
   Funds were awarded under the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Demonstration Program and are expected to support counseling programs in target elementary schools in the Jemez Mountain School District. 
   "Counseling programs are an important tool to help students succeed, not just in the classroom, but in other areas of their lives. This, in turn, can impact educational success," said Domenici. "It is a good thing for the Department of Education to offer these grants for local school districts to better develop their counseling capabilities. I hope that the Jemez Mountain School District will put these funds to good use." 
   The Jemez Mountain School District is expected to establish or expand counseling programs by hiring counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists to expand the counseling services it offers to its students. Funds are expected to be applied over a three-year period beginning May 1. 
   The Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program provides funds to enable education agencies to establish or expand elementary and secondary school counseling programs. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federal agencies, including the Department of Education.
