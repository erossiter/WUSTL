SEN. DOMENICI DELIVERS $1.65 MILLION CHECK TO CONTINUE MODERNIZING ELEPHANT BUTTE IRRIGATION SYSTEM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today presented funding to help improve water use efficiency within the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID), an agriculture watering system dating back to the 1840s. 
   Domenici presented a ceremonial check for $1.65 million to EBID leaders. Domenici secured the Bureau of Reclamation funding last year as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee. The investment is intended to modernize information management and automatic data collection systems to increase EBID efficiency.
   "Over its 160 year history, the Elephant Butte irrigation community has continuously changed and the irrigation system has worked to meet those needs," Domenici said. "Today we deliver resources to allow the irrigation district to launch a concerted effort to modernize the district, to dramatically improve efficiency and to create a state of the art information management system."
   The funding secured by Domenici will be used to:
   * Modernize data collection and information management systems;
   * Pilot test more efficient on-farm irrigation systems;
   * Test new canal lining technology;
   * Continue river restoration efforts to manage canalized areas of the Rio Grande; and
   * Define methods to optimize delivery of water to hard to reach areas.
   As part of this work, EBID will install a surface water drip irrigation system, sub-canopy sprinkler irrigation system, and polymer canal lining in select areas to test for future application on a broader basis.
   "We will continue to live with the two extremes of drought and deluge," said Domenici, who noted that drought conditions took water reserves in the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs to an all-time low of 4-5 percent of capacity only to be partially replenished by an unusually heavy monsoon season.
   "A modern irrigation district must efficiently use every drop of water, actively manage the river system, and balance water resources with environmental needs," Domenici said. "To do this, we need real-time, accurate and pertinent water resource information, efficient on-farm irrigation technology, and the best possible system to move water where it is needed."
   The EBID award is part of Domenici's ongoing support for irrigation efficiency improvements in New Mexico. He has supported Water 2025 awards to EBID, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District and the Carlsbad Irrigation District in southeast New Mexico. 
  Domenici also commended EBID for its first responder efforts this summer in flooded areas of Do?a Ana County including draining flooded areas and repairing the breached Placitas Arroyo at Hatch.
   "Before this summer's floods, we had almost forgotten that water in too large a quantity is as bad as too little. I am proud of the heroic efforts of EBID and communities here in Southern New Mexico to help your neighbors and friends during this years monsoon season."
