COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DOMENICI-COSPONSORED BILL TO CHALLENGE CHILD ABUSE ON RESERVATIONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported committee passage of a measure he cosponsored to challenge child abuse problems on American Indian reservations.  
   Domenici serves on the Indian Affairs Committee that this week approved the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act (S.398). 
   Domenici is an original cosponsor to this bill, which was introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). It is now ready for consideration by the full U.S. Senate. 
   The bill attempts to strengthen efforts to better protect children on reservations who are victims of abuse and build on the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act of 1990. 
   "Child abuse is an incendiary crime, and all too often victims on the reservation find it more difficult to find help and safety," Domenici said. "This bill would work to expand the safety network that child abuse victims need in order to escape abuse. It will also improve our understanding of what impediments keep child abuse prevention programs from working on the reservation." 
   As approved by the Indian Affairs Committee, S.398 would: 
   * Authorize a study to identify impediments to the reduction of child abuse in Indian Country, as well as require data collection and annual reporting to Congress concerning child abuse in Indian Country; 
   * Provide additional safeguards for the privacy of child information by local law enforcement and child protective services; 
   * Provide for more involvement by the FBI and the Attorney General in documenting incidents of child abuse on Indian reservations; 
   * Authorize the Indian Health Service to use telemedicine in connection with examinations of abused Indian children; 
   * Authorize background investigations for employees and volunteers who work with Indian children; 
   * Amend the Major Crimes Act to criminalize acts of child abuse and neglect in Indian Country; Authorize several treatment programs for Indian children who have been victimized; and 
   * Authorize professionals trained in behavioral health, including suicide prevention and treatment, to be included on the staff of regional Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers.
