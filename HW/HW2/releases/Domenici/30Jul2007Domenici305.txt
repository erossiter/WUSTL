   REVIEW: 
   00:46 - Domenici says Congress is awaiting General David Petraeus' report in September on the situation in Iraq. He notes that Petraeus asked for "time, money and soldiers" and got them all. He says that despite the recent contentious Senate debate on Iraq policy, the Bush administration's position on the war is likely to stay in place until the Petraeus report is issued. 
   02:26 - Domenici says he and Senator Bingaman will continue to push for progress on the Navajo Water Settlement, and notes his recent push for the nominee to head the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to commit to helping settle the Navajo water rights issue. 
   06:40 - Domenici says OMB and the Interior Department have been roadblocks to moving the Navajo water settlement forward, and that President Bush is not being well-served by these two agencies' refusal to provide realistic federal contributions to pay for the settlement. 
   08:16 - Domenici says he will encourage President Bush to lift his veto threat against the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, which includes $3.0 billion in emergency funding for immediate border security needs. Domenici cosponsored the amendment to provide this emergency funding. He says the President should be convinced that more funding is needed to better secure the border. 
   11:30 - Domenici says he is not intimately familiar with Senator John McCain's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, but that it is obvious that his campaign is not going well. 
   14:07 - Domenici says John McCain's popularity among Republicans may have been hurt by the Arizona Senator's stances on the Iraq war and the immigration debate, and disruptions in his campaign organization. 
   16:04 - Domenici says he says the entitlement reform effort in Congress has stalled, although he believes Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg may now be open to the biennial budget process. 
   19:01 - Domenici says he and Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne Feinstein are concerned that the administration may not continue Operation Jump Start--the National Guard program on the Southwest border--at full force. He says they are arguing for the administration to keep the program fully operational. 
   21:55 - Domenici says he does not believe Senator Russell Feingold will receive much support for his plan to force a United States withdrawal from Iraq because most members of Congress understand the reality of what it will take to leave Iraq. He says he continues to believe the bipartisan Salazar-Alexander plan remains a viable proposal for being the "guiding light" for U.S. policy in Iraq.
