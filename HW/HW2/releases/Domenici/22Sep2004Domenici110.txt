SEN. DOMENICI BACKS REP. GOSS TO BE NEW CIA DIRECTOR
  Sen. Pete Domenici joined his colleagues today to confirm Porter Goss to be the new director of Central Intelligence.  
 Goss was nominated by President Bush after Director George Tenant announced his departure. 
   Goss, a congressman from Florida, and former CIA officer, has served as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence since 1997. That committee has legislative, budget authorization and oversight jurisdiction over the entire U.S. intelligence community. 
   "Few people are as eminently qualified to lead the CIA as this critical time in our nation's history," Domenici said. "Porter Goss combines experience as both a U.S. Army Intelligence and CIA officer with fifteen years as member of the U.S. House. He is a public servant who has earned our confidence and who will work tirelessly to preserve our nation's security." 
   "The challenges we have in defeating global terrorism remain great. But because Porter Goss has been involved in so many aspects of intelligence-from covert operations to congressional overview-I am confident that he understands intelligence operations, where we have made mistakes in the past and how to correct them," he said. 
   In addition to chairing the House Intelligence Committee, Goss was co-chairman of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, the first-ever bi-cameral review of intelligence activities leading up to 9/11. 
   Goss served as an Intelligence Officer in the U.S. Army, and spent over a decade as a Clandestine Services Officer with the CIA. He was elected to Congress in 1988, representing Southwest Florida's 14th District.
