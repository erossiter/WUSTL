SEN. DOMENICI WARNS CONSTITUENTS TO PREPARE FOR CUTBACKS IF DEMOCRATIC FY2007 FUNDING PROPOSAL ENACTED
  Sen. Pete Domenici has begun to warn constituents in New Mexico to prepare for the possibility of cutbacks if a proposed FY2007 appropriations plan by Senate and House Democratic leaders is enacted.  
   Democratic leaders, including Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have announced plans to drop the FY2007 Appropriations process in favor of a long term Continuing Resolution (CR), which would fund the government at 2006 levels for the year. That would mean the loss of an estimated $494 million in federal appropriations for individual projects and payments in New Mexico. 
   Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today sent a letter to organizations that were slated to receive federal funding for specific projects as part of the FY2007 Appropriations process. These groups, ranging from the Head Start program in Aztec-Bloomfield to programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, had been selected to receive federal funding for FY2007, but would not if the Democratic plan is enacted. 
   Domenici's letter reads: 
   "As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I still strongly support your project. I have said publicly and privately to the Senate leadership that the handling of the FY 2007 appropriations bills has been a travesty. I have long advocated the individual completion of each of the annual appropriations bills, and continue to vigorously fight for this approach. At this time, the only FY2007 appropriations bills signed into law are those funding the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. 
   "The Democratic leadership of the House and Senate has decided to provide FY2007 funding for the remaining departments through a continuing resolution covering the duration of the fiscal year. This proposal would forgo all the funding priorities set this year by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. I strongly oppose this plan, as it would have serious negative consequences on a large number of New Mexico projects and activities. 
   "Instead of the current proposal, I advocate an approach that would allow Congress to work its will, as the Constitution requires, on each of the remaining individual FY2007 bills. This would mean that many New Mexico initiatives would have a chance to become law, including additional funding for our national laboratories, schools, and individual New Mexico community projects. 
   "Instead of preserving important priorities like these, set through the regular appropriations process, the Democratic plan will give the Executive Branch almost carte blanch to do whatever it wants in spending for FY2007. I continue to warn my colleagues about the adverse effects the Democratic plan will have on Congress' prerogative to set funding priorities representing the needs of the country." 
   Except for the Defense and Homeland Security departments, the federal government is currently being funded through a short term Continuing Resolution, which expires February 15. At that point, Congress must decide how to fund the government through FY2007. 
   The funds for New Mexico are contained in the following bills, all of which have yet to be acted on by Congress: 
   * Agriculture; 
   * Commerce, Justice and Science; 
   * Energy and Water; 
   * Interior; 
   * Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; 
   * State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs; 
   * Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; and, 
   * Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development.
