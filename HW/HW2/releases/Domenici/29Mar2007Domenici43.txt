SEN. DOMENICI JOINS SALUTE TO N.M.'S TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
  Sen. Pete Domenici joined his colleagues in paying tribute to three World War II veterans from New Mexico who today were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their service in the 332nd Fighter Group, better known as the Tuskegee Airmen.  
   Robert Lawrence of Santa Fe, James Williams of Las Cruces, and John Allen of Rio Rancho are among the 300 Tuskegee Airmen who received the medal, the highest award bestowed by the United States Congress. Lawrence and Williams were on hand for the award ceremony with President George W. Bush and members of Congress in a Capitol Rotunda ceremony Thursday. 
   "These men deserve to be honored on so many levels. Their bravery helped turn back tyranny in World War II and their courage helped tear down the tyranny of segregation and prejudice that prevented African Americans from truly sharing their talents with the world. The Tuskegee Airmen's service helped accelerate the desegregation of our Armed Forces which eventually led to school desegregation and our landmark civil rights laws," Domenici said. "I'm proud that New Mexico is home to members of this elite corps, and that they have been duly honored by Congress and a grateful nation."
