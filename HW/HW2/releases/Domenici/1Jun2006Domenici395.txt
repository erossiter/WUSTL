SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $7.11 MILLION FOR BETTER HOUSING THROUGHOUT NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a total of $7.11 million in grants to housing authorities throughout New Mexico, including $1.5 million for the Albuquerque area and $2.79 million throughout northern areas of the state. 
   The HUD grants are distributed through the Capital Fund Program which awards grants to 3,145 public housing authorities nationwide. Capital Fund grants may be used for modernization, financing, management, and development improvements. In all, 37 agencies in New Mexico were awarded grants.
   "These funds are greatly needed to improve the quality of housing in New Mexico. Because basic and affordable housing is such a need for us, New Mexico continues to receive such a large portion of these HUD funds. I trust that these funds will be used to improve our communities with better housing," Domenici said.
   Domenici serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee which designates funding for HUD and its programs.
