SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES NASA GRANTS TO UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LAB RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that scientists at the University of New Mexico have been awarded a total of $2,495,000 in grants to support research opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences.  
   The grants have been awarded through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and will be used to study the composition of a variety of extraterrestrial objects including planets and their moons. Studies will also be conducted on extraterrestrial materials such as meteorites, cosmic dust and lunar samples. 
   "I believe this is an exciting time for the UNM scientific research department. The research developed from these NASA grants will provide a tremendous opportunity for UNM researchers, and their students, to learn more about the composition of the solar system and universe," said Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   Specific areas of research grants include: Microbeam Studies of Planetary Materials ($1,080,000); Extraterrestrial Studies Using Nuclear Interactions ($189,000); Formation and Alteration Histories of Chondritic Materials ($875,000); and Petrologic, Chemical and Experimental Investigations of Early Solar System Materials ($351,000). 
   The research will be conducted through the Institute of Meteoritics (IOM) with the UNM Department of Earth and Planetary Science. The IOM, founded in 1944, was the first institute in the world built exclusively for meteoric research. 
   The grants awarded were sponsored through NASA's Cosmochemistry Program which operates under the Solar System Division of the Science Mission Directorate.
