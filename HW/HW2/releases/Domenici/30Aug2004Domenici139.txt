SEN. DOMENICI URGES NEW MEXICO SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAKE VOTING FOR SERVICEMEN, WOMEN 'AS UNCOMPLICATED AS POSSIBLE'
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged the New Mexico Secretary of Rebecca Vigil-Giron to ensure that the state make it as easy as possible for New Mexicans serving in the Armed Forces overseas to vote in the general election this fall.  
   In a letter to Vigil-Giron, Domenici said it is incumbent that the state meet its responsibilities under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), noting that the Justice Department recently sought and won court orders against Georgia and Pennsylvania for UOCAVA violations. 
   "I know you share my concern for ensuring that Uniformed Service members and their families can participate in our democracy with ease," Domenici wrote Vigil-Giron. "I believe that the men and women serving our country overseas should be able to cast a ballot as easily as citizens who vote in the United States. It is not enough that voting processes are merely 'available' to service men and women. We must work to make the process as uncomplicated as possible by removing administrative roadblocks to swift delivery and return of absentee ballots." 
   Domenici encouraged Vigil-Giron to publicize her plan for ensuring that no military voter is disenfranchised in 2004. 
   "Allow all of our state's voters to be confident that our state will not violate either the law or our moral duty to our soldiers. Only your office can give military voters the public attention they deserve, and I urge you to cast light on an issue that has been hidden from public view for too long," Domenici wrote.
