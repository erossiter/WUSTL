EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AWARDS $745,575 GAINED BY SEN. DOMENICI FOR KNME-TV INDIAN YOUTH LITERACY PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced the award of federal funding he secured to allow KNME-TV in Albuquerque to launch the "Between the Lions" American Indian Head Start Literacy Initiative in New Mexico.  
   Domenici, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, gained a $745,575 earmark within the U.S. Department of Education's FY2004 budget. The Education Department on Friday informed Domenici that it has formally awarded the funding to KNME-TV, the public broadcast station based at the University of New Mexico. 
   "I am excited about this project, which could provide the spark needed to excite more Indian children to the wonderful things they can learn through reading. KNME is working with the tribes and pueblos to create the most effective, culturally-sensitive program to best reach these children," Domenici said. "Its success could make a world of difference to American Indian children as they go forward in their academic careers." 
   KNME will use the funding to work with New Mexico tribes and pueblos to improve early literacy skills among American Indian children. The funding would support materials development and implementation. Tribes and pueblos committed to working with KNME on the early education project include the Mescalero Apache Tribe, Eastern Navajo, and the pueblos of Acoma, Laguna, San Felipe, San Juan, Isleta, Taos, Cochiti, Sandia, Santa Ana, and Zia. 
   The "Between the Lions" literacy program, produced by WGBH-TV in Boston, will be tailored into an early education curriculum in collaboration with New Mexico Tribal Head Start programs. 
   Funding for this project was included in the FY2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill, which became law earlier this year as part of an omnibus appropriations package.
