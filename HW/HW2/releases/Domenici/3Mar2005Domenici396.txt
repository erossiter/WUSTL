SEN. DOMENICI PREVIEWS TRIP TO ALASKA'S NORTH SLOPE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he expects to gain a more thorough understanding of the stakes involved with energy production at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) through an official Senate trip he is sponsoring to the Alaskan North Slope this weekend.  
   Domenici Thursday hosted a news conference to preview the ANWR trip that will involve four other Senators, as well as Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman. The delegation departs Friday morning and will return to Washington Monday. This is Domenici's first excursion to ANWR. 
   "ANWR is a big deal if we're serious about producing more energy domestically. It is our largest on-shore reserve. The question is whether United States should abandon the opportunity to prove up, with minimal economic impact, the largest oil reserve on American soil. Should we abandon it or should we look at it and make a decision?" Domenici asked. 
   "The purpose of this trip is to verify the suitability of new production technologies that would create a very small footprint on ANWR and give us the potential to tap as much as one million barrels of oil a day," he said. 
   "I want to see that with modern technology ANWR will not be like the Permian Basin. Had we had this technology on that basin in New Mexico and West Texas, there would probably be a lot fewer oil wells," he said. 
   In addition to viewing ANWR itself, the trip itinerary includes reviews of new winter drilling technologies being used in the Alpine Field and older technologies used at Prudhoe Bay, and meetings with Inupiat and North Slope leaders in Barrow and Kaktovik, Alaska. 
   Senators joining Domenici on the trip include: Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Robert Bennett (R-Utah), John Bunning (R-Ky.), and John Thune (R-S.D.). Jim Connaughton, director of the Council for Environmental Quality, will also be on the trip.
