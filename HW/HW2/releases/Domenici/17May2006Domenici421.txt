SEN. DOMENICI CRITICAL OF DEMOCRATIC ENERGY PLAN, CALLS FOR BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO INCREASE SUPPLIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today expressed criticism of an energy plan offered by Democratic Senators and encouraged lawmakers to work on a bipartisan plan to increase the energy supplies for all Americans. 
   The following is a statement issued by Domenici regarding the Democratic plan:
   "This latest plan is a sprinkling of good ideas, a heavy helping of bad ideas and distractions, and a pathetic absence of any effort to increase America's energy supply.
   "My Democratic colleagues fail to understand the basic tenets of supply and demand. If we want to bring down energy prices, we must reduce demand while increasing supply. Instead, they simply propose an array of untested federal mandates they hope will reduce demand. President Jimmy Carter tried a similar approach in the 1970s and we all remember how that turned out.
   "If my colleagues want to bring down energy prices, stop blaming the President and join us our efforts to reduce demand and increase supplies."
   Domenici, a strong advocate for tapping into domestic energy sources, continues to work with a number of Senators to develop an energy plan that would build on the Energy Policy Act of 2005 with new legislative provisions that include, among other things:
   * Consumer Anti-Price Gouging Protection - Gives Federal Trade Commission, Justice Department and states attorneys general greater authority to enforce penalties against suppliers who unlawfully manipulate fuel prices;
   * Tax Incentives - Repeals tax incentives for oil companies while expanding tax incentives to promote the use of hybrid vehicles and increase refinery capacity;
   * Fuel Economy Standards - Gives the U.S. Secretary of Transportation more authority to issue a rule governing fuel economy standards (CAFE) for passenger vehicles;
   * Advanced Energy Initiative - Encourages R&D into alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles to diversify the domestic energy supply; and,
   * Refinery Capacity - Offers incentives to encourage additional refinery capacity to enhance energy infrastructure.
