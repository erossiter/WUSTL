AT CONFERENCE, SEN. DOMENICI FOCUS ATTENTION ON WATER AVAILABILITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today laid out a wide-ranging plan that addresses serious water availability issues in Western states to water and wastewater managers at the Western Coalition of Arid States Winter Conference.  
   Domenici assured water managers from several Western states that his legislative agenda for the 109th Congress will include critical water legislation and that availability concerns remain a top priority. Domenici outlined an ambitious plan to alleviate water strains on dry states that includes the formation of a water supply council, promotion of desalination, and introduction of several bills. 
   "Drought conditions have affected nearly everyone in arid western states in one way or another. Wells are running dry, farmers are being forced to sell livestock, many cities are in various stages of water conservation, and many acres of land have been charred by fire," Domenici said. "I believe we must use every tool available to confront these water problems, and doing so remains one of my top priorities." 
   "We need to come at this from many different angles since water shortages present a multitude of complications. That's why I have crafted several pieces of legislation that focus on rural communities, water technology and augmentation, and insidious plant eradication," he said. 
   "I believe the combined effect of those bills plus continued efforts in desalination and formation of a national water council will greatly improve the situation of dry states like New Mexico," he said. 
   Domenici has vigorously supported and initiated water legislation during his chairmanship of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, stressing the importance of creating new water supplies while stretching existing sources and actively pursuing desalination and water reuse efforts. Four initiatives are part of Domenici's water shortage plan: 
   * Energy-Water Technology Act - creates a new program to develop the technology necessary to expand water supplies and increases efficiency using the DOE's existing science infrastructure and establish partnerships with universities, various agencies, and water management districts. 
   * Water Supply Council - to coordinate activities between federal and non-federal groups to explore ways to provide water to all Americans in the future. 
   * Rural Water Bill - inventories rural water needs and streamlines the process for obtaining feasibility and appraisal studies in order to construct rural water systems; would also create a loan guarantee program within the Bureau of Reclamation to revitalize existing infrastructure and help rural communities make use of lower interest rates and obtain loans they may not be give otherwise. 
   * Salt Cedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Act (S.177) - sets up a state-based demonstration program to determine the best way to manage invasive salt cedar and Russian olive trees along river banks, has already been cleared by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and now awaits Senate action. 
   On April 5, Domenici and the Energy Committee will conduct a half-day conference on water to draw out proposals from industry, government, public interest groups, academia and private citizens that address the challenge of meeting the nation's ever increasing demand for water. 
   The discussion will be broken into six topics: Water Supply and Resource Management Coordination; Role of the Bureau of Reclamation in the 21st Century; Indian and Federal Reserved Water Rights; Conservation and Technological Developments; Knowledge of Water Resources; and Drought. Proposals should mirror and address one or more of these concerns.
