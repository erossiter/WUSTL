SEN. DOMENICI: NORTH KOREAN WEAPONS TEST HEIGHTENS THREAT TO U.S., WORLD
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a leading nonproliferation advocate in the Senate, today issued the following statement condemning North Korean claims that it has tested a nuclear weapon: 
   "The regime in North Korea continues to behave dangerously and recklessly. The possibility that it may have conducted a nuclear test is deplorable and, if confirmed, represents a significant threat to the United States and global security.
   "With this provocative action, North Korea has clearly demonstrated its contempt for diplomacy and negotiation. The United States must be very vigilant and ready to protect ourselves with an enhanced defense missile system, and we must demand significant action from the UN Security Council.
   "The Security Council must take immediate action to sanction North Korea so that the nonproliferation threat is minimized and meaningful consequences are imposed to rein in this dangerous government.
   "The test in North Korea comes despite the efforts of the United States and the international community to work in good faith with the government in Pyongyang. Instead, North Korea has escalated its drive toward a military nuclear program as the first country ever to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in January 2003. It has stalled continued six-party talks involving Japan, China, South Korea, Russia and the United States. They must return to these talks in a meaningful way."
   Domenici serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and for the past 20 years has helped fund development of U.S. missile defense systems, including testing carried out at White Sands Missile Range. In addition, Domenici has consistently funded nonproliferation activities as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee.
