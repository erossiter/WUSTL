SEN. DOMENICI: FIVE NEW MEXICO FIRMS GET $1.29 MILLION IN DOE INNOVATIVE TECH GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that five high-tech small businesses in New Mexico have been awarded more than $1.29 million in innovative research grants from the Department of Energy. 
   The Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grants were awarded through the DOE Office of Science and are intended to encourage technological innovation through small businesses to advance DOE research and development missions.
   "These competitive grants are a testament to the dynamic nature of the high-tech business in the United States. I'm glad these firms in Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Los Alamos now have a chance to advance their work," Domenici said. "The results of these research initiatives may develop into real solutions to some of DOE's research and development needs."
   The awards are among 280 selected from more than 1,300 applications, and represent Phase I funding that can lead to Phase II funding in FY2008. The small businesses that win the awards in these programs keep the rights to any technology developed which they are encouraged to commercialize.
   New Mexico firms awarded DOE SBIR grants include:
   * Deep Web Technologies LLC in Santa Fe received eight separate grants totaling $797,975.
   * Southwest Sciences Inc. in Santa Fe received two grants worth $200,000.
   * NumerEX LLC in Albuquerque received a $99,997 grant.
   * Research Applications Corp. of Los Alamos won a $100,000 grant.
   * Rocky Mountain Geophysics LLC of Los Alamos received a $99,000 grant.
   Domenici is ranking member on the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Committee that funds the DOE Office of Science. For FY2008, $4.397 billion, $600 million more than FY2007, has been requested for this office. The increase is part of the President's goal to double investment in basic research in the physical sciences by 2016 as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative.
