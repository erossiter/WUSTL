DOE AWARDS WIPP WASTE CHARACTERIZATION GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that a Department of Energy grant will allow radiological control technicians to provide support to waste characterization activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  
   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued $426,800 to Bartlett Services, Inc., in Mass. to provide additional staff to help manage the Central Characterization Program (CCP) at LANL. 
   "WIPP continues to generate employment opportunities for New Mexico and I am pleased that the DOE has provided funds for personnel to join the team in Los Alamos. These technicians will help maintain WIPP's high standard of safety and assist with waste characterization," Domenici said. 
   Radiological control technicians typically perform radiological surveys on all drums and boxes, implement radiological work permits (RWP), and train and brief personnel on the requirements of the RWP's prior to the commencement of work. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that provides funding for DOE and its programs like WIPP. The lawmaker helped include $230.6 million for WIPP operations and the DOE Carlsbad Area Office, which is $5.25 million over FY2005 funding levels.
