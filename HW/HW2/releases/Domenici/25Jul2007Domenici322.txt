SEN. DOMENICI BACKS $3 BILLION EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY EFFORT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today became an original cosponsor to a broad plan to secure the America's borders by providing $3.0 billion in emergency funding for the personnel and equipment to restrict illegal entries into the United States. 
   The "Border Security First" measure was introduced Wednesday as an amendment to the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill (HR.2638). It was offered by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and cosponsored by Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. The Senate is expected to complete work on HR.2638 this month.  
   "The United States faces a crisis on our borders. The security of our borders is the most important domestic issues confronting our nation, and we must act now to provide the security needed and, rightly, demanded by the American people. This plan will provide actual and immediate funding that will be available as soon as this bill is enacted," Domenici said. 
   "This is a responsible plan for achieving greater control of our borders. It will give us more Border Patrol agents, more immigration investigators, more border fencing, and more technology to protect our borders," he said. 
   The amendment would make $3.0 billion in emergency funding available to: increase the Border Patrol to a total of 23,000 agents; construct 700 miles of border fencing as required by the Secure Fence Act; build at least 300 miles of border vehicle barriers; purchase four unmanned aerial vehicles; install 105 radar and camera towers; and provide at least 45,000 beds to detain illegal immigrants. 
   Domenici also pointed out that the amendment would provide the necessary funding to maintain the National Guard presence along our Southwest border, a program instituted last year under Operation Jump Start. 
   "The National Guard has been a tremendous asset in helping secure our borders over past year, and we need to continue utilizing them in New Mexico to the extent National Guard capabilities allow" said Domenici, who has expressed concerns about the administration plan to decrease the number of National Guardsmen participating in Operation Jump Start this summer. 
   The amendment also incorporates Domenici's previous legislative plan to advance port of entry modernization, requiring an annual land port of entry infrastructure assessment that prioritizes needs based on enhancing border security while facilitating the flow of legitimate commerce. The provision would create up to five port of entry technology testing and demonstration sites on the borders. 
   The following is a summary of additional provisions included in the emergency "Border Security First" amendment: 
   * Increased Personnel: Requires 14,500 new Customs & Border Patrol (CBP) agents through FY2012-for a total of about 30,000 CBP agents overall-as well as increased hires of new Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. 
   * Operation Jump Start/National Guard: Provides additional funding for Operation Jump Start to maintain a National Guard presence along the Southern border. 
   * Criminal Aliens: Strengthens laws to deny immigration benefits to aggravated felons, gang members, terrorists, sex offenders, and child abusers. The amendment also expands the Institutional Removal Program and gives Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the ability to detain criminal aliens for an extended period of time before they can be removed. 
   * State and Local Law Enforcement: Gives state and local law enforcement new authority to detain illegal aliens and transfer them into DHS custody. Moreover, it allows state and local law enforcement authorities to use DHS grants for 287(g) training (training permitted, under memorandums of understanding, for designated local officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions) and provides funding to cover the costs of detaining and transporting criminal aliens. 
   * Visa Overstayers: Requires DHS to detain aliens who willfully overstay their period of authorized admission for more than 60 days. 
   * Illegal Reentry: Increases criminal penalties and sets mandatory minimum prison sentences for aliens who have been removed and illegally reenter the United States. 
   * Expedited Removal: Restricts the impact of outdated court injunctions that currently prevent DHS from transitioning certain illegal immigrants into expedited removal proceedings and returning them to their country of origin as soon as circumstances allow. 
   * US-VISIT and Entry Inspection: Clarifies DHS authority to collect biometric entry and exit data at U.S. ports of entry, as well as requires DHS to provide Congress a timeline for implementing US-VISIT at all land border points of entry. 
   * Employment Eligibility Verification: Requires DHS to enhance the Basic Pilot Program to help facilitate broader use by employers as well as improved accuracy and efficiency. 
   * Liability Protection for Reporting Suspicious Threats: Grants civil liability protection to those who report possible threats to our nation's transportation system. 
   * Sanctuary Cities: Prohibits cities from banning the acquisition of information on immigration status by their own law enforcement agencies.
