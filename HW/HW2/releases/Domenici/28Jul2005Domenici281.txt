SENATE OKAYS SEN. DOMENICI JORNADA LAND TRANSFER BILL
  The Senate today approved Sen. Pete Domenici's legislation to permanently transfer up to 1,000 acres of federal land in Do?a Ana County to the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park.  
   The Senate passed the Jornada Experimental Range Transfer Act (S.447) by unanimous consent following its release by the Senate Agriculture Committee. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives for consideration. 
   The Domenici bill would permanently allot up to 1,000 acres of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS) property north of Las Cruces to the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park. The Park is a nonprofit science education organization that teaches thousands of New Mexico youth every year about the unique Southwest desert ecology. 
   "This land transfer is a good idea, in that it will continue to allow more young people to appreciate and learn about the desert ecology in which they live," Domenici said. "The Nature Park is already a site for inspiring children, and this land transfer will ensure that this area is permanently available to them and those who will follow." 
   In 1998, the Nature Park was granted a temporary easement to the federal property identified in Domenici's bill. This property rests on the southern border of a 193,000-acre block of land controlled by the USDA-ARS. However, that easement is set to expire. The Domenici bill would permanently set aside the property for the Nature Park. The transfer is supported by the USDA-ARS. 
   The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park provides hands-on science education to as many as 14,000 K-12 students, 600 teachers and 5,000 other adults annually. It provides classroom presentations, field trips, schoolyard ecology projects and teacher workshops.
