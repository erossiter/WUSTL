SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON N.M. MINUTEMEN ORGANIZATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the formation of a Minutemen organization in New Mexico to monitor the Southwest Border:  
   "I don't know that a Minutemen organization is the best solution to the rampant illegal immigration problems on our border, but I can clearly understand the mounting frustration in the region. The problem is that we have allowed our border policies to fester for far too long. We are increasing funding and personnel to stop the flow of illegals across the border. Even that won't be enough. The United States needs to engage the Mexican republic and develop a comprehensive immigration reform strategy. I would hope that the Minutemen proceed with the greatest caution." 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as well as the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.
