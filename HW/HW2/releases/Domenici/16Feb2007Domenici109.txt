SEN. DOMENICI: NSF PROVIDES FUNDS FOR NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY GEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded $755,000 to New Mexico State University to continue its geological research.  
   The award is a continuation of NSF funding for "Collaborative Research: Deep Structure of the Northeast Tibetan Collision Zone- In Depth IV," geological research involving tectonics which currently totals $195,000. The project will be funded under NSF's Continental Dynamics Program, and will continue to research the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan Mountains and overall earth collision zones. 
   "I am always excited to support scientific research because I believe it helps keep America on the cutting edge of technological leadership," said Domenici. "Through projects such as this, NMSU is furthering our knowledge of scientific subject areas that I am confident will yield positive results as we seek to better understand the world around us." 
   Domenici is a staunch advocate of federal attention, support, and funding for scientific and technological education and research. He was an author of the bipartisan Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, which has been incorporated into a larger bill, the National Competitiveness Investment Act (NCIA) introduced in October.
