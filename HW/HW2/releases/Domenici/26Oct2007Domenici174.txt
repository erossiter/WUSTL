SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES CAPITAL ADVANCES FOR N.M. DISABLED HOUSING ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that two New Mexico housing organizations have been awarded over $1.7 million in capital advances by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide housing assistance for people living with disabilities.  
   Funds were awarded through HUD's Section 811 Program, which supports programs to help persons with disabilities live independently through rental housing and support services. New Life Homes Inc. in Albuquerque received $1.0 million in HUD funds, while Eastern Plains Housing Development Corporation in Clovis was awarded $748,000. 
   "I am happy these organizations exist to help alleviate the difficulties associated with living with a disability," said Domenici. "It's important to improve housing resources and support services designed help them live independently. I look forward to the successful use of these HUD funds by both organizations." 
   HUD's Section 811 Program provides capital advances to nonprofit organizations to build, acquire, and/or rehabilitate rental housing with supportive services for persons with disabilities. The capital advances are interest free and do not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, which helps determine federal funding for HUD programs.
