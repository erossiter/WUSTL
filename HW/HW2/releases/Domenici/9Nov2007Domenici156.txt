BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WILL HELP PRESERVE NEW MEXICO'S HISTORIC TREASURES
  On October 31, I unveiled the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act (S.2262) with my colleague, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, at the historic Sewall Belmont House and Museum on Capitol Hill. First Lady Laura Bush, who serves as the honorary chair of the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures programs, joined us to lend her support to the bill. To view her remarks, visit the White House web site. This bipartisan legislation would formally authorize two historic preservation programs used to care for and protect America's heritage and treasures, including a variety of cultural resources in New Mexico. 
   This legislation would, for the first time, formally institutionalize the Preserve America and the Save America's Treasures grant programs which were initiated through presidential executive orders. Although administered by the Department of the Interior with the cooperation of other federal agencies, the programs have operated without congressional authorization since their inception. This bill would authorize these two important programs and provide for the protection of America's heritage for years to come.
   Preserve America grants complement the Save America's Treasures grant program, which funds bricks and mortar improvements to historic structures and assets by providing competitive grants to encourage sustainable historic resource management through heritage tourism. Both build on preservation goals set in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
   In New Mexico, Las Vegas and Silver City have been designated Preserve America communities, an initiative that encourages and supports community efforts to preserve their cultural and natural heritage. An additional 15 Save America's Treasure grants worth almost $5.0 million have been issued for historic preservation work throughout the state.
