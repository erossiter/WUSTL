HUD RELEASES FUNDING SECURED BY SEN. DOMENICI TO EQUIP NEW EASTERN NEW MEXICO UNIVERSITY COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has released the funding he secured to help Eastern New Mexico University-Portales equip its new communications center.  
   HUD is issuing a $496,000 Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grant to ENMU to purchase state of the art equipment for a new communications facility. Domenici gained the earmark in 2004 as part of the FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations Bill. Domenici is the only member of the New Mexico congressional delegation to serve on a congressional appropriations committee. 
   "I am very happy that these funds are now available to Eastern so it can complete its new telecommunications center. The equipment will, I believe, improve the school's already good reputation as a training ground for journalists," Domenici said. 
   The new ENMU communications facility is home to KENW, public radio and television outlets that serve all of eastern New Mexico and parts of West Texas. The classroom portion of the facility opened in January and the release of these federal funds will enable the school to activate its new radio and television facilities sooner. 
   Last August, Domenici toured the new facility as it was being built. The construction was also supported through a 2003 state of New Mexico bond. 
   The communications facility funding represents one of two sizeable federal appropriations secured by Domenici for ENMU over the past two years. For FY2006, Domenici has obtained a $620,000 EDI appropriation for science and technology equipment at a new ENMU science center that will house the school's chemistry and biology programs, including laboratories. The equipment, to be purchased with the funds secured by Domenici, will be utilized by the entire student body since all ENMU students are required to enroll in at least two laboratory science classes.
