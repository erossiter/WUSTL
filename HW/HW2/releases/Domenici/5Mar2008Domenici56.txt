SENS. DOMENICI, KENNEDY APPLAUD HOUSE ACTION ON MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL
  U.S. Senators Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) today expressed their enthusiasm with the House passage of a version of Mental Health Parity legislation (HR.1424), believing it is an important step in the process to enact a parity law this year. 
   "I'm pleased the House has taken this crucial step in developing a national mental health parity policy. There is still much more to be done to end insurance discrimination toward those dealing with mental health issues. We should now work toward legislation that can be sent to the President and enacted this year," said Domenici.
   "Today's vote in the House of Representatives is a bold step toward ending discrimination for millions of Americans whose health insurance does not cover mental illness. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to negotiate the final legislation and have it signed into law this year," said Kennedy.
   In September, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 (S.558). Domenici and Kennedy developed the bill in conjunction with mental health, insurance, and business organizations to require that mental health coverage be offered on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other physical illnesses.
