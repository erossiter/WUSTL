SEN. DOMENICI WELCOMES FORMATION OF ELECTION TASK FORCE BY U.S. ATTORNEY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement in response to the announcement that U.S. Attorney for New Mexico David Iglesias is forming an election fraud task force to ensure integrity of the November election:  
   "I applaud the action taken by U.S. Attorney Iglesias. I am deeply concerned by recent activities by outside groups that could inhibit a fair and honest election in our state this fall. Reports have surfaced about voter registration efforts that are resulting in incomplete registration forms and the solicitation of ineligible and underage voters. 
   "This nonpartisan coalition of officials and investigators from both the state and the local level will help ensure that complaints about the fairness of the election are investigated and that the rights of legally registered New Mexicans are protected. While I still have concerns about the Secretary of State's interpretation of state law that would require individuals not registering in person to present identification, I believe that this task force is a step in the right direction." 
   Yesterday, Domenici sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights R. Alexander Acosta asking the Department of Justice for assistance in ensuring a fair election given recent activities by so-called '527's' and other outside groups that are using questionable methods to register voters.
