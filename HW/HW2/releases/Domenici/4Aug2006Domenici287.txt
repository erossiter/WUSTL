SEN. DOMENICI JOINS SENATE TO PASS PENSION REFORM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he was pleased with Senate action last night to pass a measure that will protect the pensions of America's workers. 
   The Senate late Thursday passed the Pension Protection Act (HR.4), which makes changes to existing pension rules to ensure that they will be fully funded and available to retirees over the long term. Since the House of Representatives also passed the bill last week, it is now ready for President Bush's signature to make it law.
   "American workers deserve to know that when they retire, the pensions that were promised will be there. This bill takes concrete action to require companies to fund 100 percent of their pension liabilities, and change rules to ensure that benefits promised are realistic and can be covered. I'm glad the Senate was able to come together right before recess to pass it," Domenici said.
   The pension reform bill will require companies with underfunded plans to fully fund them in seven years, with the exception of airlines, which will have longer depending on whether their pension plan is frozen. Rules governing how companies measure their pension liabilities would be changed to reflect when promised benefits have to be paid.
   The bill also would make it illegal for companies to promise additional benefits when their pension plans are less than 80 percent funded. Current law allows new promises in plans that are more than 60 percent funded.
   The Pension Protection Act would also change investment advice rules to allow financial advisors to offer guidance to retirement plan participants without running afoul of conflict of interest regulations. Advisors for 401k's and employer-sponsored plans would be required to base recommendations on a computer model certified by a third party.
   Companies would also be able automatically enroll employees in a 401k plan.
