SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO NETS OVER $7.97 MILLION FOR STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CHILD IMMUNIZATIONS, VACCINATIONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised the award of several grants issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) worth over $7.97 million to support statewide health programs, such as immunizations for children.  
   Domenici said the four awards, all to the New Mexico Department of Health, will support various health outreach and child advocacy programs. The funds have been awarded through the HHS Centers for Disease Control office. 
   "These programs are vital to the health of New Mexicans around the state, many of whom are children who need this federal assistance to receive the proper immunizations," Domenici said. "I am pleased this funding will help the most vulnerable in our communities, with early vaccinations or the prevention of chronic diseases." 
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding levels for HHS, indicated the following awards have been made to the New Mexico Department of Health in Santa Fe: 
   * Immunization and Vaccines for Children Grant program will receive two awards of $4,546,306 and $3,215,900 to promote and provide childhood immunization and increase immunization rates among children. 
   * Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention program will receive $120,000 to help enable state public health agencies to develop or strengthen the focus on the prevention and control of injuries as well as injury surveillance programs, particularly those with a focus on traumatic brain injury. 
   * Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion program will receive $90,105 to help conduct studies to better understand the causes of these diseases, support programs to promote healthy behaviors, and monitor the health of the nation through surveys.
