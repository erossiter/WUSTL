SEN. DOMENICI EXTENDS INDEPENDENCE DAY WISHES TO NEW MEXICANS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today extended the following Fourth of July message to all New Mexicans:  
   "My wife Nancy and I would like to wish all New Mexicans a happy and safe Fourth of July holiday. This Independence Day I hope we all take a moment to reflect on the freedoms and liberties that bind us together as a great nation. 
   "Despite a lot of media attention on highlighting the differences between Americans, we are at the core a nation of united people. We freely exercise our rights of self expression and association. We proudly stand behind our men and women in uniform, particularly those who today risk their lives to secure new freedoms to millions of people halfway around the world. 
   "I celebrate our diversity. We should continue to embody the rights outlined in our own Declaration on Independence, namely the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   "I wish you all a happy and safe Independence Day. God bless America." 
   Domenici's offices in New Mexico and Washington, D.C. will be closed Monday, July 6, the official federal holiday.
