SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES USDA LOAN FOR ANGEL FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES FACILITY
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded a $700,000 loan to Angel Fire to help expand its emergency response facilities.  
   Funds were administered through the USDA Community and Facilities Loan program and are expected to fund the construction of an additional fire station to house fire and EMS equipment, crew quarters, training, and storage space. The 20-year loan is being offered at a 4.25 percent interest rate. 
   "Less populated, rural areas must still possess the resources and facilities to address local fire and safety issues," said Domenici. "This USDA loan will help Angel Fire as it looks to expand the capabilities of its fire fighting force and improve overall safety training in the community." 
   The building, once completed, is expected to span 3,500 square feet and will be located on State Highway 434. Officials plan to use the training room to conduct CPR/First-Aid, fire extinguisher and fire prevention classes for the general public and civic groups. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs and projects. In July, the committee approved $200,000 as part of the FY2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill for the village of Angel Fire's downtown plaza streets project. The FY2008 THUD Appropriations Bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall.
