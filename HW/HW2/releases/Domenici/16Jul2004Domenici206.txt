SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY, DOE LAB SECURITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding recent security lapses at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which led to a stand down on all classified work at the lab as an investigation is mounted:  
   "The work stoppage at Los Alamos is serious and should serve as the sternest warning to everyone associated with the lab that these security problems must stop. These most recent lapses should be investigated and those responsible held accountable. In fact, the bottom line is accountability. All the national labs and their workers must truly become more accountable. I believe Director Nanos is trying to forcefully move LANL in that direction. 
   "These repeated incidences certainly do not help the University of California as the Los Alamos contract competition moves forward. It could be a factor, but that depends on the UC bid and who its partners are in that bid." 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Energy and its national laboratories. He is also chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
