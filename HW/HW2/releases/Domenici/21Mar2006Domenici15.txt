SEN. DOMENICI: AIR FORCE TO OPEN NUCLEAR WEAPONS CENTER AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said the Defense Department decision to locate its new Nuclear Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base is yet more evidence that the Albuquerque military installation is a key asset for the Air Force.  
   The Air Force Material Command will open the NWC at Kirtland on Friday, March 31. The NWC will be a center of expertise for nuclear weapons systems, ensuring that safe, secure and reliable nuclear weapons are available to support the National Command Structure and the Air Force. 
   "This new center will not initially mean more manpower for Kirtland, but it does certainly cement the base's role as a Department of Defense center for nuclear policy and management. The base, as host to Sandia National Laboratories, is well suited to host the Nuclear Weapons Center. This is another fine feather in Kirtland's cap," Domenici said. 
   According to the Air Force, the NWC will oversee "the entire scope of nuclear weapon system support functions to include sustainment, modernization and acquisition support activities for the Department of Defense and Department of Energy." 
   The NWC will initially encompass Kirtland's Nuclear Weapons Directorate and 377th Air Base Wing, the Cruise Missile Group at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and the 896th Munitions Squadron at Nellis AFB, Nevada. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and is chairman of the appropriations panel that has funding oversight over the Department of Energy and its national laboratory system. As such, he has been instrumental in promoting a diversity of missions at Kirtland and Sandia.
