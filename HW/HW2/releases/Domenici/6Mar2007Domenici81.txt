SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES NSF CLIMATE CHANGE GRANT TO N.M. TECH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded $450,000 to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech) to further education and discovery for climate and weather research.  
   New Mexico Tech received the grant for a project entitled, "A Rational Approach to Cumulus Parameterization in Large-Scale Models." This project will expand understanding of how convection interacts with its environment. The outcome of these tests will lead to large-scale models to evaluate simulated features in the atmosphere. 
   "I applaud New Mexico Tech for this great accomplishment," said Domenici. "It always pleases me to see scientific and technological progress- especially in the area of climate research. I hope New Mexico Tech can use these resources to further climate exploration." 
   The award is part of a continued grant under the Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program within NSF and is one of many currently active projects studying climate and weather through specific scientific approaches. The project will support research by undergraduate and graduate students of New Mexico Tech and will be under the direction of David Raymond.
