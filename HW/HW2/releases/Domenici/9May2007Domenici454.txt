SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Education (DoED) has awarded $79,000 to the University of New Mexico to develop its undergraduate international studies program. 
   Funds were awarded through the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language (UISFL) Program in the Department of Education. UNM will utilize funds to improve the number and quality of courses in its international studies program, and subsequently increase the number of undergraduate enrollment in indigenous language courses and in medical Spanish.
   "UNM is one of the state's primary higher education institutions, and as such, it is important that it provide students with a high quality education," said Domenici. "I am pleased that the Department of Education has awarded these funds so that the university can build the academic quality of its international studies program."
   UNM will use DoEd funds to build an international studies program that includes language instruction, social sciences and cultural content. Additionally, the school plans to develop a Center for Indigenous Languages which will focus on Latin America.
   UNM's proposal, coordinated by its Latin American and Iberian Institute (LAII), is comprised of 13 full-time faculty members and four instructors from three major colleges and schools and seven departments within UNM.
   DoED's UISFL Program provides grants to strengthen and improve undergraduate instruction in international studies and foreign languages.
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a prominent role in determining funding for federal programs and funding opportunities, including those administered by the Department of Education.
