SEN. DOMENICI, BERNALILLO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TEAM TO HELP NEW MEXICO SOLDIER'S WIDOW
  Sen. Pete Domenici today gained an agreement from the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office to help the widow of New Mexico soldier killed last weekend in Iraq.  
   Joel Dahl of Los Lunas died on June 23 as he wrapped up his tour with the 2nd Infantry Division. He was scheduled to come home July 2 to his wife Alea, who is about to give birth to their first child. 
   Domenici turned to Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White after talking with Alea Dahl this morning and learning that her car had been stolen in Albuquerque last night. White agreed to have the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department lead an effort to get a new vehicle for Mrs. Dahl. 
   "I called Alea to offer my condolences, and was horrified today to find out her car had been stolen. She lost her husband, and now has to deal with this injustice," Domenici said. 
   "Her family has paid the ultimate sacrifice to keep our nation free," he said. "I think helping Mrs. Dahl get a new car is one way we can show her how much we appreciate the patriotism of her husband and the dedication of this military family." 
   At a news conference in downtown Albuquerque, White outlined the campaign. For more information on the effort to help Mrs. Dahl, call (505) 768-4100. 
   "Sheriff White and his deputies have done this before-and quickly--for other families in need in our region," said Domenici. "They are hometown heroes, and I am confident they will have a new car for Mrs. Dahl as quickly as possible."
