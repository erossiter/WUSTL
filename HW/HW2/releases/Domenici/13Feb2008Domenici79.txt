SENS. DOMENICI, LIEBERMAN REVIVE EFFORT TO REFORM FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS
  U.S. Senators Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) today announced a renewed effort to improve the federal budget process by implementing a two-year budget cycle that would replace a dysfunctional system that now results in delays, monster-sized omnibus spending bills and diminished congressional oversight. 
   Domenici, a former Budget Committee chairman, and Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, have introduced new legislation to convert the appropriations and budget process to a two-year--or biennial--cycle.  
   Under the Biennial Budget and Appropriations Act of 2008 (S.2627), the President would submit a two-year budget and Congress would consider a two-year budget resolution and two-year appropriation bills during the first session of a Congress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to consideration of authorization bills and for oversight of government agencies. 
   "I first proposed a biennial budget reform in the late 1980s and have been pushing legislation since the mid-90s. I regret to say the situation has not improved," Domenici said. "A biennial budget will not be a cure all and it cannot make the difficult decisions that must be made in budgeting. But it can provide the tools necessary to make much better decisions. Under the current annual budget process, we are constantly spending the taxpayers' money instead of focusing on how best and most efficiently we should be using those funds. By moving to a biennial budget cycle, Congress can plan, budget, and appropriate more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and improve the efficiency of government agencies." 
   "Biennial budgeting is not a new concept. It is tried and true," Lieberman said. "It has been an historically preferred method among state legislatures and would be a vast improvement over the contentious, time-consuming budget process we endure year after year. Moving to a two-year cycle would give Congress more time to legislate and engage in oversight and it would provide more time to work through the nation's spending priorities in a reasonable and efficient fashion. Who could resist that? I hope this is the year that the U.S. Congress accepts biennial budgeting as the best way to do its business." 
   A biennial budget system is an idea that has been endorsed by each successive president since Ronald Reagan, as well as numerous federal budget experts. In recent years, Domenici and Lieberman have led the push to advance legislation to reform the budget process. 
   Since 1980, Congress has only twice completed the appropriations process before Oct. 1. In addition, Congress has had to craft omnibus spending measures or enact at least one continuing resolution in lieu of a new appropriations bill in 18 of the previous 28 years. 
   The current system also drains time from Congress' ability to review and reauthorize laws that have budget implications. Many appropriations for nondefense programs operate under authorization laws that have expired. A two-year budget cycle would allow Congress to devote the second session to reviewing these authorizations. 
   Domenici said support is growing for his biennial budget legislation, which he first introduced in the late 1990s. Among the Senators cosponsoring this proposal are Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), George Voinovich (R-Ohio), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss (both R-Ga.), Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.). 
   The Domenici-Lieberman bill will be referred to the Senate Budget Committee. 
   SUMMARY 
   "Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act" 
   The bill would convert the annual budget, appropriations, and authorizing process to a biennial, or two year cycle. 
   * First Year - Budget and Appropriations: 
   - Requires the President to submit a two-year budget at the beginning of the first session of a Congress. 
   - Requires Congress to adopt a two-year budget resolution, a reconciliation bill (if necessary), and two year appropriations bills during the first session of a Congress. 
   - Ensures enactment of two year appropriations bills by providing a new majority point of order against consideration of an appropriations bill that fails to cover two years. 
   * Second Year - Authorization Legislation and Enhanced Oversight 
   - Devotes the second session of a Congress to consideration of authorization bills and oversight of federal programs. Provides a majority point of order against consideration of authorization and revenue legislation that covers less than two years. 
   - Enhances oversight by incorporating features of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) in the second year of the biennium by requiring: 
   * The General Accounting Office (GAO) to give priority to requests for audits and evaluation of programs and activities during the second year of the biennium; 
   * Agencies to submit to the authorizing committees at the beginning of the second session of a Congress proposed legislative changes that are needed or will assist agencies' efforts to meet their GPRA mission statements, strategic plans and performance goals; and 
   * Authorizing committees to submit in their views and estimates letters to the Budget Committee their comments on agencies' mission statements, strategic plans, performance plans, and their actual performance.
