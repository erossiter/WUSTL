SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GRANT TO RESEARCH HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that Albuquerque-based Behavioral Research, Inc. has been awarded a $398,025 grant to study behavior and health practics of pregnant woemn.  
   The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant will be used to purchase computers that contain health assessment programs which will be set up at various HMO clinics, primary care offices and public clinics. 
   "This program is beneficial because it may be able to get more accurate answers to questions that affect the health of the unborn baby," Domenici said. "With this program, a mother might be comfortable answering difficult questions through a computer program and will be able to get real answers without embarrassment." 
   The computer program is designed to ask the expecting mother questions that might not be answered honestly when asked by a real person. The program will confidentially assess any behavior that may be harmful to the mother and her unborn child including drug abuse, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, unhealthy eating habits, and other concerns. 
   The research is in its second phase and is entitled New Risk Assessment/Intervention for Pregnant Women. The assessment will confidentially assess any behavior that may be harmful to the mother and her unborn child by providing a print out of a wide range of solutions and feedback.
