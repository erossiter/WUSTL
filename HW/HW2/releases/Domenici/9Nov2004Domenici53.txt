SEN. DOMENICI ENCOURAGES NEW MEXICO HISPANIC COLLEGE STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR HISPANIC CAUCUS SCHOLARSHIPS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged Hispanic college students from New Mexico to apply for scholarships, internships and fellowships offered by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Inc. (CHCI) in Washington.  
   The CHCI is now accepting applications for its student programs, including summer internships and fellowship placements in Washington, and 2005 scholarship programs. 
   "The institute has built a good reputation for offering Hispanic college students opportunities to live, learn and work in the nation's capital. I would like to see more New Mexicans apply and be selected for these programs," said Domenici, who is a member of the Senate Republican Hispanic Task Force. 
   "These programs provide one avenue for our youth to broaden their horizons as they prepare to enter the workforce and become community leaders," he said. 
   CHCI, established in 1978, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational organization. It is now accepting applications for the following programs:
