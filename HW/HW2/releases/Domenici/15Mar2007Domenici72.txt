SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO SUPPORT U.S. TROOPS, AGAINST ARBITRARY WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, today voted for nonbinding resolutions that expressed support for continued funding for American troops in Iraq, but voted with a bipartisan majority to reject an amendment to set an arbitrary deadline to withdraw from Iraq.  
   The Senate voted on a series of three Iraq war resolutions, approving two of them and rejecting one that would have set a March 2008 withdrawal deadline for American combat troops in Iraq. 
   "I voted to support our fighting troops, but against a resolution that amounted to trying to run the war from the halls of Congress," Domenici said. 
   "These were all nonbinding resolutions, and the real test for those who oppose the war will be when we take up the Defense Department's request for more money to equip and sustain our fighting forces. Army General Schoomaker testified yesterday that out an infusion of funding by the end of April, the Army will be forced to reprogram funds from its stateside activities to keep the fighting troops in good shape," he said. 
   The Senate is expected to soon take up an emergency defense supplemental spending request for about $100 billion, mostly to support United States involvement in the Global War on Terror. 
   The resolutions considered by the Senate today included: 
   * S.J.Res.9 (Sponsor: Reid; Would restrict Commander-in-Chief's ability to direct the use of force, and set a deadline for withdrawal of March 31, 2008) Defeated 48-50/Domenici: NO; 
   * S.Res.107 (Sponsor: Murray; Congress should provide funds for training, equipment and other support for troops in the field; and should provide health care to those who have served.) Passed 96-2/Domenici: YES; and, 
   * S.Con.Res.20 (Sponsor: Gregg; States Congress should not eliminate or reduce funds for troops in the field.) Passed 82-16/Domenici: YES.
