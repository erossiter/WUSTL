SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH-PUTIN WEAPONS DIALOGUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding progress made by President Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin on nonproliferation issues and combating nuclear terrorism.  
   "I'm pleased President Bush and President Putin appear to have made some progress on nonproliferation issues. In particular, I welcome the commitments to accelerate work on protecting nuclear weapons and material, strengthening security at nuclear facilities, and developing low-enriched uranium fuel for research reactors. 
   "However, I'm disappointed that a formal agreement on MOX was not reached. I understand that the U.S. will continue to engage Russia on this promising program, so I'm hopeful that it is only a matter of time before this technology is put to use. I would have also liked to see the Plutonium Disposition Program liability issue resolved. 
   "I will continue to forcefully support nonproliferation activities around the world. I welcome and support the Bush administration renewed commitment to these vital national and global security issues."
