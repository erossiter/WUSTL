   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says member of Congress, like Representative Heather Wilson, should be asking questions about the covert domestic surveillance program, which he deems "obviously controversial." He notes that despite the partisan criticism of the anti-terrorism initiative, few critics say the program is not needed. 
   03:07 - Domenici says the United States should increase domestic production of both traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. He says President Bush is vigorously promoting greater renewable energy use, such as solar energy. Domenici discusses New Mexico's leading role in wind and solar energy research and application. He says oil and gas production in the United States should follow all rules and regulations. 
   06:23 - Domenici says he is focused on securing funding for construction of a language arts center at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Artesia, as well as his bill that would expand the scope of the new facility to provide foreign language instruction for personnel within the Homeland Security Department and other federal agencies. 
   08:06 - Domenici says he is looking forward to the dedication of the new International Law Enforcement Academy center in Roswell next week. He notes that he is working to have the State Department approve a new multi-year contract with New Mexico Tech and its partners to operate the academy. 
   11:03 - Domenici again explains the rationale behind an effort to draft legislation to create recreation and wilderness area in Do?a Ana County, and to establish a plan for the long term disposal of BLM lands for the future growth of Las Cruces and Do?a Ana County. He says discounts misinformation about the proposal, saying it is wrong to believe the plan is meant to lower property values in the area. 
   15:39 - Domenici says he cannot discuss specifics about new mission options for Cannon Air Force Base. He says he understands how people in Clovis may "feel like they're on the griddle" and "want the heat turned off" as work continues to find a new mission. He encourages residents to be patient and understand that there are a lot of variables and parties to deal with in finding a new mission. 
   18:16 - Domenici says he wants to determine the validity of claims that oil companies are not paying sufficient royalties for oil and gas produced on federal property. 
   19:38 - Domenici says he does not support legislation to prohibit possible energy production on portions of the Valle Vidal in northeast New Mexico, saying he would rather allow the U.S. Forest Service to carry out its land use study to determine whether natural gas production on the property is viable. 
   22:12 - Domenici says he wants Congress to act soon on the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act to ensure the Unites States has sufficient scientists and researchers to maintain its competitive edge in the world. He notes that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will being hearings on the bill Tuesday. 
   25:51 - Domenici praises the New Mexico Legislature for moving to approve tax credits to expand renewable energy sources in the state. He says the federal tax credits have been successfully used to promote wind energy production in New Mexico. 
   26:57 - Domenici encourages the Legislature to pass Kendra's Law legislation before the session ends. He says he has been working with the Richardson administration and the Rep. Joni Gutierrez, the bill's sponsor, to try to drum up support for the bill, which would address care for severely mentally ill individuals who may harm themselves or others.
