SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON HEIGHTENED TERRORIST THREAT LEVEL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the more serious security threat levels issued by the Department of Homeland Security for domestic and international air flights: 
   "This morning's heightened terror alert should concern us all and remind us that there is no room for complacency in guarding against terrorist threats. I am well aware of the frustrations travelers may experience, but the government is right to take precautions in light of the horrific plot exposed by the British.
   "I commend the Homeland Security Department and Great Britain for their hard work to track the terrorist threats out there. This situation reminds us that we cannot let our guard down. We must all be vigilant and patient."
   Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as well as the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.
