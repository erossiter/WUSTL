SEN. DOMENICI CREDITS PRESIDENT'S GASOLINE PRICE PLAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today credited President Bush for taking decisive steps to address escalating gasoline prices, and said Congress must do more to facilitate more long-term energy price stability. 
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is scheduled to address the energy supply and gasoline price situation in a speech to the Senate Wednesday morning. (Domenici is expected to speak at 8 a.m. Mountain, Wednesday.)
   "I appreciate the President announcing a clear, definitive plan for confronting gasoline prices that are rising as the price of crude oil escalates. We should aggressively confront any manipulation of the markets, and do what we can to increase our own supplies of energy," Domenici said.
   "The truth is that there is no easy answer, particularly in the short-term. We are today paying for decades of obstructionism to domestic energy production, a situation made worse by international strife and global competition. What we need now is not partisan gamesmanship and sniping. We need a unified American approach to moving us past our dangerous dependence on foreign oil sources and toward greater reliance on all sources of energy we can produce right here at home."
   The President has recommended: investigations into gasoline price manipulation; repeal of certain tax breaks for energy companies; further reforms to the CAFE standards; boosting domestic energy production; increased use of ethanol; and accelerated use of alternative fuels.
