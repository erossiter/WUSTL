NATIONAL HISPANIC CULTURAL CENTER EDUCATION FACILITY TO BE NAMED FOR SEN. DOMENICI
  The National Hispanic Cultural Center Saturday will break ground on a new education center named in honor of Sen. Pete Domenici, a major supporter of the center.  
   The Pete V. Domenici Education Building at the National Hispanic Cultural Center (NHCC) will host cultural programs in visual, performing and literary arts, and will also house the Instituto Cervantes, a prestigious cultural and language institute administered by the Spanish government. 
   Over the years, Domenici has secured nearly $18 million in federal funding for the NHCC, which aims to create a greater cross-cultural appreciation and understanding of Hispanic culture for the public. 
   "I am deeply honored by the decision of the National Hispanic Cultural Center to name this building after me. It is particularly gratifying because this building will house the NHCC's educational outreach efforts and share the incredibly story of Hispanic culture, art and history. I look forward to its completion so that the center can expand its educational outreach and usefulness to the community," Domenici said.
   The state of the art building to built with state funds will include conference and meeting space, visual art rooms, computer labs, indoor/outdoor culinary arts capability and student exhibition space. The building will be equipped with videoconferencing, wireless network capability, fiber optic connectivity and other technology that will make it an attractive venue.
