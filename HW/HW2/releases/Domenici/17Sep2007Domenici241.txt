RED RIVER'S "ENCHANTED CIRCLE" MARKS THIRD DECADE, SEN. DOMENICI COMMENDS LOCAL EFFORTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today recognized the 30th anniversary of the Enchanted Century Circle Tour in a Congressional Record statement, commending the Red River Chamber of Commerce and Red River Bike Club for putting on the milestone event.  
   "The tour has given many residents and visitors of New Mexico the opportunity to experience our state in a new way," said Domenici. "The start of the tour will be a major milestone for this community, and it is my hope that this tradition continues for at least another 30 years." 
   Senator Domenici's full remarks will be recorded in the Congressional Record: 
   "Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Red River Chamber of Commerce and the Red River Bike Club for putting on another Enchanted Circle Century Tour. This year marks the 30th anniversary of this legendary bicycle tour around northeast New Mexico. 
   "This 100 mile tour begins in Red River, and then passes through Questa, Taos, Angel Fire, Eagle Nest and Black Lake before finishing back in Red River. What better way to see the breath-taking Sangre de Cristo Mountains than on a bicycle? 
   "This tour has given many residents and visitors of New Mexico the opportunity to experience our state in a new way. It is not for the faint of heart though. It takes incredible strength to overcome the elevation, elements and endurance challenge this tour presents. 
   "The September 8 start will be a major milestone for this community, and it is my hope that this tradition continues for at least another 30 years."
