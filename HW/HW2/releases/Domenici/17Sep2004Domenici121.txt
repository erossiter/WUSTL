SAN JUAN COUNTY INCLUDING DROUGHT DISTASTER PLAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a natural disaster designation to San Juan County as part of a broader disaster designation covering a number of Utah counties.  
   Agriculture Secretary Anne Veneman has officially granted the designation for 20 counties in Utah. San Juan is included as an area contiguous to the primary disaster designation, which makes federal aid available to farm operators in the county. The designation is linked to sustained production losses related to drought conditions since Jan. 1, 2004. 
   "We all know the only real solution to drought in New Mexico is rain. Unfortunately, we have no control over the weather," Domenici said. "The assistance available from the USDA replaces revenue that's lost when these heavy rains taper off so farms in San Juan County will have a chance to continue operations." 
   The designation will allow eligible farmers in the county to apply for Farm Service Agency low-interest emergency loans based on the extent of losses, security available and repayment ability.
