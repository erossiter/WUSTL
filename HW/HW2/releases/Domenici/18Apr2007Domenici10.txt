SEN. DOMENICI PLEASED WITH U.S. POSTAL SERVICE HIRING ANNOUNCEMENT FOR NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he welcomes news that the U.S. Postal Service will hire 75 new workers in a bid to improve mail delivery services to New Mexicans, particularly in the Albuquerque metropolitan area.  
   The Postal Service on Wednesday announced its plans to add the new workers in the New Mexico/Albuquerque District. The decision follows ongoing efforts to improve service after consumer complaints over the past year about deficient mail delivery services. 
   "I hope the additional personnel will mean better service for New Mexicans. My staff and I continue to hear complaints and we continue to consult with the Postal Service on improving service," Domenici said. "Overall, I like the trend of the management and service reforms that are being implemented to fix problems." 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) that oversees the USPS. He has directed his field staff to work with constituents and the USPS, and his staff takes part in Advisory Boards in Santa Fe and Las Cruces. 
   HSGAC will conduct a subcommittee hearing at 2 p.m. Thursday to examine the current state of the Postal Service along with the efforts underway to implement the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435).
