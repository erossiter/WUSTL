SEN. DOMENICI: USDA TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR ANGEL FIRE WATER NEEDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to provide over $2.85 million for the village of Angel Fire to upgrade its water and wastewater capabilities.  
   USDA Rural Development will provide the loan to the village for the acquisition and construction of water and wastewater lines and facilities in Special Assessment Bond No. 434, which would extend the water and sanitary system along New Mexico Highway 454. The village is attempting to prevent further surface and groundwater pollution in the Cieneguilla Creek watershed. 
   "I am pleased to announce the acquisition of these USDA funds for the village of Angel Fire," said Domenici. "Effective water facilities are a necessity to communities and every resident of Angel Fire stands to benefit from their provision." 
   According to USDA, the loan will be awarded under a 20 year term at a rate of 4.125 percent. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding priorities for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA. 
   Last week, Domenici presented Kit Carson Electric Coop with USDA Rural Development funds to create a 911 Communication Center in Taos in order to consolidate the region's emergency dispatch and response programs.
