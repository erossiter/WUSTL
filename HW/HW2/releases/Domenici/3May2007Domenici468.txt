SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF NEW MEXICAN TO TOP HHS POST
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded President Bush's nomination of New Mexican Kerry N. Weems to be Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, succeeding Mark McClellan.  
   In this top post at the department, Weems, current Deputy Chief of Staff and longtime HHS executive, would oversee and administer Medicare and Medicaid, federal entitlement programs providing health insurance to the elderly and underprivileged. A native of Portales, Weems holds a master's degree in business administration from the University of New Mexico and two bachelor's degrees from New Mexico State University. 
   "This is a challenging job and Mr. Weems brings years of proven experience and the skills necessary to effectively run some of America's most crucial entitlement programs," said Domenici, who along with Sen. Dianne Feinstein is at the forefront of bipartisan entitlement reform efforts. 
   "Mr. Weems' leadership and service to the Department of Health and Human Services has been tireless and effective. I have confidence that he is up to the challenge of carrying out the programs that ensure medical care to some of the most vulnerable Americans. Mr. Weems is a highly-qualified candidate and his demonstrated credentials should allow for a smooth and expedited confirmation process in the Congress," he continued. 
   Prior to his position as Deputy Chief of Staff, Weems has served in various capacities within HHS, including oversight and management of the department's budget, technology, and finance offices.
