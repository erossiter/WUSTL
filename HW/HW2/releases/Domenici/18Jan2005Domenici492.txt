   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says the celebrations scheduled for the inauguration of President George W. Bush are appropriate, and that the events planned are a celebration of American democracy. He points out that security concerns have added greatly to the costs of the inauguration, but that the other privately-funded balls and events are not any more extravagant than previous presidencies. 
   01:57 - Domenici says he believes that no matter how well the upcoming Iraqi elections turn out, there will still be critics who will charge that it is "not enough." He believes the elections will be a healthy demonstration that most Iraqis are ready to establish their own government to run their country. He says insurgent attacks will continue, and that he worries about some catastrophic offense on the voters. 04:15 - Domenici says it is important to remember that the purpose of the Jan. 30 Iraq election is to select delegates to draft a new constitution. He says Sunni participation in the election is important, but that he is hopeful that the constitutional convention delegates take into account the rights of minority populations, like the Sunnis, in its new constitution. He says he sees no advantage for the Sunnis, as a minority group, to boycott the election or even to advocate civil war. 06:58 - Domenici discounts incessant worries in the Los Alamos area about employee and retiree benefits under a new management contract for Los Alamos National Laboratory. He says LANL employees should understand that every other national lab has undergone contract competition, and that work is being done to protect benefits and pensions for the workers. He notes that the University of California will have a good chance to win a new contract if it submits a strong proposal, which he expects. 10:16 - Domenici says he agrees with President Bush's desire to be more "measured" in his word choices. He also discusses Bush's legacy, and the outlook for his own. 
   12:14 - Domenici says he is hopeful the New Mexico Legislature, whose 60-day term begins today, will make progress on prudent tax reform, meaningful education improvements, careful progress on water issues, and strong support for economic development and job training programs. He says he looks forward to visiting the Legislature during its 2005 term. 
   14:41 - Domenici says he is excited about the Jan. 24 Natural Gas Conference being sponsored by his Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He says the nation must begin to look very closely at its escalating reliance on natural gas, and how to meet demand in the near and long-term future. He says the gap between supply and demand should help prompt greater use of clean coal, nuclear and a variety of renewable energy sources.
