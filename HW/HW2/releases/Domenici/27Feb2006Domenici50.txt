   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says the bill to renew the USA Patriot Act is sure to pass the Senate despite the actions by one Senator, who is running for the presidency, to stall that action and waste the Senate's time. 
   01:07 - Domenici says everyone will soon see that the controversy about allowing a company based in the United Arab Emirates has been a case of "mass hysteria" and that the firm is suitable to operate several U.S. ports without compromising security. He says security will remain in the hands of the United States, just as it does at American ports now operated by foreign counties like China, Singapore and Taiwan. 
   03:24 - Domenici points out that there are American companies that operate ports in other countries without concerns that the U.S. company's management compromises security there. He says port operation is a multi-billion industry and that it is not uncommon for a foreign-owned company to operate ports. He attributes the current public brouhaha to politics and that it will be resolved in manner that allows everyone to say they won the public relations battle. 
   06:24 - Domenici says a late 1990's study on seaport security is outdated and that port management and security has and is undergoing changes since 9/11. He says more funding is being poured in to security for seaports and land-based ports of entry. 
   10:11 - Domenici says he is troubled by indications that Americans can't trust any Arab country and does not agree with such thinking. He says nations and companies should be assessed individually to determine whether they are true allies in the war on terrorism. He acknowledges that some Arab countries must be watched as enemies. 
   12:46 - Domenici says his Energy and Natural Resources Committee is expected to soon approve its portion of the PACE Act and will forward it to the Senate for consideration. He expects the Senate to approve the overall Protecting America's Competitive Edge Act package and that the challenge will be to fully fund the effort to increase the brainpower of America's youth. 
   15:37 - Domenici says that with proper legal advise from constitutional lawyers, the Zuni Pueblo and Gallup-McKinley County schools should appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to get a ruling on whether the state of New Mexico is right to take 75 percent of federal Impact Aid funding and redirecting it to other school districts. He says a Supreme Court ruling could prompt the state or Congress to make reforms needed to endure Impact Aid goes to intended school districts. 
   19:07 - Domenici says Los Alamos National Laboratories employees are likely to see discrepancies in the benefits package offered by the new corporation that will run the lab. He says he and Senator Jeff Bingaman have asked the Energy Department to review the proposed benefits plan for employees and retirees. 
   21:00 - Domenici says he does not believe the United States will soon see another disaster of the magnitude that hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast with Hurricane Katrina. He says the recovery will be a long process, and that Congress is already providing billions of dollars to help the region clean up and rebuild. He says it may take another six months for the region to have a recovery plan "that has teeth." 
   22:51 - Domenici says mistakes were made at all levels of government before and after Hurricane Katrina. However, he says he believes federal emergency agencies are capable of offering New Mexico helps should it be struck by disaster, like a major wildfire. He cites the FEMA aid given to New Mexico following the Cerro Grande Fire in the Los Alamos area. 
   27:58 - Domenici says Congress will review the President's budget plan and assess proposed cuts. He says advocates should "keep their powder dry" because Congress is likely to fund popular education programs like GEAR Up, TRIO and the Upward Bound to keep at-risk students in school and ready them for post-secondary education. He notes that no matter who is in the White House, their budget plans are always big targets for complaints about cuts that never actually occur. 
   31:07 - Domenici predicts that Congress may address border security reforms this year, but that he is skeptical that guest worker and immigration reform will be tackled during this election year. He says neither party has a unified stance on either issue, despite the House passing legislation last year that will never be agreed to by the Senate. He also discusses his own immigration reform legislation. 
   33:24 - Domenici pays tribute to his friend, Doc Stewart of Clovis, who passed way early Monday. He honors Stewart's civic contributions to the Clovis area and to Cannon Air Force Base, stating that his life was an example of "sacrifice and commitment."
