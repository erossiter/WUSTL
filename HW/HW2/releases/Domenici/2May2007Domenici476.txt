SANTA CLARA DAY SCHOOL GETS P.E. FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Santa Clara Pueblo Day Schools have been awarded $166,098 to improve and expand physical education. 
   The award was administered under the Department of Education's Carol M. White Physical Education Program. Funds will be used to initiate, expand, and improve physical education programs, including those conducted after school, to meet state physical education standards.
   "Healthy habits begin at a young age," said Domenici. "It is good that the Department of Education offers these grants to help schools develop P.E. programs for students. I am happy to know that students on the Santa Clara Pueblo will have the opportunity to engage in activities that will hopefully help encourage physical activity as they get older."
   The Carol M. White Physical Education Program offers grants to local educational agencies and community-based organizations to improve physical education for K through 12 students.
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for activities and projects in the Department of Education.
