SEN. DOMENICI: USDA GRANT HELPS NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) decision to allocate $299,980 to New Mexico State University to help agriculture students take advantage of new technology available to them.  
   "I am pleased the USDA has chosen to back NMSU with this grant project and recognize the benefit technology can have on the learning process," Domenici said. "Students and teachers will be able to utilize the technology at their fingertips to help them in lessons and prepare for work in the real world." 
   The project, titled Strengthening Technology Competency and Instructional Delivery Systems in Institutions Serving Hispanic Agricultural Students, will develop faculty and undergraduate technology training and incentive programs to increase the effectiveness of technology within the Agriculture Department at NMSU. 
   The program aims to give teachers intensive training in delivering and teaching technologies; strengthen student retention and career preparation through specialized student training; collaborate with other universities to replicate the program at Hispanic Serving Institutions; and disseminate training materials and best practices nationally. 
   NMSU will be partnering with Fresno State University to model how the pioneering work developed at NMSU can be applied to other Hispanic Serving Institutions nationwide. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that provides funding for the USDA and its programs.
