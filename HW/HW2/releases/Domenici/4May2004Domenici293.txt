SEN. DOMENICI SAYS CARLSBAD CAVERNS VISITOR CENTER SET FOR $7.29 MILLION MAKEOVER
  Sen. Pete Domenici, as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today approved of a plan to give the visitor center at the Carlsbad Caverns National Park a $7.29 million makeover.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Tuesday gave his approval to a National Park Service (NPS) plan to rehabilitate the visitor center as a NPS Recreation Fee Demonstration project. 
   "I wholeheartedly support this project. It means that Park Service fees will be put to good use to improve this aging facility and make it a safer and more welcoming for visitors and staff alike," Domenici said. 
   To employ the recreation fee and National Park Pass revenues for the project, the House and Senate appropriations committees much give their concurrence. Final approval from all parties is expected this week. Domenici's approval was important to allowing the NSP to direct the revenues to Carlsbad Caverns project. 
   Work on the 47-year old facility will entail improving the structural integrity of the center, including new heating and cooling systems, "green energy" lighting and displays, passive solar, upgraded alarms and fire systems, and increased accessibility for park visitors and staff. The restoration will make it the center more complaint with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   The project will also entail the rehabilitation of aged electrical, plumbing and elevator machine rooms. The project is expected to be completed in FY2005.
