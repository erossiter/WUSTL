SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BLM'S OTERO MESA DECISION
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the decision by the Bureau of Land Management to authorize limited new oil and gas development on the Otero Mesa of southern New Mexico.  
   "I believe the BLM has been very balanced in its approach to Otero Mesa. Its conservation concerns are significant, as producers will have to meet some of the most stringent criteria ever to drill in the area. 
   "Some will continue to think we shouldn't do anything on the mesa, but I am not from that school of thought. I believe wherever we can increase our energy supplies, we should proceed after taking into account environmental concerns. That is exactly what has been done in this case. I commend the BLM for its diligence in working through this issue."
