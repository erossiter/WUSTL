SOUTHWEST INDIAN POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE IN ALBUQUERQUE TO RECEIVE DEFENSE GRANT TO ADVANCE IT EDUCATION
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in Albuquerque is among nine tribal schools that will share in $1.7 million in Defense Department grant funding to advance science education.  
   SIPI will receive a grant worth between $107,000 and $248,000 as part of the Department of Defense Instrumentation Program for Tribal Colleges and Universities. SIPI is expected to use the defense funds to increase American Indian education in information technologies. 
   "SIPI was selected because it put forth a competitive proposal that is intended to help its students improve their knowledge of technology. The Defense Department, like so many agencies, knows that it and the nation will be better served in the future if our youth are well versed in the sciences," Domenici said. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its subcommittee on defense, and has been a consistent supporter of SIPI and its educational programs. 
   The one-year grant, which will provide "infrastructure support," is offered through the Army's Office of Defense Research and Engineering. The nine awardees, including SIPI, were selected from 18 proposals submitted. 
   The awards are funded through the FY2007 Defense Appropriations Bill, which funded the DOD Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Support Program. This program is intended to enhance programs and capabilities at minority institutions in scientific disciplines critical to national security. 
   SIPI is a national Indian community college and land grant institution and an associate member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. It provides students with post-secondary educational opportunities and technical job skills.
