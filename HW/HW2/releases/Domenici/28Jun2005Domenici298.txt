SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON BUSH'S ADDRESS ON WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Tuesday evening issued the following statement in reaction to President Bush's address to the nation on the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan:  
   "President Bush did a good job of reminding the American people why it is important that we not shrink away from our missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. I understand why some might be getting weary from seeing so many bad headlines about Iraq. But the headlines are not the whole story. As the President outlined, we and the people of Iraq are making real progress. We need to remain strong in fighting terrorism and supporting our military as they help the Iraqis govern their own country. Only then will our work be done and our mission completed."
