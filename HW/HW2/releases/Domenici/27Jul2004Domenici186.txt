SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS DOJ FUNDS FOR JUVENILE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded nearly $500,000 to the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department to support programs that help keep youth accountable for their actions and curb youth violence.  
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations subcommittee that sets funding levels for DOJ programs. 
   "The goal of this project is to maintain a balance between holding youth responsible for their actions and giving them the chance for a different life. Youth who commit crimes and disregard the law should be punished accordingly, but there should also be a commitment to rehabilitation that can rescue youth from the cycle of violence," Domenici said. 
   The grant funds, awarded through the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program, provide the resources required by law enforcement agencies across New Mexico to effectively fight and prevent juvenile crime. 
   The program will allow the state to use this funding where it will best support state and local law enforcement initiatives aimed at curbing youth violence and strengthening the juvenile justice system. 
   JABG will implement graduated sanctions programs that may include counseling, restitution, community service, and supervised probation to help New Mexico youth reform and get back on track. JABG funds are allocated to states based on their relative population of youth who are 18 or younger.
