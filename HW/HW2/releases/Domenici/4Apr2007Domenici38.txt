SEN. DOMENICI: UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO GETS GRANT TO STUDY HOW TO SAVE PI?ON JUNIPERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the University of New Mexico (UNM) will receive $410,067 in contract funding through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Program in Ecosystem Research.  
   Research will assess the effects of drought on the pi?on juniper forests in the southwest. The DOE Office of Science awarded the contract to the UNM Biology Department, under the supervision of Professor William Pockman. 
   "This research is useful and will offer insight into the drought situation and its effect on the pi?on forests of New Mexico," said Domenici. "Large numbers of these trees are in a state of catastrophic mortality that constitutes not only an overall ecological problem, but a fire danger as well. I hope that the research UNM conducts as a result of this contract will provide some of the information needed to properly combat this problem." 
   The contract represents a two-year extension of a research project already underway in partnership with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) at the Sevietta National Wildlife Refuge. The total grant amount, including previous funding, is $685,755. 
   Domenici is the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As then-chairman, he successfully engineered the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT), which seeks to develop a comprehensive policy approach to energy independence. 
   Domenici is also the ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriation Subcommittee that funds the DOE Office of Science which sponsors such research.
