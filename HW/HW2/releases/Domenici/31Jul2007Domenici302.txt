SENS. BINGAMAN, DOMENICI CHAMPIONED AMERICA COMPETES ACT FINALIZED
  U.S. Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today announced that they have completed work on their legislation to retain the nation's competitive edge. 
   A Senate-House panel today wrapped up negotiations on their America Competes Act, legislation that dramatically increases the nation's investment in science and puts a new, heavy emphasis on mathematics and science education.  
   Bingaman chaired that conference panel and Domenici served on the negotiating team. Both New Mexico Senators were part of a core bipartisan group that began the push for passage of an American competitiveness bill nearly two years ago. 
   "This is one of the biggest accomplishments Congress has undertaken this year. America Competes will help our country stay competitive for decades to come by investing heavily in education and in scientific R&D," Bingaman said. "It will help ensure that the jobs of the future are created - and remain - right here in our own country." 
   "This is the type of legislation that doesn't necessarily get much attention but could have a big impact on our future. This bill is an investment in the future of American brain power. It will improve math and science education for our children, and utilize our national laboratories in new and exciting ways," Domenici said. "After so much work, I'm very pleased that we've reached an agreement to make America more competitive in the global economy. I look forward to final passage and getting this bill enacted into law." 
   The America Competes Act would double the authorized funding for the National Science Foundation in seven years and sets the Department of Energy's Office of Science on a path to double over seven years. 
   It also provides grants of up to $6 million to help states create specialty math and science schools. Department of Energy laboratories will be partners in this effort in several ways, including "adopting" schools to strengthen their math and science capability. 
   The final bill also creates a broad range of programs to strengthen the skills of math and science teacher and encourages mathematicians and scientists to become teachers. And it provides resources to encourage students to enroll in Advanced Placement international baccalaureate programs. 
   The bill also supports other key New Mexico initiatives, including the following: 
   * The National Science Foundation science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) program-The New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation, based at NMSU, is a STEM recipient. Eastern New Mexico University, as well as New Mexico State University-Carlsbad, participates in this New Mexico program. (http://www.nmsu.edu/~nmamp/) 
   * NASA's Space Grant College and Fellowship Program-New Mexico participates in this program through a consortium led by NMSU. (http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/) 
   * The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research program (http://www.nmepscor.org/) 
   * Develops "Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes" which will benefit Sandia Laboratories collaborative efforts with New Mexico Universities to train the engineer of the 21st century in such areas as nanoscience and Microsystems. 
   * Complements New Mexico's efforts to strengthen K-12 math and science education, by expanding access to the Summer Institutes for teachers at the National Labs so more New Mexico teachers can participate in these very successful programs. Further, the bill would increase access to Advanced Placement programs, ensuring more New Mexico teachers are trained to teach Advanced Placement and more students have access to these critical courses of study. 
   Once the bill is passed by both chambers, as is expected this week, it can be sent to the president for signature.
