SEN. DOMENICI BACKS TWO-YEAR EXTENSION FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH POSTAGE STAMP
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that this week he agreed to be an original cosponsor to legislation that will direct revenue from a special U.S. postage stamp toward breast cancer research for another two years.  
   Domenici is backing the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2007 (S.597), which was introduced Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas). 
   "I am happy to again support this bill," said Domenici "Breast cancer is something so many American women and their families have dealt with. The breast cancer research stamp has successfully raised funds to research this disease for many years. The success of this stamp reassures me that it will continue gaining support for this terrible disease." 
   The bill will extend the sale of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for two additional years. Under current law, the sale of the stamp would expire Dec. 31, 2007. This bill allows the stamp to continue to have a surcharge of up to 25 percent above the value of a first-class stamp. The surplus revenues go to breast cancer research. 
   Aside from skin cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women nationwide. The U.S. Postal Service has sold more than 747 million "semi-postal" breast cancer research stamps since 1998. The special stamp has raised more than $53.8 million for breast cancer research, as well as focused public awareness on the illness and provided hope to breast cancer survivors. 
   Last year, Domenici also cosponsored the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act (S.1687), which would amend the Public Health Service Act and allow the Health and Human Services Secretary to waive requirements for awarding breast and cervical cancer grants to states in order to improve access to examinations and screening for breast and cervical cancers.
