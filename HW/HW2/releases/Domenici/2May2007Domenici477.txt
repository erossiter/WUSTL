SEN. DOMENICI OUTLINES USDA GRANT-LOAN PACKAGES FOR QUAY & RIO ARRIBA CO. WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that USDA Rural Development has awarded over $9 million to water and waste disposal projects in Quay and Rio Arriba Counties. 
   The village of Logan in Quay County and Ensenada in Rio Arriba County will receive the funds from the USDA Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program. Both communities will use the funds to improve the water infrastructure in their respective communities.
   "These awards will go a long way in improving the water services and infrastructure in Logan and Ensenada," said Domenici. "Even though they are not densely populated areas, I know that they still have issues to address in providing their residents with reliable water and wastewater services. I am glad that USDA makes these funds available to small communities and that it has chosen Logan and Ensenada as recipients."
   Logan will receive a $4 million grant and a $4.3 million loan. Funds will be used to extend the public sewer system to areas that currently lack service.
   Ensenada will receive a grant of $800,427 as well as a $369,000 loan. The town will use the funds to improve the existing water distribution system by drilling a new supply well and installing a new water storage tank.
   Rural Development funds are provided to rural communities to spur economic development and community infrastructure. For more information, visit http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rd/index.html.
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for USDA programs and projects.
