SEN. DOMENICI BACKS BILL TO OFFSET COUNTY COSTS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT INCARCERATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reaffirmed his support for renewing a federal law that reimburses states and counties for the costs they pay to incarcerate and detain criminal illegal immigrants for the federal government.  
   Domenici is cosponsoring the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) Reauthorization Act of 2005 (S.188), a bipartisan measure introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
   Existing federal authorization for SCAAP expired in October 2004, making its reauthorization more critical in the 109th Congress, Domenici said. S.188 would reauthorize the program through 2011 and dramatically increase funding levels to reimburse states and local governments for costs incurred in the processing of criminal illegal immigrants, including court, detention, county attorney, clerk, and indigent defense costs. This bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   "New Mexico has received SCAAP funding to offset the costs incurred by providing a service to the federal government. We must reauthorize this law, and increase the authority to provide new funding to our counties and states," Domenici said. 
   "It is unreasonable for the federal government to expect often impoverished border counties to carry the burden of handling these illegal immigrants for the federal government. After 9/11, we need to avoid creating a situation in which local law enforcement has a disincentive to actively be part of our homeland security efforts," Domenici said. 
   SCAAP was created by Congress in 1995 to reimburse states and localities for direct costs associated with incarcerating adult illegal immigrants. The bill would authorize such sums as necessary for FY2005, $750 million for FY2006; $850 million for FY2007; and $950 million for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011. 
   During the 108th Congress, Domenici cosponsored similar legislation which passed the Senate, but failed to be acted on in the House of Representatives. Domenici also serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the Justice Department and the SCAAP program. For FY2005, $305 million (minus the 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction) was provided for SCAAP. 
   "It is important to note that the reimbursements paid to localities cover incarceration costs, but not all the expenses incurred in housing and prosecuting criminal undocumented immigrants. The government should do its duty and pony up for the cost of housing these offenders," Domenici said. 
   Last June, applications for SCAAP funds from the state of New Mexico and 17 counties were granted, with the state receiving more than $679,399. These awards included: state of New Mexico ($193,023); Bernalillo ($248,295); Chaves ($16,920); Colfax ($5,556); De Baca ($1,759); Lea ($35,807); Otero ($25,532); Rio Arriba ($22,264); Santa Fe ($19,813); Taos ($4,641); Do?a Ana ($63,669); Grant ($5,955); Hidalgo ($1,742); Luna ($4,549); Quay ($1,397); Roosevelt ($5,107); Sierra ($4,720); and Valencia ($18,650). 
   SCAAP funds are eligible for housing criminal illegal immigrants with felony or multiple misdemeanor convictions and who are in violation of state and local laws. Reimbursement is available if such an individual is held at least four consecutive days.
