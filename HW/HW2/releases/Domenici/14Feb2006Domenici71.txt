SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS INCLUSION OF HIS BORDER SECURITY PLANS IN EXPECTED COMPREHENSIVE SENATE REFORM BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today moved to see that important provisions from his border security bill are included in Senate legislation being crafted for consideration by Senate Judiciary Committee in March.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate committees with funding and policy jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), introduced his own bipartisan border security bill (S.2049) in November. 
   Today he issued a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) to encourage him to include major provisions from S.2049, the Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005, in legislation the committee is expected to consider this spring. 
   "Border security and immigration reform are expected to be legislative priorities this year, and it is my hope that any bill we consider will include a wide array of provisions needed to protect our borders. More border and customs agents are imperative, but not the sole answer to curbing illegal activities on our northern and southern borders," Domenici said. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has primary jurisdiction over crafting Senate legislation to reform American immigration laws. Domenici, in his letter to Specter, specifically asked that the committee's bill authorize: 
   * Additional deputy U.S. Marshals 
   * Additional federal judges for border states 
   * A new local law enforcement grant program for border regions 
   * Significant infrastructure improvements for U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada 
   * A formal DHS-Defense Department arrangement on the development and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles 
   Domenici noted that it has been 20 years since Congress last enacted a major border infrastructure improvement package for the Southwest Border. That plan was spearheaded by Domenici and former Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). A 2000 GSA study found that there are at least $786 million in improvements needed at U.S. ports of entry. 
   Domenici noted that he is also finalizing a second bill that will be focused on reforming U.S. laws regarding immigration. 
   The text of the Domenici letter to Specter is available from the Domenici press office.
