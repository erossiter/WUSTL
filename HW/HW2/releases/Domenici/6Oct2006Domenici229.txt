SEN. DOMENICI CELEBRATES SUCCESSFUL ALBUQUERQUE TRICENTENNIAL
  Sen. Pete Domenici tonight congratulated the city of Albuquerque on a successful tricentennial celebration, and said he was looking forward to a bright future for the city, starting with the 2006 Balloon Fiesta. 
   Domenici, an Albuquerque native who is New Mexico's longest serving U.S. Senator, spoke at the "Festival of Illumination" at Balloon Fiesta Park, an event which marks the end of Albuquerque's 18-month tricentennial celebration.
   "From the Royal Birthday Gala featuring the Duke and Duchess of Spain to the Air Force Thunderbirds show at Kirtland to the Albuquerque Values project, we've had a very successful and enjoyable tricentennial celebration. I'm even more excited about our city's future, starting with the kickoff of the 2006 Balloon Fiesta," said Domenici, whose father arrived in Albuquerque in 1906 from Lucca, Italy.
   Domenici made special note of the Sandia Mountain illumination, which featured a two-mile string of energy efficient LED lights blazing along Sandia Crest for three hours.
   "An example of why our future is so bright is shining over us along Sandia Crest. The lights we see there are new, high-tech energy efficient LED lights. Earlier this week, I helped kick of a new project at Sandia National Laboratories to develop and promote new lighting that will dramatically reduce our energy costs for years to come. Its just another instance in which Albuquerque will lead the way in developing technology for our future," said Domenici, who serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   Domenici was instrumental in obtaining a special use permit from the U.S. Forest Service to allow the lights to be displayed.
   The Senator praised civic leaders for using the tricentennial as an occasion to kick off the Albuquerque Values project, which will define the vision for making Albuquerque a better place to live for the next 300 years.
