SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $4.62 MILLION GRANT TO SUPPORT EXPANDING NEW MEXICO CHARTER SCHOOL SYSTEM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded $4.62 million to support the public charter school system in New Mexico. 
   The federal grant was awarded to the New Mexico Department of Public Education for the state's Public Charter Schools Program and will likely be renewed for three years.
   "Charter school education is growing in New Mexico and this infusion of federal education dollars will be use to strengthen existing schools and establish other charter school opportunities around the state," Domenici said. "Charter schools offer parents and students another option for getting the best education possible."
   According to the New Mexico Education Department, there are currently 52 charters schools already operating around the state, and 12 schools slated to open next fall in Albuquerque, Aztec, Bernalillo, Deming, Espa?ola, Jemez Mountain, and Santa Fe.
   The funding would be used to help expand the public charter school system in New Mexico, strengthen accountability practices, increase public awareness of the New Mexico Charter School grant program, and promote the use of "best practices" among charter schools.
