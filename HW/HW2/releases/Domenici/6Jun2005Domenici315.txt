SEN. DOMENICI: N.M. FIRE DEPTMENTS CAN APPLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAFER PROGRAM GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will accept applications for FY 2005 "SAFER" Firefighter Hiring Program awards that allow fire departments to hire more fire personnel and offer incentives for recruitment and retention. 
   New Mexico fire departments have until June 28 to apply for funding through the SAFER Firefighter Hiring Program. SAFER provides competitive financial assistance to local career, volunteer or combination fire departments, and to local or state organizations representing interests of volunteer fire service.
   "This is a solid program that offers New Mexico's fire stations the chance to boost the number of trained professionals on their front lines," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. "Application for additional funds through SAFER could be the difference between having an around-the-clock staffer in the station or on the phone lines. I hope our career and volunteer fire departments consider applying for this program."
   Volunteer, combination and career fire departments may apply for five-year grants that pay a portion of the salaries of newly hired firefighters, or for four-year grants that assist with recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. For more information on this grant process please visit www.firesupport.com or call the fire grant help hot line toll-free at 866-274-0960.
   Congress provided $65 million in FY2005 to SAFER. New Mexico received over $3.2 million from DHS in approximately 40 grants that have been awarded to fire stations around the state in 2004.
