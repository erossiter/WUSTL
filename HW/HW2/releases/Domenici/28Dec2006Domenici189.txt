SEN. DOMENICI'S RURAL WATER SUPPLY BILL SIGNED INTO LAW
  Legislation authored by Sen. Pete Domenici to help rural communities obtain reliable water service has been signed into law by President Bush.  
   The President gave final approval to Domenici's Rural Water Supply Act (S.895), which is cosponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman. The bill passed the Senate during the final days of the 109th Congress. 
   The bill directs the U.S. Department of Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, to establish a program to plan, design, and construct rural water supply projects. The bill authorizes $15 million a year for planning new water delivery infrastructure and would establish a loan guarantee program within the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities finance new water projects and pay for maintenance on existing water systems. 
   "I am very pleased that this legislation has been signed into law. Access and availability of water is a major issue throughout the West. This bill will allow communities to receive help with their water planning and infrastructure which they badly need," Domenici said. 
   "This new law gives the Bureau of Reclamation the authority to work more closely with rural communities in New Mexico to help them plan for and meet their long-term water needs," Bingaman said," Bingaman said. The Rural Water Supply Act establishes a federal loan guarantee program within the BOR that allows rural communities to obtain loans at interest rates far lower than loans not guaranteed by the federal government. The legislation also expedites the appraisal and feasibility study process to allow communities to find the best approach to meet their needs. 
   During Senate consideration of this legislation last year, the mayors of Farmington and Clovis came to Washington to testify in favor of the bill. The National Rural Water Association and Bush administration also support the legislation.
