SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES EPA FUNDS TO STUDY N.M. WATER SUPPLY
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $100,000 to the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) for watershed management in the Canadian, Pecos, and Rio Grande basins.  
   Funds were administered under the Clean Water Act, which requires states to report water conditions to the EPA every two years. Specifically, NMED will use the grant money to extract information on water quality, as well as for planning, management and improvement of its reporting capabilities. 
   "New Mexico's location and climate mean that water is always one of its biggest issues," said Domenici. "Water is one of our most valuable assets and as such, it is crucial that we study to understand how we can be the most resourceful with it. I am glad that the Clean Water Act demands that New Mexico study our water supply and I hope that these funds will be put to good use." 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for funding all EPA programs. Earlier this month he reintroduced two bills related to water management in New Mexico: 
   * The New Mexico Water Planning Assistance Act would give the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (OSE) federal help to carry out its work to assess New Mexico's water resources and plan for future use. 
   * The New Mexico Aquifer Assessment Act instructs the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the state of New Mexico, to undertake a groundwater resources study that will shed light on what the nature and extent of water resources are in New Mexico. 
   Both bills are cosponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman.
