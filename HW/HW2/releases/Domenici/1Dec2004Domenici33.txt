SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS START OF LANL CONTRACT PROCESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he expects "excitement in bidding" as the Department of Energy opens its effort to issue a new contract for the management and operation of Los Alamos National Laboratory.  
   The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration today has issued a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and a request for public comment on its plan to issue a contract for the management and operation of LANL. 
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds DOE national laboratories, Domenici said he is keenly interested in reviewing the specifics of the RFP. 
   "I look forward to excitement in bidding as this process moves forward and successfully concludes with a contact that benefits the lab, its workers and foremost the nation," Domenici said. 
   "At this point, I want to review the RFP and get more information from people who are involved and informed in the management and operation of LANL. There is a lot at stake here for Los Alamos and its future. The new contractor must have a plan that retains and attracts world class scientific talent, and that includes protecting employee benefits as they stand now," he said. 
   "Finally, I expect the new contractor to offer specific commitments to technology transfer and community involvement that includes partnerships and economic development initiatives in the region," he said. 
   The draft RFP is available at the NNSA Service Center's LANL M&O Contract Competition Website: http://www.doeal.gov/LANLContractRecompete/Default.htm. Responses to questions and other information about the draft RFP will also be posted to this site. 
   The current LANL M&O contract expires on Sept. 30, 2005. NNSA intends to select a contractor this summer and begin full contract performance on Oct. 1, 2005.
