SENATE PASSES DOMENICI AMENDMENT TO MAKE NONPROLIFERATION GLOBAL CAUSE
  The Senate today approved an amendment authored by Sen. Pete Domenici to greatly expand United States nonproliferation activities into a global cause that targets nuclear materials and equipment wherever they are in the world.  
   The Senate approved the Domenici amendment as part of the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill. It passed by unanimous consent. The amendment authorizes an extensive array of programs - all with a global reach - to accelerate the removal or improve the security of fissile materials, radiological materials, and equipment. 
   "Our goal is to expedite a global cleanout of nuclear materials and equipment that could represent proliferation risks. It includes in one package a range of authorizations, all of which need acceleration toward the overall goal," Domenici said. "Our focus on Russia was appropriate a decade ago. But it is very clear today that proliferation must be viewed as a global problem." 
   "With this global cleanout amendment, we will take a giant step toward providing the Department of Energy, in coordination with other federal agencies, with the tools they need to minimize proliferation risks from nuclear materials wherever they are found around the world. In the process we can help make this world a safer place," he said. 
   The provisions would accelerate efforts to secure, remove or eliminate proliferation attractive fissile or radiological materials anywhere in the world. The amendment, among other things, would authorize arrangements to provide secure shipment and storage of such materials either in the United States or abroad. 
   The Domenici amendment pays detailed attention toward improving security at sites, whether by upgrading protections at functional sites or improving security at vulnerable or decommissioned sites. Other aspects of the amendment authorize programs to assist displaced employees and convert sties to new activities. 
   The legislation authorizes support to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and moves to accelerate the development of alternative fuels and radiation targets to replace reactor systems that rely on highly enriched uranium (HEU). It authorizes programs to hasten the conversion of reactor systems, including many research reactors that are fueled by HEU, to alternative fuels. 
   The Domenici amendment is cosponsored by Senators Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Joe Biden (D-Del.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John Warner (R-Va.). The Senate is expected to finish the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill by Friday. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee as well as the chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds DOE nonproliferation activities. The DOE national labs in New Mexico-Sandia and Los Alamos-are involved in U.S. nonproliferation programs. 
   The Domenici amendment expands the scope of a nonproliferation initiative he authored in the FY2003 Defense Authorization Act that built on existing programs and created new cooperative initiatives for the United States and Russia to control, protect and neutralize materials and weapons of mass destruction. It also reauthorized the First Responder training program to improve domestic preparedness.
