SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DOE CONTRACT TO TRACK WIPP-BOUND SHIPMENTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Energy has awarded an approximately $2.9 million contract for tracking shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). 
   The Net Gain Corp. of Knoxville, Tenn., was awarded the contract for work to be performed in Carlsbad. 
   The contract was awarded through the DOE Office of Environmental Management and will be used to operate the Transcon vehicle tracking system. This system is required to track all transuranic waste (TRU) systems.
