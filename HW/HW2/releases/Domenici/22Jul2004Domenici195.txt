SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9-11 COMMISSION REPORT
  In response to the release of the 9/11 Commission report, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement: 
   "I appreciate all the work of the Commission and look forward to studying the recommendations made in its comprehensive report. It covers all aspects of the Sept. 11 attacks and the roles of the entire government. 
   "The Commission made it clear that American leadership over the years knew of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. But no one, including the public, actually believed the United States homeland would be attacked as terribly as it was on 9/11. We were never on a war footing before the attacks. A lot has been done since then to correct that error, and we should move forward with improving and reforming our intelligence to confront the ongoing war on terrorism. A central terrorist intelligence clearinghouse is a good idea that should be considered. 
   "I wholeheartedly agree with the assessment that it is critical for Congress to carry out real oversight over intelligence and homeland security. I agree that congressional oversight in these areas over the years leading up to 9/11 was lax. 
   "There will be a lot of debate on whether to follow the congressional committee reorganization recommended by the 9/11 Commission. As we move forward, I am hopeful that the report will nonetheless serve as a roadmap to guide us as we make changes to prevent other acts of terrorism here."
