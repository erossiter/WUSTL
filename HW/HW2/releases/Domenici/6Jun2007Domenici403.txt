SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE FOR TEMPORARY WORKER VISAS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today offered an immigration reform amendment based on recommendations from New Mexico constituents that would set aside a specific number of temporary worker visas for small businesses.  
   Domenici offered the small business amendment to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act (S.1348), which is in its second week of debate in the Senate. 
   Domenici based the amendment on recommendations he received last week in a meeting with members of the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce. The amendment would set aside 25 percent of the new Y temporary worker visas specifically for small businesses. The Senate bill currently authorizes 200,000 temporary worker visas. 
   "Small business owners are concerned that they are at a distinct disadvantage in competing with big corporations for temporary visa workers in a wide-open field. This amendment would give small businesses a better shot at getting the workers they need to support their work," Domenici said. 
   The amendment would make 25 percent of the Y visas available only to small businesses, as defined by the Small Business Administration, for the first six months of every year. For the last six months, any unused Y visas not claimed by small businesses would revert to the general pool of available temporary worker visas. 
   Among the estimated 12.4 million noncitizen workers in the United States, almost 70 percent work for U.S. employers with fewer than 500 employees, according to the Congressional Research Service. These noncitizen workers might include both documented and undocumented workers. Documented workers include both temporary (nonimmigrant) and permanent (immigrant) workers.
