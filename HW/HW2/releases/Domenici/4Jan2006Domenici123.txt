SEN. DOMENICI NOTES RAYTHEON FARMINGTON PLANT SHARE IN LARGE NAVY MISSILE CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today noted that the Raytheon Co. plant in San Juan County will take part in a sizable, multi-year Navy contract to produce surface-to-air missiles.  
   Domenici said the Farmington plant's share of the contract will amount to $2.35 million, about 1 percent of the total $235.6 million Department of the Navy contract awarded to Raytheon. The bulk of the work for the Navy will be conducted at Raytheon's facility in Tucson, Ariz. The contract derives from the recently passed FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act, and extends through December 2008. 
   "I'm pleased the Farmington plant will be part of this campaign to supply the Navy with the armaments it requires," Domenici said. "I've toured the plant in San Juan County and appreciate that it gives the region a role in national security and economic diversity." 
   According to the Navy, the contract entails production of "Standard Missile-2 Block IIIA All Up Rounds (AURs) AN/DKT-71A Telemetric Data Transmitting Sets (TDT's), selection level spares and shipping containers for Allied Nations." In addition to work in Farmington and Tucson, the contract will also be carried out at Raytheon facilities in Camden, Ark., and Andover, Mass. 
   The Standard Missile-2 missiles are used by the Navy to defend against enemy aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles. They are the Navy's primary surface-to-air fleet defense weapon. These weapons are used on guided-missile cruisers, destroyers and frigates of the U.S. Navy, and a number of allies. 
   Domenici last toured the Raytheon facility in Farmington in 2000.
