HUD GRANTS AWARDED FOR HOUSING AT PICURIS, SAN ILDEFONSO, TESUQUE PUEBLOS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded $639,785 to the Northern Pueblos Housing Authority to provide affordable housing assistance for the pueblos of Picuris, San Ildefonso and Tesuque. 
   The HUD grants will be used to provide comprehensive rehabilitation of most of the houses at the Picuris Pueblo; build 20 new housing units to service low and modest income residences on the San Ildefonso Pueblo; and provide electrical upgrades to homes on the Pueblo of Tesuque.
   "Improving housing facilities throughout Indian pueblos continues to be a high priority. I will continue to support any and all efforts to continue funding for pueblo housing rehabilitation and affordable housing construction," Domenici said.
   The HUD grants were made available through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program. Domenici serves as the Senate Appropriations Committee which designates funding for HUD and its programs.
