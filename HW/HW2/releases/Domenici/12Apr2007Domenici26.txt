SEN. DOMENICI WORKS TO DRUM UP SUPPORT TO EXPAND USDA NUTRITION ELIGIBILITY FOR SENIORS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today began an effort to gain bipartisan support for legislation to expand access eligibility of low-income seniors for U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition benefits. 
   Domenici will be the primary cosponsor to Senator Debbie Stabenow's Senior Nutrition Act to modify eligibility criteria for supplemental foods provided under the USDA Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a component of the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program. Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Domenici teamed up on a similar bill last year. 
   Domenici and Stabenow have issued a formal call for cosponsors to their measure, which they expect to introduce soon. The legislation is intended to take into account more out-of-pocket expenses incurred by seniors, including medical expenses, when determining eligibility for CSFP benefits. 
   "As we look at overall agriculture policy this year, I hope we can get broad support for this bill. It would expand access to USDA food goods to more low-income seniors. The CSFP is well established throughout New Mexico and I believe expanding access to its benefits would be worthwhile," Domenici said. 
   Under this plan, seniors who participate in or are eligible for the Food Stamp Program would be made categorically eligible for CSFP benefits without further income verification. The Food Stamp Program provides a medical expense deduction, which seniors may use to account for high prescription drug costs. 
   New Mexico is one of 32 states with CSFP programs, operating four food warehouses (Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces, and Roswell) and 55 tailgate distribution sites around the state. An estimated 90 percent of New Mexico CSFP participants are elderly. The New Mexico CSFP operation is overseen by the Family, Food and Nutrition Section of the New Mexico Department of Health.
