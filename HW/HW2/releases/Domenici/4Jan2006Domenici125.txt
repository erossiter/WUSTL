SEN. DOMENICI: KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE SITE FOR OSPREY AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today noted that Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque will be the site for test and evaluation work associated with the development of the CV-22, a variation of the vertical launch Osprey aircraft.  
   The Department of the Navy has awarded a $37.4 million contract to the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office to provide logistic services in support of the CV-22 Developmental Test and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation program. 
   Half of the contract will be carried out at Kirtland AFB, while the remainder will be conducted at Edwards AFB in California. 
   "The Osprey aircraft program is a bold attempt to give the services a unique and reliable aircraft that can expand their capabilities. I am pleased that much of this ongoing evaluation work will be done in Albuquerque," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee. 
   The Navy award, a modification to an existing contract, is for work that is expected to be completed by December 2006. 
   The contract is part of an effort to develop a long-range Special Operations CV-22 for US Special Operations Command. The Osprey program is a joint-service, medium-lift, multi-mission tilt-rotor aircraft developed by Boeing and Bell Helicopters. The aircraft is being designed to operate as a helicopter for take off and landing, while converting to a turboprop aircraft when airborne. 
   The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill, which was signed into law Dec. 30, provides $1.5 billion for the V-22 aircraft procurement program.
