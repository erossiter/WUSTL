SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO GAINS ANOTHER $1.8 MILLION TO WEATHERIZE LOW-INCOME HOMES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy will award another $1.8 million to New Mexico to help low-income families make cost-saving weatherization improvements to their home. 
   The DOE award to New Mexico, the second this year, will mean that $3.6 million is being made available in 2006 to improve low-income households by adding insulation, reducing air infiltration, servicing the heating and cooling systems, and providing health and safety diagnostic services. In April, DOE released an initial $1.8 million for this work in the state.
   "The high energy prices can make it difficult for some New Mexicans to keep up with energy costs. Weatherizing a home can not only save a family an average of $350 a year, but it also helps conserve energy. This is good for family pocketbooks and also good for easing our nation's appetite for more and more energy--at least a bit," said Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   The DOE Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides assistance to low income homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and reduce utility costs. The latest grant to New Mexico is part of $96.4 million being distributed to 19 states. Assistance is distributed through state energy offices through more local agencies.
   Domenici, as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, gained approval to restore $40.4 million of a proposed cut to WAP in FY2007. The Senate will now consider a FY2007 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill that has $204.5 million for weatherization aid next year.
