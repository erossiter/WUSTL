SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE COUNTY AWARDED $630,000 TO HELP LOW-INCOME WORKERS GET TO WORK
  Sen. Pete Domenici today touted the award of $630,000 in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) funds to provide transit service to low-income workers who need help getting to their jobs in Santa Fe County.  
   The funding was awarded to the City of Santa Fe through the federal Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) grant program, which is administered by the DOT's Federal Transit Administration. 
   Domenici, the only member of the New Mexico delegation to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee, requested that $2 million be included for JARC in the FY2005 Transportation Appropriations Bill. In FY2004, the lawmaker secured $1 million for this program. 
   "I am pleased to be able to secure funding for this program because it provides an invaluable service to New Mexicans struggling to find ways to get to their job," Domenici said. "The goal of this program is to make transit services more available to workers who can't find a reliable way to get to work which threatens their job security. This federal assistance will make the lives of low-income workers living throughout Santa Fe County a little bit easier." 
   Job Access Projects involve new or expanded transportation services such as shuttles, vanpools, new bus routes, connector services to mass transit, and guaranteed ride home programs for welfare recipients and low income persons. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation services to suburban employment centers from urban, rural and other suburban locations for all populations. 
   Last year, the Transportation Department awarded grants to Rio Arriba County ($252,024), Las Vegas ($98,773), Angel Fire ($70,483), Taos ($59,000) and Questa ($31,200) to provide transportation services to these areas.
