SEN. DOMENICI ENCOURAGES NEW MEXICANS TO HELP RESTORE AND RENEW N.M. PUBLIC LANDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today urged New Mexicans to participate this weekend in the nation's preeminent volunteer-based conservation event for public lands, including 21 sites across New Mexico.  
   In a bipartisan letter signed with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, encouraged grassroots support for the nation's recreational areas by volunteering on National Public Lands Day. 
   Held this year on Saturday, Sept. 29, National Public Lands Day provides an opportunity for volunteers to restore hiking trails, improve wildlife habitats, and work to protect natural and cultural resources. 
   "In New Mexico, we are fortunate to live in a state that is rich with natural resources and beauty," Domenici said. "National Public Lands Day provides an opportunity for New Mexicans to directly participate in the maintenance and care of these resources for our continued enjoyment, and to preserve our public lands for the benefit of future generations." 
   An anticipated 1,300 New Mexicans will flock to 21 sites across the state, from the Tortugas Mountains Trail in Las Cruces to Fiestas de la Joya in Taos, and many others in between.

   This year marks the 14th annual event and volunteers will be educated on environmental and natural resources issues, while building partnerships between communities and the public sector to complete restoration and improvement projects. 
   The National Public Lands Day program is coordinated by the National Environmental Education Foundation, a private, non-profit establishment. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests oversees wildlife areas and public lands.
