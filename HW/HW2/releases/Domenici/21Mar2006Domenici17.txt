SEN. DOMENICI NOTES DOD GRANTS FOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AT UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has announced that the University of New Mexico will purchase research equipment as part of $40.4 million grants awarded to universities around the country. 
   The Army Research Office (ARO), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Air Force Office of Science Research (AFOSR) awarded 183 Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) awards worth an average of $217,000 to 88 institutions to enhance and develop DoD-relevant research capabilities by purchasing state-of-the-art equipment. UNM won four grant awards.
   "Research is such an important aspect because it not only enhances the education of UNM students but it can also produce findings that can be of tremendous value. I am pleased to see that UNM is a recipient of these competitive grants," said Domenici who serves on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
   UNM will use these grants to purchase equipment for:
   * Nonlinear Optics in Novel Quantum Dot Materials
   * Fiber Fabrication Equipment for High-power Laser Research
   * Instrumentation for the Solid State Optical Cryocooler Research
   * Femtosecond Oscillator and Infrared Detector for Field-enhanced Microscopy.
   DURIP received a total of 933 proposals requesting a total of $254 million in support for research equipment.
