SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA ISSUES FUNDS TO STRENGTHEN QUESTA FIRE DEPARTMENT
  In the wake of several fires blazing across New Mexico, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today commended the La Lama fire department for successfully completing another round of FEMA grant funding that will finance the purchase of new equipment for local firefighters. 
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for FEMA, announced that the La Lama Volunteer Fire Department was selected to receive $112,500 in funding to purchase a brush truck to help firefighters battling blazes on wild lands. 
   "Within the past few months, New Mexico has been afflicted with several dangerous and damaging fires that have consumed homes, land and wildlife. As we brace ourselves for another dry summer, I am pleased to see local fire departments making the extra effort to be prepared," Domenici said. "The funds will help La Lama buy a new truck that can serve the greater Questa area fire departments." 
   Domenici also pointed out the damage three fires have done to the land around Capitan, Corona and Grants since May. The Peppin Fire six miles northeast of Capitan consumed approximately 64,448 acres of land in Lincoln National Forest. Over 11,000 acres were burned in Cibola National Forest from the Sedgwick Fire west of Grants and the Lookout Fire outside Corona. 
   Domenici has also recently announced that the Taos Ski Valley Fire Department was also selected to receive $52,830 in funding to purchase additional breathing apparatus compressors (CBA) and bunker gear. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awarded these one-year grants after Congress appropriated and President Bush signed into law $750 million in federal funds for firefighters throughout the nation.
