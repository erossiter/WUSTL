SEN. DOMENICI: FINAL ARMY CORPS FY07 BUDGET PLAN GUTS SOME N.M. WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today pledged to work with the Army Corps of Engineers to sustain water-related projects in New Mexico that face funding cuts for the remainder of FY2007, including ongoing middle Rio Grande bosque restoration. 
   Domenici is continuing to assess the impact of funding decisions made in the wake of Congress largely failing to complete the FY2007 appropriations process, including the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill that funds the Army Corps of Engineers. Earlier this year, the new Democratic leadership in Congress decided to roll all unfinished bills into an omnibus package that left federal bureaucracies to determine the distribution of federal funding.  
   "There's no doubt that New Mexico is taking a hit because the appropriations process was so messed up last year. The most salient Corps projects in New Mexico are funded, but I am disappointed with the severe drop in funding for the Corps' work to restore the bosque," said Domenici, who is ranking member on the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Corps. 
   "We've made progress to make the bosque more beautiful and I want this work to continue. I will work with the Army Corps to minimize the impact of the FY2007 funding situation and see to it that next year's outlook is better for New Mexico projects next year," Domenici said. 
   Overall, the Corps funding plan recommends $29.2 million for work in New Mexico, including increased funding for acequias rehabilitation ($2.4 million), Cochiti Lake maintenance and operations ($5.79 million), and steady funding for an Alamogordo flood control project ($4.2 million. 
   However, the FY2007 funding plan also recommends significant cuts for a water infrastructure program for Bernalillo, Sandoval and Valencia counties (-$2.49 million), Albuquerque levee evaluations (-2.0 million), and bosque restoration (-$3.75 million). The plan also eliminates $5.0 million for the New Mexico Environmental Infrastructure program, which has been used to support water and wastewater infrastructure projects around the state. 
   The following is a review of FY2007 Army Corps of Engineers funding for New Mexico projects. It includes in parenthesis a increase or reduction from FY2006 funding levels.
