SEN. DOMENICI: ESTANICA POLICE DEPARTMENT GETS RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FROM USDA
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that a loan of $18,200 and a grant of $9,800 have been awarded to the Estancia Police Department in Torrance County.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Rural Development funding has been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   "The funds provided by the USDA ensure that smaller communities like Estancia can secure the resources necessary to protect and serve even their most remote citizens," Domenici said. "New Mexicans in such rural areas will benefit from the acquisition of this often costly equipment, which help to improve safety for everyone in the area." 
   The USDA Community Facility loan and grant will be used by the town of Estancia to purchase a 4-wheel drive police unit. This vehicle will provide greater protective services for those living in the surrounding rural areas. 
   Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the USDA's rural development mission. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, hospitals, medical clinics, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, and transportation.
