SEN. DOMENICI: FOREST SERVICE EXPECTED TO MOVE MORE JOBS TO ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today made the following announcement regarding the potential for Forest Service jobs to be moved to Albuquerque: 
   "I am pleased to announce today that the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) will be moving a substantial number of jobs to the Albuquerque area over the next few years. While specific numbers are not yet known, it is likely that over a thousand jobs will be transferred from other locations to Albuquerque, and will most likely be housed in an additional USFS building.
   "This move is further evidence that the future of New Mexico's economy is strong. New job numbers released today report that over the past year, New Mexico's unemployment rate has dropped from 5.4 percent to 4.0 percent, the second largest drop in the entire nation. The economic future of Albuquerque is bright."
   The new jobs will be in addition to Forest Service employees already slated to move to Albuquerque. Last year, the Forest Service began moving employees to the Duke City as part of the new Albuquerque Administrative Service Center located in the Journal Center area. By 2008, 682 new employees will join the agency at the new facility.
