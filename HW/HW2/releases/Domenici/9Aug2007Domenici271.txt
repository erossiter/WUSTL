RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS WILL HELP OTERO & DO?A ANA WATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded over $3.2 million to water projects in Otero and Do?a Ana County.  
   Funds were awarded through loans and grants as part of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program. 
   "Otero and Do?a Ana counties contain a wide array of rural communities, each of which possesses specific water needs," said Domenici. "Rural Development funds will help each as they make improvements to their current water system in order to accommodate the needs of residents." 
   The Mountain Orchard Mutual Domestic Water Users Association in High Rolls received a $495,665 grant and a $110,000 loan for water system improvements, including new storage tanks and an upgraded disinfection system. 
   The Desert Aire Mutual Domestic Water & Sewer Works Association in Chaparral received a $244,387 grant and a $42,000 loan to improve its water system and provide service to an additional 15 users. 
   The Chamberino Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association was awarded a $636,278 grant and a $110,000 loan for the first phase of its expansion project that is expected to extend the distribution system by over two miles and 39 service connections. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA.
