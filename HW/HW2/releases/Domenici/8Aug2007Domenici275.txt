HUMANITIES GRANTS AWARDED FOR N.M. CENTENNIAL & ISLETA PUEBLO HISTORY PROJECT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that a total of $394,827 has been awarded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to two New Mexico projects dedicated to the state's history.  
   "Both of these projects represent a worthy salute to New Mexico's rich and diverse history," said Domenici. "I look forward to seeing their progress, as well as the contributions that each will make to the state in the near future." 
   The Pueblo of Isleta will receive $328,247 for its project entitled "Isletan Images: A Photographic History of the Pueblo in the 19th Century" which will showcase the pueblo's history through publication and a traveling exhibition. 
   New Mexico Humanities Council will receive $66,580 for preparations related to the New Mexico Centennial of Statehood in 2012. The NEH award will also be supplemented by $100,000 in matching funds. (http://nmhum.org/home/) 
   Both projects were selected following a review and selection progress. According to the NEH, both represent the best of humanities research, preservation, and public programs from across the country. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that determines funding for federal programs, including the NEH.
