SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO BENEFITS BIG FROM NEW FEDERAL HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today welcomed final congressional passage of a massive, new federal highway and transportation bill that will direct tens of millions of dollars to New Mexico over the next five years.  
   The Senate gave final passage (91-4) Friday to HR.3, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (HR.3). The House approved the measure Thursday night. With the final Senate vote, the $286 billion new federal highway bill will be sent to President Bush to be signed into law. 
   Domenici, as the senior member of the New Mexico congressional delegation, allocated $60 million in the bill to specific priority projects around the state. Combined with priority projects selected by other members of the state's congressional delegation, the final bill includes $137.4 million in specific project earmarks for the state. 
   In addition, Domenici welcomed the new Federal Highway Trust Fund formula that will direct an estimated $1.766 billion-or an average of $337.9 million a year-to the state of New Mexico for transportation work through FY2009. This is an $82.186 million annual increase over current TEA-21 levels. 
   "At last, New Mexico will be able to continue to improve its transportation and highway improvement projects under the umbrella of this new highway bill. No longer will all our states have to deal with continuations of the old bill. This new bill will allow us to put resources into forward-looking highway and transportation projects," Domenici said. 
   "Taken as a whole, I believe the state will be well served by this new law. My priorities, combined with those of my delegation counterparts, mean that critical projects around the state can move forward," he said. 
   The previous highway bill expired in September 2003, but Congress has been funding the federal highway through temporary six-month extensions, which put states at a disadvantage as they worked to secure long-term financing for highway projects. 
   Under SAFE-TEA, New Mexico will receive an average of $337.9 million a year from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by federal gas tax revenues, through FY2009. This would mean the state would receive an estimated $1.766 billion overall, and maintain its status a recipient state that receives from the Trust Fund than it pays into it. 
   The final bill, among many things, includes a $75 million authorization to support the development of a commuter rail link between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. In addition, Domenici and Senator Jeff Bingaman, with the support of Congressman Steve Pearce, were able to secure $14 million in the last days of conference negotiations to support the relocation of the El Paso rail yards to Santa Teresa, N.M. 
   Domenici, the senior member of the New Mexico congressional delegation, allocated $60 million in specific earmark funding for the state to projects that will aid in the long-term economic development proposals in the state. His funding allocations are directed toward Albuquerque's West Side, Rio Rancho, Las Cruces, Lea County and Eddy County. 
   Domenici apportioned more than half of his priorities toward the state's largest metropolitan area, targeting $39.6 million toward four major projects in the Albuquerque-Rio Rancho area. Three of those projects are linked to West Side growth and the potential for aircraft manufacturing at the Double Eagle II Airport. 
   The following is a brief review of the $60 million in New Mexico projects that Domenici designated for funding from the new highway bill (HR.3): 
   * Iris Road to U.S. Highway 550 (Rio Rancho) - $14.6 million for roadway construction connecting Iris Road NE to U.S. Highway 550, one segment in the overall plan to connect Paseo del Volcan/Double Eagle II Airport with U.S. Highway 550 (See related additional Udall earmark below.); 
   * I-40 and Paseo del Volcan (Albuquerque) - $12.0 million to support rebuilding and expanding this interchange to improve access to the Double Eagle II Airport and its emerging commercial aviation center; 
   * Paseo del Volcan (Albuquerque) - $8.0 million to improve this thoroughfare from I-40 to the Double Eagle II Airport; and, 
   * University Boulevard/Mesa del Sol (Albuquerque) - $5.0 million to extend University Boulevard from I-25/Rio Bravo Interchange to 9,000-acre Mesa del Sol planned community. (See related additional Wilson earmark below.) 
   * I-10 and 1-25 Bridge (Las Cruces) - $7.0 million toward a $12 million project to completely reconstruct the I-10 and I-25 interchange in Las Cruces. 
   * I-10 Reconstruction (Las Cruces) - $2.0 million toward a $39 million project to reconstruct I-10 from Las Cruces to the Texas state line. (See related additional Pearce earmark below.) 
   * N.M. Highway 176 (Lea County) - $5.0 million for roadway reconstruction of N.M. Highway 176, which connects U.S. Highway 62/180 (Hobbs-Carlsbad) to Eunice-the site for a planned uranium enrichment facility; 
   * U.S. 62/180 (Eddy County) - $5.0 million to support ongoing work to expand and reconstruct U.S. 62/180 between Carlsbad, the Carlsbad National Monument, and the Texas state line (See related additional Pearce earmark below.); and, 
   * Water Canyon Road/FS 235 (Socorro County) - $1.4 million toward the $8.0 million improvement of this Forest Service road to the Magdalena Ridge Observatory. 
   For New Mexico, other members of the ongressional delegation were instrumental in gaining another $77.4 million in earmarks for the state. These include: 
   * $20 million - I-25/Paseo del Norte/Jefferson reconstruction, Albuquerque (Bingaman)

   * $3.2 million - N.M.128/N.M. 31 junction east to Texas state line, Lea County (Pearce)

   The bill also authorizes $2.15 million over four years for Santa Fe Trails bus and bus facilities, and another $1.1 million (divided over four years) for Las Cruces Roadrunner bus and bus facilities. 
   Finally of interest to New Mexico, the conference agreement closely reflects the funding levels Domenici included in this stand-alone bill to reauthorize the Indian Reservation Roads program, which is specifically designed to improve transportation on reservations. Current IRR funding is set at $284 million. Under the final SAFE-TEA legislation, IRR would receive $300 million for FY2005, $330 million for FY2006, $370 million for FY2007, $410 million for FY2008 and $450 million for FY2009.
