SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF DR. TAYLOR MCKENZIE OF GALLUP
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the death of Dr. Taylor McKenzie of Gallup, the former Navajo Nation vice president who worked with the Senator to advance health care issues. McKenzie died Friday in Albuquerque.  
   "Taylor McKenzie was a very good and dear friend to me. I am saddened by his loss, but know that he will rest in peace knowing that he worked to do so much for the Navajo people. I could always count on Taylor to give me frank assessments of how health care and life could be improved for the Indian people. It was his good work that helped us find initial money to ensure the opening of the new Fort Defiance Hospital and his leadership was key to helping lead efforts to combat diabetes among Navajos and all Indian people. The Navajo Nation, and in fact, New Mexico has lost a wonderful man. His life should serve as role model for the young, especially for those who want to join the medical profession. 
   "My wife Nancy and I offer condolences and prayers to his wife Betty and the entire McKenzie family." 
   A memorial service for Dr. McKenzie is scheduled for 1:30 p.m., Wednesday, at the First United Methodist Church, 1800 Red Rock Drive, Gallup.
