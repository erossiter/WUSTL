   REVIEW: 
   00:40 Domenici offers reassurances of ongoing work to find the best way to move legislation to authorize federal aspects of the Navajo-Gallup water pipeline project. He says a recent memorandum of understanding between the Navajo Nation and city of Gallup is useful to this effort. 
   03:03 Domenici says it would be better to have Bush administration cooperation on Navajo water settlement legislation, but says he and Senator Bingaman could decide to try to move the bill through Congress without the outright support of the Interior Department or the Department of Justice. 
   04:02 Domenici discusses his current opposition to the development of a new energy bill, primarily because the House leadership disregarded an agreement on negotiations and included an unfair renewable portfolio standard (RPS). He says the RPS would force about 27 states to pay fees because they cannot produce enough energy through wind, solar or biofuel sources. He says this action jeopardizes the effort to pass a bill this year. 
   10:14 Domenici says the United States must improve automobile efficiency standards, or CAFE standards. He says that improving mileage standards in American automobiles could help lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He says the new energy bill contains such mandates, but says the RPS mandate could scuttle the overall legislation. 
   14:14 Domenici says he has not carefully studied the Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow one owner to own various media outlets in a single market. He says he would likely support an effort to require more time for public comment on the issue. 
   15:42 Domenici is pleased with the vote in Venezuela rejecting President Hugo Ch?vez's bid to amend that nation's constitution to give him more power. He says that unlike the national election in Russia, the Venezuelan vote appears to be more fair and open. He says it appears that the Venezuelan people have not been "totally fooled" by Ch?vez. 
   17:41 Domenici hopes the Venezuelan vote will help gain support for free trade agreements between the United States and Latin American nations. He notes that the Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on such a trade pact with Peru. 
   19:43 Domenici says the 2007 Farm Bill is "a mess" because of the Majority Leader's attempt to impose control over the bill without allowing debate on amendments. He says a bipartisan agreement is needed to help move the bill forward. 
   22:14 Domenici cites a Washington Post article on supercomputing advances being made by the national laboratories, including the Roadrunner computer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He says this work holds a lot of promise for national security and global climate change. He also points out that a House-passed funding bill recommends no new funding for the Roadrunner project. 
   24:51 Domenici says he does not support U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service efforts to expand areas in New Mexico to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf.
