SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DOE PENALTY PLANS FOR LANL SECURITY LAPSE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement regarding the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration security reforms and fines assessed against the University of California (UC) and the Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS) for security lapses at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  
   "The problematic security breaches at the labs, as well as this DOE-NNSA response, are a wakeup call for the entire weapons complex. The proposed reforms being developed by the Energy Secretary to improve security should be implemented complex wide. I believe one significant improvement proposed by the lab is a plan to consolidate vault storage for classified material so the management of this material is tighter. I've included funding to deploy this project in the FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill." 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill that includes $67 million in new funding added by Domenici for security improvements at LANL. Of this amount, $45 million is specified for classified vault upgrades to consolidate over 140 separate vaults across the lab complex to fewer than 10 vaults, and $12 million to complete the Red Network at LANL to reduce the potential for staff to remove classified material. The bill is now ready for consideration by the full Senate.
