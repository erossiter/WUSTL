SEN. DOMENICI NAMES NEW MEXICO STUDENTS NOMINATED FOR APPOINTMENT TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today released the names of students from throughout New Mexico that he is nominating for potential admission to one of the United States military service academies.  
   Domenici made the selections based on recommendations made by his Academy Review Board, which interviews applicants and assesses them on a combination of academic, athletic, extra-curricular, and leadership abilities. In all, Domenici is nominating 38 New Mexico high school seniors for possible admission. 
   "Each of my nominees has demonstrated very good academic and leadership qualities that should serve them well. I credit all of them for their interest in getting an excellent education through our military service academies and serving their nation," Domenici said. 
   "It is my hope that a few of these well-qualified New Mexico students will be accepted to a service academy. The competition for open spots is always stiff, but I hope my nomination puts them a step closer to acceptance," he said.
