USDA SELECTS PUNTA DE AGUA WATERSHED FOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has chosen the Punta de Agua watershed as a priority selection for the Conservation Security Program (CSP) sign-up planned for this summer.  
   The Conservation Security Program (CSP) is a new, voluntary federal farm program that provides financial incentives and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers who develop conservation plans on their working lands. 
   "Farmers and ranchers who reside within the Punta de Agua watershed can participate in this program and receive training, funds and other incentives in return for preserving the natural resources on their lands," Domenici said. 
   Punta de Agua rises in southeastern Union County and flows southeast through Hartley County, Texas. The shallow depressions around Punta de Agua's forty-five mile course cause a watershed-accumulated water that drains into the Canadian River. 
   "CSP will help those in the Clayton area and throughout Union County keep the natural resources on their property pristine for the wildlife that lives along the Punta de Agua," the lawmaker added. 
   The goal of CSP is to improve the quality of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life on working lands. Working lands include cropland, grassland, prairie land, improved pasture, range land, and forested land that is part of an agriculture operation. 
   All CSP applications that meet the sign-up criteria will be placed in an enrollment category. Categories will consider the applicants' soil condition, tillage intensity, existing practices and activities.

   CSP is administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.
