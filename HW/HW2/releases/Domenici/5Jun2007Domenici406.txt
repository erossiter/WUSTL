SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF SEN. THOMAS
  Sen. Pete Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the death of Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming:  
   "Craig Thomas was a cowboy, a Marine, a Senator, and a devoted father and husband. He was a quiet, unassuming man who did a good job for the state he represented and loved, Wyoming. Craig Thomas was the type of Senator that showed up when he should and did his job as best he could. When the chips were down, you could count on him. He worked the way a dedicated person works-tough-minded and impatient to get good things done. He was a true, true man. 
   "Senator Thomas was also an outstanding member of the Energy Committee who was the ranking member of our National Parks Subcommittee. He leaves behind a lasting legacy of dedication to America's national parks which includes landmark legislation to provide funding and management reforms to protect our parks. We will miss him on the committee. 
   "My wife Nancy and I offer our sincere condolences to Susan Thomas and the Thomas' four children. They will be in our prayers."
