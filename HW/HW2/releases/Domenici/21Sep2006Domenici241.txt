SEN. DOMENICI CRITICAL OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's remarks in New York City over the last two days: 
   "President Chavez's behavior in the United States these last two days is an embarrassment to himself and his country. Given his undiplomatic and inappropriate remarks, it is ironic that he would dare criticize the U.S. relationship with the rest of the world. Considering the abject failure of his government, which has caused violence and strife among the Venezuelan people, he is in no position to pass judgment on our President and our policies.
   "President Chavez's erratic behavior is particularly of concern to me because of his nation's extensive oil supplies, which are under his control. Disruptions to Venezuela's oil supply have previously affected the global market, and should serve as a stark reminder of the need to increase domestic U.S. production and reduce our dependence on foreign oil."
