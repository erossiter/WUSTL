SEN. DOMENICI BILL WOULD RENAME COLORADO LAKE TO HONOR SEN. CAMPBELL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today introduced legislation to rename a lake on the Animas River in southwest Colorado after his friend and retiring Sen.  
 Ben Nighthorse Campbell.
   The legislation would authorize renaming the Ridges Basin Reservoir, created as part of the Animas-La Plata project, as Lake Nighthorse. Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, offered the bill as a tribute to Campbell who announced his retirement from the Senate earlier this year.
   "It is fitting that the Ridges Basin Reservoir, which was created pursuant to legislation introduced and shepherded through Congress by Senator Campbell, bear his name," Domenici said.
   "A veteran, Olympian and public servant, Senator Campbell has selflessly devoted himself to serving his state and country for more than half a century. During his 17 years in the House and then the Senate, he has earned respect on both sides of the aisle as a consummate statesman and staunch advocate for the state of Colorado," he said.
   The lake near Durango was created under the Colorado Ute Indian Water Settlement Act of 1988.
   Domenici and Campbell, the only American Indian serving in the Senate, have worked together on a number of committees including the Senate Appropriations Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.
