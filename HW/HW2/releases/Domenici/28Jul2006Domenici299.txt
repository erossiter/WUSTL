SEN. DOMENICI: JAPAN ACCEPTANCE OF U.S. BEEF GOOD FOR OVERALL INDUSTRY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said that Japan's decision to begin reopening its market to American-grown beef should have a positive effect on the overall U.S. livestock industry. 
   The Japanese government on Thursday announced its intent to resume the importation of U.S. beef, ending a ban launched in late 2003 over "mad cow disease," or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) concerns. That ban effectively stopped a $1.4 billion beef trade with Japan. It was temporarily lifted late last year only to be re-imposed by Japan in January after a single error to an export agreement.
   Building on earlier efforts, Domenici in June cosponsored legislation authorizing the United States to impose greater tariffs on Japanese goods should talks to resume U.S. beef imports failed.
   "I welcome the Japanese agreement to again allow its people to enjoy American beef. The truth is that the United States has taken substantive, good-faith action to ensure the safety of its beef, and fully disclosed those actions to the Japanese government. I regret that it took this long to allay their concerns, but I do believe the resumption of exports to Japan will benefit the overall industry in the United States, including New Mexico," Domenici said.
   Japan has agreed to open its market to a select list of U.S. meat exporters, and will only accept beef form cattle 20 months of age or younger.
   "The U.S. Trade Representative should continue to work with the Japanese government to broaden the standards for the American beef Japan will accept," Domenici said.
   The Japanese government first blocked American beef products from entering the country's markets upon the discovery of a single U.S. case of BSE in December 2003. Commonly known as "mad cow disease," BSE is a chronic degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system of cattle.
