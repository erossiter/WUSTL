SEN. DOMENICI REACTS TO JUSTICE DEPT. LIABILITY ESTIMATE ON AAMODT WATER SETTLEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the recent declaration by the Department of Justice (DOJ) that federal liability on the Aamodt settlement will near $11 million:  
   "The $11 million figure from the Justice Department is a little less than I anticipated. But frankly, at no point did I think the federal government would in the end be liable for some of the very large amounts that have been suggested. That is why I asked the Department of Justice to look at this. 
   "This just shows what a tough hill we have to climb with Aamodt and the other pending settlements in NM--many of which will run into the same problem. This also increases the need for people at the state and local levels to really look at how much they will have to contribute toward these settlements. 
   "This new estimate will make getting an Aamodt settlement harder, but I will do what I can to aid the process. I will plan hearings when a settlement is reached and turned into legislation. It is my sincere hope that the parties can reach an agreement on this long-standing conflict. I am awaiting a decision by Judge Vasquez in March to assess if it is appropriate for congress to move forward on the matter." 
   The Aamodt case, filed in 1966, is presently the longest-standing case in the federal court system and has been in court-ordered mediation since 2000. The Interior Department is also a party to the Aamodt suit. 
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has dedicated extensive staff resources toward aiding the parties in concluding a settlement on the Aamodt case. The New Mexico lawmaker also serves on the Senate appropriations committees with funding jurisdiction over the Interior Department and other federal water projects.
