SEN. DOMENICI: 25 NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES GET HOMELAND SECURITY EQUIPMENT GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded grants to law enforcement agencies and fire departments in 25 New Mexico communities to support the purchase of new equipment. 
   The state will receive more than $450,000 in DHS Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP) funding.
   "Our local emergency responders need up-to-date equipment to do their jobs properly. They not only need to purchase this equipment, but they also need the proper training to ensure that this new equipment is used to its full capacity," Domenici said.
   The DHS funds will be divided for direct equipment purchases, testing and validation of available technology, training, workshops, administration and evaluation.
   Domenici serves on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding for programs such as CEDAP.
