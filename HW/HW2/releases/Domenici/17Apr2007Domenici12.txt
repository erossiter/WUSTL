SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR YOUTH DEVELOPMENT HEAD START PROJECT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that Youth Development, Inc. (YDI), located in Albuquerque, has been awarded a $5.8 million grant by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its Head Start Project.  
   The grant will fund a program that serves 1,660 children in the tri-county area of Bernalillo, Taos, and Rio Arriba counties. Children from six weeks to five years of age receive high quality care, with emphases not only on education, but also social, emotional, and physical development. 
   "The money awarded to YDI is vital to the development and growth of the children and families that benefit from its Head Start program", said Domenici. "There is great potential in these children and it is important that they receive the best possible care to help ensure their future success." 
   YDI's Head Start Program is unique due to its focus on parental involvement which incorporates on-going parent training with goal development. YDI was founded in 1971 and works to improve the livelihood of New Mexico's youth. Approximately 20,000 people benefit from its services each year. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee which determines funding for federal programs, including those administered by the Department of Housing and Human Services.
