SEN. DOMENICI REQUEST RESULTS IN FED TRAILER DONATION TO SUPPORT SOCORRO EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN
 Sen. Pete Domenici today said he is pleased the federal government has agreed to donate an excess trailer to the Socorro Amateur Radio Association (SARA), a move he endorsed in a March letter to the National Science Foundation.  
   The NSF has informed Domenici that it has authorized the transfer of the trailer, surplus government property used at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), to the amateur radio group. The trailer is expected to be used to support the Socorro County emergency operations plan. NRAO had been advised earlier by NSF that it should sell the trailer through a public auction. 
   "This donation just makes sense. It can be put to good use locally to support emergency preparedness efforts," Domenici said. "I appreciate the National Science Foundation agreeing to approve this donation." 
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the NSF, asked the federal agency to approve the donation after being made aware of the possibility by Socorro County Commissioner Rosalind Tripp. SARA, with the county emergency preparedness organization, is in the process of implementing a mobile emergency communications system. The surplus NRAO trailer, build in 1985, should be used for this system. 
   NRAO operates a variety of facilities in Socorro County, including the Array Operations Center, Very Large Array, Very Long Baseline Array, Extended Very Large Array and the ALMA Test Facility.
