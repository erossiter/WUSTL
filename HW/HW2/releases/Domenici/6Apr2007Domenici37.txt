SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT JERRY MURPHY OF ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the death of Raymond "Jerry" Murphy of Albuquerque, a Korean War veteran who earned the Medal of Honor and for whom the Senator is attempting to name the Albuquerque Veterans Administration Medical Center for.  
   "Jerry Murphy was a brave and true man whose life was unquestionably dedicated to this nation and the men and women who have fought to protect it. I am saddened by his loss, and offer my condolences to his family. I truly regret that our legislation to name the Albuquerque VA hospital in his honor did not happen before his passing. But I have every confidence that it will get done." 
   In January, Domenici introduced legislation, cosponsored by U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman, to designate the Albuquerque VA facility as the "Raymond G. Murphy Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center." The legislation is supported by the VA Department as well as the New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services. 
   Murphy retired in 1997 from a 23-year career as director of Veterans Services in the Albuquerque VA Regional Office, and became a volunteer at the VA afterward. 
   Murphy is one of fewer than 3,500 Americans who have ever been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was given the honor following his heroic actions Korea in February 1953, when as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps he organized and led--against orders--a daring mission to rescue wounded Marines pinned down by enemy fire on Ungok Hill. He was wounded himself, but refused treatment until all his fellow Marines were accounted for and treated. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Murphy also earned a Silver Star for bravery in 1952.
