SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LANL CONTRACT SPECULATION
  In response to recent speculation regarding the effect of the upcoming presidential election on the bidding process at Los Alamos National Laboratories, Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement: 
   "I am troubled by recent rumors and news reports indicating that the presidential election will play a role in determining who the next manager of Los Alamos National Laboratory is. These rumors have no basis in fact and are merely a political attempt to sway voters.
   "The competition to run Los Alamos will not be affected by the presidential election. I fully expect the Department of Energy to conduct a full and open process to select a manager. DOE will fully comply with all federal procurement rules through the course of the competition.
   "I'm very proud of the relationship between Los Alamos and the University of California. It has been very good for our country, and especially for the men and women at the lab. Throughout the tenure in the Senate, the Los Alamos contract has been extended numerous times and political pressure has never worked to the detriment of the LANL.
   "Most importantly to the people of Los Alamos, I expect the Department to ensure that the jobs and retirement benefits of the lab employees are protected. In fact, DOE Secretary Abraham has made a point of emphasizing that these jobs and benefits will be protected.
   "Federal law requires the process to select a manager to be open and thorough. I am committed to this process, and will be watching carefully to make sure it happens. But the employees of Los Alamos should know that despite attempts to scare them, presidential politics will not be a factor in determining who runs the lab."
   Domenici on Monday will be visit Los Alamos on Monday to address lab employees and meet with lab officials.
