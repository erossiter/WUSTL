SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $7.7 MILLION CONTRACT TO ALBUQUERQUE FIRM FOR WORK ON LANDMINE DETECTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that an Albuquerque company has been awarded a $7.7 million contract to carry out landmine detection work for the U.S. Army.  
   Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque has been awarded the contract to develop new technologies for the Force Protection De-mining System. The system uses robotics to disarm and remove unexploded munitions. 
   "Landmines are a threat to our armed forces. They linger long after peace is established and often times harm the innocent and unaware. Areas all over the world are plagued with landmines, including regions where our troops are now deployed. I am pleased that an Albuquerque company will undertake this important work," Domenici said. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee who has secured $100 million in New Mexico-related funding within the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill that was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee Wednesday. 
   Applied Research Associates will receive $3.44 million from the Army in the initial award with the $4.27 million to follow in subsequent actions. The estimated contract completion date is March 2008, and all work will be performed in Albuquerque. 
   The work to be carried out by ARA would entail developing and evaluating landmine detectors and neutralizers for integration into the Army=s All-Purpose Remote Transport System platform. 
   Domenici also recently announced another Albuquerque small business garnering a $12.0 million Army contract. Applied Technology Associates will help in the research and development of cargo planes capable of conducting in-flight experiments.
