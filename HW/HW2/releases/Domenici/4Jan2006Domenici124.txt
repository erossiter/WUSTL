SEN. DOMENICI: ROSWELL FIRE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES $55,966 HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Roswell Fire Department has been awarded a $55,966 grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to augment its public safety mission.  
   Domenici, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said the grant was awarded through the Operations and Firefighter Safety Program. The funding can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, fitness activities, and facility modifications. 
   "This grant is meant to supplement the Roswell Fire Department's own budget and increase its overall effectiveness in protecting the city. I am glad to see the Roswell department get this grant," Domenici said. 
   The grant requires a 10 percent non-federal funding match. 
   Domenici noted that the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill provided $3.3 billion for first responders, including grants for firefighters and emergency management. The bill provided $655 million for firefighter grants, as well as $550 million for basic formula grants, $400 million for state and local law enforcement terrorism prevention grants, and $185 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants.
