SEN. DOMENICI REMEMBERS HARRY KINNEY, LONG-TIME FRIEND, FORMER ALBUQUERQUE MAYOR
  Sen. Pete Domenici today lamented the death of his long-time friend and ally, Harry Kinney, a former Albuquerque mayor and Bernalillo County commissioner.  
   "I can hardly believe that there will be an Albuquerque without Harry Kinney. He was involved in more good things that happened to the city of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County than any other single human being that I'm aware of. 
   "To have met him, and had him as part of my first race for public office in 1966, was one of the most important occasions of my life. I was privileged to be elected and serve with him on the Albuquerque city council and to find out what a true public servant he was. Harry knew more about city and county government than any other person around, and all that he shared openly with me to make me feel better, learn quicker and serve better. 
   "All the years thereafter, I have never known a more honest, forthright, and reputable and involved public person. 
   "My family and I will miss him. My wife Nancy and I can't say enough good things about him. He was an invaluable friend who helped us settle into our home with all eight children after I was elected to the Senate. I will always be grateful to Harry for everything he has meant to me and my family." 
   Kinney, who has known Domenici since the future Senator was in high school, had been a Bernalillo County Commissioner when Domenici approached him in the late 1960s to be part of a team running for Albuquerque City Commission positions. The Domenici team won and in a single term managed to change the face of Albuquerque. 
   Kinney, who went on to become Albuquerque's mayor himself, had remained friends with Domenici and his family since.
