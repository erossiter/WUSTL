NEW MEXICO HEALTH DEPARTMENT RECEIVES $3.48 MILLION IN RYAN WHITE AIDS/HIV GRANT FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $3,489,677 to the New Mexico Department of Health for HIV/AIDS related services.  
   The Ryan White AIDS grant was issued through the HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the federal agency responsible for ensuring the quality and accessibility of health care. 
   "I am pleased to see that New Mexico will have the funding needed to care for those dealing with HIV/AIDS in the state. As this disease continues to touch a greater number of individuals in underserved and rural areas, we must remain vigilant in our efforts to help those affected while persisting in the search for a cure," said Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   The nearly $3.5 million dollars in federal funding from the Ryan White Title II Formula Grants Program of the HAB will be used for activities such as ambulatory health care, home-based health care, insurance coverage, outreach to HIV-positive individuals, early intervention services, and HIV Care Consortia assessment of needs and services. 
   The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act was signed into law on Aug. 15, 1990 to improve the quality and availability of care for people with HIV/AIDS and their families. Title II grants are awarded to states using a formula that, historically, has been based on reported AIDS cases. 
   CARE Act provisions require that states with more than one percent of total AIDS cases reported in the United States during the previous two years must contribute a match with their own resources, according to a formula outlined in the legislation.
