SEN. DOMENICI, TREASURY SECRETARY PAULSON MEET, DISCUSS DROP IN FEDERAL DEFICIT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today visited with Henry Paulson, sworn in Monday as the new Treasury Secretary, and discussed the promising news that the federal budget deficit is falling faster than projected. 
   The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced Tuesday that this year's federal budget deficit is now forecast to be $296 billion-a $127 billion or 30 percent decline from the administration's $423 billion forecast in February.
   "Secretary Paulson is very knowledgeable about the financial markets and how our economy works. He understands how important it is that we continue to grow the economy, which can ultimately be one of the best deficit-reduction mechanisms we have," said Domenici, former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   "Continuing to expand the economy at a steady rate and continuing to move back toward balanced budgets means continuing pro-growth policies that are good for families and business alike," he said.
   OMB attributed the cut in the deficit, which now amounts to about 2.3 percent of the GDP, to a surge in revenues. Revenues grew 14.5 percent last year and are forecast to grow by $245 billion, or 11.4 percent.
   Last week, Domenici welcomed news from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an agency within the U.S. Department of Labor, that 121,000 new non-agriculture jobs were created nationally in June. With these jobs, the U.S. economy has helped produce more than 1.85 million new positions over the past year, while unemployment rates held steady at 4.6 percent.
