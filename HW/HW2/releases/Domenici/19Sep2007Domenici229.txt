EASTERN NEW MEXICO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RECEIVES HUD GRANT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Eastern Plains Housing Development Corp., which is based in Clovis, will benefit from a $67,464 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
   Funds were awarded as part of HUD's Section 202 Demonstration Planning Grant Program and will assist the corporation as it pursues elderly housing projects in eastern New Mexico. 
   "The Eastern Plains Housing Development Corporation provides multiple housing opportunities throughout eastern New Mexico," said Domenici. "These funds will help the group as it continues its work on behalf of elderly residents in this part of the state." 
   HUD's Section 202 Demonstration Planning Grant Program provides predevelopment grant funding for architectural and engineering work, site control, and other planning related expenses. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, which helps determine federal funding for HUD programs.
