SEN. DOMENICI REVIEWS IMPROVEMENTS TO ROSWELL BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB
  Sen. Pete Domenici today visited with local children benefiting from the educational and after-school programs provided by Roswell Boys and Girls Club as he toured the recent improvements to the center.  
   As a major advocate of the Boys and Girls Club program, Domenici was on-hand today to observe growth and additions to the Roswell facility. Domenici last visited the club to present a $50,000 check to support the center. 
   "This club, and others like it around New Mexico, serves as a safe place for kids away from the streets and empty homes. The invaluable interaction found at the Boys and Girls Club teaches lessons of responsibility and citizenship that help our kids avoid going down the wrong paths," Domenici said. 
   "I am glad to see the Roswell club prosper with its doors opened wide for all who need it. I hope we continue to celebrate the good that these clubs contribute to our communities," he added. 
   Domenici secured $85 million for Boys and Girls Clubs nationally as a member of the subcommittee that drafted the FY2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill. 
   Last year, Domenici cosponsored a measure that extended funding authorization to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America through 2010 to keep its federal funding viable. The lawmaker also authored the 1995 amendment that first made the clubs eligible to receive Department of Justice funding. 
   The Roswell Boys and Girls Club is one of many clubs in communities around the state, including 17 clubs serving specifically American Indian youth, which serve 41,000 children in New Mexico. The clubs provide and organize various activities for at risk youth, including sports, arts and crafts, and computer literacy and job training.
