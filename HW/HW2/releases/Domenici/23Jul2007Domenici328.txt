NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO STUDENTS PLAN CHARACTER COUNTS SALUTE, PROGRAM TO BE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE ONLINE
  Student athletes from northwest New Mexico will gather in Farmington Aug. 21 to show U.S. Senator Pete Domenici the Character Counts lessons they've learned through the New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA) "Pursuing Victory with Honor" program.  
   The students will join Domenici for a workshop and rally that is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., Tuesday, Aug. 21, at Farmington High School. NMAA will feature live streaming video, and students around the state can view the celebration at www.nmact.org. 
   "I am delighted to help kick off the school year with young people from Farmington, Aztec, Bloomfield, Dulce, Kirtland, Navajo Prep and Shiprock," Domenici said. "I am excited that students from around the state can learn more about Character Counts by using the web to view this rally and workshop." 
   Domenici is a national sponsor of Character Counts. The NMAA "Pursing Victory with Honor" is a sportsmanship program that helps students and adults use the pillars of Character Counts--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship--in their behavior on and off the field and in the classroom. 
   The NMAA has taken "Pursuing Victory with Honor" training to students, athletic directors and coaches in every state school district. The Aug. 21 back to school event will help Domenici witness some of the results of the Character Counts education initiative he has promoted since 1994. 
   "Character Counts is building the self esteem of our young people across New Mexico, and helping us achieve the life-long benefits of learning to do the right thing," Domenici said.
