SEN. DOMENICI'S 'ACCESS' RADIO SHOW-QUESTIONS & ANSWERS WITH NEW MEXICO RADIO JOURNALISTS, APRIL 14
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici recorded his "ACCESS" radio news conference Monday, April 14, 2008. 
   PARTICIPANTS:
   * John McBreen, KYVA Gallup
   * Gillian Sutton, KRSN Los Alamos
   * Mike Jaxson, KSVP Artesia
   TOPICS:
   * Funding the Navajo-Gallup Water Project
   * Extending Tax Credits for Clean Energy Development
   * Goals for Recycling Nuclear Waste
   * Housing Crisis Remedies
   * LANL Cleanup Funding Shortfall
   * Successful WIPP Project
   REVIEW:
   00:00 Domenici says he and Senator Bingaman are focused on how to secure the funding, including offsets, for the Navajo-Gallup water project. He says he is working with Senator Grassley of the Senate Finance Committee on offsets. He speculates that if the funding issue can be resolved, Navajo-Gallup water legislation could be enacted this year.
   02:07 Domenici says the debate over renewing federal tax incentives for clean energy has focused on the length of the tax credit extensions and how to pay for them. He notes the objections to paying for the tax credits by taxing other energy sources. He says there is still a risk of a "fiasco" if the House of Representatives demands a renewable energy tax plan that is largely different from the Senate-passed plan he cosponsored.
   04:25 Domenici explains the broad goals of legislation he is writing to advance nuclear waste recycling as a means to fuel new nuclear power plants. He stresses that the recycling costs are "clearly payable by the users or out of the [Nuclear Waste] Trust Fund." He says his legislation would not specify sites for any future temporary waste storage areas or recycling facilities. He predicts, however, that there are communities around the country that would welcome these facilities, which would not be much different from recycling operations in nations like France.
   09:24 Domenici notes his vote for Senate legislation to address the housing crisis facing the nation. He says the foreclosure problems are serious, although the problem has not hit New Mexico as severely as some other states.
   11:36 Domenici says it will be important for the Department of Energy and the state of New Mexico to work out the environmental cleanup work needed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He notes an expected $100 million shortfall in FY2009, and says realistic assessments should be made of the cleanup projects to determine which cleanup milestones are most critical.
   14:12 Domenici says that the celebration to mark the 100,000 container of defense transuranic (TRU) waste at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant belies some of the doubt that some people had when WIPP was proposed and being built. He says he knew that once WIPP opened that the facility would work well as a stable repository for TRU waste.
