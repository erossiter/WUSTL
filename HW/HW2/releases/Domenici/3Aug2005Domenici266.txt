SEN. DOMENICI: EFFORTS ON PECOS RIVER ADDRESS WESTERN WATER SCARCITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded federal grant funding issued to New Mexico by the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a water conservation project that will help monitor the stretched waters of the Pecos River.  
   New Mexico was selected along with five other Western states to receive funds through the Water 2025 Challenge Grant Program. The program supports state projects that find innovative ways to address pressing water shortages. 
   Domenici is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Bureau of Reclamation and its programs, including the Water 2025 initiative. The program will contribute $59,480 toward the $146,660 overall cost of the project. 
   "The Pecos River has been stretched to its limits as a provider to New Mexico and Texas and as a victim of the parasitic salt cedar. The strain of recent droughts and the Pecos River Compact may soon lead us straight into a water crisis," Domenici said. "But projects like this one help tally every last drop of water leaving the Pecos so that one day down the road we will not find ourselves depleted with no where else to turn." 
   The state of New Mexico will use the 50-50 cost share grant to rehabilitate a streamflow gage on the Pecos River to better measure water under high flow conditions. This project will be critical in ensuring accurate water delivery to Texas. 
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici helped secure $1.08 billion in the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, which is $63.5 million over last year, for the Bureau of Reclamation that manages Water 2025 projects.
