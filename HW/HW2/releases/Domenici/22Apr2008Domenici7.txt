SEN. DOMENICI: FAA AWARDS GRANTS FOR FT. SUMNER, RUIDOSO & TORC AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that airports in Fort Sumner, Ruidoso and Truth or Consequences will benefit from over $394,000 in grant funding released today by the Department of Transportation (DOT). 
   Funds will be distributed through the DOT's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and will be used to renovate and rehabilitate airport facilities in the respective communities.
   "These FAA funds help smaller communities improve the quality and function of their airport facilities, which is important for the area's economy," said Domenici. "I'm pleased the FAA has chosen to provide funds to these New Mexico communities as it will help them make needed improvements to their airports."
   The Village of Fort Sumner was awarded $246,643 to rehabilitate the apron at Fort Sumner Municipal Airport.
   The Sierra Blanca Airport Commission in Ruidoso received $88,000 for a new taxiway and markings, access gates, as well as replacement firefighter protective gear.
   Truth or Consequences was awarded $60,000 for a new Master Plan, that is expected to provide the city with full information on the existing, short and long-term airport needs.
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and serves on the subcommittee that determines federal funding for the DOT and the FAA.
