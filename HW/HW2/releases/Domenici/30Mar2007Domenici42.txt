SEN. DOMENICI TO JOIN 'HEART OF BELEN' CELEBRATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici will be in Belen Saturday to join the community for a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the "Heart of Belen" downtown revitalization project.  
   Domenici is scheduled to give remarks at a ceremony that will be led by Belen Mayor Ronnie Torres and involve Valencia County and municipal officials and civil leaders. The event will mark the opening of Belen's fifth annual Mardi Gras and Spring Fest, an annual arts and crafts festival in Becker Park and downtown. 
   "I look forward to being in Belen to celebrate the city's embrace of the future while strengthening links to its history. This is a growing community, and its leaders and residents deserve credit for preserving its small town charm and values while being proactive in fostering smart economic growth," Domenici said. 
   The "Heart of Belen" project has been a multi-year effort by the community to revitalize its older town areas, including the routes to the rail yards that were established a century ago. The revitalization project on Main and Becker streets has been designed to entice more people to Belen.
