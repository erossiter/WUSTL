SEN. DOMENICI: RAYTHEON FARMINGTON PLANT TO SHARE IN ARMY CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Army has extended its contract with Raytheon Missile Systems with a portion of the work to be completed in its Farmington facility. 
   The Farmington plant will conduct 1 percent of the contracted work with its portion estimated at almost $430,000. The contract will produce the XM982 Excalibur Unitary, which is part of the family of precision-guided, extended-range modular projectiles.
   "The Raytheon facility in Farmington has the opportunity to help produce the artillery needed by our military. The Farmington facility has proven to be an important part of defense contract production and I am confident that they will continue to provide a high quality of work," Domenici said.
   The contract will be divided between 16 different facilities. The majority of the work will be completed in Tucson, Ariz. The total award of this contract is worth $42.7 million and is expected to be completed by Sept. 30, 2007. In all, this contract with Raytheon Missile Systems is worth a cumulative $499 million.
   The Raytheon facility in Farmington assists with other defense contracts, including a Navy contract to produce Standard Missile-2 missiles. Domenici last toured the facility in 2000.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding for defense projects.
