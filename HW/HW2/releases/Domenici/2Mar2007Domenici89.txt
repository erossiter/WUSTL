SEN. DOMENICI INTRODUCES BILL TO AUTHORIZE KIRTLAND AFB FUEL FACILITY REPLACEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today introduced a bill to authorize $1.8 million to replace a fuel unloading facility at Kirtland Air Force Base at Albuquerque.  
   Domenici, joined by original cosponsor Senator Jeff Bingaman, offered the legislation in advance of FY2008 defense authorization and appropriations bills to stress the importance of the military construction project to Kirtland. 
   The $1.8 million facility is needed to replace an existing facility that is inadequate for supporting the multiple missions and programs now at Kirtland. The bill would authorize funds for a new fuel truck unload facility that is up to par with environmental and safety standards at the base. 
   "Kirtland officials have indicated that the existing facility poses environmental and safety hazards. Therefore, it is important that a new facility be constructed to ensure safer, more efficient operations," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "This new fueling station would replace the temporary one in use, which doesn't meet safety and environmental standards. This is an important project and we need to get Congress on record supporting it," Bingaman said. 
   The existing fuel truck unloading facility closed due to leaking, corroded underground piping, necessitating a temporary structure which is now in place. KAFB has cited several environmental and safety hazards related to the current facility, including absence of a properly grounded electrical system, fuel pump flow switches, and emergency escape routes for tank trucks. In addition, the current system causes delays in issuing fuels to the flightline and all maintenance must be delayed during operations.
