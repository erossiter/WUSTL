HUD RELEASES SEN. DOMENICI-SECURED FUNDS FOR ALBUQUERQUE-AREA HOUSING FOR MENTALLY ILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has released the $742,500 he secured to help the Albuquerque Mental Health Housing Coalition, Inc. provide housing for veterans and mentally ill. 
   The funding was provided as part of Domenici's successful effort to secure FY2006 HUD funding. The HUD grant will be used to purchase and renovate the 84-unit Sunport Plaza apartment complex that will be utilized mostly by homeless veterans and mentally ill and will also provide supportive services to its occupants.
   "Providing housing facilities to a section of the population that truly needs it is very important work. There is a large population of homeless that suffer from mental illness or are veterans of war and I will work to ensure that funds continue to support these individuals," Domenici said.
   Occupants of the new facility will accepted by referrals made by the five due paying agencies that make up the Albuquerque Mental Health Housing Coalition, Inc. including St. Martin's Hospitality Center, Transitional Living Services, Albuquerque Healthcare for Homeless, University of New Mexico Psychiatric Center and Veterans Medical Center.
   The HUD grant was made available through the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) program. Domenici serves as the Senate Appropriations Committee which designates funding for HUD and its programs.
