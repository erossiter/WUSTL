SEN. DOMENICI: EPA WATERSHED RESTORATION GRANT FUNDING AVAILABLE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged entities in New Mexico--including the state, tribes and watershed organizations--to consider applying for watershed protection grant funds being offered by the Environmental Protection Agency.  
   EPA has up to $19 million available through its Targeted Watersheds Grant Program to support preservation, protection, education and training activities associated with protecting lands that drain into rivers, streams and lakes. The grants are awarded under with the federal Clean Water Act. 
   Created in 2003, the grant program has been applied to the Rio Puerco watershed. New Mexico is also one of six states participating in the Watershed Support Network that has used public-private collaboration for watershed activities on in the Gallinas and Rio Grande tributaries. 
   "Better care of riparian areas is necessary for the best management of water as a resource and for optimum protection of ecosystems. This is true both in times of drought and deluges, like we're seeing in New Mexico this summer," Domenici said. "These grants are intended to foster greater public involvement in watershed protection work, and I believe there should be plenty of interest in state for taking part in these activities." 
   An Oct. 15 application deadline is set for "capacity-building" grants that are intended to improve watershed restoration through education and training. 
   A Nov. 15 deadline is set for "implementation" grants that involve on-the-ground preservation and protection activities. 
   In New Mexico, watershed protection is overseen by the state Environment Department's Watershed Protection Section.
