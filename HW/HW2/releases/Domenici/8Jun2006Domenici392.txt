SEN. DOMENICI: DEATH TAX AGAIN GETS REPRIEVE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today voted to move forward on legislation to permanently repeal the federal death tax, but the measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to allow the Senate to fully debate the bill. 
   The Senate debate on the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act (HR.8) was stopped after the Senate came three votes shy of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster. The Senate vote that ended the debate was 57-41. The measure was passed in April 2005 by the House of Representatives, 272-162.
   "I support the permanent repeal of the death tax, which can be called the most confiscatory tax of all. I believe it is unfair and too often causes heirs to liquidate small businesses, family farms and ranches just to meet the demands of this tax," Domenici said.
   "I'm disappointed with this vote, but remain hopeful that Congress might still act to ease the burden of this federal tax. As it stands now, the death tax has been given a reprieve from the death sentence that should be imposed," he said.
   In 2004, about 220 estate tax returns were filed from New Mexico, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Of those New Mexico returns, about 100 were taxable and heirs paid $57.5 million to the federal government.
   Overall in the United States in 2004, 62,718 estate tax returns were filed on which $21.5 billion was collected from 30,276 of those returns. Of those taxable returns, a large majority-26,782-were from estates worth $5.0 million or less.
   "The opponents of the death tax repeal like to solely focus on the mega-billionaires in this country. But the fact that the IRS collects mostly from estates worth $5.0 million or less is in my mind a clear indication that this onerous tax is hitting people who spent their lives building up a small business to support their families," Domenici said.
   Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with a complete phase-out of the federal death tax by 2010, but the repeal sunsets after one year. So without Congressional action, the death tax will be fully reinstated in 2011.
