SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO PROCEED ON FY07 SPENDING BILL TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined the Senate to end debate and move forward with a spending plan to fund the government through the remainder of FY2007.  
   With a 71-26 vote, the Senate today invoked cloture on H.J.Res.20, the Continuing Resolution to fund most government agencies through FY2007. With today's action, the Senate will engage in up to 30 hours of debate leading up to a vote expected by Thursday, when the current funding measure expires. 
   "As I have made clear, I am not at all pleased that Congress has chosen to punt on its responsibilities to fully fund the federal government during this fiscal year. With the deadline for a government shutdown looming, I have come to the conclusion that there is no other alternative but to proceed with this bill and keep the government operating," Domenici said. 
   "During this year, agencies will have broad discretion over the distribution of funding provided in the Continuing Resolution. While it is not yet known how agencies will distribute that funding, my office will do all that it can to help should money be available that could have a positive impact on New Mexico programs," he continued. 
   Under the Continuing Resolution, all earmarks secured by members of Congress are eliminated. For New Mexico projects, Domenici had gained more than $75 million, including the dialysis center in Gallup, the cotton gin laboratory at New Mexico State University, the emergency room at Saint Vincent Medical Center in Santa Fe, the Valles Caldera National Preserve, and many others.
