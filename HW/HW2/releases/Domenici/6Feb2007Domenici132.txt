NSF FUNDS NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH ON EARTH'S CORE
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the National Science Foundation has awarded $228,087 to New Mexico State University to be used for experimental efforts in understanding properties of Earth and planetary materials.  
   The grant will fund NMSU's project "Elasticity and the Chemistry of the Earth's Inner Core." Researchers will address problems facing the chemistry of the Earth's and planetary interiors. The result of simulations will advance our understanding of properties of metallic planetary cores in general and the Earth's core in particular. Students will utilize their ideas and techniques from computational material sciences. 
   "I believe that science offers answers to so many challenging problems our world faces," said Domenici. "I am happy NMSU students will have this grant funding to address their education. I want to keep New Mexico at the forefront in scientific research and education; and I know the money for this project will help with that." 
   Domenici is a long-time proponent of education in subject areas associated with science and technology and has supported measures that focus federal attention and funding on them. New Mexico State University also recently received NSF money to support research programs such as "Stone Age to Space Age--Southern New Mexico Academies for Young Scientists."
