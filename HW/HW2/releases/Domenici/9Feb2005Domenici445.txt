SEN. DOMENICI WELCOMES TEXAS TECH TO SANDIA NATIONAL LABS RESEARCH TEAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised a new agreement between Sandia National Laboratories and Texas Tech University that could lead towards new collaborations on water desalination research.  
   Texas Tech's agreement is focused on six research areas: pulsed power, water desalination, wind energy, polymer science, nanotechnology and micro-electro mechanical systems. Sandia works with 22 universities in the nation, including the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State, and New Mexico Tech. 
   "I am a firm believer in developing technology that will provide long term solutions to the water crisis that we have in New Mexico. Desalination is one of the most promising avenues, so I'm pleased that Texas Tech will become part of the Sandia team," Domenici said. 
   Within the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Act, Domenici secured $11.5 million in third-year funding to advance the Navy's water desalination program in Otero County, which also involves Sandia and the Bureau of Reclamation. Domenici gained $5.6 million in FY2004 and $6 million in FY2003 for this project, which will develop high efficiency, compact technology to help alleviate the significant logistical load for transporting water. Ground was broken last June for the Expeditionary Warfare Water Purification program in Otero County. 
   Desalination is also proving valuable to the military and to areas that are the victims of natural disasters. The technology can be used to make contaminated water drinkable.
