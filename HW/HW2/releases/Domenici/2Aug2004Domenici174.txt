USDA GRANT WILL HELP BUILD SAN JON VILLAGE HALL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the village of San Jon has been awarded an $80,000 grant to support construction of a village hall for this rural Quay County community.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Community Facility Grant funding has been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   "I am very pleased with this USDA investment to give San Jon a facility to carry out the basic needs of this small municipality," Domenici said. "Many rural communities often do not have the resources to build necessary public facilities. This USDA Rural Development grant program is designed to help villages, like San Jon, meet those needs." 
   The USDA Rural Development grant funds will be used to support construction of a 2,000-sqaure-foot village hall that will house the village council chambers, in addition to magistrate and municipal courts.
