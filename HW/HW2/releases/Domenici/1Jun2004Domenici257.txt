SEN. DOMENICI PUSH SUCCESSFUL, FOREST SERVICE TO MOVE 400 WORKERS TO ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Forest Service will move at least 400 professional federal employees to Albuquerque, which was chosen over 18 other cities to host federal workers.  
   Domenici had lobbied Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman and other Forest Service officials to select his hometown. On Tuesday, the Senator confirmed that Albuquerque had been selected. With the decision, the Forest Service will move its entire consolidated budget and accounting operations to Albuquerque. 
   "I couldn't be happier that Albuquerque will get this employment boost. We won out over a number of serious contenders and we should be proud of that. These will be very good jobs and their impact on our overall economy will be significant," Domenici said. 
   The Consolidated Financial Services Center will provide budget and accounting services for the entire Forest Service in one facility. Beyond the 400 professional jobs, the Forest Service is also expected to hire an unspecified number of support service employees. 
   "Our selection is particularly gratifying after the recent news that the city would be losing about 800 call center jobs. The loss of that many jobs is serious, but I am pleased that disappointing news is now counterbalanced with these Forest Service jobs," he said. 
   Domenici said the Forest Service will now begin the process of relocating workers associated with its budget and accounting work to the Duke City. The goal is to have the employees in place and working by fall. 
   In finding a host city, the Forest Service considered such factors as: labor pool (diversity, skill, education), socio-economic (tax rates, labor productivity), infrastructure (office space, transportation and telecommunications), and quality of life (housing costs and cost of living).
