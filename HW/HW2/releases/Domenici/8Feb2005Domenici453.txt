SEN. DOMENICI APPAUDS AWARD OF TWO NASA SPACE RESEARCH GRANTS TO LANL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Los Alamos National Laboratory is the recipient of two grant awards from NASA to research opportunities in space science.  
   Domenici serves on the Veterans' Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies (VA/HUD) Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for NASA. LANL received two of the 24 grants issued from over 172 proposals accepted. 
   "In a tight budget climate it's great news to still see funding continually channeled into New Mexico's labs, further entrenching them as premier science and technology centers," Domenici said. 
   "LANL is well-diversified in its capabilities and takes on projects from space exploration to plutonium research with dynamism and precision. I am pleased to see LANL receive two grants as well as the funding set aside in the President's budget and I applaud their continued success," he said. 
   LANL will receive $388,397 to study Low-Energy Solar Electron Bursts, while Space and Atmospheric Sciences at LANL will receive $330,300 for the proposal Verifying, Refining, and Extending the Two-Component Analysis of Solar-Wind Turbulence: The Maltese Cross. 
   Both projects will compliment NASA's Sun-Earth Connection Guest Investigator Program (SECGIP) that aims to maximize returned space missions by providing support for broader and more complex research studies. Grants are generally funded for one to three years. 
   The President's FY2006 budget, released Monday, recommends a total of $3.2 billion for NASA exploration programs, including $320 million for the space nuclear program to develop power sources for space exploration. The programs deferred were Project Prometheus and the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter that would launch in 2015 or later. Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories have long been involved with NASA for the nuclear propulsion and deep space exploration programs.
