SEN. DOMENICI: $100 MILLION ARMY CONTRACT SECURED BY LAS CRUCES-BASED EMI TECHNOLOGIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today commended the Department of the Army for finalizing a contract worth $100 million for a company headquartered in Las Cruces. 
   EMI Technologies, Inc. in Las Cruces was selected for the Army contract to furbish vans and trailers with high-tech equipment.
   "This is big news for Las Cruces and for EMI Technologies. Such a huge award gives this small business a multi-million dollar, five year contract with the U.S. Army to provide several trailers equipped with the newest technology," Domenici said. "I am very pleased EMI Technologies has secured this funding to bring long-term work to the Las Cruces area."
   The Army contract is for the manufacturing of general purpose instrumentation vans, shelters and trailers. This includes the integration and installation of instrumentation and equipment, and the modification and refurbishment of used trailers and shelters.
   Founded in 1985 as a mechanical and electrical engineering, consulting, and fabrication services company, EMI has completed over 300 custom built vehicles. The technical staff has over 100 years combined experience in engineering design and fabrication of electronic instrumentation vans, shelters, trailers and other transportable systems.
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for Army programs.
