SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $8.7 MILLION FOR PUBLIC HOUSING IN N.M.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that 37 New Mexico communities have been awarded over $8.7 million in federal funding to help modernize public housing.  
   The funding was awarded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Capital Fund Program (CFP), which provides grants for modernization and management improvements of public housing agencies. 
   "The Capital Fund program provides communities throughout New Mexico with the funds needed to improve infrastructure, making public housing safer and more enjoyable for everyone," Domenici said. "I am very pleased New Mexico has gained over $8.7 million to improve our housing system." 
   The CFP grant funding will provide assistance to improve the physical condition of existing public housing developments, and upgrade the management and operation of these developments to assure continued availability and service to low-income families.
