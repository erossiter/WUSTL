SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States:  
   "Six years ago, we experienced an unprecedented level of hostility and violence against our nation and its people when terrorists came to our country and attacked us. The act was in defiance of a culture of freedom, and a direct affront to the democracy and independence our nation enjoys. 
   "We will neither forget the lives that were tragically lost that day, nor the lessons our nation has been forced to learn in the years since. The September 11th attacks changed our world, and its consequences impact the lives of Americans still. I am proud of the progress this nation has made to make the United States safer. A lot of these efforts are being made in New Mexico--at the national labs, FLETC and the Playas training complex. In addition, so many New Mexicans are part of our homeland security work through the National Guard and our Armed Forces. 
   "Although the Islamic extremists behind the attacks sought to break our will and erode our freedom, they were unsuccessful on both fronts. Our liberty is dearer to us now, and we are reminded of that each day, as our nation's Armed Forces continue the war against terror that these terrorists waged on us six years ago. 
   "On this sixth anniversary, I remember the lives of the thousands of Americans that were lost on September 11th. I continue to offer my prayers and support to the families who still ache with the absence of loved ones who were killed that day. 
   "I thank the men and women, many of whom took up the fight against terrorism after the September 11th attacks, for their service, bravery, and sacrifices. I join all New Mexicans in honoring those lost and those fighting so that we can live in safety today and in enduring freedom into the future."
