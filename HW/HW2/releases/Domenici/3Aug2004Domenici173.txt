SEN. DOMENICI: SAN ANTONIO WATER ASSOCIATION GETS FUNDING TO IMPROVE WATER SYSTEM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the San Antonio Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association (MDWCA) in Socorro County has been awarded federal funding to upgrade its water delivery system.  
   Domenici said the San Antonio cooperative is receiving a $495,881 grant and a $606,076 low-interest loan from the Rural Business Opportunity Grant and Loan program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   "The residents in the San Antonio region of Socorro County have been in need of these funds for some time," Domenici said. "I am glad to see that despite all the water problems New Mexicans face, there is some help in the struggle for deserving areas." 
   The funding is intended to upgrade the existing water system by replacing the water distribution mains and isolation valves, fire hydrants and related equipment in the northern part of the system. The project will also rehabilitate the Luis Lopez well and replace its existing storage tank. 
   Domenici is the sole member of the New Mexico delegation to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee. In his time on the committee he has consistently supported the USDA and EPA in funding water and waste disposal projects all over New Mexico.
