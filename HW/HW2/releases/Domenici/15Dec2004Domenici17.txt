SEN. DOMENICI: LOVINGTON'S CHAPARRAL PARK WILL SOON INCLUDE SWIMMING POOL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the city of Lovington will receive funds from the National Park Service (NPS) to provide additional recreational opportunities for Chaparral Park, a prized area in the southeastern town.  
   NPS is awarding $400,000 in matching funds through its Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for the installation of a swimming pool at the 80-acre public park in Lovington. Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for the Interior which sets the funding levels for the LWCF. 
   "Public parks should be a magnet for family and community activities so people of all interests and ages can enjoy," Domenici said. "Chaparral Park is Lovington's prime recreational area with picnic facilities, basketball and tennis courts, and trails. I am pleased we can add a brand new swimming pool to the park to enhance the enjoyment for all its visitors." 
   NPS has also awarded three other parks in New Mexico for a total of $740,871 for outdoor recreation projects. Lovington's share accounts for the largest award in this grant process: 
   * NM State Parks - $205,871 for Mesilla Valley Bosque Park access road in Do?a Ana County; 
   * City of Aztec - $75,000 for Florence Park tennis and basketball court improvements; and, 
   * Village of Cloudcroft - $60,000 for Zenith Park tennis and basketball court improvements. 
   Chaparral Park, one of six public parks in Lovington, is hailed as one of the best in the county. Its 80 acres contain an amphitheatre, tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts, jogging paths, and playgrounds. An 11-acre lake provides prime fishing that compliments the RV camping and picnic facilities. The park also hosts the annual Fourth of July "World's Greatest Lizard Race" that has had families participating in the competition for nearly 30 years. 
   Since LWCF inception in 1964, the LWCF has used returns from oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf to provide conservation funds that finance the procurement of public lands. More than $3.2 billion have been matched by state and local contributions and of the total number of projects, approximately 10,000 have helped states acquire 2.3 million acres of park land.
