SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GRANT TO SUPPORT RIO RANCHO SENIOR TRANSIT PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded the city of Rio Rancho a $242,945 grant to support the Rio Rancho Senior Transit Program. 
   The DOT grant will be used to purchase three replacement vehicles, one expansion vehicle and dispatching software and hardware.
   The bus program currently operates seven buses which provides door-to-door transportation service for senior citizens 55 years of age and older and for disabled adults 18 years of age and older.
   "The service that this grant will provide is essential to Rio Rancho residents. The program allows individuals to live independently by providing reliable access to transportation. I am pleased to see that residents will directly receive service from this transportation earmark," Domenici said.
   To receive service from the Rio Rancho Senior Transit Program, applicants must be a resident of Rio Rancho with a physical address in Rio Rancho and must provide proof with a driver's license, cancelled check or utility bills.
