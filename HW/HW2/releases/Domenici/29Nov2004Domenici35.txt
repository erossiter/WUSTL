SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GUTIERREZ AS COMMERCE SECRETARY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today released the following statement regarding the nomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be U.S. Secretary of Commerce:  
   "I believe the President has made a wise choice by nominating Carlos Gutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce. His story truly reflects the American dream. Gutierrez is an immigrant who climbed the corporate ladder all the way from truck driver to CEO of a major, respected American company. His years of experience make him well qualified for this position. 
   "I'm also pleased by this nomination because of the diversity it adds to President Bush's Cabinet. This President has demonstrated a commitment to selecting Americans from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds to serve him, and I believe that the selection of Carlos Gutierrez, along with the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General, is a clear sign of the contributions that Hispanic-Americans are making to our nation."
