SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS OPENING OF RIO RANCHO POST OFFICE
  Less than four months after Sen. Pete Domenici gained a firm commitment from Postal Service officials to open a new facility in Rio Rancho, the Senator today applauded news that the facility was now open and ready for customers. 
   After pressuring the USPS to expand its services for Rio Rancho residents for months, Domenici gained a firm commitment in January to open a new contract facility from Postmaster General Jack Potter. The Senator had received numerous complaints from Rio Rancho residents, many of whom had to travel to Albuquerque to visit the post office.
   "I'm very happy that the Post Office has followed through with its commitment to me to open a new postal facility in Rio Rancho. This new contract office should make life a little easier for citizens in Rio Rancho. The city had long ago outgrown its single post office," said Domenici, who is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee (HSGAC) which has jurisdiction over the Post Office.
   While the USPS is not able to build many new individual Post Offices due to budgetary concerns, the retail contract mail facility will help with common postal services such as mailing packages and buying stamps.
   Domenici also said that his office is continuing to monitor USPS performance and customer service in New Mexico, since there have been lingering complaints about poor service from all over the state.
   "The Post Office has assured me that they are working hard to raise the level of service in New Mexico. My office is still monitoring and tracking complaints, and I will continue to engage in a dialogue with postal officials until service has improved to all areas of the state," Domenici said.
