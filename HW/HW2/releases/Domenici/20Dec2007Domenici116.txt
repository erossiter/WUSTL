SEN. DOMENICI: 15 N.M. COMMUNITIES RECEIVE $314,000 IN HOMELAND SECURITY EQUIPMENT GRANTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that 15 New Mexico communities--including Rio Rancho, Corrales and the town of Bernalillo--have been awarded $314,000 in federal grants to acquire training and equipment to meet emergency and first-responder preparedness needs.  
   The grants were awarded through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of its Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for DHS and its grant programs to support local emergency preparedness. 
   "Emergency response and law enforcement departments throughout New Mexico tap into this federal program to beef up their ability to respond to local emergency needs. In that way, communities are better served, and the Homeland Security Department can expect these agencies to improve their abilities to work together in times of crisis," Domenici said. 
   The DHS grants will support equipment purchases, testing and validation of available technology, training, workshops, administration and evaluation.
