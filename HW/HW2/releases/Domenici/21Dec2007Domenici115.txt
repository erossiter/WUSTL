SEN. DOMENICI OFFERS HOLIDAY MESSAGE TO NEW MEXICANS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today issued the following holiday message to New Mexicans today:  
   "My wife Nancy and I wish everyone a happy and blessed holiday season. This is a very good time to be with those we love, look back on the past year and look forward to an even better new year. 
   "We also send our best holiday wishes to the American men and women who are serving our nation overseas. They and their families will be apart, but we should all take a moment to remember them and reach out to them. This is especially true, too, for those families who have lost a loved one in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   "Nancy and I look forward to spending this Christmas with our family and friends, and hope everyone at home has a chance to do the same." 
   The Domenici offices in Washington, D.C., Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell and Santa Fe will be closed beginning Monday, Dec. 24, and will reopen on Wednesday, Jan. 2.
