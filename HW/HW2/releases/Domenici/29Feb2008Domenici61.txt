SEN. DOMENICI OFFERS U.S. ENERGY ENHANCEMENT SECURITY IDEAS IN PART 2 OF ENERGY POLICY ADDRESS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today delivered the second of two major policy speeches on America's energy predicament, and offered approaches the nation must take to keep its hunger for energy from compromising its future. 
   Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on Thursday offered a comprehensive assessment of the challenges facing the nation and bipartisan actions taken by Congress to address the problems. On Friday, he focused on offering a sampling of policy options open to Congress this year-and after he leaves office in January 2009. 
   "Those of us in Congress must be honest with the American people and honest with ourselves. Given our growing energy needs, and the severity of our dependence on foreign oil, we should not promise energy independence within a term of office or a set number of calendar years. In the absence of scientific breakthroughs, the significant strengthening of our energy security that we seek will take substantial time and effort to achieve. But we can begin to move in that direction today," Domenici said.  
   Domenici said Congress must move beyond the extreme ideologies that result in an "either-or approach, where participants are accused of being beholden to either 'big oil' or 'environmental extremism.'" Domenici, who has served on the Energy Committee for more than 30 years, advocated instead for a three-pronged approach to America's energy needs: 
   * Incentives to increase responsible domestic energy production
   * Incentives to accelerate research, development and the deployment of renewable and alternative energy sources; and,
   * Incentives to enhance energy conservation
   Domenici said broad bipartisan support for conservation and renewable energy sources is necessary and admirable, but that ignoring the third leg-domestic energy production-cripples efforts to meet near-term energy goals for cutting American dependence on foreign oil. 
   "When you miss a critical piece of the puzzle-the one that matters most in the near-term, and would have the greatest immediate impact-then you can safely say, as I do now, that our efforts will fall short of the goal," Domenici said. 
   "It is my sincere hope that we will use this year and the future to work together on policies that will move us toward our energy security goals. This will require us to set aside our differences and make difficult decisions. It will require us to come to the table with open minds and positive intentions. In an era defined by its bitter partisanship, this will not be easy. But given the stakes-our national security, our economic strength, and our standing in the world-that is exactly what we must do," he said. 
   The following are highlights of Part 2 of Domenici's American energy speech, in which he outlines actions Congress can take to ease U.S. dependence on foreign oil. (The complete prepared text of his remarks from today is available from the Domenici press office). 
   * Congress' "Damaging Obstructionism" 
   "Those of us in Congress continue to share a common goal-to reduce our dependence on foreign oil-but there are deep divisions over how to achieve it. As a result, the Congressional Record continues to be filled with legislation that undermines our ability to move toward this goal. These measures were drafted with good intentions. But sometimes good intentions are not enough, especially when they are not matched with the wisdom and experience necessary to adopt policies that will achieve the goals we seek. This Congress is failing in this regard." Domenici cited examples of recently examples of a "long history of damaging obstructionism in congressional energy policy," including: ANWR exploration prohibitions; oil shale development moratorium; new fees on oil and gas permit processing; failing to agree to an inventory of national energy reserves. 
   * ANWR/Arctic Coastal Plain 
   "We must listen to the people of Alaska and open the Arctic Coastal Plain to responsible leasing for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. ANWR is an emotional subject for many folks, so let's stick to the facts. First, to the critics who say that oil from ANWR will take 10 years to come online-you are probably right. But to use this as an argument against development is a fallacy, like refusing to save for your retirement because you will not be able to retire next year. It will take time and patience to develop the resources of Alaska's North Slope. From experience, we know that starting this process a decade ago would have ensured greater domestic oil production when we needed it most." 
   * Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) 
   "Unfortunately, the recent debate in Congress has focused on how to shut off leasing on the OCS, not on how to open more areas up. Continuing to restrict the OCS will sacrifice billions of dollars that could be used to develop our nation's future energy supplies. Opening the OCS would augment our supply of traditional fuels-and dollars that now go overseas to acquire oil could remain within our economy and be used to develop alternative sources of energy. The conventional fuels of the 20th century can be used to pioneer those of the 21st century, but we must first find the courage to put ourselves on such a forward-looking and pragmatic path." 
   * Expedited On-Shore Permitting Process 
   "The last component of increased domestic production will be to expedite the on-shore permitting process... Permitting must be streamlined, not only to prevent energy producers from investing abroad, but also for the sake of growing our energy production." 
   * Develop Coal-to-Liquid Fuels 
   "As an alternative to oil, coal-to-liquid fuel has many merits: it will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and other pollutants when compared to conventional fuels. Coal-to-liquids fuel has been commercially demonstrated in other countries, can be moved through existing pipelines, and can be used in existing vehicles. The commercialization of coal-to-liquid fuels will also create investment in rural communities, thousands of good-paying jobs, and cheaper energy for American consumers. Despite this potential, two amendments to advance this innovative fuel were defeated on a party-line vote in the most recent energy debate." 
   * Advanced Batteries 
   "To help power a next generation of automobiles, we must also seek to develop advanced batteries in this country. The government must redouble its efforts to ensure the research, development, and deployment of these technologies. Reliable and rechargeable batteries will be critical to the success of hybrid vehicles, which hold tremendous promise for reducing the amount of oil consumed in the transportation sector." 
   * Et Cetera 
   "The policies I have spoken of are just a few of the options available to us as we confront our energy challenges. We should also increase the number of flex-fuel vehicles on the road, and the number of stations that offer blended fuels. We should offer incentives to existing refineries, and encourage the expedited siting and construction of new ones, to reduce the amount of gasoline we import. We continue to lament that while our refinery capacity has improved at existing sites, we have not built a new refinery in 30 years. We must rethink our policies to match the modern challenge we face. We should reform New Resource Review to allow efficiency increases that do not increase emissions to be undertaken at plants in our existing power fleet. Again, these are just a sampling of the policy options available to the Congress as we seek to chart a more responsible path forward."
