SENATE OKAYS DOMENICI-COSPONSORED RESOLUTION DESIGATING JUNE AS 'NATIONAL INTERNET SAFETY MONTH'
  Senator Pete Domenici today announced Senate passage of a bipartisan resolution that calls attention to the need for strong internet safety education for children by designating June as National Internet Safety Month. 
   Domenici is a cosponsor of the National Internet Safety Month resolution that advocates raising public awareness of the critical need to increase and improve internet safety measures to protect the more than 35,000,000 American children with internet access.
   "Particularly in an educational environment, the internet is a tremendous resource and learning tool for our nation's technology savvy youngsters. However, the internet has also been made a repository for obscene and objectionable material that is not appropriate for children. Educators, parents, and their children must know that, in addition to all the good the internet offers, there also exists unsuitable content and dangerous individuals online," said Domenici.
   "National Internet Safety Month will bring this critical issue into the national spotlight, and I hope that it will facilitate discussion among teachers and students, parents and children, resulting in safe and responsible use of the internet," he added.
   The resolution cites a number of alarming facts illustrating how children can be exposed to danger on the internet:
   * 61 percent of students admit to using the internet unsafely or inappropriately.
   * 41 percent of students in grades 5 through 12 do not share with their parents what they do on the internet.
   * 31 percent of students in grades 5 through 12 have the skill to circumvent software designed to filter out unwanted and unsuitable material.
   * 20 percent of middle school and high school students have met face-to-face with someone they first met online.
   The resolution is intended to help make American citizens aware of the dangers of the internet, and the importance of being safe and responsible online through information and training programs. Further, it will bring together safety organizations, law enforcement personnel, educators, community leaders, and parents to make sure everyone works together to protect children from the hazards of cyberspace.
