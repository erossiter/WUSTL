SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON AGREEMENT ON TERRORIST DETAINEES, INTERROGATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement related to an agreement reached between the White House and Senate negotiators on legislation to outline how United States operatives can treat and question terrorists captured in the War on Terrorism: 
   "I'm pleased that an agreement has been reached on the question of interrogating terrorists that the United States has captured during the Global War on Terrorism. I have been involved in many of these discussions and believe that the most important concept has been preserved-that we will be able to continue to interrogate the terrorists who have vowed to destroy the United States. While I will continue to review the agreement, I will not support any policy that I believe will tie our hands in the war on terrorism and make Americans more vulnerable to the terrorists."
