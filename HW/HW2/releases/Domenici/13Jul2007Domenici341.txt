SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR CLOVIS AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $469,679 to improve New Mexico airport facilities, including the Clovis Municipal airport.  
   DOT awarded $280,000 to the Clovis Municipal airport for construction surveys, as well as for a runway extension. The proposed survey would evaluate runway obstructions and make the airport more accessible to pilots. Additionally, the airport plans to design a new 7,200 foot runway. 
   "Airport facilities are a strong contributor to the overall economic well-being of a community," said Domenici. "I was pleased to see that DOT has awarded these funds to Clovis. I trust they will be beneficial in improving the capacity of the airport in Clovis." 
   Funds were administered by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   DOT also awarded $189,679 for the design project to extend the runway at Raton Municipal/Crews Field. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps make federal funding allocations for projects nationwide, including those carried out by the Department of Transportation.
