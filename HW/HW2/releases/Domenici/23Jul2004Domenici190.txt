SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR MIGRANT FARMERS IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Northern New Mexico Community College in Espa?ola will receive federal funds to renew a program that helps migrant workers and their children earn high school diplomas. 
   The U.S. Department of Education chose to fund the High School Equivalency Program (HEP) for an additional five years. The $350,160 grant is authorized through the Higher Education Act. 
   "Too often, migrant workers are made to choose between staying in school and earning money to support their families. This is a great program that helps them work towards a degree without having to sacrifice their job," Domenici said. 
   "I am very happy to see that Northern New Mexico Community College can continue in their efforts to help improve the lives of New Mexicans," he said. 
   The HEP program will provide academic instruction, supportive services, and financial resources to 100 students per year who are migrant or seasonal farm workers. Participants will complete their GED and be able to prepare for secondary education, training or vocational programs. 
   HEP is uniquely designed as a open-entry-open-exit program to fit the migrant worker schedule. Students may enter at anytime during the semester and leave once they complete their GED. 
   In 1972, Northern New Mexico Community College received its first HEP grant and has received funding ever since. The program's continued success is attributed to Northern's commitment and support to ensure that farm worker students succeed.
