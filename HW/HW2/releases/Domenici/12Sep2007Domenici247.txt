SEN. DOMENICI SAYS USDA WILL HELP TIERRA AMARILLA & TAOS WITH RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that La Clinica del Pueblo de Rio Arriba in Tierra Amarilla will benefit from $125,000 in funding through the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development.  
   USDA Rural Development has approved a loan of $106,250 and a grant of $18,750 through its Community Facility Loan and Economic Impact Initiative Grant programs to help the hospital purchase a new 2008 North Star ambulance. 
   "La Clinica del Pueblo de Rio Arriba serves a large area which necessitates an adequate and up-to-date ambulance to transport patients," said Domenici. "I am pleased these USDA funds will help the hospital as it continues to provide quality service to residents in Tierra Amarilla and the surrounding communities." 
   An updated ambulance is needed to help the hospital meet its patient transportation needs. Currently, mileage to and from the hospital typically ranges from between 130 and 300 miles. The loan was awarded at a 10 year rate of 4.125 percent. 
   Domenici also announced that the town of Taos received a similar grant of $15,750 to purchase new communication equipment and motorcycle trailers for its police department, which provides first-responder services for Taos and the surrounding communities in Taos County. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federal programs, including those administered by the Department of Agriculture.
