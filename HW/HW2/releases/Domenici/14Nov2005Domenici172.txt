SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER PATROL AGENTS ASSIGNED TO NEW MEXICO
  In response to news that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) plans to assign 265 additional Border Patrol agents to New Mexico in 2006, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici issued the following statement. 
   During a visit to the Santa Teresa Port of Entry on Saturday, Domenici announced that he is introducing the Border Security Modernization Act of 2006 in the Senate this week. The bill will authorize a substantial increase in the number of personnel, assets, checkpoints and facilities on the border. 
   As a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici joined the Senate to fund the hiring of 1,500 additional Border Patrol agents this year. 
   "It was only inevitable that New Mexico would get more border security personnel. As California, then Texas, then Arizona are seeing crackdowns, illegal crossings are shifting to our state. These new positions recognize that, and are made possible by additional funding by Congressional Homeland Security Appropriators. 
   "Having just returned from a visit to the border, I know first hand how badly additional Border Patrol agents and personnel are needed. While I'm pleased that the Department has made this designation, it is certainly not enough. This week, I'm introducing a bill that will give the Department of Homeland Security the personnel, authority, and help it needs to investigate and remove aliens who are not authorized to be in America." 
   Domenici and Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), the bill's cosponsor, will be holding a news conference to discuss his new legislation on Thursday, November 17 at the U.S Capitol at 11:30 a.m.
