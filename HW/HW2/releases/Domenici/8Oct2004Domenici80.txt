FINAL DEFENSE BILL OUTLINES NEW WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL OVERSIGHT PLAN DEVELOPED BY SEN. DOMENICI
  A Senate-House conference committee has finalized a defense policy bill that includes a provision written by U.S. Senator Pete Domenici authorizing a contract for oversight and evaluation of work at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad.  
   The language is included in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill, which now requires final approval in both the House and Senate before it can be forwarded to President Bush. It is unknown whether final votes will occur before Congress recesses for the fall elections or during a subsequent lame duck session. 
   The directive was included in the Senate version of the bill by the Senate Armed Services Committee at Domenici's request. 
   "I'm pleased this provision has been included in the final version of the defense policy bill. I believe that WIPP should have strict oversight to ensure the safety and proper operation of the facility. This language will ensure that there is an independent body watching over WIPP," Domenici said. 
   The Domenici language serves to provide federal reauthorization of an oversight function previously managed by the Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG). The language directs the Secretary of Energy to use a competitive procedure to enter into a contract to conduct independent reviews and evaluations on the design, construction and operations of WIPP. It also sets a one-year period for the competitive contract, with a renewal option for four additional years. 
   Domenici and Congressman Steve Pearce recently announced a $600,000 award by the Department of Energy for interm independent monitoring of WIPP. The monitoring will be carried about by the Carlsbad Environmental Monitoring and Research Center, which is serving as a watchdog for WIPP between the end of last month when the EEG contract expired and the awarding of a new contract.
