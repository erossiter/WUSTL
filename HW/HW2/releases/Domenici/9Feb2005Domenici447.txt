HUD RELEASES SEN. DOMENICI-SECURED FUNDING TO EXPAND TIJERAS VILLAGE HALL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that a $636,224 U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant has been awarded to Tijeras Village to support the expansion of the local town hall.  
   "The funding will provide needed renovations to the Tijeras Village Hall and the new facilities should be a big improvement over those that are currently in place," said Domenici. "Tijeras has been working for awhile to get their project solid funding and I am pleased to see that their efforts are moving forward." 
   The Economic Development Initiative (EDI) Special Project grant will be used for construction of an addition to the Tijeras Village Hall. 
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies (VA-HUD) Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for HUD and the EDI program, requested $640,000 for the project in 2003. It became law as part of the FY2004 VA-HUD Appropriation bill. 
   The construction project consists of a 2,200 square-foot renovation of existing space as well as an additional 2,800 square-feet of space. 
   The additional square footage will enlarge the Motor Vehicle Division offices and waiting area, separate offices, create a workroom, a computer server room and a staff restroom, and will bring the public restrooms up to future Americans with Disabilities Act standards.
