WHEELS MUSEUM RECEIVES HUD FUNDING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded $223,673 to Wheels Museum in Albuquerque which showcases remnants of the old Santa Fe railroad.  
   Domenici included the funding in the FY2004 Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies (VA-HUD) Appropriations bill as a member of the VA-HUD subcommittee. 
   "Albuquerque began as a small farming community and has since become the largest city in New Mexico, in large part because of the Santa Fe Railway. The railroad marked the beginning of Albuquerque as a commercial center and it is important for New Mexicans to revisit our past," Domenici said. "Wheels Museum has done a great job maintaining this important landmark for Duke City and I am please to have secured this funding." 
   The Santa Fe Railway was instrumental in the development of Albuquerque as a hub for commerce and industry as it served as the city's leading employer. Twelve remaining historic buildings offer a glimpse into the influential role the railroad played in the growth of modern Albuquerque. 
   The former Santa Fe Railway Shops, making up an historic village in the heart of Albuquerque, once housed the largest urban industry in New Mexico and employed more people than any other business in Albuquerque. 
   Wheels Museum will use the funds to continue the management and upkeep of the railway site that served as a crucial depot during World War II and whose locomotive shop complex is the largest historic industrial plant in New Mexico.
