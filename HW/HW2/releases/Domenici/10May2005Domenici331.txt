DOE AWARDS HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS GRANT TO NMSU
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that New Mexico State University (NMSU) has been awarded $110,000 in grant funding to continue studying the physics of high-energy particles.  
   The grant represents renewal funding through the Department of Energy (DOE). Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding levels for the DOE. 
   "I am pleased to see funding for NMSU to continue its in-depth research of the basic components that make up everyday life. A better working knowledge can lead to many more insightful discoveries and revolutions. I encourage NMSU to keep up the good work," Domenici said. 
   The project, Quark Gluon Structure of Hadrons in QCD, will receive $110,000 as part of a total contract worth $842,000. The award support physics research devoted to the fundamental building blocks of matter. 
   The latest action by the DOE signals the ninth consecutive year funding has been awarded to support the project. NMSU was granted the initial contract in 1996 and will continue to receive funding until March 2008. Over $630,000 in federal dollars have already been awarded to the project.
