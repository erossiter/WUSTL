SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GLOBAL NUCLEAR POWER HEARING, SEPT. 14
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which he chairs, will conduct a hearing next week on the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) initiative.  
   The hearing is set for 9:30 a.m., Thursday, Sept. 14, in Room 138 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The hearing has been called to review the technical challenges of both nuclear waste recycling and advanced reactor technologies. 
   "The DOE solicitations to move GNEP forward are positive steps forward, and I want to use this hearing to take a comprehensive look at the challenges and needs ahead. I am heartened by the interest in expanding the use of nuclear power as a clean energy source in this country and in the developing world," Domenici said. 
   GNEP is evolving into a long-term, public-private R&D program that builds on industry experience and the capabilities of the DOE national laboratories--including Los Alamos and Sandia labs in New Mexico. The laboratories are being challenged to develop the technologies that will treat spent nuclear fuel to significantly reduce the toxicity and volume of waste by-products while recycling components that can be used to extract additional energy. 
   DOE recently issued a Request for Proposal for interested entities to initiate siting studies for GNEP facility locations, as well as an Expression of Interest for development of an advanced burner reactor and a spent fuel recycling center. 
   Scheduled witnesses include: 
   * Dennis, Spurgeon, DOE Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; 
   * Dr. Alan Hanson, executive vice president, AREVA; 
   * Kelly Fletcher, Sustainable Energy Advanced Technology Leader, GE Global Research; and 
   * Matthew Bunn, senior research associate, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.
