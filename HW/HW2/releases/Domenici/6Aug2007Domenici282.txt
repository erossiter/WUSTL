SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES HHS GRANT FOR DRUG ADDICTION RESEARCH
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $256,974 to the MIND Institute in Albuquerque for research regarding drug abuse and other addictions.  
   The grant, awarded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, will be used to fund the project entitled, "Multimodal Imaging of the Sensory Gating Deficit in Chronic Cocaine Abusers." The MIND Institute expects to use this research to better understand addictions and their affect on the brain, as well as the best treatment options for those affected by the condition. 
   "The MIND Institute is working to establish itself at the forefront of brain and addiction research," said Domenici. "A better understanding drug addictions and the brain activity surrounding them will help us treat individuals suffering from these conditions most effectively. I look forward to hearing of the institute's progress as it utilizes these funds." 
   Earlier this year, Domenici was briefed on research activities at the MIND Institute during a visit to its Albuquerque facility. To date, the institute has received 11 funding awards worth $7.01 million to expand its research concerning neuroimaging and addictions. The institute is also working on mental illness, neuroscience, aging and other brain-related research. (http://www.themindinstitute.org/) 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federal projects, including those administered by HHS.
