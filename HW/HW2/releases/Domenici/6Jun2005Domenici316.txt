SEN. DOMENICI: USDA GRANT INTENDED TO IMPROVE HOMEOWNERSHIP IN RURAL N.M.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that $300,000 made available to the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority will help develop more housing opportunities in rural areas in the state. 
   Domenici said the Rural Community Development Initiative grant will spark more homeownership and affordable housing in several parts of New Mexico. Overall, the USDA has awarded $6.5 million for technical assistance in 19 states.
   "Homeownership is especially challenging in rural areas where there are typically fewer opportunities for affordable, reliable housing," Domenici said. "This program will disseminate information throughout communities in New Mexico to properly educate families before they buy." 
   The grant funding will help provide technical assistance to recipients to increase the availability of homebuyer education, improve the capacity rural organizations to expand the supply of affordable housing through affordable housing development.
   Recipients are required to obtain matching funds that will double the impact of the USDA grants. Funding of individual recipients will be contingent upon meeting the conditions of the grant agreement.
