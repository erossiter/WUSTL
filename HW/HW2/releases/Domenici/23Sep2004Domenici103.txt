SEN. DOMENICI COMMENDS NASA WHITE SANDS TEST FACILITY FOR WORKER SAFETY & HEALTH HONOR
  Sen. Pete Domenici today commended the workers at the NASA White Sands Test Facility at Las Cruces who recently received recognition for "exceptional achievement" by the Occupational Safety and Heath Administration (OSHA) for employee safety and health practices.  
   OSHA has named the NASA White Sands Test Facility, which is administered by the Washington Group International Inc., as a "Star Participant" in its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). The VPP was established in 1982 to recognize worksites that demonstrated exemplary health and safety records in the workplace. 
   "I'm proud that the White Sands Test Facility has accumulated such an outstanding record that its workplace safety and health can be used as a model to other businesses. Worker safety is critical to the most efficient and successful workplaces. The work carried out by the workers there is difficult and sensitive, which makes this OSHA recognition all the more remarkable," Domenici said. 
   NASA White Sands Test Facility is a preeminent resource for testing and evaluating potentially hazardous materials, space flight components, and rocket propulsion systems. These services are available to NASA, the Defense Department, other federal agencies, universities, and commercial industry. Its primary mission is to support NASA Space Shuttle and Space Station programs and to serve as the official Johnson Space Center Propulsion Systems Development facility. As part of its responsibilities, the facility carries out hazardous fluid assessments, hypervelocity tests, and explosive hazard assessment. 
   According to Assistant Labor Secretary John L. Henshaw, VPP sites are "models for what employers and employees can achieve by working cooperatively with one another and with OSHA to achieve a level of worker protection that goes beyond compliance with government regulations."
