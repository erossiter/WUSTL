SEN. DOMENICI PRAISES SWIFT ACTION BY BUSH TO STREAMLINE COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement in response to President Bush's call for a national intelligence director and counterterrorism center:  
   "I applaud President Bush for acting quickly on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. I agree with the President that our nation would benefit by streamlining our intelligence through a national intelligence director and a counterterrorism center. 
   "Already, the Bush administration and Congress have taken substantial steps to make American safer, with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security being the most important. A national counterterrorism center, which will serve as a knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists makes sense and should allow government agencies to work together even better. 
   "As we live with heightened security warnings, these latest moves by President Bush show us that our fight against terrorism is an evolving and dynamic challenge. His announcement today is a testament to the President's understanding that he is ready to make the difficult decisions to improve domestic security."
