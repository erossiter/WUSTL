SEN. DOMENICI VOTES FOR ?PROJECT BIOSHIELD' ACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today voted for legislation authorizing President Bush's "Project BioShield," a major initiative to develop and make available modern, effective drugs and vaccines to protect against attack by biological and chemical weapons.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, voted for S.15, the Project BioShield Act of 2004. The bill passed unanimously, 99-0. The House passed a similar bill last July. 
   "This bill will provide the impetus for the medical community to find the best way to launch a full-scale response in the event of a biological or chemical attack. With the federal government's backing, medical researchers and emergency planners can find better drugs and vaccines to protect the public from bioterrorism threats or attacks," Domenici said. 
   The legislation authorizes the use of almost $5.6 billion in Homeland Security appropriations already provided by Congress for developing bioterroism countermeasures. 
   Building on two existing homeland security laws (Public Health Safety & Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Act of 2002), S.15 will bolster federal support for developing and improving: prevention of bioterrorism; surveillance of infectious diseases; medical and public health readiness for mass casualty events; research and development of new drugs and devices; information technology system infrastructures; and the Strategic National Stockpile.
