HOMELAND SECURITY GIVE HOBBS FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDS TO PROCURE PROTECTIVE GEAR
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the Hobbs Fire Department will receive funds from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to purchase operations and firefighter safety equipment for area firefighters.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), announced that the Hobbs Fire Department will receive $205,921 to procure personal protective gear and fitness equipment. 
   "New Mexico's emergency responders must be prepared for any situation that could threaten our safety. These funds help bolster the Hobbs Fire Department and supply firefighters with necessary protective gear," Domenici said. 
   The funding is a one-year award through the FY2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program (AFGP) which is administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the USFA. 
   The Hobbs Fire Department will purchase 30 sets of bunker gear and coveralls which include fire-resistant suits, gloves, hats and other protective gear. Remaining funds will purchase fitness equipment, finance the refurbishment of a room to serve as a workout center in the station, and provide for annual physicals for Hobbs firefighters. 
   The AFGP awarded these grants after Congress appropriated and President Bush signed into law $750 million in federal funds for firefighters throughout the nation.
