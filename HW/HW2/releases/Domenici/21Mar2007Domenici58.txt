SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS VIETNAM MEMORIAL RESOLUTION COMMEMMORATING 25TH ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cosponsored a bipartisan Senate resolution recognizing the 25th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.  
   The resolution, introduced by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), expresses support for those who served in Vietnam, commemorates the 25th anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Memorial, and encourages renewed public respect and remembrance of Vietnam War veterans. 
   "Since its creation, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is one of the most moving spots in the nation's capital. It is a unique place for Americans to remember and honor those who fell in the divisive combat in Southeast Asia," Domenici said. "As we reach the 25th anniversary of this memorial, I am pleased to use this resolution to call attention the sacrifices made by New Mexicans during the war in Vietnam and the ongoing sadness felt by veterans and families across the nation for those who lost their lives for their country." 
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is located in Washington D.C. and displays the names of over 58,000 men and women who died in Vietnam between 1956 and 1975. 
   In 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial was unveiled at the site of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Created by Santa Fe resident Glenna Goodacre, the sculpture depicts three American nurses and a wounded soldier. For more information, visit http://www.nps.gov/archive/vive/memorial/memorial.htm 
   "Glenna's sculpture adds to the solemn dignity of the Vietnam memorial. I know New Mexicans today wish her well as she recovers from a recent surgery," Domenici said. 
   Domenici earlier this week cosponsored the Military Retiree Survivor Benefit Equity Act of 2007 to modify the distribution of benefits that veterans and their families receive.
