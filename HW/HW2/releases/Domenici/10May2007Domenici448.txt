SEN. DOMENICI REPORTS AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT FUNDS FOR ABQ SUNPORT, DEMING AIRPORT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $2 million dollars for renovation of the Albuquerque International Sunport. 
   The City of Albuquerque will utilize funds to rehabilitate the taxiway at the Sunport. The grant was awarded through the DOT Airport Improvement Program (AIP).
   In addition, the Deming Municipal Airport was awarded $1.4 million in AIP funding to extend a runway.
   "The Sunport provides air service for residents well beyond the Albuquerque city limits," said Domenici. "As the demands on the airport continue to grow, there are obvious repairs and renovations that must be made, one of these being to the runway. I am happy the Transportation Department will provide these funds so that the Sunport can continue its service to New Mexicans."
   Domenici has supported funding for the Albuquerque Sunport in the past. He requested $1 million on behalf of the Sunport in the FY2007 Senate Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill, but these earmarked funds were lost when the FY2007 Appropriations process collapsed last winter.
   Last year, the airport also received $5.2 million in AIP DOT funding last year to renovate the deteriorated pavement on its terminal apron.
   The DOT funds will be disbursed through the Federal Aviation Administration.
