SEN. DOMENICI: ALBUQUERQUE WEST SIDE GETS FEDERAL 'WEED & SEED' GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded a $200,000 grant to the Albuquerque Department of Community and Family Services to support local efforts to fight crime through community revitalization and development. 
   The DOJ grant will fund the Albuquerque Westside/South Valley site of the Weed and Seed Program. The Weed and Seed program utilizes a multi-agency strategy that "weeds" out violent crime, gang activity, drug use and drug trafficking in specified neighborhoods and then "seeds" the area with social and economic revitalization projects.
   "We have seen the success of the Weed and Seed program in Las Cruces, Espa?ola and southeast Albuquerque. I believe that this is a smart strategy that not only focuses on combating crime but also on economic revitalization. I am pleased with the results and will continue to work to sustain this program," Domenici said.
   The program focuses on increasing the coordination of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies while also focusing on community collaboration utilizing social service agencies, private sector businesses, and neighborhood associations.
   Domenici serves on the Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee which designates funding amount for DOJ programs.
   The DOJ grant was awarded through the Office of Justice Programs and its Community Capacity Development Office.
