SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF ARTESIA MAYOR MANUEL MADRID
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today issued the following statement following the passing of Artesia Mayor Manuel Madrid:  
   "I am saddened by the death of Mayor Madrid. Manuel's long battle is over, but I believe he will be remembered for being a strong champion for Artesia. As a long-time city councilor and then mayor, he dedicated himself to the city and improving its overall vitality. It has always been a pleasure to work with him, and I'll miss our interaction. 
   "My wife Nancy and I offer Linda and the entire Madrid family our sympathy and prayers. Manuel had a very evident dedication to Linda, his children and grandchildren, who will feel his absence most. I hope and pray they, and all the Mayor's admirers, will find solace in his life and all of his efforts on their behalf."
