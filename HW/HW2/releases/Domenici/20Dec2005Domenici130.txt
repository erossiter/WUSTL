SEN. DOMENICI'S 2005 HOLIDAY MESSAGE TO NEW MEXICANS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today extended the following holiday message to New Mexicans:  
   "I want to wish New Mexicans all the best of the joys of this holiday season. So many of you helped the nation usher in this festive season with the gift of the National Capitol Christmas Tree, which today stands beautifully in Washington. 
   "Whether you and your family celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanza, I believe we should all take time to enjoy and be thankful for our family and friends. 
   "We should also take time to remember those who cannot be with us this year, particularly the brave men and women in uniform who will spend the holidays in service to their nation. We should also remember and comfort the families of those New Mexicans who have lost loved ones in battles overseas. 
   "My wife Nancy and I wish you all a blessed holiday season, and a happy and healthy new year. God bless you all." 
   The Domenici offices in Washington, D.C., Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell and Santa Fe will be closed beginning Monday, Dec. 26 and will reopen January 3, 2006.
