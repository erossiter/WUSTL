SEN. DOMENICI: LAS CRUCES HIV/AIDS AID GROUP GETS FEDERAL RYAN WHITE GRANT FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Camino de Vida Center for HIV Services in Las Cruces has received a $190,673 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for services to people with HIV/AIDS.  
   Camino de Vida provides assistance to those affected by HIV/AIDS. The funding will be used to further the organization's services, which include testing, case management, medical care, insurance assistance, and home health care. 
   "Providing assistance to those affected by HIV/AIDS starts in the local community. I believe it is essential to help these individuals and their families whether through counseling services or health care," said Domenici. "Camino de Vida is receiving these funds because it is recognized as a community leader and has a proven track record of helping those affected by this disease. I applaud its efforts and hope that this HHS funding will help it keep up the good work in the Las Cruces community." 
   Camino de Vida received funds under the Ryan White Title III Outpatient EIS Program. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, funds in the program are awarded to community organizations and health centers that specialize in care for those living with the disease.
