JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AWARDS GRANT TO FIGHT SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN NEW MEXICO JAILS, PRISONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded a $75,352 grant to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety in an effort to combat substance abuse in state and local correctional facilities.  
   The Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Formula (RSAT) grant will assist the New Mexico Department of Corrections by creating a Therapeutic Community (TC) Quality Assurance Coordinator position. 
   "These programs are useful because it gives inmates opportunities to get their lives together by overcoming substance abuse problems. This grant will help give these individuals a better chance at a better life when they are released," Domenici said. 
   Addicted inmates, who have less than two years to serve and who indicate high motivation for treatment, are placed in the Therapeutic Community or designated housing units within the prison system. 
   The TC Quality Assurance Coordinator will specifically oversee training, technical assistance, quality improvement activities and contractual monitoring. 
   The RSAT grant will also provide funding for program activity items including workbooks, journals, videos, training and workshops.
