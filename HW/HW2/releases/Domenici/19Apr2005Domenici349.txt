SENATE PASSES SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORED MENTAL HEALTH COURTS BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Senate last night approved an extension of the Mental Health Courts system, which was created in 2000 as part of a pilot program by the U.S. Department of Justice.  
   Domenici is the cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) to extend authorization for the program. The DeWine-Domenici extension, S.239, calls for an annual appropriation of $10 million through 2011. Domenici and DeWine also teamed up to pass the original law creating the program, which is being used by the Albuquerque and Bernalillo County District Court systems. The bill passed the Senate without any objection. 
   "I'm very pleased that this year, we were able to get this extension passed out of the full Senate. The mental health court program has been very effective, and is particularly important to me because Albuquerque housed the very first mental health court in 2003. This program has led to better recognition by authorities of detainees that suffer from mental illness. Having courts of this nature ensure that detainees with mental illnesses that are charged with non-violent offenses receive considerations," Domenici said. 
   Under the existing program, 100 pilot Mental Health Courts (MHCs), including one in Albuquerque, were created to deal with mentally ill detainees. The MHCs are operated in a similar fashion to the Drug Court system. 
   Like drug courts, MHCs maintain separate dockets, handling cases involving only nonviolent mentally-ill defenders. Each court provides: 
   * Specialized training of law enforcement and MHC judicial personnel to handle the needs and challenges of nonviolent mentally ill offenders; 
   * Centralized case management of all nonviolent offense cases involving qualified mentally ill or retarded offenders; 
   * Voluntary assignment of qualified offenders to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatments as an alternative sentence, or an alternative to incarceration; 
   * Life skills training, job placement, and education for mentally ill participants; and, 
   * Continued judicial monitoring of offenders participating in a treatment plan. 
   The American Jail Association has estimated that as many as 700,000 persons suffering from mental illness are jailed each year. The Justice Department reported that 16 percent of all inmates in local jails and state prisons are mentally ill. 
   Since FY2002, Domenici has secured $7.4 million in Department of Justice funds for the mental health court program.
