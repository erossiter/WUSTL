SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA PROVIDES FUNDING ASSISTANCE FOR BELEN BLAZE
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that New Mexico has been awarded FEMA funding to help support firefighting efforts in the Belen Fire in Valencia County.  
   The state originally applied for federal assistance in fighting the fire on February 23. At the time, the fire had burned over 700 acres of private land, threatened homes and businesses, and forced the evacuation of over 400 residents. Through FEMA's Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP), the state will receive funding to support the costs incurred while fighting the fire, including those for equipment and fire fighting crews. 
   "New Mexico has an arid climate that makes it more prone to damaging wild fires. I am saddened to see the Belen community impacted by this blaze," said Domenici. "I am glad FEMA has recognized the need and agreed to provide these funds that will hopefully help Belen and Valencia County recover from this damaging fire." 
   The assistance will be provided through a cost-share program. While the actual costs of the blaze have yet to be determined, FEMA is expected to fund 75 percent of fire fighting costs and the state of New Mexico will provide the remaining 25 percent. 
   "Such blazes are often an unexpected cost that local governments are not fully prepared to deal with. While the effects of this fire in Belen may be long-lasting, I hope that these FEMA funds will help ease the immediate costs incurred while fighting this blaze," Domenici said. 
   FEMA's FMAGP provides financial assistance to state, local, and tribal governments to fire blazes affecting public and private forest and grassland. The program allows governments to submit a request for assistance at the time of the blaze, which is then subject to an expedited review process.
