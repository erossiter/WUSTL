SEN. DOMENICI LAUDS AWARD OF USDA HOUSING GRANT FOR NORTHERN DO?A ANA COUNTY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the Las Cruces Affordable Housing Inc. will receive federal funds from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to manage a unique homeownership program designed for low income families.  
   The $15,000 grant has been awarded through Rural Development, a division of USDA, for the Mutual Self Help Program which is designed to help low income families become homeowners. 
   "Homeownership is an essential part of creating economic and financial independence. Many families that struggle with financial burdens believe that owning a home is far-fetched goal. But this program is designed so that New Mexicans can purchase their homes at a lower cost than a houses built by contractors," Domenici said. 
   "This award helps families in Do?a Ana County make a substantial investment in the future, especially low-income families and those in rural areas," he said. 
   The Las Cruces Affordable Housing Inc. (LCAH) will work with USDA Rural Development's housing program to administer and implement the program. The LCAH will be working with low income families wanting to build new homes in the Salem and Placitas area in northern Do?a Ana County.
