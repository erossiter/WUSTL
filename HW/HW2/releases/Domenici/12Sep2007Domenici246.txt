SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES ANTI-METH FUNDS FOR ALBUQUERQUE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Justice will award $446,454 to the city of Albuquerque to combat the manufacture, use, and distribution of methamphetamine.  
   Funds were awarded as part of the DOJ's FY2007 Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Methamphetamine Initiative. Albuquerque is the only jurisdiction in the state that will receive the funds to combat the manufacture, use, and distribution of meth. Additionally, the grant will assist Albuquerque as it takes collaborative measures alongside other entities to prevent and treat methamphetamine abuse. 
   "Meth use is an increasingly prevalent issue in the Albuquerque area," said Domenici. "I am pleased that Albuquerque will be better equipped to mount the efforts needed at all levels in order to target meth production, trafficking, and use." 
   The COPS Methamphetamine Initiative will award $43.6 million in funding to 117 state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The DOJ developed its target pool of awardees based on data from the El Paso Intelligence Center, the Uniform Crime Report, and the Treatment Episode Data Set. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is plays a large role in determining funding for federal programs, including those administered by the Department of Justice.
