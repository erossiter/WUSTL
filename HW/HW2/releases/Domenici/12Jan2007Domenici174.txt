SEN. DOMENICI ENCOURAGES AMERICANS TO REMEMBER THE LIFE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today asked New Mexicans to pause this Monday, Jan. 15 and remember the life of Martin Luther King Jr. 
   To commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Domenici offered the following statement:
   "Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged all Americans to unite behind a common goal-liberty and justice for all. His efforts to bridge the racial divide during his time had lasting effects that have helped to create a more unified American society. Because of him, we are a nation that works harder than ever before to bring a sense of worth to every American.
   "Although we have come a long way since his time, the determination of Martin Luther King Jr. should still inspire us in the problems that we face today. We can draw motivation from his words, not only because they are true, but because he led by example. 
  "As we commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I encourage my fellow New Mexicans to not only remember his life, but also reevaluate the lessons that his life and death taught us. If we do that, I am confident that we will be one step closer to securing his dream for all people to live in America with grace and dignity."
   Domenici staff will be on hand Monday, Jan. 15, at the New Mexico Urban League's Martin Luther King Jr. Observance Ceremony in Albuquerque.
   Domenici's offices located in Washington D.C., Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces, and Roswell will also be closed.
