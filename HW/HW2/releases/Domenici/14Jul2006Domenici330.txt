SEN. DOMENICI OUTLINES HUD GRANTS TO NEW MEXICO, INCLUDING HOBBS AIR PARK FUNDS HE SECURED
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has released $1.5 million worth of Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grants to New Mexico, including $744,000 he secured for the city of Hobbs to improve its industrial air park. 
   Hobbs will utilize the EDI funds to facilitate infrastructure rehabilitation at the Hobbs Industrial Air Park. Domenici secured the FY2005 funding as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds HUD.
   "The key to maintaining our communities is stimulating economic development. These EDI earmark funds are needed in our cities and I am pleased to see so many awards offered to New Mexico," Domenici said.
   Approved as part of the FY2006 Transportation, Treasury and Housing Development Appropriations Bill, Domenici also announced that HUD has also released funds secured for these other New Mexico initiatives:
   * The city of Carlsbad will receive $500,000 to fund the Carlsbad Battered Families Shelter.
   * The Deming Helping Hands, Inc., will receive $250,000 to fund the food bank.
   * The city of Albuquerque will receive $19,800 to fund the East Central Ministries Enterprises Program.
   HUD's Economic Development Initiative provides funds to local governments to enhance economic development and revitalization projects. This may include property acquisition; rehabilitation of publicly owned property; and housing rehabilitations.
   Next week the Senate Appropriations Committee will mark-up the FY2007 TTHUD Bill.
