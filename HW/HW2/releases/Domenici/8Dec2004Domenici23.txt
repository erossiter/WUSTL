CURRY, ROOSEVELT, QUAY, EDDY, OTERO COUNTIES NAMED IN USDA DISASTER AID DESIGNATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a natural disaster designation to Curry, Roosevelt, Quay, Eddy and Otero counties as part of a broader disaster designation covering a number of West Texas counties.  
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Anne Veneman has officially granted the designation for 5 New Mexico counties as well as 14 counties in Texas. The New Mexico counties are included as areas contiguous to the primary disaster designation, which makes federal aid available to farm operators affected in the counties. 
   "Unfortunately, natural disasters can create agricultural losses that cannot be controlled or undone," Domenici said. "The assistance available from the USDA does not ensure complete recovery, but it does offer aid during tough times." 
   Three separate designations were made for the various counties: 
   * Curry and Roosevelt counties were included in the affected area surrounding Bailey County, Texas, that suffered losses caused by excessive rain, flash flooding, hail, high winds, and lightning that occurred on Oct. 5. 
   * Curry and Quay counties were designated contiguous to Deaf Smith County, Texas, in regards to the results of hail on Aug. 12, and excessive rain and hail that occurred on Sept. 22. 
   * Eddy and Otero counties were included with Culberson County, Texas, as suffering losses due to drought that has continued since Jan. 1. 
   The designation will allow farmers in the eligible counties to apply for Farm Service Agency low-interest emergency loans based on the extent of losses, security available and repayment ability.
