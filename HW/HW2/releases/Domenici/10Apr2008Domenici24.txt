SEN. DOMENICI TOLD OF PROGRESS IN EQUIPPING NEW MEXICO NATIONAL GUARD
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today said he likes the progress the Defense Department is making to re-equip the New Mexico Army National Guard, but that it will take due diligence to ensure the Guard has full equipment readiness. 
   The Pentagon formally responded to inquiries Domenici issued at a February Senate Budget Committee hearing on the FY2009 defense budget and war costs. Domenici's questions were prompted by A 2006 General Accountability Office report that showed that the New Mexico Army National Guard had less than 40 percent of the total amount of dual-use equipment it is authorized to have for war-fighting missions--ranking it lowest in the nation.
   In response, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England indicated that the New Mexico Army National Guard had 89 percent of its critical dual-use equipment at the end of FY2007, with 77 percent available for emergency use in the state of New Mexico. He also noted that in the next two years, the New Mexico Guard is slated to receive 4,155 new pieces of equipment.
   "It seems the New Mexico National Guard is getting some new equipment. The real test will be whether this progress is sustained, particularly as our guardsmen are cycled for service in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Congress must fund these equipment needs and the Pentagon must ensure that our Guard units meet equipment readiness requirements both for work overseas and here at home," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
   England pointed out that 66 percent of overall "equipment on hand" (EOH) is available to state governors. In New Mexico, the National Guard reported 63 percent of its EOH is currently available for state use--or 18,000 out of 29,000 pieces of equipment.
   The President's $49 billion request for the Guard and Reserve was included in the administration's budget plan sent to Congress in February. England told Domenici the Army currently plans to have 100 percent EOH for the Army National Guard and Army Brigade Combat Teams by FY2015, and 100 percent EOH for the U.S. Army Reserve by 2019.
   England said the Army has increased Army National Guard equipment funding to an average of $5 billion a year from FY2005 to FY2013. He reported that, based on the Bush administration's current funding assumptions, about 400,000 pieces of new equipment are expected to be distributed in FY2008 and FY2009, and more than 240,000 from FY2010 to FY2013.
   Domenici serves on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that last year added $980.0 million for National Guard equipment nationwide, whereas the initial FY2008 budget requested nothing for the procurement of National Guard equipment.
