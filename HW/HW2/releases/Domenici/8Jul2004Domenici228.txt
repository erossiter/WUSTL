REPS. PEARCE, WILSON, SEN. DOMENICI WELCOME REVERAL ON CAMP SIERRA BLANCA
  Reps. Steve Pearce and Heather Wilson along with Sen. Pete Domenici welcomed news that the state of New Mexico had reversed course and would not close the doors of Camp Sierra Blanca in Lincoln County, New Mexico.  
   "While I am pleased with the reversal, I hope the state will not prevent youths from being referred to Camp Sierra Blanca which could in turn cause it to suffer financially and be unable to operate in the future," Pearce said. 
   "It's great to know that Camp Sierra Blanca will continue to be there for the New Mexico young people who need these important services," Wilson said. "I'm proud to have supported the start of Camp Sierra Blanca, and I look forward to seeing the camp continue to help our state's youth for years to come." 
   "This camp has been successful in terms of its ability to give at-risk youth a new chance to improve their lives. I am very pleased the decision to close it has been reversed and that the state will find the means to improve its operations," Domenici said. 
   On June 16, 2004, the Secretary of New Mexico's Child Youth and Families Development Department, Dr. Mary-Dale Bolson, issued a letter announcing the closure of Camp Sierra Blanca in 30 days. 
   Shortly thereafter, Pearce and Wilson along with Senator Domenici wrote to Governor Richardson asking him to re-examine the department's justifications and to reconsider the decision to close Camp Sierra Blanca. 
   In the letter, the delegation scrutinized CYFD's reasoning for the decision which included: under-enrollment; expenses to repair the facilities; and a focus on community-based programs as opposed to juvenile detention centers. The reasons offered by CYFD could not withstand scrutiny and were not supported by the facts.
