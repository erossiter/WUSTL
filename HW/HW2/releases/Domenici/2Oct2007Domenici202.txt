   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici reviews the Base Realignment and Closure activities that led to the Air Force Special Operations Command taking over Cannon Air Force Base at Clovis. 
   03:15 - Domenici says the AFSOC transition at Cannon continues to require additional aircraft to advance Special Operations training and additional military construction funding to build the hangars for these aircraft. 
   03:56 - Domenici recounts the change of command ceremony Monday at Cannon, and lauds the Air Force leadership that participated. 
   04:33 - Domenici explains the difficulty facing the Senate and House in finalizing the FY2008 funding levels for the DOE national laboratories, including Los Alamos and Sandia. He discussed the continuing resolution that will fund the labs through Nov. 16 at FY2007 funding levels, and suggests that continuing this funding level throughout FY2008 might be the best option for the labs. 
   07:18 - Domenici says it will be tough to reach an agreement to maintain FY2007 funding levels for the national laboratories, and predicts that it will take a bipartisan effort to promote and gain approval for this option. He notes that he has asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to weigh in on the impact of the weapons program cuts passed by the House in its FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. 
   09:44 - Domenici says the entire DOE weapons complex could face $600 million in cuts under the House bill, with about $400 million of that amount to be taken from Los Alamos National Laboratory. He says such dramatic defense cuts have never been taken from a "living laboratory" like LANL, and questions the rationale of basing such cuts on security problems at the labs. 
   12:46 - Domenici suggests that broader congressional hearings be held to fully discuss the future of the nuclear stockpile work done at the DOE weapons labs and the ramifications of such major cuts. He discusses the notion that these laboratories be used for other purposes, noting that such a change requires congressional authorization and additional funding to carry out. He remarks that using cuts first to force such a change would result in layoffs and the possible closure of a laboratory.
