SEN. DOMENICI EXTOLS CANNON AIR FORCE BASE FOR WINNING NATIONAL RECOGNITION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated the 27th Maintenance Group from Cannon Air Force Base for winning recognition for superb performance in military equipment and weapon systems.  
   The Secretary of Defense Maintenance Awards are given annually to those units that display excellence in readiness and operations. The 27th Maintenance Group was one of just two selected nationally in the large unit category. 
   "This is a good example of the very cost-effective operations at Cannon and shows the contributions Cannon makes on behalf of the military's overall mission. This honor is certainly a shining star for Cannon and evidence that our investment in the base and its personnel have been worthwhile," Domenici said. "Our bases continue to play an active role and I am very proud of their continuing success." 
   The 27th Maintenance Group from Cannon AFB conducts all aircraft maintenance for the F-16 aircraft. Aircraft maintenance training, aircraft maintenance quality assurance, weapons loading and maintenance data analysis functions are all part of this group's mission. 
   In FY2004, Domenici secured $7.7 million for an Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Complex to upgrade facilities and support the efforts of the 27th Maintenance Group.
