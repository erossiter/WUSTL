SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO RECEIVES $780,012 TO HELP NEEDY FAMILIES PAY WINTER HEATING BILLS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that New Mexico is slated to receive over $717,000 in federal emergency contingency funding, including $62,100 in tribal set-aside, to help needy families and seniors afford rapidly escalating winter energy bills.  
   Domenici, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that helps determine federal funding provisions to support the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), supported the inclusion of $2.57 billion in funding for the program as part of the FY2008 omnibus spending bill. The U.S. Department of Human Services (HHS) today announced the distribution of $449 million for the program, including $780,012 for the state of New Mexico. 
   "Higher energy prices have caused drastic increases in costs associated with heating and general utilities, which poses big problems for disadvantaged families and seniors," said Domenici. 
   "Many New Mexico residents have been forced to absorb these costs, causing undue financial hardship. I'm pleased HHS has distributed these funds so that qualifying individuals can begin receiving some level of relief," he said. 
   LIHEAP is a federally-funded program to help eligible low-income households pay for their home heating needs. 
   Individuals wishing to apply for aid through LIHEAP should contact their local or state LIHEAP Agency. New Mexico's program is managed by the State Human Services Department, which can be reached at http://www.hsd.state.nm.us/isd/liheap.html.
