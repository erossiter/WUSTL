  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Institute of American Indian Arts, as well as Navajo Technical College, have been awarded over $1.9 million in grants by the Department of Education (DoED) to expand their programs.  
   "Both of these institutions provide valuable educational opportunities for Indian youth," said Domenici. "The grants from the Department of Education will help both as they seek to expand their educational services for American Indian students." 
   The Institute of American Indian Arts was awarded over $1.4 million to renovate its facilities. Renovations are expected to support its programs and improve enrollment. 
   Navajo Technical College received $475,000 to improve enrollment and retention rates. The school's plans include a new integrated student record and financial system, development of an E-learning capacity, and programs to secure the success of first-year students. 
   Both awards were administered by DoED's Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Program. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in the delegation of funds for federal programs, including those administered by the Department of Education. He also serves on the Indian Affairs Committee.
