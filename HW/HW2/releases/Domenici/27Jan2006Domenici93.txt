SEN. DOMENICI FACILITATES AGREEMENT TO RE-STRIPE MONTA?O BRIDGE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that as a result of a meeting he facilitated between the Army Corps of Engineers and Albuquerque officials this week, the Army Corps will issue a modified permit to re-stripe the Monta?o Bridge to make it four lanes.  
   On Wednesday, Domenici coordinated a meeting between Lieutenant Colonel Todd Wang of the Army Corps of Engineers and Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez in his office to discuss disputed issues between the city and the Corps. As a result of the meeting and subsequent discussions, the affected parties have reached agreement to allow the re-striping of the bridge. 
   "When I learned that both Colonel Wang and Mayor Chavez were in Washington at the same time, I saw it as a good opportunity to try to resolve the Monta?o Bridge permit issues. I'm very pleased that the meeting resulted in the give and take needed to get a plan to re-stripe the bridge. Four lanes should make life easier for commuters," Domenici said. 
   "Measures to minimize noise effects will be undertaken in order to ensure the new traffic pattern is in compliance with applicable agreements. This solution will improve the transportation picture for the West Side while still honoring the environmental review process. I believe this will be resolved by the end of February," he continued. 
   Domenici, who chairs the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee which has jurisdiction over the Army Corps, had urged a swift resolution to the issue, believing that commuters would benefit from additional lanes.
