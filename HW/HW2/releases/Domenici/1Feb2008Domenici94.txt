SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTURE OF LONG-TIME AIDE LYNDEN ARMSTRONG
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced the departure of his long-time staff member and deputy chief of staff Lynden Armstrong, a native of Fort Sumner.  
   Armstrong, a member of his staff since 1995, is leaving Domenici's office to be Chief Clerk of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, the committee that oversees operations throughout the Senate. 
   "Lynden has worked in multiple capacities as a member of my staff for the past 13 years. I credit his intelligence and exceptional work ethic for the stellar operation of my offices in Washington and New Mexico over the past several years," Domenici said. "His work on the Senate Administrative Managers Steering Committee has influenced technological innovations throughout the Senate. I believe the entire Senate will be well-served by his talents as he moves to the Rules Committee." 
   Armstrong, a graduate of Fort Sumner High School, received his B.S. in Animal Science from New Mexico State University, and an MBA from Johns Hopkins University. His roles in Domenici's office have included executive staff assistant and, for the past 10 years, deputy chief of staff for administration. 
   "I, as well as my entire staff, wish him the best as he begins the next phase of his career as the Chief Clerk at the Senate Rules Committee," Domenici continued. 
   First elected in 1972, Domenici is New Mexico's longest serving Senator. He currently serves as ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and is a senior member of both the Senate Appropriations and Senate Budget Committeees. He also serves on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
