SAN ILDEFONSO CLAIMS BILL CLEARS KEY COMMITTEE HURDLE
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today announced that their legislation to implement the San Ildefonso settlement, which was reached last summer between the San Ildefonso Pueblo and the U.S. Forest Service, has cleared a major hurdle. 
   On Wednesday, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Claims Settlement Act (S.1773) passed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, on which Domenici serves. The bill would formally settle San Ildefonso Pueblo's claim to 7,700 acres of ancestral land, which dates back to 1951. Santa Clara Pueblo and Los Alamos County are also impacted by the settlement.
   "Today marks the first step in the legislative process for the San Ildefonso settlement agreement. I know that it has been a long wait. The Forest Service and Department of Justice deserve credit for their work to reach a compromise with the Pueblo which will be good for Los Alamos County and for the traditions and cultures of the pueblo," said Domenici.
   "This settlement was years in the making and it's very good news that it now has the support of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee," Bingaman said. "It's my hope that the full Senate moves quickly to adopt this important legislation."
   The agreement is the final settlement of the 1946 Indian Claims Commission Act, which involved more than 600 claims by tribes.
   The agreement will give the pueblo a payment, as well as an opportunity to gain other property from the Santa Fe National Forest. Santa Clara Pueblo has also negotiated the right to acquire certain properties.
   The pact is designed to guarantee Los Alamos County access to water wells and infrastructure, and allow the county to purchase property for future economic development. Also included will be right-of-way passage during emergency situations.
