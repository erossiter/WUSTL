SEN. DOMENICI NOTES CINCO DE MAYO, SET TO CELEBRATE HOLIDAY IN ARTESIA
  Sen. Pete Domenici today marked the commemoration of Cinco de Mayo with a message directed at all Americans as the Congress grapples with border security and immigration reform issues. 
   Domenici will celebrate the day, which commemorates the 1862 defeat of French troops by Mexicans at Puebla, Mexico, at a community-wide Cinco de Mayo celebration hosted by the city of Artesia. As part of the program, Domenici will join Artesia Mayor Manuel Madrid in honor long-time educator José Gallegos.
   "Cinco de Mayo gives us an occasion to remember the bravery of people in troubled times. Today, in a time when the immigration debate is a divisive one for our nation, I think we would all do well to look at the values that have worked to build American communities and bring them together-no matter what ethnic background," Domenici said.
   Domenici noted that the U.S. Senate is likely to resume consideration of border security and immigration legislation this month.
   "The immigration issue strikes at the heart of who we are as a nation. For that reason there is no shortage of passion and controversy surrounding it," Domenici said. "It is important for all of us to maintain a certain amount of civility in our discourse about this in order to reach a solution as a nation, whether in Washington, D.C., or in communities across America. I hope the Senate will finally agree on a bill that ensures American control of its borders while providing an orderly and humane system to admit those immigrants who want to live and work here and add to our communities."
