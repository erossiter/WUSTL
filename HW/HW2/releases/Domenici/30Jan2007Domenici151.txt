SEN. DOMENICI LAUDS DOE FUNDS FOR POTENTIAL NUKE RECYCLING PLANT SITES IN N.M.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will provide over $2.6 million for two New Mexico sites to conduct suitability studies for a new spent fuel recycling plant.  
   Eleven sites around the country received $10.4 million to conduct detailed site studies to determine the viability of hosting either the Consolidated Fuel Treatment Center or Advanced Burner Reactor, or both. The facilities are part of the Department of Energy's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). 
   The Eddy/Lea Energy Alliance in Hobbs will receive $1.59 million, while EnergySolutions, LCC, in Roswell will obtain $1.13 million for the studies. 
   As then-chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici included $20 million for site studies in the FY2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. Domenici is now ranking member of the subcommittee. 
   "I'm very pleased that two sites in New Mexico are among those being considered for a spent fuel recycling plant. DOE has now taken the next step in the process by awarding funds for site studies in Lea County and Roswell," Domenici said. 
   "Our state is a leader in energy production, and a new facility here would give us a role in advancing nuclear power in the U.S. and building on the nuclear expertise already in New Mexico. Nuclear energy has to be part of any serious long term energy solution, and that means we have to address waste," he continued. 
   Domenici has advocated a three tiered policy for dealing with short, middle- and long-term strategies for waste from nuclear power. The Senator has said that the federal government must honor its obligation to take control of waste stored at more than 60 sites around the country until a spent fuel recycling facility or Yucca Mountain is ready.
