CLOUDCROFT GETS FUNDS TO IMPROVE LOCAL PARK
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the village of Cloudcroft will receive funds from the National Park Service (NPS) to provide better recreational opportunities at Zenith Park.  
   NPS is awarding $60,000 in matching funds through its Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to improve tennis and basketball courts at the public park in Cloudcroft. The total cost of the project is $120,000. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee which sets the funding levels for the LWCF. 
   "Public parks should be a magnet for family and community activities so people of all interests and ages can enjoy," Domenici said. "Zenith Park plays host to many different town events and serves as an everyday spot for recreation. I'm very pleased we can improve upon the tennis and basketballs courts there to make the area newer and more enjoyable for everyone." 
   Zenith Park hosts the annual Easter Egg hunt, Mayfair, July Jamboree and September's Lumberjack Day. Christmas in Cloudcroft was also recently held at the park and included bonfires, music, refreshments, snowmobile rides and a visit from Santa Claus. 
   Since LWCF inception in 1964, the LWCF has used returns from oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf to provide conservation funds that finance the procurement of public lands. More than $3.2 billion have been matched by state and local contributions and of the total number of projects, approximately 10,000 have helped states acquire 2.3 million acres of park land.
