   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says he is hopeful that Congress will work with the President during the new 109th Congress, but that he is troubled by repeated vows by Democratic leadership that it will fight every Bush initiative. He said the session could be "difficult and acrimonious" if the minority party in Congress truly embraces this tactic. 
   01:10 - Domenici says he will use the 109th Congress to push for a bipartisan National Energy Policy Bill, pointing out that the differences are not as big as the need for such important legislation. He says he will work diligently on reforming Social Security, providing an optional plan for allowing some private investment. He says he will also push for New Mexico-focused projects, including various water projects like the middle Rio Grande bosque and silvery minnow work or the Navajo Water Settlement. He says BRAC will also be an issue this year. 
   03:29 - Domenici says DOE extended the comment period for a proposed new contract to manage and operate Los Alamos National Laboratory because it believes more parties need to evaluate the plan and their options. He says he expects to see some "unexpected things" as the contracting process moves forward, and says he believes the University of California will put forth a serious bid. 
   05:08 - Domenici says he will continue to look into whether additional federal funding can be provided to the Albuquerque Indian Health Center, which serves urban American Indians. 
   07:00 - Domenici says he is already making efforts to open the door to compromises with Senate Democrats on a new Energy Policy Bill. He says there are a number of issues that can be resolved, and that he hopes Senate Democrats will agree to work on a bipartisan effort to finalize a bill this year. 
   08:50 - Domenici says he believes the divisive rhetoric surrounding the new federal prescription drug benefits for seniors will calm down now that work is being done to fully implement the benefits program. He expects the issue of importing prescription drugs from Canada to remain, although he believes that debate has peaked. 
   10:06 - Domenici says he is very pleased to see the Navajo Nation, the state of New Mexico and other parties moving forward on a Navajo Water Settlement agreement. He says the agreement will be useful, although the federal government will not be bound by it. He says it is important that the Interior Department be actively involved in the settlement plan that will also include a pipeline infrastructure to provide potable water to the Navajo Nation and the city of Gallup. In due course, he says his committee will consider legislation that mimics the settlement agreement. 
   13:47 - Domenici says he is not aware of any undue secrecy by the firm planning to put a uranium enrichment plant in Lea County, or other DOE-contract firms that are concerned about homeland security. He says the Lea County initiative will move forward and that issues like tailings will be resolved in the ongoing licensing process. 
   16:40 - Domenici says he is supportive of trying to find additional Indian Health Service funding for the AIHC. He says the budget problems at the AIHC are linked to the fact that individual pueblos in the Albuquerque region are providing more health care at the pueblos and drawing funding away from the AIHC. 
   19:03 - Domenici says he is not overly concerned about American border protection because more National Guard units are being deployed to the war in Iraq. While border security is important, he says he is worried about the burden being placed on the National Guard through extended deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He says there will have to be realignments made in terms of the deployments, and greater attention to recruitment and retention. 
   21:15 - Domenici says he does not believe there was any more election shenanigans in 2004 than any other national election. He says he will reintroduce legislation to clarify voter identification requirements. He says it would also be useful to provide more training for county clerks and polls workers in order to make future elections "more certain." 
   25:59 - Domenici says he believes the legality of cockfighting should be left up to the state to decide, as he considers it a states rights issue. The fact that New Mexico is one of two states where cockfighting is legal "doesn't strike me as being anything we should be proud of," he says. 
   27:03 - Domenici says he has never touted drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or his national energy policy plan as a means to American "energy independence." He says, though, that he supports the greatest level of American energy production. He says the goal is to shift the margins of American energy dependence by expanding its own production of all types of energy sources. He says ANWR energy production would be done under specified standards so as to leave a very small footprint on the environment. 
   30:55 - Domenici says he believes Supreme Court Justice Scalia will be the next Chief Justice when William Rehnquist eventually steps down. He says he will not speculate on whom the President might nominate to be a justice on the Supreme Court. Troubled by talk that a Bush Supreme Court nominee might be filibustered, he says he would reluctantly support a plan to change the rules of the Senate regarding breaking filibusters.
