SEN. DOMENICI: N.M. LEGAL AID RECEIVES GRANT TO IMPROVE SERVICES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that New Mexico Legal Aid will benefit from a $25,000 grant from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC).  
   Funds were awarded as part of the LSC's Technology Initiative Grants (TIG) program and will help New Mexico Legal Aid continue work on its website. 
   "Quality legal assistance is often expensive and difficult to afford for low-income individuals," said Domenici. "New Mexico Legal Aid works to bridge this gap. I am pleased to see these funds awarded to New Mexico Legal Aid." 
   New Mexico Legal Aid is a non-profit law office that provides legal services to disadvantaged individuals involved in civil cases. 
   LSC was created by Congress in 1974 and seeks to provide high quality civil legal assistance to disadvantaged Americans. Its 2007 TIG program awarded $2.1 million in grants to programs in 25 states. For more information visit: www.lsc.gov.
