SEN. DOMENICI: NEW TRANING CAN LEAD DISABLED NEW MEXICANS TO EMPLOYMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that two entities charged with providing vocational services for blind and disabled New Mexicans will together receive over $47,000 to improve vocational services.  
   The New Mexico Commission for the Blind and the New Mexico Division of Vocational Rehabilitation have both been awarded for the continuing education rehabilitation personnel from the U.S. Department of Education (DoED). 
   "Both of these institutions work diligently to offer the blind and disabled throughout the state the opportunity for desirable and sustainable employment," said Domenici. "I am pleased that this funding is made available to improve specific areas laid out by students in a way that benefits staff, participants and the community." 
   Both grants were awarded through the DoED State Vocational Unit In-Service Training Program that helps staff use feedback from participants to tailor services to address areas needing further attention. 
   The New Mexico Division of Vocational Rehabilitation will receive $28,405 to increase the skills of counselors and staff in order to improve employment services offered to individuals with disabilities. 
   The New Mexico Commission for the Blind will receive $19,412 to improve a variety of services, including job development and placement, transition activities for youth from school to employment, rehabilitation technology for the blind, and independent living services. The Commission is the sole provider of occupational assistance to visually impaired New Mexicans. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Domenici helps set funding levels for DoED and its programs.
