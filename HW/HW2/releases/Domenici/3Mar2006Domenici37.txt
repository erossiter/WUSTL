SEN. DOMENICI: HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT 2006 GRANT APPLICATIONS FROM NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday will begin accepting applications for the 2006 cycle of grant awards to help local fire departments and nonaffiliated EMS organizations acquire equipment, vehicles, and training.  
   Starting Monday, New Mexico fire departments and nonaffiliated EMS organizations may begin applying for grants from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). Applications are available online at www.firegrantsupport.com. The application deadline is 5 p.m., April 7. 
   "New Mexico's fire departments have received millions from this program to keep our first responders ready to handle emergencies," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that funds these grant programs. 
   "I encourage volunteer and civic fire departments, as well as EMS groups, to apply for these grants that can help our brave firefighters and EMS personnel better serve their communities," he said. 
   New Mexico received more than $2.2 million from DHS in over 30 grants to fire stations around the state in 2005. For instance, the Mora Fire Chief's Association this week was awarded a $34,200 DHS Fire Prevention and Safety Grant to implement a fire safety program for children and the elderly. 
   Congress authorized DHS to award $648 million in FY2006 for AFGP. Of this, $108 million is allocated for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants and a minimum of $27 million is specified for Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) grants. DHS will solicit applications for these distinct programs at a later date. 
   For additional information applicants may call the fire grant help line toll free at 866-274-0960 or email questions to FireGrants@dhs.gov.
