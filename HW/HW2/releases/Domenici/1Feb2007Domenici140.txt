SAYING WAGE INCREASE 'LONG OVERDUE,' SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE BY $2.10
  Sen. Pete Domenici today continued his long-standing record of voting to increase the federal minimum wage, supporting a Senate package that will increase the hourly wage to $7.25 and offer tax incentives to small businesses.  
   Domenici, who brokered the 1996 compromise that led to the last minimum wage hike, voted for the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (HR.2). The Senate measure, passed 94-3, will increase the federal minimum wage by $2.10 in three phases over the next 26 months. 
   "The current federal minimum wage just isn't sufficient. Now is the time to raise the minimum wage. In fact, it's long overdue," said Domenici, who endorsed passage of a similar package at the end of the 109th Congress. 
   "It has been 10 years since Congress last voted to raise the minimum wage. In the meantime, our cost-of-living has increased annually and those who earn this wage have struggled to meet their most basic needs," he said. 
   Unlike the measure passed by the House of Representatives, the Senate bill contains tax credits to encourage small businesses to continue to explore new investments and make improvements to their business property. The House and Senate must reach an agreement on the tax credits before HR.2 can be sent to President Bush to be signed into law. 
   "This bill will extend the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce, such as low-income workers, welfare and food stamp recipients, and high-risk youth. The work opportunity tax credit will also apply to the hiring of veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks. I believe that these tax credits will be of benefit to our small business owners," Domenici said. 
   The Senate, led by Republican Senators, insisted on the tax relief provisions in HR.2: 
   * Expensing - A one-year extension of a provision allowing small businesses to combine as much as $112,000 in expenses into one annual tax deduction. 
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit - A five-year extension of the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce. There is also a modification to the work opportunity tax credit to include a tax credit for employing veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks. 
   * Leasehold Improvements- An extension through March 31, 2008, of provisions allowing property owners to more quickly deduct the cost of making improvements to a restaurant or to leased property. It also extends the provision to apply to improvements made to owner-occupied retailer space and for the construction of new restaurants. 
   * Cash Method of Accounting- A permanent change to the tax code allowing more businesses to simplify bookkeeping by allowing the use of the cash method of accounting for tax purposes. 
   * S Corp Reforms- A modification to the standards allowing small businesses to qualify for or stay within the S Corp tax rules.
