BILL TO RENEW, EXPAND HEAD START SIGNED INTO LAW
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today praised the enactment of legislation to reauthorize and expand Head Start, the successful federal early education program that serves thousands of New Mexico children.  
   President Bush today signed into law the "Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007," which was given final approval by the Senate in November. The legislation renews the Head Start program through 2012 and provides for the expansion of both Head Start and Early Head Start programs. 
   Domenici has been a consistent supporter of the Head Start Program, which in 2006 served almost 7,500 children in New Mexico with the support of more than $51.7 million in federal funding. Nationally, Head Start serves more than 900,000 children through a network of public and private agencies. 
   "I believe this new law will improve Head Start and make it a more effective early education program. Implementing these changes will help more New Mexico children receive the support they need to excel in school," Domenici said. 
   The bipartisan agreement on renewing Head Start comes after four years of partisan stalemates. The program was last authorized in 1998, and its current authorization expired in 2003. HR.1429 sets new standards and measures for Head Start programs, improves coordination with other early childhood education programs, and strengthens program accountability. 
   Domenici noted that the bill, among other provisions, would: 
   * Provide for the expansion of both Head Start and Early Head Start programs with additional funds going to states serving fewer than 60 percent of eligible children; 
   * Establish annual $10 million increases for both the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program and the Indian Head Start program; 
   * Strengthen the Head Start workforce skills by establishing goals for educational standards for Head Start teachers, curriculum specialists and teacher assistants; 
   * Require all Head Start teachers to have at least 15 hours of in-service training every year; 
   * Require Head Start teachers to receive on-going literacy training, including methods to best meet the needs of English language learners; 
   * Increases accountability and improves the overall quality of Head Start grantees by requiring all grants to be designated for renewal every five years. 
   Domenici today expressed hope that Congress will be able to rewrite the appropriations bill that funds Head Start, a measure vetoed by President Bush last month. The vetoed FY2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Bill contained $7.0 billion for Head Start programs next year, a $300 million increase over the budget request.
