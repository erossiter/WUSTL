NEW MEXICO DELEGATION PRESSES MEXICAN AMBASSADOR TO BROKER AGREEMENT WITH N.M. CATTLE RANCH
  Members of the New Mexico congressional delegation, including Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman and Representative Steve Pearce, today called on the Mexican government to come to a mutually-beneficial agreement with a Columbus ranch which has portions of a cattle fence located in Mexico.  
   In a letter sent to Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan, the New Mexico lawmakers expressed concern over a recent request made by the Mexican government for the immediate removal of a portion of cattle fence, owned by Johnson Ranches LLC of Luna County, that is actually located in Mexico. 
   Pointing to the fact that the existing fence benefits both Mexico and the United States, the delegation pressed the Mexican government, through Sarukhan, to reach an agreement with the ranch. 
   "We believe the existing fence benefits parties on both sides of the border by preventing the intermingling of livestock and the spread of animal diseases. Therefore, we are hopeful that the Mexican government will work with Johnson Ranches LLC in an effort to resolve this matter in a manner that is agreeable to both parties," the lawmakers wrote. 
   The cattle fence was erroneously constructed on the Mexican side of the border over 30 years ago in cooperation with the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC). The error was only recently detected after an aerial survey of the U.S.-Mexico border was conducted and IBWC determined that the private cattle fence belonging to Johnsons Ranches is located in Mexico.
