SEN. DOMENICI PLEASED INTERIOR SECRETARY NORTON WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today said he is very pleased that President Bush has invited Interior Secretary Gale Norton to continue to lead the vast Department of the Interior in a second Bush term.  
   Domenici, who also serves on the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, issued the following statement regarding Secretary Norton, her accomplishments and future goals: 
   "I am very pleased that the President has invited Secretary Norton to remain in his administration. Over past four years, Gale Norton has proven herself as a results-oriented leader who is adept at finding balanced policies that protect our federal lands, the environment and wildlife. 
   "It is fair to say she deserves credit for helping us pass Healthy Forest legislation. This is a progressive program that will save vast tracts of pristine forests from wildfire and improve the overall health of our national forests. 
   "She has worked closely with Congress to tackle the maintenance backlog in our parks, the backlog of grazing permits on BLM lands and our energy challenges on all federal lands open for energy development. 
   "I also believe Secretary Norton is making significant advances in meeting the federal government's responsibilities to American Indians and native peoples. These are serious, complex and difficult issues, but she has not shied away from any of them and has made good progress, particularly in the areas of Indian health and education. 
   "We have made considerable progress in all of these areas, but there is much more to do. I am very pleased Secretary Norton will continue to make a strong contribution to our efforts as Secretary of Interior."
