SENATE PASSES SEN. DOMENICI-BACKED $3.0 BILLION EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY PLAN
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today joined the Senate in supporting passage of a plan to make $3.0 billion in emergency funding immediately available to better secure U.S. borders and to handle illegal immigrants now in the country.  
   The Senate voted 89-1 to pass a reworked amendment based on the "Border Security First" plan Domenici cosponsored Wednesday. The new amendment, which Domenici also cosponsored, was added to the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill (HR.2638). The Senate-approved amendment was pared down from the original Domenici-cosponsored plan to overcome partisan objections. 
   "The hue and cry from the American people has been to secure the borders, and this plan provides the resources to immediately accelerate plans to do just that. The $3.0 billion in emergency funding will address some of the most critical security problems we have on the border," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   "I regret that our original plan, which would have maintained the National Guard presence on the border, ran into opposition. I will continue to push to keep the 'Operation Jump Start' project fully operational," he said. 
   The amendment would make $3.0 billion in emergency funding available for the administration to ensure that within two years: the Border Patrol has hired, trained and deployed to a total of 23,000 agents; 700 miles of border fencing has been constructed; at least 300 miles of border vehicle barriers exist; four unmanned aerial vehicles are deployed; 105 radar and camera towers are installed; and at least 45,000 beds are available to detain illegal immigrants. 
   The Senate-passed emergency border plan also says funding should be made available to support the following: 
   * Allow the Department of Homeland Security to present a photo electronically to an employer so that the employer may confirm the identity of an employee; 
   * Require mandatory detention of immigrants who overstay their visa by 60 days; 
   * Increase penalties for illegal entrants who are criminals and for those who reentered the United States after being deported; and 
   * Reimburse local governments that choose to cooperate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Directorate to enforce immigration laws.
