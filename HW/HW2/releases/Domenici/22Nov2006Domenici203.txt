SEN. DOMENICI WISHES NEW MEXICANS A HAPPY THANKSGIVING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement wishing New Mexicans a Happy Thanksgiving: 
   "Nancy and I wish every New Mexican a safe, relaxing and enjoyable Thanksgiving. This special holiday is a time for families to reconnect, spend time together and focus on the truly important things in life.
   "Thanksgiving is also a time to remember those brave men and women who are serving our nation and keeping us safe. Members of our Armed Forces and their families have made tremendous sacrifices, particularly in the last few years. I know it has not been easy on them, but they are in our prayers.
   "I'm glad that members of the 116th Transportation Company are safely back home for the holidays, but my heart goes out to other New Mexicans--and Americans-who have made the ultimate sacrifice."
   Domenici's New Mexico and Washington, D.C. offices will be closed on Thursday, Nov. 23 and Friday, Nov. 24 to observe the holiday.
