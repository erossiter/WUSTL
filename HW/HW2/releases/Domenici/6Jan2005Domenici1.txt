SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY CONTRACT COMMENT PERIOD EXTENSION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged the public to wisely use a two-week extension granted by the Department of Energy to comment on a plan for awarding a new management and operating contract for Los Alamos National Laboratory.  
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, today learned that the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration has decided to accept additional public comment through Friday, Jan. 21-two weeks past its initial Jan. 7 deadline for public comment on its draft Request for Proposal (RFP) on a new LANL management and operating contract. 
   Domenici, who believes the extension will further compound a contracting process that is already behind schedule, advised the public to take full advantage of the additional time to review the draft RFP. 
   "I am concerned about the time crunch the NNSA will find itself in as the current contract expiration date draws near. This is a complex contracting process that is already behind schedule. It must be done right," Domenici said. "The NNSA decision to extend the comment period has apparently been deemed useful, and I trust those interested in the LANL contract process will use this new time productively." 
   "It is clear there are significant and critical modifications that need to be made in the RFP. I have problems with the provisions dealing with health, retirement and other benefits for workers, as well as aspects dealing with community support and economic development. Scientific capabilities and other evaluation criteria must also be addressed," Domenici said. 
   The draft RFP is available at the NNSA Service Center's LANL M&O Contract Competition Website: http://www.doeal.gov/LANLContractRecompete/Default.htm. Responses to questions and other information about the draft RFP will also be posted to this site. 
   The current LANL management and operating contract expires Sept. 30, 2005. NNSA intends to select a contractor this summer and begin full contract performance Oct. 1, 2005.U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today encouraged the public to wisely use a two-week extension granted by the Department of Energy to comment on a plan for awarding a new management and operating contract for Los Alamos National Laboratory.
