SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR WSMR HOUSING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today commended the Department of the Army for authorizing over $13 million for family housing to be built at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico.  
   The Army gave a $13,549,600 contract to Hunt Building Corporation, an El Paso, Texas company, to design and build 48 single family housing units at WSMR. The WSMR housing funding was included in the FY2004 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. 
   "This contract for military housing is directly linked to the quality of life of hard-working military personnel and their families at WSMR," said Domenici, member of the Senate Defense Appropriation Subcommittee. 
   The WSMR project, estimated for completion Sept. 30, 2006, will demolish 41 existing housing units and remove harmful asbestos and lead-based paint. The project will provide safe, new homes for military personnel and their families in the area. 
   Since 1970, Hunt has focused on the design and construction of military housing through the Department of Defense's military construction process.
