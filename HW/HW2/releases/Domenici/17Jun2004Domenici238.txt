USDA PROVIDES BACKING TO SAVE JOBS IN CARLSBAD, EUNICE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today commended the Department of Agriculture for approving over $1 million to ABC Rental Tool Company, which will create seven new jobs and retain 32 in Carlsbad and Eunice.  
   Rural Development, a division of the USDA, has approved the loan through the Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program that helps create jobs by financially backing rural businesses. 
   "This loan will fuel economic growth by creating new jobs and strengthening existing businesses," said Domenici. "ABC Rental has branches in both Carlsbad and Eunice so the funds will actually spur both communities." 
   The loan will be used to buy machinery and equipment for ABC Rental Tool Company. 
   Western Commerce Bank in Hobbs will issue the $1.2 million loan to ABC Rental. Loan proceeds may be used for working capital, machinery and equipment, buildings and real estate, and certain types of debt refinancing.
