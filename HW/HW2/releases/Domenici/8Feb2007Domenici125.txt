SEN. DOMENICI VISITS FT. BLISS COMMANDER, ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today met with General Robert P. Lennox, Commander at Ft. Bliss, to discuss future work opportunities between Fort Bliss and New Mexico military installations.  
   Greater cooperative ventures with New Mexico military installations are expected as Ft. Bliss becomes home to the U.S. Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS), particularly at White Sands Missile Range. 
   FCS is a multi-faceted program that will feature an unprecedented level of integration and cooperation encompassing vehicles, surveillance equipment, arms, communications equipment and new tactics designed to improve efficiency. 
   Domenici Thursday also announced that the Army has awarded a $3 million contract to The Boeing Co. to provide micro aerial vehicle systems to benefit FCS. Ninety percent of the work will be carried out at The Boeing Co. in Albuquerque. 
   "The FCS holds a lot of potential for our military and for the overall future of Fort Bliss and our military facilities in New Mexico. I appreciate General Lennox visiting with me, and I am especially pleased that Boeing's operation in Albuquerque will be carrying out the bulk of this new contract to support the FCS," Domenici said. 
   The president's FY2008 proposed budget has requested $3.6 billion for FCS research, testing and development, as well as an additional $79.5 million for FCS procurement. 
   As a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici last year obtained $2.6 million for an Environmental Impact Statement for WSMR in the FY2007 Defense Appropriations Bill which was recently signed into law. The EIS will help WSMR prepare for future FCS testing.
