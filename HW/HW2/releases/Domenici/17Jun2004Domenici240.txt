SEN. DOMENICI, REP. PEARCE LINK BORDER JOB GROWTH TO NEED FOR HAZMAT FACILITY AT SANTA TERESA
  Sen. Pete Domenici and Rep. Steve Pearce today said housing an emergency response team at Santa Teresa could help draw business and jobs to the border region, and encouraged the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) to help build the facility.  
   In a letter to EDA Regional Director Pedro Garza, Domenici and Pearce asked that the agency support a Do?a Ana County application for $1.1 million to build storage and training facilities in Santa Teresa for the county's Hazardous Incident Response Team. 
   The lawmakers noted that plans call for construction of the facility in the Paso del Norte Borderplex, which is in an area with over 50 industrial parks. However, the region lags behind in job creation, employment and personal income. 
   "One of the major concerns of investors to develop in the region is the lack of a hazardous response team to serve the area. The development will enable the private sector to attract more companies to locate in the Industrial Parks and Airport; therefore jobs will be created as the result of the expansion," said Domenici and Pearce in the letter. 
   The facilities will be built at a site adjacent to the Santa Teresa Airport, and will be owned and operated by Do?a Ana County. It is expected that facility may also attract additional interest in the airport. 
   The request comes after Congress appropriated $1.2 million in FY2002 to purchase equipment and provide initial haz-mat training. 
   "In order to continue the development of this project, it is essential to provide a facility to store this equipment and provide a training location. Without the building to house the hazardous materials equipment, the use of this congressional funding will provide little benefit to the region that urgently needs the use of a Hazardous Incident Response Team," Domenici and Pearce wrote Garza.
