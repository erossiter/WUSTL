SEN. DOMENICI: UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEADS RESEARCH TO TREAT COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the University of New Mexico (UNM) has received a federal grant to develop a website designed to prevent and reduce binge drinking among college students.  
   The $525,315 award was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. 
   "This project will allow UNM to develop a website that assesses a student's drinking level and offers advice and options. Binge drinking continues to be a dangerous trend on college campuses with serious ramifications, and I am pleased UNM is addressing the issue," Domenici said. "Past treatment programs have not produced the type of results we need, and this research should help us determine what other approaches are available." 
   The grant will support the development of an interactive website that will ask the participant questions about their drinking habits, assess their answers, and give corrective feedback. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness will also be determined.
