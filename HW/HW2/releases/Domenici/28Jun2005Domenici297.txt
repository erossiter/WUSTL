SEN. DOMENICI GAINS DOE COMMITMENT TO FUND LOS ALAMOS SKI HILL CONNECTOR ROAD
  Just days after the Department of Energy told Los Alamos county administrators there were insufficient funds to build a Los Alamos Ski Hill connector road, Sen. Pete Domenici today has gained a DOE commitment to fund the project construction.  
   Domenici is chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the national laboratories. 
   Following intervention by Domenici, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Linton Brooks reported that the road will be constructed as part of the Cerro Grande Rehabilitation Project. The road was previously to have been part of the Los Alamos Security Perimeter Project but the project was cut by the NNSA due to unforeseen cost increases. 
   "I'm very pleased that the NNSA has listened to my concerns and has found a way to build a connector road for the Los Alamos Ski Hill. Including the road construction project with the Cerro Grande Rehabilitation Project makes sense because the road can be used as an emergency evacuation route. The construction of this road will allow for traffic to flow better and will also make the area more secure," Domenici said. 
   Last year, as part of the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, Domenici provided $20 million to fund the Security Perimeter project, which was slated to include the Ski Hill bypass. The NNSA eliminated the road when it encountered a cost increase due to a rapid increase in fuel, materials, and labor costs, along with an increase in the backlog of construction work in northern New Mexico. 
   The Cerro Grande Rehabilitation Project will have sufficient funds to build the bypass and fits into the mission of the project because the new road will allow for better access in the event of an emergency.
