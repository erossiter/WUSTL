SEN. DOMENICI SAYS GRANTS WILL HELP NEW MEXICO TRIBES CONSERVE FISH, WILDLIFE
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have awarded over $1 million to five Indian tribes throughout New Mexico to preserve and restore fish and wildlife resources. 
   The funds are awarded through the Tribal Landowner Incentive Program and Tribal Wildlife Grants Program. Both programs are designed to assist federally recognized Indian tribes to protect, restore and manage habitat for species at risk including federally listed endangered or threatened species.
   "The fish and wildlife resources that these funds are protecting are very important to the culture of these Indian tribes. Often time, tribes set the pace in wildlife protection. I am pleased to see these programs facilitate partnerships between tribal and federal agencies in an effort to protect endangered wildlife and their natural habitats in New Mexico," Domenici said.
   The Pueblo of Santo Domingo will receive $148,348 to restore the Rio Galisteo.
   The Pueblo of Laguna will receive $246,100 to assist in the baseline characterization of resources and riparian habitat restoration.
   The Pueblo of San Juan will receive $249,990 to assist in the wetland restoration of the Ohkay Owingeh fish pond.
   The Pueblo of Santa Clara will receive $249,411 for riparian and wetland habitat re-creation.
   The Pueblo of Taos will receive $249,829 to restore bighorn sheep along the northern Rio Grande.
   Domenici serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior which sets funding levels for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.
