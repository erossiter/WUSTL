  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced the names of 50 high school students in New Mexico who he plans to nominate for potential admission to one of the United States military service academies this fall.  
   Nominees were selected on the recommendation of Domenici's Academy Review Board, following an intense interview and assessment process that considered their academic, athletic, extracurricular, and leadership abilities. 
   "These students represent some of the finest young people New Mexico has to offer, and I'm impressed by their demonstrated ability and leadership," said Domenici. 
   "I'm sure they will represent New Mexico well as they apply for admittance to these top-notch institutions, and I commend their desire to work hard as they serve the United States," he said.
