SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRIEF DELAY IN MAKING LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY CONTRACT DECISION
  In response to news that the Department of Energy will not announce the winning bid to operate Los Alamos National Laboratory on Dec. 1, as previously expected, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici issued the following statement: 
   "I have been notified that there will be a brief delay in announcing the winning bid to operate Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
   "I continue to have faith that DOE is conducting a fair, thorough and exhaustive evaluation of the two bids, and I'm confident that no matter what the outcome, the lab will have an excellent management team and the employees will be well treated. I do not expect this delay to inhibit lab operations." 
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee which funds the DOE national laboratories.
