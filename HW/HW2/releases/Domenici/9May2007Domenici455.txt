SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR N.M. HOUSING SERVICES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded over $11.4 million to support housing programs across the state. 
   The state of New Mexico received $8.9 million total to improve housing opportunities for disadvantaged individuals statewide. Similarly, Albuquerque also received $2.5 million in overall HUD funds.
   "Housing is a basic need that is sadly not an option for many New Mexicans," said Domenici. "I am happy to announce these HUD funds to provide housing opportunities statewide in the hope that it will lead to better, more fulfilling lives for many of my constituents." HUD administered the awards under the American Dream Downpayment Inititative (ADDI), Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), HOME, and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs. All programs provide federal funds to improve housing assistance to disadvantaged and low-income individuals.
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federally subsidized programs, including those administered by HUD.
