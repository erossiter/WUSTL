TAPPING PETROLEUM RESERVE NOT ANSWER TO LOWERING GASOLINE PRICES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today mocked suggestions that tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) would work to reduce escalating gasoline prices.  
   In a floor speech to the Senate, Domenici chided lawmakers who criticize President Bush for not tapping the SPR to address gasoline prices. He charged that these same critics are supporting a filibuster of the comprehensive national energy policy bill that would increase domestic energy production. 
   "I understand that somebody around here wants to offer a resolution that we ought to fix this problem with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve," said Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   "If that's the case, we ought to have are resolution that says the Senate wants Bin Ladin to turn himself in to America. Why should we do that? Because that is apt to happen as we are apt to save anything on the price of gasoline with a resolution that says use the SPR. We tried that once and it saved all of one cent a gallon."
