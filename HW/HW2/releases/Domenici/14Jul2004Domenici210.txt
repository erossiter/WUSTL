SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA AWARDS $2.9 MILLION FOR DAMAGE DONE IN ALBUQUERQUE BY APRIL FLOODING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded $2.9 million in emergency funding awarded to New Mexico to repair structural damages sustained during heavy storms and flooding in early April in the Albuquerque area.  
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, awarded the funds through its Public Assistance program that helps public entities fund the repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of a public facility that is damaged by a disaster. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for FEMA. 
   "April floods caused significant damage to much of Albuquerque including roads, pipelines, and schools throughout the community. The wastewater treatment facility, in particular, sustained damages from large debris blocking entrances and sand and gravel washing into the building," Domenici said. "I am pleased the funds provided by FEMA will help get this facility up and operational again, which is a top priority because it provides an important service for the community." 
   Flood waters from the April 3 flood dumped 2.29 inches of rain in a 24-hour span, more than Albuquerque has seen since 1893. Massive sewer lines broke around Broadway Boulevard and Central Avenue that caused 4,524 cubic yards of silt to accumulate in the plant. 
   Funds will support repairs and preventive procedures including measures that will protect entrances to the facility from future flood debris. 
   FEMA leads the effort to prepare the nation for all hazards and effectively manage the federal response and recovery efforts following any national incident. FEMA also initiates proactive mitigation activities, trains first responders and manages the National Flood Insurance Program and the U.S. Fire Administration.
