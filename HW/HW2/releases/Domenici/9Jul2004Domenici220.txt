SEN. DOMENICI: USDA PROGRAM DIRECTED TOWARD JOB CREATION IN HIDALGO, GRANT COUNTIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised two loan awards from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that give a boost to Santa Fe Ingredients in Animas and Morar, LLC in Silver City.  
   "These loans will give two businesses a head start to help them stay competitive with their neighbors," Domenici said. "Forty jobs will be created in Animas alone, while a new option for travelers will be available in Silver City. I'm pleased the USDA has made these awards." 
   Santa Fe Ingredients in Animas will receive a $600,000 loan to provide permanent financing for a warehouse expansion that will allow them to enter into a new line of chile and chile products for its customers. This expansion will create 40 news jobs while retaining 35 current positions. 
   Morar, LLC in Silver City has been granted a $1,415,000 loan to convert the former Holiday Motor Inn into a Motel 6. In addition to the renovations, the funds will also help refinance existing lender debt and pay other related costs. While providing a new option for tourists and travelers, the project will save five positions for current employees.
