SENATORS INTRODUCE MIDDLE RIO GRANDE ENDANGERED SPECIES COLLABORATIVE LEGISLATION
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today introduced legislation to formally give federal recognition to a five-year effort in New Mexico to bring divergent interests together to address significant water and endangered species issues on the middle Rio Grande.  
   The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program Act is expected to be referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Domenici is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Bingaman is the ranking Democrat on the panel. 
   The legislation would provide the existing New Mexico Middle Rio Grande Collaborative Program with the federal authority it needs to continue its important collaborative, multi-agency effort to improve the river and preserve endangered species like the Rio Grande silvery minnow and Southwestern willow flycatcher. The measure will streamline the decision making process of the program, delegate responsibilities among federal agencies, and provide adequate authority for federal participation in the program. 
   "This bill will provide federal authorization for a successful program based on the premise that it is better to work in the spirit of cooperation to develop solutions to shared problems regarding resource management and meeting the needs of our endangered species. When left up to the courts, there are always losers. The collaborative program is successfully working to avoid that," said Domenici, who first outlined the bill at an early July event on the banks of the Rio Grande. 
   "Over the last few years, there has been a tremendous effort on the part of many to work through the complex endangered species and water use issues in the Rio Grande. Restoring the Rio Grande and protecting the interests of those dependent on its water, however, requires a multiple year commitment and long-term plan. This bill sets up the framework for the coordinated and comprehensive effort we will need for success," Bingaman said. The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program was created by Domenici in 2000 and funded through his Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee since. The program partners federal, state and local governments as well as pueblo, agricultural, environmental and other community interests. 
   The Senate legislation reforms the organization of the program, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the participating federal agencies-the Army Corp of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation and Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   The bill gives the Interior Department management responsibility over the collaborative program executive committee. The Bureau of Reclamation would ensure sufficient flows to meet endangered species purposes, and the Army Corps of Engineers would take over administration of habitat restoration, fish propagation and most construction and river maintenance activities. 
   "Since 2000, the collaborative program has been a remarkable success, bringing together various stakeholders including federal and state agencies, cities, Pueblos, environmental groups, farmers and business interests in an effort to protect our biological heritage and ecological diversity while meeting the needs of those who are dependant on the waters of the Rio Grande. Often, the process has been difficult. However, I'm sure all would agree that it is far preferable to the alternative of continued litigation," Domenici said. 
   Domenici this year included $25 million for the Middle Rio Grande Project in the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, $12.9 million of which is designated for work carried out by the Endangered Species Collaborative Program. He added another $2.0 million for a specific off-channel minnow sanctuary project, which is being built by the Bureau. Domenici has provided almost $30 million through the Bureau of Reclamation since 2001. 
   Congresswoman Heather Wilson, who also participated in the July Rio Grande event in Albuquerque, is expected to introduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives. 
   The following is a summary of the Senate legislation to authorize the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program: 
   PROGRAM GOALS: 
   * Endangered species recovery, including meeting the requirements of the 2003 Biological Opinion; 
   * Coordination of federal and non-federal recovery activities; 
   * Development of recovery plans for the Rio Grande silvery minnow and Southwestern willow flycatcher; and, 
   * Establish organizational hierarchy and voting structure. 
   ORGANIZATION 
   * Department of the Interior would manage (in collaboration with a non-federal co-chairperson) an executive committee that includes members from the Army Corp of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the New Mexico Game and Fish Department, New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, New Mexico Attorney General, the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Water Authority, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, four pueblos (Isleta, Sandia, Santo Domingo, Santa Ana), one farming community representative, and one environmental community representative. 
   * Additional members may be added upon unanimous recommendation of the executive committee, which will not exceed 20 members total. 
   * The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for meeting flow requirements of the 2003 Biological Opinion and other projects determined by the executive committee to promote the recovery of the silvery minnow and willow flycatcher. 
   * The Army Corps of Engineers will provide all administrative support and manage the program implementation team, which has the responsibility of implementing decisions of the executive committee not related to water management. This includes implementation of the remaining elements of the 2003 Biological Opinion. 
   * Federal Agencies, all the members of the executive committee, and entities or individuals willing to sign a memorandum of agreement can volunteer to serve on working groups under the direction of the project implementation team. 
   * All current sub-committees would be either eliminated or transitioned to workgroups. 
   * The Corps would implement the program in collaboration with other members of the program. 
   * Water rights, land rights, pueblo law, the San Juan-Chama Project water waiver, and state laws would be protected 
   ACTIVITIES 
   * Water acquisition and program administration would be funded by the federal government as would 75 percent of the costs of project implementation (a 25 percent cost share, which could be provided through cash or in-kind contributions, would be required by non-federal interests for projects undertaken other than water management).
