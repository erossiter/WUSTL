SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GRANT TO RUIDOSO EDUCATION GROUP FOR NEW MEXICO CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Education (DoED) has awarded $327,450 to Region IX Education Cooperative (RECIX) in Ruidoso to improve children's mental health services in New Mexico schools.  
   The Department of Education administered the grant through the Grants to Improve the Mental Health of Children Program. RECIX plans to utilize funds to increase student access to mental health services by building a statewide network of education partners to coordinate resources and provide technical assistance in the interest of children's mental health. 
   "We can dramatically increase students' education quality by providing mental health services where they are needed," said Domenici. "These funds will help the cooperative increase the ability of New Mexico schools to provide these services. This is particularly important in rural areas where access to mental health care can be limited." 
   RECIX, formed in 1984, coordinates and provides support programs, including health clinics, mental health counseling, career counseling, and family support services for areas primarily surrounding Capitan, Carrizozo, Cloudcroft, Corona, Ruidoso, Hondo, and Tularosa. 
   The organization expects to build on recent expansion of school-based health centers by training school officials on the process of referrals, as well as improving and expanding telehealth services in these school-based health centers. 
   The Grants to Improve the Mental Health of Children Program awards grants to forge cooperation between local school systems and mental health services in order to improve the scope and quality of these services for students. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and plays a role in crafting spending bills for federal projects, including those administered by the Department of Education.
