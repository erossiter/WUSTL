SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES HHS TO NEW MEXICO ORGANIZATIONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded two grants totaling over $450,000 to conduct pregnancy risk assessments and alcohol abuse prevention. 
   "I am always pleased when funds that promote the health and well-being of New Mexicans are awarded. The data that both these grants will collect has, in the past, been very beneficial on many levels," Domenici said.
   The New Mexico Department of Health will receive $135,790 to assess pregnancy risks by conducting surveys of women who recently gave birth. The data will be used extensively to address existing barriers in prenatal care, to establish where to target health education efforts and how to effectively divert health funds.
   Behavior Therapy Associates, LLP in Albuquerque has been awarded $320,145 as part of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. The funds will be used to devise a downloadable training program that can teach individuals how to cutback and moderate their drinking. The program will be targeted towards heavy drinkers who are not considered alcoholics.
   The HHS grants will be distributed through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
