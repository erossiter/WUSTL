SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS OPENING OF MESILLA VALLEY SOCIAL SERVICES CENTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cheered the opening of the newly expanded Community of Hope in Las Cruces that combines the efforts of several charitable organizations to provide services to disadvantaged New Mexicans. 
   Domenici was instrumental in obtaining construction and development funding for the project, securing $1.0 million in FY2003 through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grant program. Domenici serves on the Appropriations Subcommittee that has funding jurisdiction over the EDI program.
   "Community of Hope has used its resources time and time again to reach out to the people of Las Cruces to provide education, counseling and job training to those who most need it. With the completion of Phase III, the many agencies in this partnership can be housed under one roof to provide comprehensive and collaborative help," Domenici said. "I have nothing but praise for this organization and hope, with this new facility, many more New Mexicans will receive these valuable services."
   The Mesilla Valley Community of Hope is an alliance of agencies that address homelessness and poverty in Las Cruces by providing direct services to homeless people. The umbrella organization includes El Caldito Soup Kitchen, St. Luke's Health Care, Hacienda del Sol, Jardin de los Ninos, and Casa de Peregrinos.
   Domenici also introduced the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) bill. PATH funds community-based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, case management and other support services for people who are homeless and suffer from serious mental illnesses.
