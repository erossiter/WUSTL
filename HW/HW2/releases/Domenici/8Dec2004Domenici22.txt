BUSH SIGNS BILL FUNDING NEW MEXICO LABS, WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT, WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that President Bush has signed into law a measure that provides funding levels for the remainder of FY2005 for Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and numerous federal water projects throughout New Mexico. 
   The funding is part of the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act that Bush signed into law on Wednesday. The $388 billion omnibus package includes nine appropriations bills, including the FY2005 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill that funds Energy Department, Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers. (The entire omnibus package is subject to a 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction.)  
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that engineered the final agreement on the $29.02 billion Energy and Water Development portion of the bill. 
   "I am pleased this year's appropriations process is finally over. But the arduous process of getting an Energy and Water bill pieced together has resulted in some healthy funding levels for Sandia and Los Alamos. It also keeps WIPP on course and sustains the federal government's important work on water projects around the state," Domenici said. 
   Domenici used this spending measure to provide funding for a wide variety of projects, including Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) and Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers water projects throughout the state. 
   Within the bill, Domenici added $91.1 million to continue construction of the Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications (MESA) Complex at Sandia National Laboratories. Congress has provided $287 million toward this $463 million project, which is one of the largest federal construction projects undertaken in New Mexico. 
   Domenici secured $30.9 million for the Center for Integrated Nanotechnology, a joint venture of Sandia and Los Alamos located at Kirtland Air Force Base. 
   For LANL, Domenici provided an additional $16 million to provide a total of $40 million to continue work on replacing the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility. The additional funding is intended to keep this project on schedule for a projected 2010 completion date. Domenici secured $10 million for the project in FY2004. 
   Related to water issues in the middle Rio Grande, Domenici allocated $6.15 million to continue Bureau of Reclamation work to sustain the silvery minnow. Within this funding, $2 million is for habitat restoration, $2 million is for water acquisition, $500,000 is for science and monitoring, $275,000 for water and minnow management improvement, $750,000 for biological monitoring, and $625,000 for the management of the program. 
   "This level of funding is sufficient for the Bureau to continue being proactive in addressing the minnow situation on the Rio Grande. The Bureau must continue to be a good partner with the city, state and other water holders to successfully deal with the minnow," Domenici said. 
   In addition, Domenici noted that the bill has $5 million for middle Rio Grande levee repairs. Overall, the Bureau's Middle Rio Grande Project is receiving $29.15 million in FY2005, $13.3 million for resources management and $15.8 million for facilities. 
   The following are highlights of the New Mexico-related spending included by Domenici in the FY2005 Energy & Water Development Appropriations Bill:
