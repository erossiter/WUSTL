SAN FELIPE PUEBLO, N.M. ANTI-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITIONS RECEIVE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded over $800,000 in grant funding to three New Mexico domestic violence programs.  
   "Stopping domestic violence requires a broad effort that targets the problem at multiple levels," said Domenici. "These funds recognize the hard work being done by groups in New Mexico to provide education and assistance related to domestic violence situations." 
   The San Felipe Pueblo received $400,000 for its Domestic Violence Prevention Program (DMVPP). The pueblo expects to improve its response to domestic violence situations, as well as increase public awareness, services and assistance for those it affects. 
   The Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women received $400,000. DOJ funds for the Albuquerque-based coalition will support ongoing Native American domestic violence training and assistance. 
   The DOJ also awarded $83,045 to the New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, a nonprofit organization located in Albuquerque. 
   The awards were administered through DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women. For more information, visit: http://www.usdoj.gov/ovw/. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which determines funding for all federally-administered programs, including those carried out by the Department of Justice.
