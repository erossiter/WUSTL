SENS. DOMENICI, KENNEDY & ENZI UNVEIL LONG-AWAITED BREAKTHROUGH ON MENTAL HEALTH PARITY
  Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) today introduced breakthrough mental health legislation to ensure greater health insurance parity for persons with mental illness. 
   The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 (S.558) represents the culmination of more than a year's negotiations involving lawmakers, mental health, insurance and business organizations to craft compromise legislation. The new policy would build on the landmark 1996 Mental Health Parity Act, a law authored by Domenici and the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone that began the process of ending health insurance discrimination against people with mental illness. 
   The bill does not mandate group plans to provide any mental health coverage, but it does require health insurance plans that offer mental health coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other physical illnesses.  
   "We are here today after years of hard work," Domenici said. "Simply put, our bill will provide parity between mental health coverage and medical and surgical coverage. No longer will a more restrictive standard be applied the mental health coverage and another more lenient standard be applied to medical and surgical coverage. This is a matter of fairness and I am genuinely excited that we may finally make progress to build on the 1996 law and offering this much-needed help to those with mentally ill and those whose care for them." 
   "One in five Americans will suffer from mental illness this year. But unlike in the past, we know today that mental illnesses are treatable - more treatable than many physical illnesses. Yet, only one third of those facing mental illnesses will receive treatment," Kennedy said. "The bill we introduce today will begin to right these wrongs. It represents an agreement, after seven long years of stalemate, not only between Democrats and Republicans, but also with the mental health community, businesses and the insurance industry. And it provides new hope to millions of our fellow citizens." 
   "This carefully crafted, balanced compromise bill could only be reached by bringing together employer, insurance and mental health communities and asking them to set aside partisanship and find a common ground. By bringing everyone to the table to air concerns and determine areas of agreement, we have finally overcome years of legislative paralysis to make progress for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness," Enzi said. 
   Domenici is a long-time mental health advocate, while Kennedy and Enzi are chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee that has jurisdiction over this issue. 
   The HELP Committee is scheduled to take up the bill Wednesday. 
   The legislation would provide mental health parity for about 113 million Americans who work for employers with 50 or more employees. It will ensure that health plans do not place more restrictive conditions on mental health coverage than on medical or surgical coverage. As such it would require: 
   * Parity for financial requirements like deductibles, co-payments, and annual and lifetime limits; and, 
   * Parity for treatment limitations such as the number of covered hospital days and visits. 
   The 1996 Mental Health Parity law only provided parity for annual and lifetime limits between mental health coverage and medical surgical coverage. The new bill expands parity by including deductibles, co-payments, out-of-pocket expenses, coinsurance, covered hospital days, and covered out-patient visits. 
   The measure does include a small business exemption for companies with fewer than 50 employees, and also includes a cost exemption for all businesses. 
   The 1996 law began the parity process, and helped raise greater public awareness to the plight of those with mental illnesses and the societal stigma often associated with those illnesses. Today, about 26 percent of American adults, or nearly 58 million people, suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder each year. Six percent of these adults suffer from a serious mental illness. 
   Mental illness is also closely linked to the more than 30,000 suicides in the United States every year. In addition, an estimated 16 percent of all inmates in state and local jails suffer from a mental illness. 
   SUMMARY 
   Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 
   This compromise legislation reflects more than a year of discussions among business, insurance, and mental health organizations. 
    What the Bill Requires Plans To Do 
   * The bill does not mandate group health plans provide any mental health coverage. However, if a plan does offer mental health coverage, then: 
   * The plan or coverage must ensure that the financial requirements applied to mental health benefits are no more restrictive than the financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers. Such financial requirements include deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket expenses, and annual and lifetime limits. The plan may not establish separate cost sharing requirements that are only applicable to mental health benefits. 
   * The plan or coverage must also ensure that the treatment limitations applied to such benefits are no more restrictive than the treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers. Such treatment limitations include limits on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope and duration of treatment.  What the Statute Does Not Limit Plans From Doing 
   * The bill would not prohibit group health plans from negotiating separate reimbursement or provider payment rates, or managing the provision of mental benefits in order to provide medically necessary treatments under the plan (as a means to contain costs and monitor and improve the quality of care). This statute would not prohibit group health plans from taking into consideration similar treatment settings or similar treatments when applying the provisions of this statute. 
   * The bill would not require group health plans to provide out-of-network coverage for mental health benefits, but if a group health plan does provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits (including substance abuse treatment), and provides such benefits on both an in- and out-of- network basis pursuant to the terms of the plan (or coverage), then the plan must ensure that the requirements of this section are applied to both in- and out-of-network services by comparing in-network medical and surgical benefits to in-network mental health benefits and out-of-network medical and surgical benefits to out-of-network mental health benefits. 
    Scope of Coverage - Small Business and Individual Market Exemption 
   * The mental health parity requirements apply to group health plans with 50 or more employees. 
   * It does not apply to employers with less than 50 employees who are exempt from this Act, nor does it affect the individual insurance market. 
    Cost Exemption 
   * Plans may elect to be exempt from the parity requirement if it is projected that the health plan will experience increased actual total costs of coverage under the plan that exceed 2% of the actual total plan costs during the first plan year or exceed 1% of the actual total plan costs each subsequent year. The cost exemption would apply for the next plan year following determination that the cost threshold will be exceeded.  Definitions * "Mental Health Benefits" are defined to mean benefits with respect to mental health services (including substance abuse treatment) as defined under the terms of the plan or coverage, and when applicable, as may be defined under State law to health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan. 
    Effect on State Mental Health Parity Laws 
   * At the State level, mental health parity standards regarding financial requirements and treatment limitations would be preempted. The bill would not preempt state laws mandating that mental health benefits be covered. States that elect (through statute or regulation) to adopt the federal standards would not be subject to preemption.  Administration 
   * Oversight and administration would be conducted by the Department of Labor for self-funded ERISA plans and by the Department of Health and Human Services for insured plans. 
    Effective Date 
   * The requirements of the bill will be effective in the first plan year that begins on or after January 1 of the first calendar year that begins more than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
