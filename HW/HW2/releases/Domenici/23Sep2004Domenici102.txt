SEN. DOMENICI CONGRATULATES SANTA FE AUTHOR FOR ADOPTION ADVOCACY, ESTEEMED AWARD
  Sen. Pete Domenici today personally gave his praise to Santa Fean Michelle Madrid-Branch on being selected to receive congressional recognition for her work on behalf of adopted children in New Mexico.  
   Domenici met with Madrid-Branch Thursday in his D.C. office to congratulate her on being selected to receive a 2004 Congressional Angel in Adoption award and discuss further goals to bring public attention to adoption in New Mexico.
   Domenici nominated Madrid-Branch for the Angels in Adoption award after learning of her efforts in adoption awareness as founder of Adoption Tribe Publishing and the Adoption Means Love Foundation. 
   "I am amazed by Michelle's hard work in promoting the real truths of adoption and her dedication to making a difference in the lives of children. Michelle has focused her talents and efforts on finding children permanent homes and helping new families manage issues that often surface after adoption," Domenici said. 
   Madrid-Branch, also adopted, is a former Emmy-nominated television news journalist now writing a children's book series that will help parents explain different questions and issues as they surface in adopted families. 
   "Michelle is living proof that children of adoption are achievers who can reach any level of success. We are grateful to have such a role model among us and are proud of her accomplishments and recognition," he said. 
   Madrid-Branch will be honored as a 2004 Congressional Angels in Adoption winner at a reception in Washington D.C. Thursday evening by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI). The Angels in Adoption program was created in 1999 to raise public awareness of the many ways to help children and families through adoption.
