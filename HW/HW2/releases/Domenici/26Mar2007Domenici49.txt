SEN. DOMENICI WANTS TO MAKE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT PERMANENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he believes Congress should make permanent a federal tax credit offered to parents who adopt children, and is pleased with Senate efforts to keep the credit from expiring.  
   Domenici also supported an amendment to the Senate's FY2008 Budget Resolution to permanently extend the adoption child credit. That measure, passed by the Senate last Friday, awaits conference negotiations to reconcile differences in Senate and House budget plans for the federal government next year. 
   "Congress passed this tax credit to promote the adoption of children who have no permanent home. Adoption is not an inexpensive endeavor, and this tax credit can help defray some of the costs associated with bringing a child into a permanent home. We should not allow this tax credit to expire and should instead make it permanent," Domenici said. 
   Federal law currently allows adopting parents to receive a maximum $10,000 credit for qualified expenses and guarantees associated with adopting children with special needs. The bill has been endorsed by the National Council for Adoption and the National Infertility Association. 
   Domenici is an original cosponsor to the Adoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act (S.561), which would permanently extend the existing federal adoption tax credit. The credit, passed in 2001, will expire in three years. Introduced by Senator Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), the bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee.
