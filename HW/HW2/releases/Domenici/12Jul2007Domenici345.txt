SEN. DOMENICI ENDORSES CLOVIS INDUSTRIAL PARK GRANT FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that he has endorsed a grant application for $1.5 million in federal economic development grant funding for infrastructure needs at the Clovis industrial park.  
   Domenici has written Pedro Garza, regional director for the Economic Development Administration, endorsing the Clovis application for a $1.5 million EDA grant to allow the city to install the infrastructure needed to support renewable energy facilities at a new industrial park. The application was submitted by the Clovis Industrial Development Corp. (CIDC), in cooperation with the Eastern Plains Council of Governments. 
   "Clovis has presented an aggressive grant application to support a major push to attract renewable and clean energy facilities. To support such plants, the city is asking for aid to ensure its industrial park can support these bio-diesel plants. I believe they have a good plan and strong industry interest," Domenici said. "I hope the EDA will approve the city's grant application." 
   The EDA grant would help the city fulfill its obligation to install required infrastructure for three planned bio-diesel facilities at its industrial park. The cost for this work is estimated to be $3.0 million, and the city has secured the $1.5 million in required matching funds for the proposed EDA grant. 
   Clovis recently purchased a 237-acre tract for its first industrial park. In April, construction began on a bio-diesel plant that would produce 15 million gallons a year (MMgy). Construction on a second 75MMgy bio-diesel facility is expected to begin in August. Both are expected to be in full production in 2008.
