SEN. DOMENICI GET TRIGO FIRE THREAT ASSESSMENT, URGES PUBLIC TO HEED EVACUATION & SAFETY NOTICES
  In response to ongoing efforts to quell a forest blaze making its way through portions of the Manzano Mountains, U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today called U.S. Forest Service Chief Abigail Kimbell to be assured that firefighters there have the resources they need to conquer the wildfire. 
   The fire, which has so far consumed thousands of acres and caused the evacuation of homes in the Manzano and Torreon area, is being driven by the area's current warm, dry and extremely windy weather conditions.
   "Forest Service Chief Kimbell updated me on the status of the Trigo Fire and the efforts of firefighting crews on the ground," said Domenici. "I have been assured that resources are available, but that the winds and terrain are grounding tankers from flying and hampering ground crew efforts."
   Prior to his conversation with Kimbell, Domenici was briefed on the situation during a conversation with Mountainair Mayor Velta Gilley.
   "I encourage residents to take evacuation orders seriously. I understand the desire to save your home, but personal safety must be a priority. In addition, New Mexicans across the state need to practice fire safety so we can prevent these terrible fires. I will continue to monitor the situation and do what I can to address the needs on the ground," Domenici continued.
   Domenici is a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Forest Service and Interior Department.
