SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF DR. BERNANKE TO BE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Dr.  
 Ben Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
   "In choosing Dr. Ben Bernanke to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, President Bush has made an excellent decision. Dr. Bernanke has the right mix of academic and real world experience. 
   "Through his groundbreaking academic work, Dr. Bernanke has examined many of the world's most pressing economic problems, which gives him a solid understanding of economic theory. 
   "As a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Dr. Bernanke has put that background to work on the real world financial issues in our country. Now, he will have the opportunity to fill the substantial shoes of Alan Greenspan and guide our economic growth. I look forward to working with him."
