SEN. DOMENICI: LEA COUNTY GETS FUNDS TO CURB SUBSTANCE ABUSE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $347,935 to Lea County to support programs designed to reduce substance abuse in the area.  
   Domenici secured these grant funds for Lea County in the FY2004 Ominbus Appropriations Bill that passed the Senate by a 65-28 vote in January. The grant was issued through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the federal agency responsible for enhancing local mental health and substance abuse services. 
   "It is important that we continue to fund programs like SAMHSA to combat the devastating cycle that drugs and alcohol abuse have on our youth," Domenici said. "SAMHSA supports not only drug prevention and rehabilitation programs, but also mental health disorders that can be associated with substance abuse. I applaud SAMHSA for recognizing mental illness as a disease that can sometimes lead to drug abuse and offering treatment opportunities to both." 
   As the only member of the New Mexico delegation to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Domenici included the funds to provide substance abuse counselling and treatment to detainees held at to Lea County's new detention center. The facility includes drug and substance abuse rehabilitation, and mental health counselling and treatment programs. 
   SAMSHA was established by an act of Congress in 1992 as a separate entity within the HHS to focus attention, programs, and funding on improving the lives of people with or at risk for mental and substance abuse disorders.
