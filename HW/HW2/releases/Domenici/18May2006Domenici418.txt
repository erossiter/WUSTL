SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH BORDER FUNDING REQUEST
  Sen. Domenici's Statement on Bush Border Funding Request: 
   In response to a White House request for border security and National Guard deployment funding to be included in the FY2006 Emergency Appropriations Supplemental Bill, Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement:
   "It is clear that the situation on the border is an emergency. The Senate has already proven it wants to get serious about moving quickly to shore up the border by passing an amendment to spend $1.9 billion on border infrastructure, vehicles, air assets and other equipment.
   "The White House today has sent up its own $1.9 billion plan for border funding. Included in that plan is $756 million for National Guard work along the border, including surveillance, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, and building patrol roads.
   "I'm pleased that there is such strong agreement that funds must be spent on the border as soon as possible. Both proposals will benefit New Mexico. As a member of the conference committee that will negotiate the final expenditures in the supplemental, I am committed to finding the best way to fund our border needs."
   Domenici serves on the Department of Homeland Security Subcommittee and will be a member of the conference committee that negotiates a final agreement with the House of Representatives. The Senator was also a cosponsor of the $1.9 billion Senate amendment, which includes funds for the Border Patrol Academy at FLETC Artesia.
   The Bush Administration request was submitted to Congress on the day the President visited Yuma, Arizona and DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff visited El Paso to highlight border needs.
