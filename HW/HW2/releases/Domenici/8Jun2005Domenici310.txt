SEN. DOMENICI: DOE RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTS LET FOR LAGUNA PUEBLO, JICARILLA APACHES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that both Laguna Pueblo and Jicarilla Apache have been awarded contracts from the Department of Energy (DOE) to support the development of renewable energy methods on tribal lands.  
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that has funding jurisdiction over the DOE. Domenici is also a member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. 
   "I am pleased to see these two pueblos working diligently toward self-sufficiency and greater economic prosperity. Energy initiatives such as these will contribute to the broader search for renewable energy while creating job opportunities on the reservations," Domenici said. 
   Laguna Pueblo has been awarded $375,049 in federal funds to enable a Renewable Energy Feasibility Study. The initiative would improve quality and reliability of electric service on the reservation, promote energy self-sufficiency, contribute to environmentally clean energy, encourage economic development, and create employment opportunities. 
   The award of $110,220 to Jicarilla Apache Utility Authority will enable the reservation to take the first steps toward developing renewable energy and energy efficient projects. Eligible technologies include: photovoltaic, solar thermal, wind, biomass power, hydroelectric, geothermal, and other renewable or renewable hybrid systems.
