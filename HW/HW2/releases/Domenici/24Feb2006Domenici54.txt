SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS MONTA?O BRIDGE RESTRIPING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded action taken by the Army Corps of Engineers that resulted in the restriping of the Monta?o Bridge to make it four lanes.  
   In late January, Domenici announced that an agreement had been reached to issue the permit after he facilitated a meeting between the Army Corps of Engineers and Albuquerque officials in his Washington, D.C. office. 
   "I'm very pleased that the Army Corps has issued a modified permit that has allowed for the Monta?o Bridge to become four lanes. This permit comes as a result of a good compromise that will increase noise abatement measures while allowing traffic to flow better. I'm glad the work was completed so soon and commuters are now seeing benefits," Domenici said. 
   Domenici brought together Colonel Todd Wang of the Army Corps and Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez for the January meeting in order to resolve permit issues with the bridge. 
   The modified permit requires Albuquerque to monitor and enforce speed limits on the bridge, and will result in the extension of a noise wall overlap and additional landscaping. 
   Domenici, who chairs the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee which has jurisdiction over the Army Corps, had urged a swift resolution to the issue, believing that commuters would benefit from additional lanes.
