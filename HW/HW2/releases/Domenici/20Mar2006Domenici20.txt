UNDERAGED DRINKING TARGET OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT TO NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded $350,000 to the New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department to combat underage drinking. 
   Enforcing the Underage Drinking (EUDL) Block Grant Program will support efforts by local law enforcement agencies to prohibit the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors.
   "Underage drinking has been a problem plaguing our communities for quite some time. It is essential that these programs fight this problem using different methods," Domenici said.
   The EUDL grant will help establish tasks forces, implement public advertising efforts and develop innovate programs to assist in the reduction of underage drinking.
   Domenici is a member of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which funds Department of Justice programs.
