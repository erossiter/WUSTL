SEN. DOMENICI CONCERNED ABOUT 2005 FIRE SEASON, 4.5 MILLION ACRES ALREADY LOST EARLY THIS SUMMER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today expressed grave concern over the loss of more than 4.5 million acres to wildfires at this point of the year-including almost 90,000 acres in New Mexico-and noted that appropriators have taken action to provide another $500 million to meet skyrocketing firefighting costs this year.  
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, served on the Senate-House defense appropriations conference committee that last week finalized the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Bill and added $500 million to the bill to support firefighting costs this year. The House and Senate are expected to give final passage to this bill this week. 
   "The heaviest fire months, August and September, are still ahead," Domenici said. "Year to date, we have lost more forest to fire than any time in the past 50 years. I am gravely concerned. We have more than 90 million acres of forests at high risk for deadly fire. So far this year, we've lost 4.5 million acres. If this rate of loss continues, we could lose as much as 11 million acres and spend nearly $2 billion fighting these fires." 
   In New Mexico, 86,383 acres have been consumed in nine major fires this summer.
