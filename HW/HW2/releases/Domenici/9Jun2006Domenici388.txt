SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SECURITY BREACH
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement regarding a security breach in Albuquerque last fall involving the theft of National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) personnel data: 
   "I learned about this disturbing situation last night and my staff received a classified briefing on the breach today. While I'm relieved that only unclassified information appears to have been compromised, I'm still concerned for those whose data was stolen. There will be a thorough investigation of this matter, and the Department of Energy should hold whoever is at fault accountable.
   "At this time, it is not known how many New Mexicans are affected, but I have asked that DOE contact the individuals whose data may be at risk immediately so that they may take precautions."
