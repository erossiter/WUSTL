SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO AWARDED $6.9 MILLION IN HOMELAND SECURITY PREPAREDNESS FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded over $6.9 million in FY2007 homeland security funds for protection and prevention measures in New Mexico.  
   New Mexico will receive the funds as part of the FY2007 Homeland Security Grant Program to help localities maintain security, as well as overall preparedness in the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster, according to Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   "Enabling states to protect against and respond to threats is pivotal in maintaining overall national security," said Domenici. "I am pleased DHS has awarded these funds to help the state take appropriate action in the best interest of New Mexico communities. The Demand for these funds is great, so we're pleased to continue funding these grant programs." 
   Within the overall award, DHS allocated funds to New Mexico according to the following programs: 
   * State Homeland Security Program (SHSP): $3.8 million to help the state and localities deal with threats through planning, equipment, training, and exercise; 
   * Law Enforcement Terror Prevention Program (LETP): $2.7 million for law enforcement and public safety services for terrorism prevention activities; 
   * Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS): $258,145 to support response programs in Albuquerque; 
   * Citizen Corps Program (CCP): $165,108 to facilitate citizen participation in prevention, preparedness, and response to terrorism, natural disasters, and other threats. 
   DHS offers awards through the Homeland Security Grant Program to maintain preparedness activities in communities across the country. These programs fulfill national security requirements. For more information, visit http://www.ojb.usdoj.gov/odp.
