LOS LUNAS GETS BACKING FOR ADULT CARE CENTER EXPANSION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that a $1.56 million low-interest loan has been issued to SC Inc. in Los Lunas to expand the Senior Living Systems-Center for Ageless Living, an adult residential care facility.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Community Facility Direct Loan for $1,560,577 is over 40 years at 5 percent interest. The federal backing will allow SC Inc. to construct a new adult residential care facility in order to serve 15 new clients. The facility currently has the capacity to serve 30 residents, and the expansion will allow the center to accommodate 45 clients. 
   "USDA Rural Development approves such loans to help small communities obtain the facilities they need to best serve their people. This low-interest loan will allow an existing assisted living center expand so that it can meet a growing population. I'm pleased the USDA has decided to make this investment, which will help more low-income seniors obtain the services of this facility," Domenici said. 
   The USDA loan will support the construction of a new 6,000-square-foot facility. The project will also entail remodeling the existing residential program to expand to five additional private rooms, new bathroom facilities and an entertainment room. A 2,034-square-foot garage with storage and training space will also give the facility room for staff education and special events.
