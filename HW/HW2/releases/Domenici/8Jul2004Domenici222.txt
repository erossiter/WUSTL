SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS RESOLUTION ANTICIPATING OPENING OF NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN INDIAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cosponsored a resolution to commemorate the September opening of the National Museum of the American Indian, a major facility opening on the National Mall to highlight the culture and history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, cosponsored the resolution to call attention to the opening of the newest museum in Washington-slated for Sept. 21-and to celebrate the contributions of New Mexico pueblos and tribes to the construction and establishment of the facility. 
   "The museum that is nearly finished on the National Mall is beautiful and suitable for honoring centuries of American Indian history and their contributions to our nation today. Our tribes and pueblos in New Mexico will be part of telling that rich story," Domenici said. "I believe this museum will do so much to improving the public's understanding of the Indian peoples, and I'm excited to see it opened." 
   The commemorative resolution was introduced Wednesday by Indian Affairs Committee chairman Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-Colo.). The measure notes that the museum "will give all Americans the opportunity to learn of the cultural legacy, historic grandeur, and contemporary culture of Native Americans." 
   As part of the buildup to the museum opening, the U.S. Postal Service plans to unveil its "Art of the American Indian" postage stamp series at an event in Santa Fe on Aug. 21. Among the art featured on the stamps will be Navajo weaving, as well as Acoma Pueblo and Mimbres pottery. Overall, the 10-stamp series includes American Indian artifacts dating from around the 11th century A.D. to circa 1969.
