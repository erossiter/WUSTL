SEN. DOMENICI WELCOMES NEW CARLSBAD FAMILY HEALTH CENTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today took part in a ribbon cutting ceremony to commemorate the official opening of the new Carlsbad Family Health Center, a facility made possible by federal funds he helped obtain.  
   During the ceremony, Domenici outlined the importance of this facility in accessing cost-effective, high quality, affordable health care to local communities. The new center will be operated by Presbyterian Medical Service (PMS). 
   "Primary care facilities are crucial to meeting the medical needs of New Mexicans. This new center in Carlsbad will provide essential primary care including managing chronic diseases, prenatal care, dental care and behavioral health services," Domenici said. 
   As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Domenici secured $1.15 million for the construction of the facility in the FY2004 Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. 
   The Senator secured the funding in response to the lack of medical practitioners in Carlsbad. PMS was no longer able to lease space but was the only low income provider available. The new center will accommodate more patients. 
   "The comprehensive health and social support services that this health center will provide will help people who have difficulty obtaining quality health care. It is critical that each and every member of our community regardless of their income receive quality care," Domenici added. 
   He pointed out that the money for this project would have been much more difficult to secure without the support of federal earmarks. 
   "There is a lot of talk in the media that refer to this type of earmark funding in Appropriations bills as 'personal pork' but I hardly consider these projects wasteful. In fact, I am proud that I was able to assist in the way that I did," Domenici said.
