SEN. DOMENICI AMPLIFIES STAND ON DUBAI PORTS SALE
  After a continued search for information regarding the proposed sale of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&O) to Dubai Ports World (DPW) of the United Arab Emirates, Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement:  
   "I am certain that when the dust settles, and the near hysteria regarding the sale of P&O to DPW subsides, this matter will be resolved and DPW will receive ownership of P&O. 
   "A continued search for information regarding the current state of U.S. ports has revealed that there are other foreign government owned terminals being operated in the United States right now. The governments of Singapore, China and Taiwan operate six terminals located in the ports of Los Angeles, Oakland, Tacoma and Seattle. 
   "In addition, privately held foreign companies, including those based in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Denmark and the U.K. operate 37 other terminals located in 17 ports, ranging from New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore to Houston and Long Beach. 
   "In all of these terminals, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard is responsible for security. The same is to be the case with the DPW operated ports in the U.S. I see no reason why DPW should be discriminated against, nor any reason why we should be more concerned about terminals they operate than we are about those operated by other foreign entities. 
   "Terminals and port operations are a major international business. For instance, the company that is believed to be the largest operator in the world, SSA Marine, is based in the U.S. and operates in 3 South American countries. Foreign countries accept our companies as long as they follow strict security guidelines, so we should accept foreign companies as long as they meet our security guidelines. 
   "I am certain that when the dust settles and the near-hysteria subsides, this matter will be resolved and DPW will receive ownership of P&O."
