SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS 2006 FALL INTERNS, DEADLINE FOR APPLICANTS IS MAY 1
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported his Washington, D.C. office is accepting fall internship applications through May 1 and encouraged interested students to apply. 
   Domenici's Fall 2006 program will run from September through December. College-age students, who are either New Mexico residents or attending a two or four-year school in the state, are eligible to apply.
   "My internship brings future leaders from New Mexico to my Washington office so they can see first hand how the Senate and federal government work. Students who intern in my office will have a chance to work on constituent service, legislation and public outreach. I encourage interested students to apply," Domenici said.
   Applicants must have completed as least one year of study at an institution of higher learning. New Mexico residents and/or students will receive priority in the selection process. Students participating in the program during past years have come from a wide variety of backgrounds and schools, including universities, community colleges, and vocational schools from inside and outside New Mexico.
   Applications are available on Domenici's website, which may be accessed at http://domenici.senate.gov in the "Student Section."
   For more information about the program and intern responsibilities, email internships@domenici.senate.gov or call (202) 224-6621. Applications must be postmarked by May 1.
   Domenici, a Republican, is New Mexico's longest-serving U.S. Senator and is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He also has senior memberships on the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee, and is a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.
