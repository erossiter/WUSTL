SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEED FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today issued the following statement regarding proposals for an economic stimulus to energize the U.S. economy:  
   "While there are economic bright spots in New Mexico, there is no doubt that the national economy is in trouble. I was pleased to hear the President endorse an economic stimulus plan that would amount to about 1 percent of the GDP. 
   "I believe a bulk of this stimulus should be delivered directly to the taxpayers to give our overall economy a boost. The trick will be to move forward with a good plan without the Congress descending into more partisan bickering." 
   Domenici is completing a working trip today in Carlsbad where he is meeting with the Mayor's WIPP Task Force to discuss the status and future of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The community has been interested in parlaying the assets related to WIPP, the federal government's sole transuranic waste repository, into other economic growth activities. 
   Domenici's visit to Carlsbad follows meetings and tours this week of the nearly $2 billion National Enrichment Facility construction site in Lea County and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Artesia.
