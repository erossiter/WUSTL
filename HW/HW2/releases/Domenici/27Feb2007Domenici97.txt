SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES HHS FUNDING FOR ALBUQUERQUE HEALTH PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award $4.3 million to New Mexico health programs and will include $3.8 million for First Choice Community Healthcare, Inc. in Albuquerque.  
   The awards will be administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Additionally, Mora Valley Community Health Services will receive $569,725 under HHS funding for New Mexico. 
   "Health programs provide a variety of necessary services to local communities," said Domenici. "I am always happy to know that HHS makes funds available for community healthcare. I hope that these awards made within the state of New Mexico will help maintain and improve the healthcare provided to Albuquerque-area residents." 
   Funding will be dispersed as part of the Health Center Cluster program within HHS, which supports health programs that operate multiple facilities. In FY2006, HRSA awarded 82 grants totaling $57.68 million within the state of New Mexico. 
   First Choice was founded in 1972 as a non-profit organization and now serves as one of the largest providers of low-income healthcare in the Albuquerque and Valencia County areas. In 2001, Domenici was successful in gaining a $2.75 million federal appropriation to help construct a new facility for the First Choice Community Clinic in Albuquerque. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding levels for federal programs, including those administered by HHS.
