SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN INTRODUCE SAN ILDEFONSO SETTLEMENT BILL
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today introduced legislation that will implement the San Ildefonso settlement, which was reached earlier this year between the San Ildefonso Pueblo and the U.S. Forest Service.  
   The bill would formally settle San Ildefonso Pueblo's claim to 7,700 acres of ancestral land, which dates back to 1951. Santa Clara Pueblo and Los Alamos County are also impacted by the settlement. 
   "This settlement certainly has been a long time coming. I appreciate the hard work of the U.S. Forest Service and Department of Justice to reach a compromise with the San Ildefonso Pueblo. The agreement reached will help secure the future of Los Alamos County while recognizing the traditional and culture values on federal property adjacent to pueblo lands," said Domenici, who is a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee which is expected to consider the bill. 
   \"This claim, the last one pending before the Indian Claims Commission, has gone unresolved for over 50 years. It is long past time to settle it and this legislation will help us accomplish that goal," Bingaman said. 
   The agreement is the final settlement of the 1946 Indian Claims Commission Act, which involved more than 600 claims by tribes. 
   The agreement will give the pueblo a payment, as well as an opportunity to gain other property from the Santa Fe National Forest. Santa Clara Pueblo has also negotiated the right to acquire certain properties. 
   The pact is designed to guarantee Los Alamos County access to water wells and infrastructure, and allow the county to purchase property for future economic development. Also included will be right-of-way passage during emergency situations.
