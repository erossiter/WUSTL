   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici says he is willing to consider a second economic stimulus package if one should be proposed. However, he says Congress would have to weigh the benefits of such a package versus increasing the deficit. He notes that Congress could work on a housing assistance package that could be considered as an economic stimulus. 
   02:37 Domenici says he is pleased at the final FY2008 funding levels for the DOE national laboratories, including resources to continue development of the CMR-R at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He briefly discusses the president's FY2009 budget request for the CMR-R. 
   06:13 Domenici says he will continue to press the Energy Department to explain its $23 million cut in FY2009 for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. He says DOE would have to have "real positive reasons" for the proposed cuts before he would ever consider supporting such a reduction. He says he still considers the cut unacceptable. 
   08:33 Domenici says he is confident that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Facility at Artesia has an exciting future, and notes that the nation will rely on the campus to train all the Border Patrol agents and others needed to secure the border and improve homeland security. 
   10:54 Domenici says he believes Senator Barrack Obama's run for the Democratic presidential nomination has been fueled by his lofty oratory capabilities. However, he says he questions whether Senator Obama's specific policy ideas match the soaring ideas he presents in his speeches. He says the economic uneasiness being felt around the nation is helping propel the Obama candidacy. 
   15:43 Domenici says he plans to reach out to candidates running to take his Senate seat to review projects, like FLETC-Artesia, that he believes will need continued attention. He says he must consider when the time is best for such discussions. He says he is excited with the growing economic diversity in southeast New Mexico, including the robust energy and potash industries. 
   18:00 Domenici says he has not learned of any new federal funding sources to help the Ruidoso region construct a wastewater treatment facility. He notes that help is needed since the project is expensive.
