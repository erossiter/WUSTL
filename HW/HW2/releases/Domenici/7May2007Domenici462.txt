SEN. DOMENICI DISCUSSES IMMIGRATION SOLUTIONS WITH KEY SENATE, ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today met with Arizona Senator John Kyl to discuss possible bipartisan solutions to the border security and immigration issues facing our country and broadly affecting Southwest Border states. 
   Today's discussion with Kyl is one of several recent meetings Domenici has participated in with Senate colleagues and key administration officials, including Department of Homeland Security policy director Stewart Baker, in an effort to work up a productive immigration reform agreement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated that Senate debate on border security and immigration reform will begin next week.
   "During these difficult, but necessary conversations, we must carefully consider the economic, human, and legal elements of the debate," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
   "Congress needs to work hard to solve our border security and immigration problems. Any solution must leverage the positive economic impact that productive undocumented workers have on the economy without adopting a policy of blanket amnesty. We must strictly enforce existing laws, and equip regions, such as the Southwest Border, with resources to ease the burden of illegal immigration on area health care, education, and law enforcement," he said.
   Domenici plans to actively participate in the immigration debate and has offered several suggestions for the immigration reform bill, including provisions to substantially upgrade land ports of entry, providing more federal judges to states whose legal systems are overwhelmed with immigration cases, and increasing the number of deputy U.S. marshals who transport and guard illegal immigrants charged with federal crimes.
   In the 110th Congress, Domenici has introduced the following border and immigration-related legislation:
   * S.475, a bill to hire 250 new Deputy United States Marshals to work on immigration-related crimes.
   * S.575, Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act of 2007, a bill to authorize appropriations to upgrade infrastructure and technology at border crossings, hire more border personnel, and improve trade security measures.
   * S.1192, Federal Criminal Immigration Courts Act of 2007, a bill to increase the number of federal judgeships in certain judicial districts with heavy caseloads of criminal immigration cases, including New Mexico.
   * S.1216, Laser Visa Extension Act of 2007, a bill to allow nationals of Mexico who have a U.S.-issued laser visa to travel temporarily up to 100 miles from the international border between New Mexico and Mexico, and for tourism and travel purposes.
