SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE, JUDGE ALBERTO GONZALES OF TEXAS
  Sen. Pete Domenici, who serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S. Department of Justice, today issued the following statement on Judge Alberto Gonzales, who has been nominated by President Bush to be the nation's first Attorney General of Hispanic descent.  
   Gonzales, a former Texas Supreme Court justice and current counsel to the President, testified Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of his confirmation process. 
   "I think Judge Gonzales did very well testifying before the Judiciary Committee and I look forward to voting for him to be our new Attorney General. He has certainly racked up a remarkable career as a jurist and public servant. I think he will bring a fresh new viewpoint to the Justice Department. I believe he has the intellect, experience and fortitude to be an excellent Attorney General in the post-9/11 world in which we live."
