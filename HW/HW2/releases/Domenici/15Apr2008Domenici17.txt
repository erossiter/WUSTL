SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON 'TAX DAY'
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today issued the following statement as New Mexicans join taxpayers across the nation in filing their 2007 federal income tax returns: 
   "As New Mexicans join millions of Americans in filing their 2007 federal and state income tax forms, we should take a hard look at what these families face in the upcoming year. I believe the American economy is propelled by the ability of American families and businesses to keep more of what they earn.
   "Though there are bright spots in New Mexico's economy, the overall national economy is facing some serious troubles. In that light, I believe careful attention should be paid to whether Congress will allow existing tax cuts to expire.
   "In 2001 and 2003, we extended the 10 percent tax bracket to more workers and enacted a child tax credit, adoption credit, dependent care credit, and marriage penalty relief. We offered deductions for costs like education tuition, and we addressed capital gains and dividends to spur investment in small businesses. These credits could soon disappear and taxes increase if Congress does not act to extend them.
   "I believe this is something to consider as we pay our personal tax debts and look at personal budgets that must today weather higher food and energy costs. Personally, I want these tax credits extended so that thousands of New Mexico families and small business owners do not also have to worry about disappearing deductions and higher federal taxes."
