LOVELACE BIOMED CENTER GETS $8.0 MILLION FOR GENE THERAPY RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Lovelace Biomedical and Education Institute in Albuquerque will receive nearly $8.0 million from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for gene therapy research.  
   The funding is part of a contract between several research facilities across the country and NHLBI. Lovelace is one of five recipients of the endowment and will receive NHLBI funding through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
   "Lovelace is a flagship institution in terms of health research," says Domenici. "I am always proud and inspired by the hard work in our state to develop and implement medical advancements through learning and investigation." 
   Lovelace will act as the core lab for pharmacy and toxicology during the span of the gene therapy research. The cost-reimbursement contract will fund the Lovelace Biomedical Research and Education Institute until March 2012. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee which plays a large role in determining funding for programs within the Department of Health and Human Services.
