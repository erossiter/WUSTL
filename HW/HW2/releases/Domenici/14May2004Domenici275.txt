NEA AWARDS ARTS GRANT TO NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Working Classroom, Inc. has been awarded $20,000 by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to instruct young artists in the Albuquerque area. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that provides funding for the NEA.  
   "Working Classroom has been diligent over the past 15 years in training young, under-privileged New Mexicans wanting to develop their talents in the fine arts," said Domenici. "Some of these kids may not have even considered taking up theater or writing but Working Classroom provides the resources to build self-esteem and leadership qualities, not to mention improving in school." 
   Working Classroom, Inc. began in 1987 and serves students aged 9 to 21 by offering visual arts, theater and creative-writing workshops for "historically ignored" inner-city communities in Albuquerque. It encourages youth to apply their talents to community development and social change. 
   Year-round visual arts and drama workshops, which run for 6-8 weeks, are taught in both Spanish and English and are free to low-income students and adults. 
   In addition to Working Classroom, Inc. NEA has selected four other Albuquerque organizations to receive FY2004 grants: 
   * New Mexico Symphony Orchestra has been awarded $22,500 for the Challenge America-Access to the Arts program which supports a statewide tour to small, rural, and underserved communities. The program also offers educational activities in Albuquerque area schools. 
   * Sweet Bird Classics, Inc. has been awarded $30,000 to support Boombox Classroom. Boombox Classroom is a nationally syndicated children's radio series about world and classical music designed for school districts that have little general music instruction in kindergarten through eighth grade. 
   * Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, Inc. has been awarded $20,000 to support the Cultural Education Program (CEP). The CEP features Pueblo artists in weekly and special-event dances, regular lecture series, art and craft demonstrations, workshops, and festivals. 
   * University of New Mexico Main Campus has been awarded $30,000 to support "Music in Latino Culture: Nuestra Musica" at the 2004 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife. The program will present National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Fellows in concerts and workshops over a two-week period. 
   For Silver City, the following grants were awarded: 
   * The Mimbres Region Arts Council (MRAC) will receive $20,000 to support the Youth Mural Program. The project offers Saturday programs in eight-week sessions, leading to the creation of public art for up to 200 youth, ages 13-19 who have been through the juvenile justice system. MRAC, founded in 1981, is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing arts opportunities and education for Southwestern New Mexico. 
   * Native American Art Scholarship Fund has been awarded $55,000 to support the Lore of the Land Indigenous Aural Historian Training Project.
