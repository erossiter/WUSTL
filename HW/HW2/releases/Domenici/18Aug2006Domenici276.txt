ANOTHER $1.13 MILLION GAINED BY SEN. DOMENICI RELEASED FOR NEW SANTA FE HEAD START CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has released another $1.13 million that he secured to continue the construction of the Head Start education center in Santa Fe.  
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Domenici requested and secured the funds as part of the FY2006 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill. 
   "Early education is especially important and must be a top priority for children, parents and educators alike. Head Start can offer the building blocks toward a good education for these children. I am especially proud that these funds will give this Santa Fe Head Start project a new facility for meeting that challenge," Domenici said. 
   The funds will be released to Presbyterian Medical Services (PMS), who is the sole provider of Head Start services in Santa Fe. Previous grants awarded to Presbyterian Medical Services facilitated the construction of the Head Start facility in Carlsbad and continued Head Start operations in San Juan and Torrance counties. 
   Last August, Domenici toured the Manderfield Head Start facility in Santa Fe where he met with staff members and children and pledged to continue his support and advocate for the Head Start program. 
   Earlier this year, HUD released $1.16 million initially secured by Domenici in FY2005 to PMS for the Head Start construction projects. 
   HUD today also awarded $198,000 in EDI funding to the Village of Angel Fire to fund its Town Square project. 
   The funds are part of the HUD's Economic Development Initiative (EDI).
