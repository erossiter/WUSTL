   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici strongly expresses his belief and support for Senate filibusters, but says Majority Leader Bill Frist must do everything he can to explain to the American people why filibusters led by the Democratic leadership against judicial nominees are unprecedented and an affront to 200 years of Senate tradition. 
   04:59 - Domenici says it is deplorable that jails and prisons are now used to house the mentally ill, which is why he is a primary cosponsor to legislation to extend a federal Mental Health Court program. The Senate recently passed this bill to extend efforts to try to identify and treat inmates with mental health problems. 
   07:43 - Domenici says he is hopeful that House negotiators will accept the $26 million he included in the FY2005 emergency supplemental bill to advance the environmental clean up of Technical Area 18 (TA-18) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The TA-18 funding is not opposed by the Energy Department, which might help convince House negotiators to accept it. He says the funding is needed to make progress on the cleanup. 
   09:40 - Domenici says he is confident that the just-enacted Bankruptcy Reform Act will work to stop those who now abuse the bankruptcy system. He says the new law includes a means testing standard to ensure that those courts will work with those who cannot begin to repay their debts. 
   14:20 - Domenici says the announcement that Northrop Grumman Corp. will bid for the LANL management contract is further evidence that the bidding process will be very competitive. He again reiterates his preference for the University of California to retain the contract, but says his preference will not matter as the process moves forward. Noting that the contract competitors may offer some surprises in their bids, he reiterates that LANL workers should delay judgment until the new contract is let.
