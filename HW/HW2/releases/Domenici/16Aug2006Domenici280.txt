SEN. DOMENICI SAYS USDA FUNDS WILL HELP IMPROVE WATER SERVICE TO NORTHERN N.M. SYSTEMS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved a loan and awarded two grants to help restore existing water facilities for Taos County and the Navajo Nation as part of the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program.  
   Upper Des Montes MDWCA, located in Taos County, was approved for a $482,000 loan and awarded a $356,141 grant to replace its deteriorating water system. The funds will be used to construct a new $50,000 gallon water storage tank including 3,000 feet of water transmission lines with fire hydrants. 
   "Rural water facilities are increasingly aged and in need of expansion to meet the needs of the population. USDA rural development funds are useful to combat the financial burden placed on these local facilities, Domenici said. 
   The USDA also awarded a $1 million grant to Mariano Lake Chapter in the Navajo Nation to update the existing water system with water meters, install new pipes and new water dispensing stations to its water facilities. This project will no longer require Chapter residents to travel many miles to obtain water. 
   The funds were distributed through the Rural Development program. Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that designates the funding levels for the USDA and its Rural Development programs. 
   The loan approved for Upper Des Montes MDWCA is based on 40 years at a 4.5 percent interest rate.
