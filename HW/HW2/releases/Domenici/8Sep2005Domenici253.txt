SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DECEMBER DATE FOR LIGHTING NATIONAL HOLIDAY TREE FROM NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the nation's Capitol Holiday Tree, which this year is from New Mexico, will be lit at a gala ceremony on Dec. 8.  
   The Holiday Tree will travel throughout New Mexico in November before being transported to Washington, where it will be lit in a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Sixty-five smaller holiday trees from New Mexico are also being delivered for use in other Washington offices. 
   "It is an honor for New Mexico to provide the nation's Capitol Holiday Tree this year, particularly because the Forest Service is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On Dec. 8, visitors and those who work here in Washington will be able to witness this beautiful tree come to life in celebration of the Christmas season. 
   "I look forward to seeing all the homemade ornaments from New Mexico, and I thank New Mexicans for their involvement in selecting the tree and getting it to Washington," Domenici said. 
   The 80-foot Engelmann Spruce comes from the Santa Fe National Forest and was selected by a U.S. Capitol landscape architect in conjunction with the Forest Service. The tree will be lighted with 10,000 lights and over 4,000 homemade ornaments from New Mexico. 
   Domenici's Washington office will also display a smaller tree, which will be decorated with ornaments from New Mexico schoolchildren and other groups. 
   This is the second time the Land of Enchantment has provided the Capitol Holiday Tree.
