SEN. DOMENICI: NATIONAL TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL TO TRAIN LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS MANAGERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the National Tribal Environmental Council based in Albuquerque has received a $750,000 federal grant to train American Indian water systems managers.  
   The funds were awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Technical Assistance Training Grant program. 
   "There are still many places in our state that struggle to have a reliable source of clean drinking water. We continue to make this a priority to ensure all New Mexicans have safe and clean drinking water. Part of this process is to train those regulating the water lines in our communities, particularly on Indian lands," Domenici said. "The funds from the USDA will allow tribal lands to protect their most valuable resource." 
   The $750,000 will provide technical assistance and training to operators and utility managers of tribal drinking water systems. This award for the National Tribal Environmental Council has exceeded past USDA awards of $250,000 in 2002 and $154,500 in 2003.
