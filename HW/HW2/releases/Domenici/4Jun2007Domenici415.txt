SEN. DOMENICI OFFERS AMENDMENTS TO BORDER SECURITY BILL, INCLUDING ONE TO ADD FED JUDGES TO SOUTHWEST BORDER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today offered a series of amendments to the pending Border Security and Immigration Reform Act being debated in the Senate, including one to authorize new judgeships to alleviate immigration-related cases now overwhelming U.S. District Courts on the Southwest Border. 
   The Senate today began its second week of debate on S.1348, a comprehensive plan for enforcing greater control over U.S. borders and implementing immigration reforms. As part of the resumption of debate, Domenici offered a series of amendments, most of which directly impact border security in New Mexico.  
   Domenici's federal judgeship amendment would authorize 10 new permanent and temporary judgeships--all for districts that are experiencing immigration caseloads that total half of their total criminal filings. For New Mexico, the amendment would allocate one permanent and one temporary judgeship. 
   "Currently, the bill fails to recognize that while immigration cases typically go before immigration judges, repeat offenders can be charged with felonies and must be tried in Federal District court. Such cases are overwhelming District courts on the Southwest border," Domenici said. "The bill would be incomplete without addressing this need." 
   "Some of these District courts have immigration caseloads that total at least half of all of their criminal filings," he said. "We must add new judges for these Districts to hear the cases of repeat immigration law violators." 
   The 2007 Judicial Conference for U.S. District Courts Conference recently reported, for instance, that the District Court for New Mexico had 1,940 immigration filings--more than 71 percent of all criminal filings. Districts in Arizona and Texas also have similar criminal immigration filing ratios. 
   The Domenici amendment would implement the recommendations of the Conference that are overly burdened with immigration caseloads. 
   The following is a brief review of additional amendments offered by Domenici: 
   * Border Patrol Academy Efficiency Study - An amendment revising the bill's existing requirements that the GAO s that the GAO study the efficiency and value of border patrol training to ensure that all appropriate factors are considered, including a March 2007 GAO study that indicates that the Border Patrol's training program is an effective training program and that the cost of training a Border Patrol Agent is similar to other similar law enforcement training costs. 
   * Border Security on Federal Lands - An amendment adding the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as an entity to consult and coordinate with in improving border security on federal lands, and authorizing the hiring of additional BLM, Forest Service, and Park Service realty personnel to assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with border security issues on federal lands. 
   * Border Radio Communications - An amendment to require a study to determine areas along the border where radio communication is inadequate and to require a plan for enhancing radio communication capabilities in such areas. 
   * FLETC Border Patrol Academy - An amendment calling for the expansion of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and the Border Patrol Academy at Artesia, N.M., to provide more realistic and situation-based training and planning. 
   * Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Surveillance - An amendment requiring the DHS to consider utilizing the New Mexico State University/Department of Defense UAV program as it develops broader UAV border security surveillance plans. 
   * Mexican Cooperation - An amendment requiring the U.S. Secretary of State to work with Mexico to improve border security, reduce border crime, and encourage circular migration.
