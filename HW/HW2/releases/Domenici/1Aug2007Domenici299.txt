DOT RELEASES SEN. DOMENICI-SECURED FUNDS FOR ALBUQUERQUE WEST SIDE TRANSIT FACILITY
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has released $371,779 he secured for the Albuquerque West Side Transit Facility to protect its transit vehicles.  
   The funds for the city of Albuquerque were included at Domenici's request in the FY2006 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill. The federal funds will help finance the construction of canopies and related paving, drainage, and electrical work to protect revenue vehicles at the West Side Transit Facility. 
   "Albuquerque represents the hub of New Mexico which means it has a larger volume of transportation needs, which is underscored by the phenomenal growth on the West Side," said Domenici. "I am happy that these funds, which I worked to secure throughout the appropriations process, are available to Albuquerque." 
   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as the THUD Subcommittee, Domenici helped draft the FY2006 THUD Appropriations Bill. He also served on the negotiating team while the Senate and House versions of the bill were reconciled. 
   In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the FY2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill, which included more than $20 million requested by Domenici for 23 projects across New Mexico. The bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate. At Domenici's request, the Senate bill includes: 
   * $2 million for the Albuquerque International Sunport Aircraft Parking Ramp 
   * $850,000 for rehabilitation of the Albuquerque Amtrak facility 
   * $2.08 million for New Mexico statewide buses and bus facilities 
   * $1 million for the Sandoval County Northwest Access Loop project
