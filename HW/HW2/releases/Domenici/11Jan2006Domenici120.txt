SEN. DOMENICI: ALBUQUERQUE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WINS ARMY CONTRACT TO BUILD NEW WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE ANECHOIC CHAMBER
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today cheered the award of a $31.0 million U.S. Army Contract to an Albuquerque construction firm for work at White Sands Missile Range.  
   Domenici indicated that the Hensel Phelps Construction Co. of Albuquerque will undertake the construction of a new Electromagnetic Vulnerability Assessment Facility or anechoic chamber at WSMR. The project is expected to be completed by July 2008. 
   "The construction of this new facility will certainly enhance the research capabilities at WSMR. It has taken time to get everything set in terms of authorization and funding, but I look forward to this work commencing post-haste," Domenici said. 
   The previous anechoic chamber at WSMR was destroyed by fire in 2000, and Domenici subsequently added language into the FY2002 Military Construction Appropriations Bill strongly recommending that the Pentagon expedite the construction of new a chamber facility. In 2004, Congress followed the Bush administration's budget request to provide $33.0 million in military construction funding for the project. 
   "Fire completely destroyed the old facility and its total loss has been a challenge to the critical research and development in Army Information Operations. We're well past time to replace it. I am pleased a New Mexico firm has been chosen to carry out this work," Domenici said.
