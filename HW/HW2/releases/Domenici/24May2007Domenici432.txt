SEN. DOMENICI ADDS SUPPORT TO TOUGH IMMIGRATION AMENDMENTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today supported additional amendments to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act being debated in the Senate, including an amendment offered by Senator John McCain requiring undocumented workers applying for the new Z Visa to pay back taxes.  
   Domenici noted that the extensive debate on the bill will extend into June in order to address additional amendments to the legislation, including one he will offer to increase federal judgeships for judicial districts overrun with criminal immigration cases. 
   "This will be a three-week debate on issues critical to the future of our nation. I am committed to increased border security and immigration reform, but I will not support any bill that offers blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants. Nor will I support a bill that lacks the strongest possible border security provisions. The bill on the Senate floor is being amended," Domenici said. 
   "I will continue to work for a comprehensive bill that puts border security first and denies blanket amnesty for undocumented workers. If the final bill holds true to these principles, I will support it," he said. 
   Domenici Thursday also supported for an amendment offered by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) that increases the penalty for any illegal immigrant who has been denied entry or deported and attempts to reenter the United States. 
   On Wednesday, the Senate accepted an amendment drafted by Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and supported by Domenici to strengthen the border security trigger requirements in the bill. The Gregg enhanced trigger-necessary to activate immigration reforms-would require the Department of Homeland Security to certify that it: 
   * Has hired, trained, and has on duty 20,000 Border Patrol agents at the time of certification. Current trigger requires the hiring of 18,000 agents. 
   * Has put up 300 miles of vehicle barriers. Current trigger requires 200 miles of barriers. 
   * Has set up 105 radar and camera towers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Current trigger requires 70 towers. 
   * Has 31,500 detention beds to end "catch and release" of illegal immigrants. Current trigger requires 27,500 beds.
