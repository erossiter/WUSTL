UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO WINS GRANT TO STUDY DRUG ABUSE AMONG RURAL YOUTH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $238,500 to the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque for research on drug abuse among rural youth.  
   The grant project entitled Drug Use, Ethnicity, and Help Seeking among Rural Youth was awarded through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a division within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
   "The problem of drug abuse continues to cause real harm to our nation, and cannot be classified as only an urban problem. Increasingly, young individuals in rural areas are affected by substance abuse. With grants like this one to the University of New Mexico, I hope that we can find ways to reach out and reverse this negative trend among New Mexico's youth," Domenici said. 
   NIDA was established in 1974 before becoming a part of the National Institutes of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services in 1992. NIDA supports over 85 percent of the world's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction.
