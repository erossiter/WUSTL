SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS RESOLUTION AGAINST PLAN TO LIFT BAN ON CANADIAN BEEF
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said the United States must be vigilant in safeguarding its livestock and agriculture resources, which is why he has cosponsored a resolution that would negate a U.S. Department of Agriculture plan to lift an existing ban on Canadian cattle imports.  
   Domenici is among a bipartisan cadre of Senators who have cosponsored a joint "resolution of disapproval" (SJ.Res.4) related to a recent USDA ruling on the importation of Canadian beef. 
   "There is enough question as to whether there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect us from the so-called mad cow disease that I believe it is judicious to retain the ban on Canadian beef," Domenici said. "This infection is serious enough that I would rather err on the side of being overly cautious at this point." 
   The USDA has issued a ruling designating Canada as a minimal risk for the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. If the ruling is allowed to stand, Canadian beef imports could resume on March 7. 
   The resolution of disapproval, if approved by the House and Senate, would nullify the USDA effort to lift the ban. The resolution was introduced by Senators Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. It is also cosponsored by Senators: Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Tim Johnson D-S.D.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Ken Salazar, D-Colo.; and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
   The resolution of disapproval is supported by New Mexico livestock producers, including the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. 
   The Senators believe lifting the ban would run counter to U.S. goals of providing safe meat for American consumers and remaining a BSE-free country. The first and only U.S. case of mad cow disease in a dairy cow was discovered in December 2003 in Washington state. 
   Last April, Domenici also joined Senators in advocating that the Canadian beef ban remain in place.
