SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF U.S. ATTORNEYS ACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding his votes on S.214, the U.S. Attorneys Act related to the manner in which vacant U.S. Attorney positions may be filled. The bill was passed on a 94-2 vote.  
   "The Senate plays an important role in vetting and approving presidential appointees. I voted for two amendments that would have returned us to a traditional appointment/approval process and ensured a more timely process for filling vacancies. I have concerns about allowing one branch of the government, the judicial branch in this instance, to have the final say over an executive branch vacancy. While both those amendments failed, I still voted for final passage of the bill because I believe the Senate should retain the advice and consent powers it is granted under the Constitution to confirm presidential nominees."
