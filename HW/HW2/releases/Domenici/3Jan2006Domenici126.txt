SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES HUD FUNDING FOR 27 N.M. HOMELESSNESS AGENCIES, $6.85 MILLION PROVIDED
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said 27 local agencies will benefit from more than $6.85 million in federal housing aid intended to support local government and nonprofit organizations provide housing and services for the homeless.  
   The funding, awarded by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, will support homelessness programs based in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Silver City, Socorro and Taos. Twenty-seven grants were made under two categories - the Supportive Housing Program for homeless families and individuals, and the Shelter Plus Care program for disabled persons. 
   "This is a sizable level of federal aid to tackle homelessness at the local level," Domenici said. "The funding will be used to help communities provide shelter for the homeless and to help these families and individuals rebound and reestablish housing stability in their lives." 
   Domenici has been a long-time advocate for the homeless, particularly those afflicted with mental illnesses. He authored the initial federal Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) legislation, and last year introduced legislation to reauthorize the PATH grant program. These grants support community-based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, case management and other support services for homeless people who suffer from serious mental illnesses.
