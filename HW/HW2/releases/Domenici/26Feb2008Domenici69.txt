SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA PROVIDES $803,809 TO NEW MEXICO FOR EMERGENCY FOOD & SHELTER AID
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced that 21 New Mexico counties will share $803,809 in federal emergency food and shelter grants to assist the hungry and homeless in their areas.  
   The funding is provided through the Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Administration, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to the 21 recipient counties in New Mexico, funding is also provided to a state EFS set-aside committee. 
   "The Emergency Food and Shelter Program has worked to help New Mexicans in need. It is directed to those organizations that work directly with the needy, which is critical to get aid where it is needed most," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds FEMA and other DHS programs. 
   The EFS grants provide emergency assistance to supplement community efforts to meet food, shelter, and other related needs of the homeless and poor. In New Mexico, more than 90 nonprofit, voluntary and social service organizations have received EFS grants. FEMA indicated that additional grants could be selected later by the EFS State Set-Aside Committee. 
   Most of this money is allocated by local boards with representatives from religious and charitable organizations. The boards guarantee that the funding is directed to areas where it is most needed, and that all monies are accounted for. 
   The grant recipients may use the funding on food and shelter, or emergency one-month assistance with rent, mortgage, and utility payments. Awards are based on criteria that take into account levels of population, unemployment and poverty. Congress provided FEMA with $153 million in FY2008 funding for EFS.
