SEN. DOMENICI TOUTS PROGRAM TO IMPROVE READING SKILLS AMONG MIGRANT STUDENTS IN ANTHONY
  Migrant students will have more resources available to them to improve their reading skills because of a $241,314 grant awarded by the Department of Education, announced Sen.  
 Pete Domenici. A check for that amount was presented to state officials last week at Anthony Elementary School in Anthony. 
   "I am very pleased the Education Department recognized the strides New Mexico has made to bring up our literacy rates. Reading is the key to future success and now migrant students around the state will have access to better services," Domenici said. 
   New Mexico is one of seven states to receive the two-year funding to support the Migrant Consortium Arrangement to Promote Academic Success (MAPAS) program which aims to improve the reading skills of migrant students. 
   The goal of MAPAS is to improve the reading skills of migrant children whose education is continuously interrupted as their families move from state to state to work in the agricultural and fishing industries. The program also provides teachers with professional development to help strengthen their skills. 
   MAPAS coincides with the goals set down by President Bush's No Child Left Behind initiative. The No Child Left Behind Act is the bipartisan landmark education reform law designed to close the achievement gap among groups of students, offering more flexibility to states, giving parents more options and teaching students based on what works.
