SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR GALLINAS WATERSHED PROPOSAL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today released the following statement announcing his support for a proposal to treat 8,200 acres in the Gallinas Watershed: 
   "The implementation of fuels reduction projects on National Forest lands to protect communities and watersheds from catastrophic wildfires is crucial. The Gallinas Municipal Watershed Wildland-Urban Interface Project proposes to treat about 8,200 acres using a combination of thinning, mastication, and prescribed burning.
   "The Gallinas Watershed is the primary source of water for Las Vegas and surrounding communities, which includes 17,000 people. It provides over 90% of the city's drinking water. A catastrophic high intensity wildfire in the watershed could devastate the city's ability to provide water for its citizens.
   "I support projects like the one being proposed for the Gallinas Watershed because the completion of these projects will help safeguard our watersheds and simultaneously address insect infestation problems. Ultimately, these improvements are a positive step toward correcting years of well-intended but misguided management practices.
   "I would also like to point out that preliminary monitoring data on the Santa Fe Watershed thinning project appears to indicate the thinning there has increased the annual water yield by as much as 29 percent. These early results are promising and should provide hope for Las Vegas and its surrounding communities.
   "Both the Las Vegas City Council and San Miguel County Commission have endorsed the proposal. I look forward to this project going forward as it is one of many projects which will ensure the long-term preservation of the forests in our state."
