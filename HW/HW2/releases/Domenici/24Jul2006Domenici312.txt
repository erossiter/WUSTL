   REVIEW:
   00:00 - Domenici says he commends Rep. Tom Udall for advancing legislation to prohibit energy production on the Valle Vidal in northeast New Mexico. While he says the bill had a "very good objective," he remains willing to allow the U.S. Forest Service to move forward with its land use review. He believes the Forest Service will ultimately determine that energy production on the Valle Vidal is not conducive to other uses on the lands. He says he continues to review the process and the legislation.
   01:45 - Domenici says the Air Force is following good business practices by sending a delegation from the Special Operations Command to the Clovis-Portales area to get a feel for the region that will soon be their home. He says the mission change schedule for Cannon Air Force Base is on target and that he's anxious for the next steps to establish the new mission at the base.
   04:10 - Domenici says he will work with Carlsbad city officials to help them get any federal assistance needed to help the more than 80 employees who will lose their call center jobs. He says good news announcements about new jobs are often taken for granted, but that layoffs show just how important job creation efforts are to a community. He says Carlsbad officials are always focused on bringing new jobs to the community.
   07:23 - Domenici says the Senate will take up an existing energy bill (S.3711) to allow energy production on Lease Sale 181 in the Gulf of Mexico, which will produce vast amounts of American-owned natural gas for domestic use. He says "it's close, it's clean, it's safe and it's ready." He discusses U.S. dependence on natural gas, and escalating costs. He says his Lease Sale 181 legislation could gain enough Senate support for passage through a revenue-sharing agreement to benefit Gulf Coast states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the U.S. Treasury. He says the question is whether to share revenue and produce American energy or just allow the status quo to rule.
   13:01 - Domenici says he regrets that Senator Jeff Bingaman opposes the revenue-sharing plan in the new energy bill, but he says the plan is necessary to garner enough votes to open Lease Sale 181 to energy production. He says this bill is a necessary follow-up to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and should help ease natural gas prices.
   16:13 - Domenici says that until carbon sequestration becomes more available new coal-powered energy plants will continue to use existing technology. He says all new plants, including two planned for Milan, N.M., and the Navajo Nation, must meet all environmental standards. However, he says carbon sequestration technology must be advanced to address global warming concerns. He also says a major U.S. alternative to coal plants should be to use more nuclear power that does not add to global warming. He notes federal government support for carbon sequestration and liquefied coal technologies.
   21:06 - Domenici reiterates his message to the New Mexico Wool Growers Association convention in Roswell, saying he will work to continue U.S. Department of Agriculture programs in the new Farm Bill that help the sheep industry. He says these programs are not large, but are beneficial to the survival of the industry.
   22:50 - Domenici notes that individual Senators can add projects to appropriations bills, and says he and Senator Bingaman try to support a variety of projects across the state.
   23:25 - Domenici says the Energy Policy Act of 2005 set the stage for 22 new applications for new nuclear power plant construction. He says he supports nuclear power usage because it is a clean fuel and that the nation is making progress on handling wastes. He notes that the uranium enrichment plant to be built near Eunice, N.M., will help provide the fuel for these new plants. Domenici says he is unsure more U.S. nuclear power will result in a rebirth of uranium mining in New Mexico or the Southwest.
