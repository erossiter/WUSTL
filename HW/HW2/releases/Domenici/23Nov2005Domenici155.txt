SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON THANKSGIVING DAY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following Thanksgiving Day statement to New Mexicans:  
   "I wish each and every New Mexican a joyful, safe and relaxing Thanksgiving holiday. This Thanksgiving season, we come together as a nation to give thanks for our many blessings. We live in a remarkable nation and have so much for which to be thankful. 
   "This year my wife Nancy and I will keep in our thoughts and prayers the families of American servicemen and women who cannot be with their loved ones this year. We are proud of these families and their sacrifices to support members of the Armed Forces who work as stalwarts of freedom and democracy around the world. Their service is not easy on their families. So we are thankful for their service and their work to make the world a better and safer place. We also will keep those they have left behind in our thoughts and prayers."
