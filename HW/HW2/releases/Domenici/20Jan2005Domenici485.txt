SEN. DOMENICI: NEW EDUCATION SEC. SPELLINGS WILL FURTHER PUBLIC EDUCATION REFORM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he has every confidence that the education reforms will be further advanced by Margaret Spellings who was confirmed by the Senate today to be the Secretary of Education.  
   With a voice vote, the Senate today confirmed Spellings to lead the U.S. Department of Education, replacing Secretary Rod Paige. Spellings has been serving as the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and has accumulated an extensive background on educational issues in her native state of Texas. 
   "Margaret Spellings has devoted her career to working to improve education for children in Texas and across the nation. She has had in-depth discussions with teachers, administrators and school board members. Her experience and dedication make her eminently qualified to serve as Secretary of Education," Domenici said. 
   As a top domestic advisor to President Bush, Spellings was integral to the development of the No Child Left Behind Act, which is producing solid improvements in reading and math for America's students and is helping students by transforming our public education system. 
   "Secretary Spellings understands about school reform and the federal role in education," Domenici said. "The fact that President Bush has chosen one of his closest and most trusted advisors to become Education Secretary is a clear sign that education will continue to be a top domestic priority for this administration during the next four years. I look forward to working with Margaret Spellings in her new role as Education Secretary to help make public schools great for every child." 
   In Texas, Spellings was associate executive director of the Texas Association of School Districts and was a senior advisor on state education policies to then-Governor George W. Bush.
