SEN. DOMENICI URGES SENIORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OPEN SEASON
  Sen. Pete Domenici today urged New Mexico's seniors to take advantage of the annual open enrollment period for Medicare's Prescription Drug Benefit. 
   From now until Dec. 31, current Prescription Drug benefit enrollees may change to a new drug plan if they choose. Medicate beneficiaries who have not yet signed up for the prescription drug benefit can also do so. For 2007, 57 plans will be offered in New Mexico.
   "Seniors across the country are saving hundreds of dollars by participating in Medicare's prescription drug benefit. I encourage seniors who already are members to make sure that their plan best fits their needs. If you are unhappy with your current plan, this is the time to change it. I also hope that those who have not yet signed up for the plan will consider their options and find out if it is right for them," said Domenici.
   On average, the monthly premium for a Medicare prescription drug plan in New Mexico is just over $33, and there are 29 plans that cost less than $30 a month.
   The new benefits plan was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, which Domenici supported in the Senate. Almost all of the 272,000 New Mexicans who receive Medicare are eligible for drug coverage under a Medicare prescription drug plan. Prescriptions can be obtained from neighborhood pharmacies and through mail order.
   Domenici encouraged seniors and families seeking more information to contact Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE or online at www.medicare.gov.
