LA FAMILIA HEALTH CENTER AWARDED HHS GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that La Familia Medical Center in Santa Fe was awarded $497,759 in federal funding to help low-income and uninsured New Mexicans in Santa Fe County. 
   La Familia Medical Center will receive the award through the Bureau of Primary Health Care, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   "Programs administered by La Familia provide essential tools to ensure adequate healthcare is available to those who need it," Domenici said. "Health care that is available for people of all income in rural as well as urban areas is a daunting task. But La Familia has managed to bring medical services to many New Mexicans throughout Santa Fe County for several years and I am pleased it now has additional funds to address its needs." 
   The funds will be used to expand medical services, including primary care, mental health, substance abuse and dental care. La Familia, established in 1972 by the city of Santa Fe, served 13,000 patients last year. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Domenici included $500,000 for facilities and equipment and $50,000 for community health workers programs for La Familia in the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Domenici also lobbied on behalf of La Familia several years ago to increase funding to maintain operations.
