SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS BRIEFING ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY SECURITY BREACH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the security breach in which reportedly classified material was taken from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and discovered during a drug-related bust by local law enforcement. The FBI is leading the investigation into the incident. 
   "I am profoundly disappointed and upset with this incident. I have talked with Energy Secretary Bodman, and I have asked that the FBI and DOE give me with a formal briefing.
   "At this point, it is not clear which security protocols have been violated or when it occurred. But clearly there is a serious problem when classified lab material is found off campus. This is a serious situation and I will press federal investigators and the lab to get to the bottom of this security breach quickly.
   "We have invested a significant amount of money for LANL to secure classified material, so the apparent movement of classified material outside the lab security network is upsetting and problematic. I want answers from the DOE Secretary and the new contractors on the effectiveness of that security system."
   Domenici is chairman of both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee-positions that give him oversight and funding jurisdiction of the Department of Energy and its national laboratories.
   Over the past two years, Domenici has secured an additional $40 million to install the so-called "red network" throughout LANL to secure classified material.
