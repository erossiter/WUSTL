SEN. DOMENICI GAINS $1.5 MILLION FOR LEA CO. ROAD IMPROVEMENT
  In what should be the last day of the 108th Congress, Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he has successfully secured $1.5 million for infrastructure improvements in Lea County that will support development of planned uranium enrichment facility near Eunice.  
   Domenici, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the funding in March as part of the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations Bill. House and Senate appropriators have completed negotiations on transportation funding for FY2005. These projects will be part of a massive omnibus appropriations package that will include nine separate appropriations bills. 
   "The leadership in Lea County has been diligent about working to ensure that they are ready for the prospect of bringing new industry to the area. This infusion of federal money is part of that effort, and I am pleased to be able to help in this way. The long-term goal of hosting a uranium enrichment facility in Lea County will require good infrastructure, and this $1.5 million is intended to help meet that need," Domenici said. 
   Domenici gained $1.5 million to support improvements to New Mexico Highway 176. Currently, the highway is crumbling and lacks paved shoulders for vehicles to pull off of, creating unsafe traveling conditions. In addition to serving as a popular route for tourism in southeastern New Mexico, the road provides access to local oil fields and is a gateway to the state of Texas. 
   The Congress is expected to give final passage to the omnibus bill on Saturday. All items in the $388 billion measure will be subject to a 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction. 
   Domenici is expected to announce other appropriations for southeast New Mexico Saturday as they are confirmed, including his request for funding to support infrastructure development at the Hobbs Industrial Air Park.
