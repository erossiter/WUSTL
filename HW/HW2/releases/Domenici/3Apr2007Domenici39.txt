SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $14.7 MILLION CONTRACT FOR SAN FELIPE DAY SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of the Army has awarded a $14.7 million contract to K.L. House Construction Co., Inc. of Albuquerque for work on a school at San Felipe Pueblo.  
   The contract will be administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. Valued at an expected $14.7 million, it will be used to expand and renovate facilities at the San Felipe Day School at the San Felipe Pueblo in Sandoval County. 
   "Improving the quality of our education facilities is an important first step in maintaining a proper learning environment for students," said Domenici. "I am happy to announce that not only will facilities at the San Felipe Day School be improved, but that the work needed to accomplish this will be performed by a New Mexico-based company." 
   Work is expected to include a 53,000 square foot expansion along with an additional 14,000 square feet of renovation that includes the plumbing, roofing, and electrical systems. Exterior work will involve a 65,000 gallon fire service water storage tank, fire hydrants, and a new parking lot and driveways. 
   The Army Corps of Engineers expects the project to be completed by July 2008. The contract award was made following a selection process that prioritized applicants according to criteria that included business size and ownership by either women or veterans. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which plays a large role in determining funding for programs in the Department of Defense.
