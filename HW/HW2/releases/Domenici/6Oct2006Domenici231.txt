SEN. DOMENICI HIGHLIGHTS NEW MEXICO ACTIVITIES FOR '2006 NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK'
  Sen. Pete Domenici today highlighted preparations in New Mexico to commemorate "National Character Counts Week," a time set aside annually for the last 12 years to celebrate the character education program. 
   A bipartisan resolution (S.Res.598) introduced by Domenici and Senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) sets 2006 National Character Counts Week as Oct. 15-21.
   Domenici first gained congressional recognition for the Character Counts program in 1994, and has since helped craft a federal grant program to help promote character education programs around the country. In New Mexico, he has worked with local leaders and schools to bring the Character Counts pillars of Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring and Citizenship in the classrooms and communities.
   "Character Counts week is a time to renew our commitment to the six pillars of good character and to highlight all the good work being done through Character Counts to make life in our state and in our country better," Domenici said.
   "I have supported Character Counts throughout the years because I believe this program reaches out to all youth and adults. This character education program transcends race, creed, politics, gender, or age. In New Mexico, it has grown well beyond our schools and is now being embraced by communities and a variety of organizations," he said.
   In a Congressional Record statement accompanying the resolution, Domenici highlighted a wide variety of Character Counts activities in New Mexico, ranging from daily lessons at Clovis' Mesa Elementary School, to poster distribution at Gallup High School to plans to launch a Character Counts-based program at the New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility at Grants.
