SEN. DOMENICI GAINS FY 2005 FUNDING FOR ESPA?OLA, CHAMA WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he has gained funding to begin helping Chimayo and Espa?ola improve their water systems, a goal made possible with the enactment of an authorizing bill he wrote to help the two northern New Mexico communities.  
   Within the massive FY2005 omnibus appropriations package that Congress approved Saturday, Domenici secured $250,000 for Espa?ola and $200,000 for Chimayo for work outlined in the Chimayo Water Supply System and Espa?ola Water Filtration Facility Act of 2004 (S.2511), which became law in October. (The omnibus bill is being prepared to send to President Bush to sign into law. All items in the omnibus appropriations package are subject to a 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction.) 
   Domenici gained the initial funding as part of Bureau of Reclamation funding. Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Bureau. 
   "I'm glad that we are providing this initial funding to help Chimayo and Espa?ola get the infrastructure in place to ensure clean and safe water supplies for the people," Domenici said. 
   The Domenici law directs the Interior Secretary to conduct a feasibility study of a Chimayo water supply system. It also directs the Interior Department to aid in the planning, design, and construction of a water supply, reclamation, and filtration facility for Espa?ola. 
   Elsewhere in the Energy and Water Development portion of the omnibus bill, Domenici pointed out that the bill provides $1.45 million for the ongoing effort to sustain and improve the acequias irrigation systems in northern New Mexico. 
   Through the Environmental Protection Agency, Domenici also gained a $1.0 million appropriation to support work by Espa?ola to improve its water and wastewater system. The House added another $150,000 for this work.
