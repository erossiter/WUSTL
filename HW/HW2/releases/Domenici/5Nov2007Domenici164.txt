SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE & LAS CRUCES RECEIVE TRANSIT FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded a $500,000 to the city of Santa Fe for improvements to its public transportation system. 
   DOT released the grant as part of its FY2007 Clean Fuels Grant Program. The city will replace three 30-foot buses to provide service for fixed route bus service. As a member of the Senate subcommittee that funds the DOT, Domenici supported federal grant funding for the Santa Fe project.
   "I consistently support federal funds for improvement to local transportation projects and programs," said Domenici. "I am pleased Santa Fe will now be able to update its public transportation system to provide convenient service to area residents."
   The city of Las Cruces also received $86,320 purchase two paratransit vans for its RoadRUNNER program.
   Earlier this year the Senate approved the FY2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill, which includes $1.0 million Domenici secured to support renovations on the Santa Fe Place transit center. The bill also has $320,000 for Las Cruces to purchase diesel paratransit vans.
   The bill awaits conference negotiations where it will be reconciled with the House-passed version.
