SEN. DOMENICI, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN OCS BILL
  Senate Energy & Natural Resources Chairman Pete V. Domenici today introduced the bipartisan Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (S.3711), legislation that directs new oil and gas leasing in 8.3 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico.
   The bill is cosponsored by Majority Leader Frist and Senators Cochran, Cornyn, Hutchison, Landrieu, Lott, Martinez, McConnell, Sessions, Shelby and Vitter. The bill was filed under Senate Rule 14. Debate is expected to begin on the bill next week. 
   The legislation directs the Department of the Interior to begin oil and gas leasing in designated parts of Lease Sale 181 no later than one year after the bill becomes law and directs leasing in 181 South as soon as practicable.
   It places a 16-year moratorium on oil and gas activity near the Florida coast and excludes certain parts of 181 and 181 South that are either used for military training activity or are near the Florida coast.
   The Gulf producing states will receive 37.5 percent of the revenue from oil and gas development in the new areas with an additional 12.5 percent going to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the state assistance program and the remaining 50 percent to federal coffers.
   After 2017, the Gulf producing states will also receive 37.5 percent of revenues from new leases in areas of existing development adjacent to Lease Sale 181.
   Chairman Domenici:
   "My top priority this year has been OCS legislation that makes a real difference in our energy supply. Every time the price of oil has climbed to a new high, I have intensified my efforts to do this bill. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work in crafting with me a bill that protects our environment while bringing enough oil and gas to market to ease supply constraints and stabilize energy prices. This bill strikes the balance I always strive for between our need for energy and our commitment to our environment. This legislation honors both priorities." BILL SUMMARY:
