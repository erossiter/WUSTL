  Sen. Pete Domenici late Tuesday issued the following statement related to the issuance of a report by the Office of the Inspector General (IG) at the Department of Energy on security concerns at Los Alamos National Laboratory:  
   "I will review this classified report and will work to ensure the lab and Energy Department implement previously proposed reforms that have yet to be fully implemented, as well as immediately act to execute the new procedures and practices identified by the IG.
