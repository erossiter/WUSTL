SEN. DOMENICI: WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT IS DOE 'BRIGHT SPOT' IN WASTE MANAGEMENT QUEST
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency recertifying that the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad continues to meet federal environmental regulatory requirements: 
   "This recertification indicates that the WIPP program is working well. It is undoubtedly a bright spot for DOE in terms of trying to address the critical waste issues facing the country. The EPA certification means that for almost 10 years WIPP has been, and continues, to be operated safely and soundly. Recertification is a credit to good management and everyone in the Carlsbad area that supports WIPP."
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that has funding jurisdiction over the Department of Energy and WIPP. He will soon begin crafting the FY2007 funding bill for the WIPP program.
   DOE in February recommended $213.3 million for the DOE Carlsbad Area Office and WIPP, a cut of $15 million. Although DOE proposes an additional $15 million for increased waste shipments and WIPP operations, it is offset by the following $30 million in reductions related to earmarks gained by Domenici in recent years, including: 
   * Economic Development, -$11 million; 
   * Central Characterization Project, -$15 million; and, 
   * Transportation, -$4 million.
