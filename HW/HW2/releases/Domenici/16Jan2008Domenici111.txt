SEN. DOMENICI SETS SIGHTS ON NEAR & LONG-TERM FUTURE OF FLETC ARTESIA CAMPUS
  In the build-up to the 2009 federal budget season, U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reviewed progress at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Artesia and received briefings on the near and long-term needs at the campus.  
   Domenici, who has championed FLETC-Artesia since its establishment in 1989, serves on the Senate committees that have appropriations and authorizing jurisdiction over all FLETC campuses, which are part of the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Since FY2006, Domenici has worked to secure more than $70 million for infrastructure improvements at the Artesia campus--including $1.2 million for a detention training facility and $2.1 million for a trainee recreation center in FY2008. 
   "Making sure the Artesia campus is well-equipped and funded to meet the training demands Congress is mandating remains a high priority for me as I begin my last year in Congress," said Domenici, who in October announced his retirement. 
   "The 2009 fiscal process is just beginning, so I want to be here to see first-hand the growth in Artesia and to get an on-the-ground assessment of what is still needed here, not just in the next year but on down the road," he said. "I have pledged to do everything I can to ensure that FLETC Artesia remains a pivotal training asset for the federal government." 
   While President Bush is expected to roll out his FY2009 budget requests on Feb. 4, Domenici is also working to develop his appropriations and legislative priorities for the upcoming year. As such, the veteran lawmaker is identifying policy and funding needs for FLETC and other projects around New Mexico. 
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, has enjoyed success in gaining new funding for FLETC Artesia in recent years, including: 
   * $45.0 million for two new dormitories (FY2006 and FY2007) 
   * $3.0 million for an aquatics training facility (FY2006) 
   * $10.0 million for a firearms multipurpose building (FY2007) 
   * $8.9 million for a language arts facility (FY2007) 
   * $1.2 million for a detention training facility (FY2008) 
   * $2.1 million for a recreation center (FY2008) 
   During his visit Wednesday, Domenici was briefed on current activities at FLETC Artesia, including: basic and advanced Border Patrol training; Federal Air Marshal training; Federal Flight Deck Officer training and Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement training. He also toured the campus to assess new and planned construction projects.
