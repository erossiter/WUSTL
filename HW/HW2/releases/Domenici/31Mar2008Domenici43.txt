   REVIEW:
   00:00 Domenici says he wants to learn more about the broad-based changes recommended by the Bush administration to reform federal oversight over investment and banking institutions. He says such reform will be difficult to enact. He says the changes must be right for the American taxpayers and not just the investment bankers.
   02:26 Domenici says the legislative effort to reform the Mining Law of 1872 should be moved forward. He states that amending the law must include royalty provisions and stronger environmental requirements. He says, however, that any reforms cannot be overburdened by regulations that would only serve to cripple the mining industry in the United States.
   4:33 Domenici says the administration's budget request to cut $23 million from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant budget could result in the layoff of 71 workers, reduce the number of shipments to WIPP, affect groundwater monitoring, and delay equipment replacement. He says he will work to restore the funding as the FY2009 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill is crafted this year.
   6:51 Domenici says he supports actions by the Mexican government to try to stop drug cartel violence on the Southwest Border. He says the violence is a serious problem and that such action by the Mexicans is necessary. He notes that his Las Cruces staff is working with local authorities to monitor the impact of the violence in New Mexico.
   9:16 Domenici says Congress is kicking around several legislative ideas to address the housing crisis facing many American homeowners, including the Security Against Foreclosures and Education Act. He says the serious foreclosure problem has not hit New Mexico as hard as it has in other states. He says it will be difficult to craft legislation to help those thrown into trouble because of subprime lending activities.
   12:37 Domenici says he favors action to address banking regulations because the banking and investment sectors have changed in recent years. He says better regulation should mean the federal government would not be required to bail out fewer troubled banking institutions.
   14:35 Domenici says he understands why the Federal Reserve Board would decided to provide aid for troubled banks, but says it is important that the federal government balance those actions by offering help to small investors or homeowners that have been victimized by the problems facing these banks and lending institutions. He says finding that balance will be difficult.
   19:02 Domenici says his Roswell office staff have received a few complaints about postal service in southeast New Mexico, but that these are individual cases and not on a broad scale.
   20:36 Domenici says he will formally issue his views on the future of the national laboratories under the National Nuclear Security Administration's lab transformation process. He discusses the plutonium pit production needs of the country and why Los Alamos National Laboratory is the best site for such work in the future. He says some of the criticism of pit production in New Mexico has not been objective.
   24:34 Domenici says he hopes the economic stimulus plan passed by Congress helps build consumer confidence, and that taxpayers will use the rebates to buy goods they need. He says he expects a projected economic recession to be short, but that the Federal Reserve must not tighten up credit lines to much. He says he is concerned about the long-term ability of the United States to compete in manufacturing. He also discusses the economic hot-spots in New Mexico, including activities in southeast New Mexico.
