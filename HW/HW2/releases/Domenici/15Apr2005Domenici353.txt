SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS BILL TO GENERATE REVENUES FOR NATIONAL PARKS IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cosponsored bipartisan legislation that commemorates the historic anniversaries of several national parks while potentially generating up to $33 million to support the national park system.  
   The National Park Anniversaries-Great American Spaces Commemorative Coin Act authorizes the U.S. Mint to produce silver dollars commemorating several national parks. Proceeds would be divided equally between the National Park Foundation, for the benefit of all parks, and 11 parks celebrating signification anniversaries in the near future. New Mexico parks will benefit from the half of proceeds devoted to the National Park Foundation. 
   "New Mexico's natural beauty is a huge tourism draw for the state and provides New Mexicans with continuous enjoyment and recreation. The bill not only celebrates the establishment of several parks across the nation but also includes a funding source that can help support parks in New Mexico and elsewhere," Domenici said. "Several of New Mexico's national parks and monuments could benefit from the funds generated by this bill. Revenues would support more infrastructure upgrades that provide services and facilities for visitors." 
   New Mexico has 13 national parks and monuments, including Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands and Bandelier national monuments. 
   The bill commissions the U.S. Mint to produce no more than 300,000 $1 coins to mark the anniversaries of 11 national parks around the nation. Charges accrued from the sale of coins will be divided equally in half between those parks with significant anniversaries and the National Park Foundation. 
   The National Park Service was established in 1916 to preserve and protect great scenic parks and encourage public appreciation for the monuments by raising private funds, making strategic grants, creating innovative partnerships and increasing public awareness.
