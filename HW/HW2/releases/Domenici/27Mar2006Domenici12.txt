   REVIEW:
   00:00 - Domenici says he has expressed his concerns to Governor Richardson about the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) implementation of the new federal arsenic drinking water regulations. He says the NMED should be utilizing the more lenient guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   02:20 - Domenici says the Senate will begin debate on the controversial subjects of border security and immigration reform. He says he is particularly interested in how the Senate will deal with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already in the United States, many of them for numerous years. He is critical of those who believe illegal immigrants can be rounded up and shipped out of the country, and instead believes there must be a way to give them some legitimate status even if they cannot become citizens.
   05:36 - Domenici says he is hearing more about economic development activities in the Raton area, and notes his support for technological research being carried out by a local firm.
   07:09 - Domenici says the Interior Department decision on whether to support the Jemez Pueblo's bid to establish an off-reservation casino in Anthony, N.M., will probably be made by the likely new Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and not out-going Secretary Gale Norton. He discusses Kempthorne's career as a Senator and then Idaho governor, and expressed the desire to have Kempthorne confirmed soon.
   08:31 - Domenici says he understands that consumers are being hit by higher natural gas prices. He says Congress can take action to help ease prices. He notes that the Energy Policy Act authorized the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska, and says Congress should pass his bill to authorize natural gas development on Lease Hold 181 in Gulf of Mexico more than 100 miles off the coast of Florida. He says the Gulf production could bring vast amounts of American-owned natural gas to the market.
   12:10 - Domenici says Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories are part of an arsenic water technology partnership that is actively working with New Mexico water systems to find affordable technologies that can help them met the new federal arsenic standard. He says the procedure set by the EPA can give these New Mexico systems more time to meet those standards.
   14:10 - Domenici says he believes much of the public and some members of Congress don't understand the illegal immigration situation in the country. He reiterates the need for workable program, and that he expects to be active in the Senate debate to craft a fair system for dealing with illegal immigrants.
