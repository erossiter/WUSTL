WHEELER PEAK FIRE DISTRICT, RED RIVER FIREFIGHTERS WINS DHS GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the Wheeler Peak Fire District will receive funds from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to purchase operations and firefighter safety equipment for area firefighters.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), announced that Wheeler Peak Fire District will receive $35,244 to procure personal gear for firefighters serving the Red River area. 
   "New Mexico's emergency responders must be prepared for any situation that could threaten our safety. These funds help bolster the Wheeler Peak Fire District and supply firefighters with necessary protective gear," Domenici said. 
   The funding is a one-year award through the FY2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program (AFGP), which is administered by the Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the USFA. 
   The Wheeler Peak Fire District will purchase eight self-contained breathing apparatuses, or SCBA's. The grant will also pay for cascade systems that refill personal air tanks on site. 
   The AFGP awarded these grants after Congress appropriated and President Bush signed into law $750 million in federal funds for firefighters throughout the nation.
