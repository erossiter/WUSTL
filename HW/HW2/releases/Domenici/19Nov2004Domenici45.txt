FIVE NEW MEXICO HEAD START PROGRAMS RECEIVE $8.7 MILLION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that five Head Start projects in New Mexico have been awarded a total of $8.7 million in federal funding to support early childhood development programs in the state.  
   The funding was provided through the Department of Health and Human Services for Head Start programs in Santa Fe, Hobbs, Albuquerque, Silver City, and Santo Domingo Pueblo. 
   "Our youth need to have strong and equal footing when it comes to education. Making sure low-income and minority students have the same opportunities to learn is the best way to have a stronger state and improve the chances of success for our youngsters," Domenici said. "I'm pleased that these programs in Santa Fe, Hobbs, Albuquerque, Silver City, and Santo Domingo Pueblo will receive this funding for local Head Start programs." 
   The five programs are part of a growing number of New Mexico Head Start programs that have benefited from Domenici's efforts to increase resources for the program. The funding was awarded as follows: 
   * $5,016,691 to Presbyterian Medical Services in Santa Fe 
   * $1,281,461 to Child & Family Services, Inc. in Hobbs 
   * $1,057,594 to the Home Education Livelihood Program in Albuquerque 
   * $776,589 to Santo Domingo Pueblo 
   * $603,558 to El Grito, Inc in Silver City 
   The New Mexico lawmaker, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding levels for HHS, supports $6.94 billion for Head Start in FY 2005, a $165 million increase from the previous year. New Mexico will receive $49.3 million of this allotment in FY2005 to serve over 7,000 enrolled children. 
   The Head Start program, which began in 1965, is a comprehensive early childhood development program that seeks to provide comprehensive developmental services for low income, pre school children ages three to five, as well as social services for their families.
