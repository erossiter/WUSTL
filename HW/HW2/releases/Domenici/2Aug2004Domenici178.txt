COCHITI PUEBLO GETS FEDERAL FUNDS TO DEVELOP VISITOR CENTER LINKED TO SMALL BUSINESS JOBS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Cochiti Pueblo has been awarded a $100,000 rural development grant to plan a proposed visitor center that would be linked to small business development for the pueblo.  
   Domenici said the pueblo is receiving the Rural Business Opportunity Grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The funding is intended to support a feasibility plan for a proposed Kasha-Katuwe Visitor Center, a business and cultural facility. 
   "Cochiti Pueblo has some dynamic attractions and the development of this proposed center would give it a location from which it can highlight some of the products made by its people," Domenici said. "The center could serve as one way for the pueblo to expand opportunity for small businesses at the pueblo and take offer more of its products to the thousands of people who visit the pueblo and the Kasha Katuwe Tent Rock National Monument." 
   According to the USDA, the grant will support the first phase development of the project, which would eventually be expanded to assist tribal businesses as a location to create and sell products and provide small business technical assistance.
