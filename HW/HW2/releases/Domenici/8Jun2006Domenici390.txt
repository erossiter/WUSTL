SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN MEET WITH TAOS WATER SETTLEMENT PARTIES
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today met with the non-federal parties to the Taos (Abyeta) settlement today to discuss implementation of the proposal. 
   The Taos water settlement was signed May 30 after 17 years of negotiations, but has not been agreed to by the federal government. Congressional legislation is needed in order for the settlement to proceed. Domenici and Bingaman met with the representatives from the Taos Pueblo, town of Taos, local water districts, and the state of New Mexico.
   "Today's meeting was very valuable and gave me some real feeling of the depths to which the parties have gone to try to resolve the issues in dispute. I want to be as helpful as I can be to them. I've already asked Secretary Kempthorne to devote his attention to New Mexico's water settlements. It is necessary for the Interior Department to make its position known before we can proceed," Domenici said.
   "I applaud the effort that went into crafting this settlement, reached between the pueblo, the state, and the local parties. Now, I hope we can engage the Justice Department and the Department of the Interior in a good faith effort to resolve any outstanding federal issues so we can clear the path for federal legislation," Bingaman said.
   The Senators said that since this year's legislative session is already more than half done, it would be very difficult to act this year. However, they vowed to meet again when the Interior Department's position on the settlement is better understood.
   The Taos settlement has a total cost of around $135 million, and proposes a $120 million federal share. In total, the proposed Taos, Aamodt and Navajo settlements would require a federal contribution of over $1 billion.
