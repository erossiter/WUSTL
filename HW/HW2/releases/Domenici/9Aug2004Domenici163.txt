SEN. DOMENICI BRIEFED ON LANL SECURITY EFFORTS, SAYS SECURITY UPGRADES WILL ASSURE LAB FUTURE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today received briefings on the security and management changes now underway at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and expressed confidence that the lab will remain the nation's preeminent scientific institution as it works through necessary security reforms.  
   Domenici is chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Energy national laboratories. Domenici, who has been an ardent supporter of both Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories in New Mexico, was briefed by LANL Director G. Peter Nanos and other senior lab managers on the state of security at the lab and to gain a better understanding as to why security failures have brought all scientific research to a standstill. 
   "There is no doubt that LANL is one of the best facilities in the world, and I will continue to support it. I believe the lab's future is bright and we'll get through this. Director Nanos has put the lab on a course that reinforces the message that there can no longer be any tolerance for lax adherence to security here or at any other DOE lab," Domenici said. 
   "I want every employee to take it upon themselves to change the culture and to focus on restoring the reputation of the lab as the best example of scientific research, and not the weakest link in our security chain," he said. 
   Domenici said he expects to move forward on the FY2005 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill when the Senate returns to session in September. He also reiterated his opposition to a bill (S.2746) introduced by Senator Wayne Allard that would require DOE to terminate the University of California contract to operate LANL by March 15, 2005, and require the Energy Secretary to appoint an interim manager to run the lab until a new contractor could be formally selected in the fall of 2005.
