SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ENERGY SECRETARY ABRAHAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the resignation announcement made by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.  
   "I commend Secretary Abraham for a job well done and wish him, his wife Jane, and the rest of their family, the best. Spencer Abraham has served the nation well both as a U.S. Senator and as Secretary of Energy. 
   "Secretary Abraham proved to be a steady hand on whole range of issues that are critical to all Americans, both in terms of national security and the domestic economy. He worked overtime to do what is necessary to stabilize world energy markets, and was key to developing a good national energy policy. And, to his credit, Secretary Abraham worked doggedly with Russia to advance nonproliferation programs. 
   "We will now continue to use the strong foundation he laid for us. There is a lot of work still to do."
