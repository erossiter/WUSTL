SEN. DOMENICI: FEDERAL GRANT AWARDED FOR UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the University of New Mexico has been awarded a $167,000 grant to fund further research in mental health.  
   The grant has been awarded through the National Institute of Mental Health to support research that will allow UNM scientists to gain a better understanding of cell functioning and in turn create better techniques for future cellular response studies. 
   "We are now in an exciting time in mental health research," Domenici said. "There are numerous advancements arising everyday in this field. This grant will make it possible for the University of New Mexico to take part in these advances." 
   The research will be conducted through the Department of Neurosciences. Assistant Professor Dr. Kevin Caldwell explained that this type of research is essential because it will develop better scientific techniques for future studies in mental health issues. The project is titled "Protein-protein interaction domains: targets for neuropharmacologic intervention." 
   Dr. Caldwell hopes that this research will enhance future studies in the connection between learning disabilities in children and substances they have been exposed to in the womb. He hopes to study the effects of many substances such as nicotine, alcohol and arsenic.
