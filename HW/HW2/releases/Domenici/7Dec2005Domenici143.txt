SEN. DOMENICI: DOE RENEWS CONTRACT FOR UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded an award of $342,000 as part of a significant contract to the University of New Mexico (UNM) for continued scientific research.  
   UNM was awarded the renewal funding as part of a larger fifteen-year, $5.3 million contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) and The Regents of UNM for a project to research strange particles and heavy ion physics. 
   "The continuation of this contract will offer the necessary support for UNM to maintain the quality and continuity of their research," said Domenici. "This not only advances the students and faculty members' education, but it also gives the University a competitive edge in scientific investigation." 
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for the DOE and its programs. 
   UNM's Nuclear Physics, Particle Physics and Particle AstroPhysics programs, in collaborations with the New Mexico Center for Particle Physics (NMCPP), was also awarded a four-year, $4.6 million contract in 2003. This funding promoted the research for the particle physics program.
