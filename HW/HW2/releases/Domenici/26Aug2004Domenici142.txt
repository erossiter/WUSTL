SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES CONSERVATION FUNDS FOR ISLETA, SANTA ANA PUEBLOS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the Department of Interior (DOI) has awarded grants to Isleta and Santa Ana pueblos to protect three endangered species indigenous to New Mexico.  
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior that funds the DOI and its Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI) program. The Isleta and Santa Ana projects are aimed at improving habitats for the Rio Grande silvery minnow, willow flycatcher and yellow-billed cuckoo. 
   "These grants are yet another indication that there are multiple angles for trying to address endangered species problems in New Mexico. The pueblos have been part of the cooperative effort to improve habitats, and these Santa Ana and Isleta projects are another step in that quest," Domenici said. 
   The DOI awarded Isleta Pueblo $150,000 to construct a rearing habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. These funds will also protect the southwestern willow flycatcher in Bernalillo County. 
   Santa Ana Pueblo was awarded $149,947 for the Willow Swale Development and Surveys project that restores the habitats of the southwestern willow flycatcher and the yellow-billed cuckoo, both of which are endangered. 
   Domenici also announced that the Jicarilla Apache Nation also received a $17,700 CCI grant to restore the roundtail chub to the Navajo River through habitat improvements. The funds will help install three drum screens that will prevent the entry of non-native fish into the river. 
   Last December, Domenici and Sandia Pueblo Governor Stuwart Piasano unveiled a proposal to create near-natural sanctuaries north of Albuquerque that are adjacent and connected to the Rio Grande to support the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow. That plan is still under review by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers.
