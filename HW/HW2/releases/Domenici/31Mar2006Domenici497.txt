SEN. DOMENICI TALKS BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH RADIO HOST LAURA INGRAHAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today was a guest on the Laura Ingraham Show to discuss the Senate debate on border security and immigration reform legislation. 
   During the program, Domenici expresses his belief that it is possible for Congress to pass legislation that would fortify America's borders and deal with the estimated 11 million undocumented workers now in the United States.
   Domenici has introduced bills dealing with border security (S.2049) and immigration reform (S.2326), and is planning to offer amendments based on those bills to try to improve The Securing America's Border Act (S.2454) that is now pending in the Senate. Debate is expected to extend throughout next week.
   Domenici, who told Ingraham he does not support the McCain-Kennedy guest worker plan, instead said he supports a two-pronged approach to border security and immigration reform. He said a stronger national commitment must be made to meet the expense and time required to secure the border.
   Domenici also indicated that he does not support automatic deportation of undocumented workers and their families nor does he support amnesty or an automatic path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United States.
   Domenici said he believes there is a middle ground between these proposals that would recognize the contributions of undocumented workers who have been contributing to America's economy and society that would allow them to continue doing so, at least for some amount of time.
