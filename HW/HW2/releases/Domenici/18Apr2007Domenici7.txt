SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. SUPREME COURT RULING UPHOLDING PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a national ban on partial-birth abortion affirms his belief that Congress was right to prohibit the late-term procedure used to end pregnancies. 
   The Supreme Court Wednesday upheld the constitutionality of the 2003 law banning partial-birth abortion, ruling that the law does not violate a woman's right to an abortion. Domenici cosponsored the 2003 legislation that was enacted into law. 
   "The Supreme Court has affirmed what a vast majority of Americans believe--that partial-birth abortion amounts to an inhumane procedure. I believe that an unborn life is worthy of protection, and I'm pleased that the Court has upheld the law that bans partial-birth abortions. I continue to believe it is an unnecessary, cruel and inhumane practice," Domenici said. 
   Partial-birth abortion is a procedure most often performed over a three-day period in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The 2003 legislation was drafted to take into account concerns cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2000 Stenberg v. Carhart decision. 
   Domenici supported previous partial-birth abortion bans that were approved by the 104th, 105th and 106th congresses. Congress was unable to overcome a number of vetoes by former President Bill Clinton. The House of Representatives passed a partial-birth abortion ban during the 107th Congress, but the Senate was prevented from considering a similar ban.
