SEN. DOMENICI URGES DOE SECRETARY TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY CONTRACT PROCESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today voiced serious concerns about National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) efforts to structure a bidding process for the contract to operate Los Alamos National Laboratory, and asked the Energy Secretary to become more involved in developing the final proposal.  
   Domenici addressed the LANL contracting process during an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing at which Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman appeared to review the FY2006 budget requests for the Department of Energy. 
   At the hearing Domenici, who traveled with Bodman to LANL last week, voiced growing concerns with the draft and reconfigured request for proposal (RFP) issued by the NNSA regarding the LANL operations and administration process.
