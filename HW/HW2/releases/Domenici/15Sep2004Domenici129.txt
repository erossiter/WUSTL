SENATE PASSES BILL TO RENAME COLORADO LAKE TO HONOR SEN. NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL
  The U.S. Senate has passed a bill authored by Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today to rename a lake on Basin Creek, a tributary of the Animas River in southwest Colorado after his friend and retiring colleague - Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell. 
   The Senate on Wednesday approved S.2508, which authorizes renaming the Ridges Basin Reservoir, created as part of the Animas-La Plata project, as Lake Nighthorse. The bill was approved by unanimous consent. 
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced the bill in June as a tribute to Campbell who announced his retirement from the Senate earlier this year. 
   "I am very pleased the Senate has approved this bill, and I am confident that Senator Campbell's former colleagues in the House will do likewise before this session ends. Senator Campbell has a long history of public service and is a wonderful person. I think this is a fitting tribute," Domenici said. 
   The lake near Durango was created under the Colorado Ute Indian Water Settlement Act of 1988. 
   Domenici and Campbell, the only American Indian serving in the Senate, have worked together on a number of committees including the Senate Appropriations Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.
