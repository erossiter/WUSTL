SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS FUNDING EXTENSION FOR LAS CRUCES TRANSIT CENTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that he is requesting that almost $2 million appropriated for a Las Cruces intermodal transit center remain available for the project and not be allowed to expire on Sept. 30.  
   Domenici has sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury and General Government, asking that language extending the funds be included in the FY2005 Transportation Appropriations Bill, which the Subcommittee will work on this summer. 
   "This intermodal transit center is a high priority for my constituents, and Las Cruces is now ready to proceed with the project," Domenici said. "However, the funds which were previously appropriated are due to expire at the end of September. I've asked that funds be made available through next year to ensure that this project is completed." 
   In FY2002, Congress appropriated $1.98 million for the Intermodal Transit project. The facility will allow the city to coordinate transit systems for its residents. 
   The city of Las Cruces is currently preparing a grant application to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) but Domenici is concerned the application may not be completed by the deadline of Sept. 30. 
   "It would not be fair for Las Cruces to lose its funding for the transportation center because the grant application isn't finalized in time," Domenici said. "Since Congress has already appropriated these funds, I believe that Las Cruces, one of New Mexico's fastest growing cities, should be able to put them to use."
