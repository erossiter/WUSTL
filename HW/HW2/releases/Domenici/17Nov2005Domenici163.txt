SENS. DOMENICI, DORGAN UNVEIL BORDER MODERNIZATION BILL
  Having just returned from a trip to the Mexican Border, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico today introduced comprehensive legislation to address necessary border security needs--crafting a plan to bring new manpower, technology and equipment to the nation's borders.  
   Domenici and Senator Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), along with Senator Jim Talent (R-Mo.), today introduced the Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005, an authorization bill which addresses four primary needs to begin confronting illegal immigration and the security threats posed by porous borders: personnel, technology, infrastructure and aid to border states. 
   "I believe before we can act on needed immigration law reforms, we must secure our borders," Domenici said. "It is increasingly clear to me that this country is not keeping up with the flood of illegal immigrants. This is not only an issue of fairness to the many immigrants that come here legally and contribute to our society. It is also a major security issue, and we in Congress must get serious about enforcing our border." 
   "The legislation I'm introducing with Senator Dorgan would improve all phases of border security. It is not just about adding Border Patrol agents, which Congress is doing. It is about increasing the number of personnel needed to apprehend, detain, and deport illegal immigrants, and give them state-of-the-art technology and equipment to get the job done," he continued. 
   Over the next five years, the Domenici-Dorgan bill will authorize an increase in the number of Customs and Border Protection personnel by 5,000, attorneys assigned to immigration cases by 1,000 and immigration judges by 500. It will also allow the Department of Homeland Security to supplant its force with National Guard personnel and volunteer retired law enforcement officers. The actual number of personnel hired will be subject to congressional appropriations. 
   For the first time in almost 20 years, the bill would authorize a comprehensive land port-of-entry infrastructure overhaul. It calls on the General Services Administration (GSA) with the Department of Homeland Security to identify and prioritize needed border crossing improvements on the Mexican and Canadian borders. Congress last passed a major border infrastructure plan with legislation authored in 1986 by Domenici and then-Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). Since then, a 2000 GSA study found that there are at least $786 million in improvements needed at U.S. ports of entry. 
   "Congress has acted to improve security at airports and seaports, but we have not yet addressed the needs of our busiest ports-of-entry. This bill would change that and would work to prevent terrorists from exploiting weaknesses at our land ports," Domenici said. 
   The bill also authorizes significant funds to acquire new technology, construct roads, fences and barriers, and purchase air assets like helicopters. It calls for increasing the number of beds available for immigration detention and removal by 15,000 by 2010, and requires DHS to implement pilot programs in all border states regarding alternatives to detaining illegal immigrants. 
   Finally, the bill reauthorizes the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) through 2011, while increasing the bond a detained alien must pay to be released from custody to $5,000. Detained aliens would no longer be able to be released on conditional parole, and the bill will increase criminal penalties for human smuggling, falsifying work/entry documents, drug trafficking, and participating in criminal street gangs.
