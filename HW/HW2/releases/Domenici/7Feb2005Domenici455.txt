SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON FY 2006 PENTAGON BUDGET OUTLOOK, BID TO RETIRE SOME F-117 FIGHTERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement in regard to the FY2006 Pentagon budget submitted to the White House today.  
   Domenici is a veteran member of the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, and will play an active role in the development of a FY2006 Budget Resolution and the spending bills that will fund the federal government next year. 
   "I view this year's Defense Department budget request as a mixed bag. On the positive side, I am very pleased that a much-deserved 3.1 percent pay increase for our troops has been included. Overall defense spending has been increased by 4.8 percent, which I believe is appropriate for a time of war, especially considering the large increases of the previous few years. The White House will also be asking for additional funds specifically for the Iraq war effort which I expect to include items such as body armor and equipment. 
   "In relation to New Mexico, I'm pleased that research and development is continuing to see strong funding levels. Specifically, the High Energy Laser System Test Facility would see a solid increase of $2.6 million. The Airborne Laser Program at Kirtland, which will be capable of tracking and killing ballistic missiles, also would receive a $7 million increase to $483 million. 
   "However, I am concerned that Pentagon has once again indicated its desire to retire 10 F-117 Stealth Aircraft stationed at Holloman. I do not support this action because I continue to believe that it is not in the best interest of the country nor does it provide significant cost savings. Like last year, I plan on resisting this retirement during debate on the FY2006 Defense bill. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to look out for the best interests of Holloman and for New Mexico's military installations."
