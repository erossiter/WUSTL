NEGOTIATORS KEEP SEN. DOMENICI'S SOUTH VALLEY FLOOD AND BOSQUE RESTORATION PROJECTS IN WATER BILL
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that Congress is set to give final approval to a long-awaited national water resources bill that includes three New Mexico provisions he wrote to authorize more than $56.1 million to continue bosque restoration and flood control work on the middle Rio Grande.  
   Senate and House negotiators have reached a final accord on legislation to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Final approval by both the House and Senate could occur as soon as this week, allowing the bill to be sent to President Bush to become law. 
   Language in the bill authored by Domenici authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to continue its participation on Middle Rio Grande bosque restoration work, South Valley flood control projects and overall Rio Grande environmental restoration work. WRDA authorizes appropriations for water resource projects and studies for the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. 
   "We are on the cusp of officially sanctioning the Army Corps to continue its work with New Mexicans to make our bosque healthier and improve public safety and health by enlisting its work to control flooding threats and provide for basic infrastructure," Domenici said. "We've waited a long while for a new WRDA bill, and I'm pleased this reauthorization plan has good things in it for New Mexico." 
   The final bill (HR.1495/S.1248) includes these three Domenici projects: 
   * The Middle Rio Grande Restoration Project authorizes the Corps to increase its work to remove jetty jacks, replace invasive species like salt cedar with native vegetation such as cottonwoods, and create paths, viewing areas and other educational and recreational opportunities throughout the Middle Rio Grande. This project is associated with Domenici's initiative to create a park-like bosque greenbelt through metropolitan Albuquerque. Domenici has requested that the federal government pay for all improvements on federally-owned lands. ($25 million authorization) 
   * The Southwest Valley Albuquerque New Mexico Flood Damage Reduction Project authorizes the Corps to construct detention basins and a pumping station in Albuquerque's North and South Valley. This is a continuation of a program supported and funded by Domenici since the mid-1990s. The Corps has worked with Bernalillo County and the city of Albuquerque on these projects. ($16.15 million federal authorization, $8.69 million nonfederal share) 
   * The Rio Grande Environmental Management Program for Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas authorizes the Corps to address environmental restoration and management on the Rio Grande and its tributaries through planning, construction, and evaluation of habitat rehabilitation and enhancement. This program also calls for long term river data acquisition coupled with an adaptive management program. ($15 million authorization.) 
   Domenici is ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that provides funding for WRDA-authorized projects. Within the Senate's FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, Domenici included $10.0 million for WRDA Section 595 projects like the North and South Valley flood control works, and $4.0 million for Rio Grande bosque restoration.
