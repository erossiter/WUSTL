SBA, AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT OFFER DISASTER AID TO LEA COUNTY FLOOD DAMAGE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that businesses located in Lea County will be able to apply for low interest Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA).  
   The loans were issued due to the excessive rain, flash flooding, high winds, and lightning that occurred from Sept. 25 to 30 that damaged crops of local farmers and ranchers, which resulted in a negative economic impact on businesses that depend upon these producers. 
   "Small businesses are essential to economic growth in southeastern New Mexico. These loans will help to supplement the substantial costs incurred by some businesses in Lea County. I believe that the assistance will help those in the area who were affected to get back on their feet," Domenici said. 
   Agriculturally dependent businesses that incurred economic losses may apply for loans up to $1.5 million to help pay installments on long-term debt, accounts payable, and overhead expenses that would have been met if not for the disaster. Loans are designed to be used in conjunction with monies from other sources available to business owners. 
   Domenici also reported today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has designated Lea County as a contiguous natural disaster area as a result of excessive rains and flooding that occurred on Oct. 5. Five Texas counties were also included in the designation. This announcement allows farmers in Lea County to apply for compensation of damaged crops and economic losses in the form of low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency (FSA).
