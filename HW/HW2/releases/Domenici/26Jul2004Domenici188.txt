SEN. DOMENICI: ALBUQUERQUE COMPANY SEIZES OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH FOR DOE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded Albuquerque-based Cabot Superior MicroPowders for its role in researching new technologies that would provide energy efficient lighting for buildings across the nation.  
   The three-year contract was issued through the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Building Technologies Program for a total of $4.2 million. Cabot Superior MicroPowders (CSMP) will be working in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories. 
   "I am very pleased that this private company is working in conjunction with Sandia to find better ways to bring efficient lighting to the public," Domenici said. "This research aims to develop longer lasting and energy efficient lighting methods using new technologies." 
   The project, titled Development of Advanced LED Phosphors by Spray-Based Processes for Solid State Lighting Applications, supports the goals of DOE's Solid State Lighting program to develop advanced solid state lighting technologies that are more energy efficient, longer lasting, and cost competitive than conventional lighting by 2015. 
   CSMP, founded in 1997 and acquired in 2003 by Cabot Corporation, is an enabling materials solutions provider. CSMP delivers advanced materials systems for a variety of markets and applications. 
   Cabot Corp., headquartered in Boston, is a global specialty chemicals and materials company. Cabot's major products are carbon black, fumed silica, inkjet colorants, and capacitor materials.
