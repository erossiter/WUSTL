NEW MEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENTS SELECTED FOR $1.0 MILLION IN CRIME FIGHTING FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that New Mexico will take home a total of over $1.1 million to bolster the ability of local law enforcement agencies to fight crime.  
   Domenici is a member of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for DOJ programs, including the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) program that helps reduce crime and improve public safety. 
   "As part of the continuing efforts to eliminate crime in New Mexico, these awards support key resources and programs that allow police to enhance local protections and security for New Mexicans," Domenici said. 
   "I am particularly pleased that these funds give control to local police departments so they can draw up programs and plans that are tailored to the community's needs," he said. 
   Qualified jurisdictions are determined by a formula that considers the number of Part I violent crimes in the area (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) reported to the FBI and are given direct allocations. 
   After direct allocations are made, the remaining state funds, if any, will be awarded to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety in Santa Fe.

   * Albuquerque, $405,837
