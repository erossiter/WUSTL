   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici says Democratic leadership in Congress are providing little information as to how FY2008 appropriations measures will be handled, and predicts that the continuing resolution (CR) to fund the federal government will have to be extended by at least a month after the current CR expires Nov. 16. He believes the DOE national laboratories should remain at FY2007 funding levels. 
   02:56 Domenici says the KSL contractor used by Los Alamos National Laboratory must answer the specific charges levied by a DOE Inspector General, and that DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration have an obligation to implement the IG recommendations and go after any fraudulent activities among its contractors. 
   04:46 Domenici says early reports about DOE plans to reform its national laboratory system indicate that the labs in New Mexico may not grow much in the future. He says he has stressed the need for DOE to focus on science and advanced computing in its long-term plans for the labs. 
   07:20 Domenici emphasizes the need to maintain the defense-related work that makes up the backbone of activities at Los Alamos and Sandia. He says that work must continue no matter what changes might be recommended by DOE. 
   09:02 Domenici says he has not decided how he will vote on Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey, but says Mukasey must clarify his stand on the "waterboarding" for his confirmation to make it through the Senate. 
   11:16 Domenici says he does not believe the U.S. federal agencies, like the Central Intelligence Agency, would break the law on interrogation practices. He notes that the United States has made fewer mistakes in this area than many other countries. 
   12:30 Domenici discusses the bill he unveiled today with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and First Lady Laura Bush to formally authorize the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures program. He notes that these small historic preservation programs have been useful to work in New Mexico to preserve its heritage and culture.
