SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO UPGRADE DEMING, T&C SCHOOL LIBRARIES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Education (DoED) has awarded $530,406 in grants to improve school libraries in Deming and Truth or Consequences.  
   Deming Public Schools received $299,555 to provide books, technology, and online subscriptions for the library at Red Mountain Middle School. 
   DoED also awarded $230,851 to T or C Municipal Schools for material and media technology upgrades at Arrey Elementary School. 
   "School libraries serve as a primary educational resource in local schools, which means it is necessary to ensure they are well equipped," said Domenici. "These grants from the Department of Education will go a long way in providing the technology and media needed in Deming and T or C school libraries." 
   Funds were awarded under DoED's Literacy and School Libraries Program, which aims to equip schools with modern school library materials that include access to media and professionally trained staff. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs, including grants administered by the Department of Education.
