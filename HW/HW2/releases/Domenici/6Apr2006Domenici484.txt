SEN. DOMENICI COSPONORS 'FUGITIVE SAFE SURRENDER' BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined in introducing the Fugitive Safe Surrender Act to establish a national program that would team the U.S. Marshals Service with nonprofit organizations and churches to get fugitives to turn themselves in to authorities. 
   Domenici is an original cosponsor of the bill, which was authored by Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) based on a successful pilot program conducted in Cleveland.
   "This is a program that seems promising on many different levels, especially in terms of low-risk fugitive apprehension. It would reduce the dangers posed to law enforcement and the public during more typical take downs. This bill will give the Marshals Service another tool for apprehending fugitives wanted on federal, state and local levels," Domenici said.
   The legislation would authorize the creation of Fugitive Safe Surrender programs in selected cities, including Albuquerque. The U.S. Marshals Service would partner with public, private and faith-based organizations to temporarily transform a church into a courthouse where fugitives can turn themselves in.
   The legislation is supported by U.S. Marshal Gorden Eden in New Mexico, as well as the local courts and law enforcement.
   The bill would authorize Congress to appropriate $3.0 million in FY2007, $5.0 million in FY2008, and $8.0 million in FY2009 to establish and carry out the program. The bill specifically states that the new program may not diminish any other U.S. Marshal Service authority to locate and apprehend fugitives.
   During Cleveland's three-day Fugitive Safe Surrender pilot program, more than 800 fugitives turned themselves in; whereas a successful fugitive task force sweep carried out there just days later, resulted in the arrest of 65 wanted individuals.
   Domenici serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Justice Department programs that benefit local law enforcement.
