SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS ENACTMENT OF SEVEN-YEAR INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici applauded the enactment of a new law to prohibit taxes on most forms of Internet access through 2014, a seven-year extension of a federal tax ban first put in place in 1998.  
   President Bush on Wednesday signed into law the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 (HR.3678). The law extends the internet tax moratorium, which would have expired Thursday, through 2014. Domenici supported Senate passage of HR.3678 last week. 
   "The Internet is a great benefit to New Mexicans--at work, at school and at home. It is important for so many in our state who live in rural, remote areas," Domenici said. 
   "I am glad we have a new seven-year moratorium on taxing Internet access. We should not make it more difficult for people to use the Internet by allowing state and local governments to tax access to it. The bottom line is that taxpayers must already comply with a complex tax system, and allowing such taxes would only inhibit Internet use and further complicate the tax code," said the former Senate Budget Committee chairman. 
   HR.3678 extends the moratorium on state taxation of internet access and electronic commerce. It includes grandfather provisions for states with previously enacted Internet tax laws, but also restricts certain states that claim an exemption from the moratorium under the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act of 2004 to impose internet access taxes after Nov. 1, 2007. 
   The new law also expands the definition of "Internet access" to include related communication services, such as e-mails and instant messaging. Additionally, it also refines the definition of "telecommunications" to include unregulated non-utility telecommunications, or for example cable service.
