SEN. DOMENICI: AGREEMENT ON NAVAJO WATER SETTLEMENT OPENS DIFFICULT NEXT STEPS FOR APPROVAL, FUNDING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the signing by the state of New Mexico and the Navajo Nation to a long-awaited water settlement agreement.  
   Domenici, as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, will play a role in the legislation to authorize the Navajo Water Settlement pact signed today by Governor Bill Richardson, Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley and the attorneys general for the state and Indian tribe. 
   "I commend all the parties for reaching this point in the arduous path toward reaching a settlement. This is a step forward. But significant hurdles remain, the most prominent of which is the issue of cost. 
   "The harsh truth is that legislation authorizing the Navajo settlement will be very difficult to fund given the huge budget deficits confronting the nation. I will continue to work with all parties to see what price tag the federal government can bear. I will work with the Interior Department and OMB in the months and years ahead to reach that point. 
   "Finally, I will fully support exhaustive hearings on this settlement when all parties, including the federal government, have signed and we have a formal, legal agreement before the Congress. The final settlement will require greater administration participation, and may require further compromise from all parties."
