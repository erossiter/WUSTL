SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES NEW FEDERAL GRANT FOR LAS CLINICAS HEALTH CENTER NETWORK
  Las Clinicas del Norte Inc., has been approved for another $409,570 in federal funding to support community health care centers in El Rito, Abiquiu and Ojo Caliente, according to Sen.  
 Pete Domenici. 
   Domenici reports that Las Clinicas del Norte, based in El Rito, will receive the funding through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "health center clusters" grant program. The supplemental funding will support health services provided by the three-center network through June 2005. 
   "For people in rural areas of New Mexico, a community health care center is their first and most readily available option for accessing health care. These federal funds are intended to ensure that Las Clinicas can continue to treat people in rural Rio Arriba and Taos County," Domenici said. 
   Last week, Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that Las Clinicas del Norte was receiving $388,670 to carry out health care services to the underserved and uninsured in northern New Mexico. 
   The Las Clinicas centers offer primary medical, dental, and mental health services, including medical outreach and preventive, urgent, and emergency care.
