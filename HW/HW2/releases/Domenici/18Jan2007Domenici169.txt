SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY RECEIVES FUNDS FOR ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the National Science Foundation has awarded $820,000 to New Mexico State University to continue studying the ecology of the Chihuahuan Desert.  
   The grant is part of continued funding of the program and is expected to result in a cumulative amount of $4.9 million. Funds will be used to improve on the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research program (JRN). The project, established in 1982, utilizes Chihuahuan Desert areas to better understand arid and semi-arid parts of the world. 
   "The JRN program at NMSU is recognized by the National Science Foundation as a leader in developing a greater understanding of global ecological systems," said Domenici. "I hope that these funds from the NSF help the project continue and flourish." 
   The JRN has included students in both undergraduate and graduate programs at NMSU and carries out research in collaboration with various international scientific institutions. 
   Domenici plans to reintroduce the Jornada Experimental Range Transfer Act during this session of Congress. The legislation, which Domenici authored in 2005, was passed by the Senate before but was not acted on by the House of Representatives. It would allot up to 1,000 acres of the Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service, which is one of NMSU's research partners, to the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park north of Las Cruces. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and sits on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, which determines funding for programs of the National Science Foundation.
