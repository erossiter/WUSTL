SEN. DOMENICI JOINS SENATE RECYCLING CAUCUS
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today repeated that he has joined a bipartisan effort to promote recycling education, advocate for recycling legislation, and correct obstacles that currently exist for recyclers. 
   Domenici joined the Senate Recycling Caucus, lead by Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), to increase awareness to the differences between waste and recyclable materials, the relationship between curbside collection and commercial recycling, and the nature and operations of the recycling industry.
   "I joined the recycling caucus because I believe that the visibility of recycling should be increased as yet another way we can save our precious natural resources. Through education and legislation, we can successfully increase recycling initiatives throughout the nation by setting a good example in our congressional offices," said Domenici, whose Washington and Las Cruces offices participates in a recycling program.
   The caucus was established with the help of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) to raise awareness of the environmental and economic benefits of recycling and to understand the complex issues that affect the recycling industry.
   Domenici last week met with Jim and Mary Bly, of Artesia, who are members of the ISRI.
   "Recycling is also an over-looked asset to our economy. I am aware of the positive trade aspects and the creation of jobs that recycling provides in our country. Recycled products are worth $30 billion a year, and it is important that this aspect of the manufacturing industry is recognized," Domenici added.
   Members of the House Recycling Caucus include Rep. Paul Gillmor (R-Ohio) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.).
