SEN. DOMENICI URGES N.M. HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW 'PROJECT LIFELINE' AID
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today encouraged eligible New Mexicans to take advantage of a new housing assistance program, unveiled Tuesday by the federal government and several mortgage lenders, to help alleviate the threat of foreclosure facing some homeowners.  
   Project Lifeline will provide eligible homeowners with a reevaluation and modification of their housing and mortgage situation to help them remain in their homes. Upon receiving a letter, qualified individuals must contact their lender directly to request assistance. 
   "Many homeowners have been adversely affected by our present economic situation, making it difficult for them to maintain payment on their homes," said Domenici. "This program is in the best interest of many homeowners who have faced difficulty in maintaining their financial obligations to their lenders. I encourage everyone who thinks they may qualify to contact their lender to see if they qualify." 
   In order to be considered for a loan modification, homeowners who receive a Project Lifeline notification must do the following: 
   * Call their servicer within 10 days of receiving a notice. 
   * Notify the servicer that they have received the letter, they want to stay in the home and they are willing to seek counseling, if necessary. 
   * Provide updated financial information so the servicer can explore the appropriate solution. 
   * Homeowners already in the foreclosure process will have the process "paused" for up to 30 days while they are evaluated for a loan modification. 
   Six leading servicers-Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Countrywide, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo-representing approximately 50 percent of the mortgage servicing market are expected to begin mailing letters shortly to seriously delinquent homeowners explaining the steps they must take to receive the assistance. 
   For more information on Project Lifeline, call (888) 995-HOPE.
