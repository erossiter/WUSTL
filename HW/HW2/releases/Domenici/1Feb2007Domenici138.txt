SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES ESPA?OLA WASTEWATER UPGRADE GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $1.1 million to the city of Espa?ola to expand and upgrade its wastewater treatment facility.  
   Domenici secured funds as part of FY2005 appropriations process. It was awarded under EPA's State and Tribal and the Assistance Grant (STAG) Program. The funding will allow Espa?ola to reduce the ammonia level it discharges into the Rio Grande and increase its treatment capacity. Changing this facility will help protect the health and safety of local water bodies as well as provide safe drinking water to the communities. 
   "One of New Mexico's most precious assets is its water which is very limited," said Domenici "This funding is intended to ensure our water is used wisely. It is important that our treatment facilities are kept up to par to best serve New Mexico residents." 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for funding EPA programs and has worked for years to help the Espa?ola region implement more modern wastewater services.
