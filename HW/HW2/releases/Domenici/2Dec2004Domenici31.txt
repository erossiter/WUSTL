SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES ALLOCATION FOR RESEARCH AT KIRTLAND AFB
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that research will be contracted at Kirtland Air Force Base to investigate the uses of high-powered microwaves in security communications networks at home and abroad.  
   The Air Force awarded $160,000 to the California-based Science Application International Corporation to conduct the work at Kirtland Air Force Base. The award, through Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research, is worth $49 million. The total contract can be delegated to various research projects involving HPMs and other directed energy systems within a span of five years. 
   "This is another example of the importance of our bases and the versatility of their missions. Kirtland continues to do its part to make America and the world safer," Domenici said. "It is so important for New Mexico to continue to receive important research projects such as this one. These projects create economic growth through new inventions and new jobs, and they create products that can be incredibly helpful to Americans, and the United States as a whole." 
   The funds will be used to research and develop new technologies relating to High Power Microwave (HPM) systems. The goal of the research is to use HPMs to disrupt communication systems of U.S. opponents and, in turn, recognize how to protect domestic systems against such sabotage.
