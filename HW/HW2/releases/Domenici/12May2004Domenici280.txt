CAVERNS VISITOR CENTER REMODEL GETS FINAL OKAY
  Sen. Pete Domenici, as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today reported that the Senate and House Appropriations committees have given final approval to a plan to give the visitor center at the Carlsbad Caverns National Park a $7.29 million makeover.  
   Last week, Domenici, a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, gave his approval to a National Park Service (NPS) plan to rehabilitate the visitor center as a NPS Recreation Fee Demonstration project. 
   "I wholeheartedly support this project, and I'm pleased to see a good chunk of Park Service fees be put to work in New Mexico. The end result will be a better visitor center for Carlsbad Caverns. The current facility is getting up there in years, and needs a makeover to make it more welcoming for visitors and staff. Park Service fees will be put to good use," Domenici said. 
   To employ the recreation fee and National Park Pass revenues for the project, the House and Senate appropriations committees must give their concurrence. Final approval from the House was granted this week. Domenici's approval was important to allowing the NSP to direct the revenues to Carlsbad Caverns project. 
   Work on the 47-year old facility will entail improving the structural integrity of the center, including new heating and cooling systems, "green energy" lighting and displays, passive solar, upgraded alarms and fire systems, and increased accessibility for park visitors and staff. The restoration will make it the center more complaint with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   The project will also entail the rehabilitation of aged electrical, plumbing and elevator machine rooms. The project is expected to be completed in FY2005.
