SEN. DOMENICI REPORTS FIRES SAFETY GRANT FOR MORA FIRE CHIEF'S ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $34,200 grant to allow the Mora Fire Chief's Association to increase fire safety awareness among children and the elderly.  
   The grant was awarded through the DHS Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. 
   The Fire Prevention and Safety Grant will be used to purchase a mobile fire safety house to teach fire awareness and prevention. The mobile house will be furnished like an ordinary home and will be equipped with smoke machines, smoke detectors, working telephones and heated doors and doorknobs. 
   "The fire safety education that this grant will provide is invaluable. Young children especially need to learn exactly what to do in fire emergencies," said Domenici, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Mora County fire fighters will take the fire house to different elementary schools and nursing homes to demonstrate how to exit a smoke filled home, how to safely check doors for heat and point out fire hazards that may exist in homes.
