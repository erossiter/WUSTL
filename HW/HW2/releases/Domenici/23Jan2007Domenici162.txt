SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DO?A ANA COUNTY LAND USE PLAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici, ranking Republican of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement regarding efforts in Do?a Ana County to reach consensus on a wilderness land use plan:  
   "There is definitely no deadline to submit a proposal to me and Senator Bingaman. The 110th Congress just recently started its two-year session, which means that we have plenty of time to draft legislation and seek its approval. I urge the members of the land use group to continue working to find reasonable consensus on these important land management issues. 
   "I appreciate the discussions that have been held so far regarding a land use plan for Do?a Ana County. While I recognize that not everyone can be in total agreement, it is important that the local community reach a workable solution on the type of plan that they would like to see enacted."
