SEN. DOMENICI, REP. PEARCE ANNOUNCE $7.8 MILLION USDA LOAN TO EXPAND ROOSEVELT COUNTY ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE SERVICE
  Sen. Pete Domenici and Rep. Steve Pearce today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a $7.8 million loan to Roosevelt County Electric Cooperative, Inc. (RCEC) to provide electric services to 647 new consumers in southeast New Mexico. 
   The loan, approved through the Rural Development program, will be used to build 75 miles of new distribution lines and make other system improvements. The loan will be used to provide electric service improvements in rural areas of Chaves, De Baca, Curry and Roosevelt counties.
   "Rural communities in southeast New Mexico will benefit from this USDA loan. I am pleased to see the amount of money is substantial and can be utilized to help a large number of residents," Domenici said.
   "We cherish the rural character of Southeastern New Mexico," Pearce said. "But that blessing also means fighting hard for the resources we need to create jobs, opportunity, and a good quality of life for our people. This substantial loan brings us closer to meeting that challenge."
   The RCEC serves 5,805 consumers including 3,479 residential, 1,387 irrigation, 546 commercial and 344 oil well services. They provide numerous services to its consumers such as rebates and loans and also is active in awarding scholarships and youth tour programs.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that designates the funding levels for the USDA and Rural Development program.
   The term of the loan will be provided for 35 years at a variable interest rate not to exceed seven percent.
