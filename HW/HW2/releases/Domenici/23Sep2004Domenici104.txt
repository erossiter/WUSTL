SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS AWARD OF $1.47 MILLION FOR NEW PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTER IN CARLSBAD
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Carlsbad residents will have better access to medical services because of funds awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to Presbyterian Medical Services.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the $1,476,239 grant was issued through the Bureau of Primary Health Care, a division of HHS, to enable Presbyterian Medical Services to build a new primary care facility. 
   The funds were obtained last year by Domenici and Congressman Steve Pearce through the FY2004 Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. (Domenici secured $1.15 million of the grant and Congressman Steve Pearce added another $350,000 for the project.) 
   "Primary care facilities are crucial to meeting the medical needs of New Mexicans. These centers are smaller than general hospitals, but because of multiple locations, are able to serve many more residents," Domenici said. "The facility in Carlsbad will be accessible to residents who would otherwise find it difficult, if not impossible, to be treated because of the cost of travel or the time needed to get to a larger provider." 
   The new facility will be constructed in southwest Carlsbad to be more accessible to the surrounding low-income families. Presbyterian Medical Services expects to break ground in November on the new center and plans to complete the project by spring of 2005. 
   The funds from this grant are to be used solely for the construction of the facility. Presbyterian Medical Services has already secured funds for the medical equipment and furnishings needed for the center through the Bureau of Primary Health Care. This facility will be the 31st primary care center in New Mexico.
