SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS RESOLUTION HONORING 'NATIONAL DAY OF THE COWBOY'
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that he is supporting a resolution recognizing the "National Day of the American Cowboy."  
   Domenici joined a bipartisan group of Senators to cosponsor a resolution introduced by Senator Craig Thomas (R.-Wyo.) that would recognize July 28, 2007 as "National Day of the American Cowboy." The measure encourages individuals to mark the day with appropriate ceremonies and celebrations. 
   "New Mexico has a history that is steeped in traditions of the 'Old West.' To this day, New Mexicans regularly take part in activities that pay homage to the legacy that America's early cowboys and vaqueros left us," said Domenici. "It is only fitting that I support this measure. I hope that New Mexicans will take the opportunity to enjoy the day and the history it represents." 
   The resolution notes the cowboy men and women who contributed to the settlement of the West for their display of "?honesty, integrity, courage, compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism?" It continues, "?to recognize the American cowboy is to acknowledge the ongoing commitment of the United States to an esteemed and enduring code of conduct?" 
   New Mexico hosts a diverse array of activities, many of which relate to the state's history of cowboys and the Old West. Located in Hobbs, the Western Heritage Museum and Lea County Cowboy Hall of Fame opened last year and presents information on settlers and events in as it relates to the state's early years.
