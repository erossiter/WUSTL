SEN. DOMENICI: ALBUQUERQUE SMALL BUSINESS GETS $6.6 MILLION DEFENSE FUEL CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Defense Energy Support Center has awarded a $6.6 million contract to Cutter Aviation in Albuquerque.  
   Under the contract, Cutter Aviation will provide jet fuel for all branches of the military, as well as other government agencies. 
   "New Mexico has a strong connection with military operations. Cutter Aviation is especially well-placed, due to its location, to provide services for defense oriented activities," said Domenici. "These funds will allow Cutter to continue to provide an essential service for the U.S. military and other federal agencies as they carry out their daily activities." 
   The contract is being awarded as a continuation of an existing contract held by Cutter Aviation. Such contracts are periodically re-open for bidding. 
   Cutter Aviation was founded in 1928 and provides aviation services at eight locations, including Albuquerque, Deer Valley in Arizona, Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Dallas, El Paso, San Antonio, and McKinney, Texas. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which is responsible for determining funding for federal programs, including those carried out by the Department of Defense.
