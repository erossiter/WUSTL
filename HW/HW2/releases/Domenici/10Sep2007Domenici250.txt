   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says he and Senator Byron Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, are pushing to have the FY2008 Energy and Water Bill considered by the Senate as soon as possible. He says the dramatic funding differences between the House and Senate bills are the most divergent he has ever experienced. 
   02:51 - Domenici says the preliminary layoff projections at Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories should be taken seriously since it will be difficult to close the funding chasm between the House and Senate bills to fund the labs in FY2008. 
   04:10 - Domenici says it is important that Senate and House negotiators get to meet as soon as possible to try to begin resolving the DOE and lab funding discrepancies. 
   06:24 - Domenici relays to lab employees that he will "hunker down," do his best and fight to resolve the funding cuts facing the nuclear weapons complex under the House bill. 
   08:14 - Domenici predicts that farmers qualifying for U.S. Department of Agriculture disaster loan assistance will be less than enthused with this aid. He says few appreciate USDA disaster loans when they are already experiencing economic hardships. 
   09:33 - Domenici says he is optimistic that the final FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill will retain the $10 million in the bill to support the Air Force Special Operations Command takeover of Cannon Air Force Base. He notes that he continues to look for opportunities to find new funding to support the AFSOC mission at Cannon. 
   11:58 - Domenici discusses the probable need for DOE and its laboratories to be funding through a continuing resolution (CR) after the Oct. 1 start of the federal fiscal year. He says the CR could require funding be maintained at FY2008 levels, but says this situation "won't be great any way we look at it." 
   14:11 - Domenici says he continues to press the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee to address the needs of New Mexico peanut farmers as it works to develop the 2007 Farm Bill.
