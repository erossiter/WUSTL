SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BILL TERMINATING UC-LANL CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding legislation introduced by Sen.  
 Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) that would terminate the University of California contract with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
   "I certainly understand why Senator Allard is so frustrated. New Mexicans should know that Senator Allard is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which has responsibility for the National Nuclear Security Administration. He is well informed on these issues. 
   "On the other hand, a competition is underway to select a new operator for the laboratory and it is absolutely inappropriate to legislate who that new operator may or may not be. A process is in place to select the best qualified contractor, and that process must be allowed to proceed." 
   The Allard bill (S.2746) would require the Department of Energy to terminate the UC contract to operate LANL by March 15, 2005, and require the Secretary of Energy to appoint an interim manager to run the lab until a new contractor could be formally selected in the fall of 2005.
