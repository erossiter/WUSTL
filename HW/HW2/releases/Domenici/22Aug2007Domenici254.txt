SEN. DOMENICI TOURS LAS CRUCES DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today took a spin down the streets of downtown Las Cruces in a convertible with city officials to take an up close look at efforts to renew the historic part of town.  
   Domenici joined Las Cruces Mayor Bill Mattiace, City Manager Terrence Moore, City Councilor Jose Frietze to tour the Las Cruces Downtown Revitalization Project. Following the driving tour, former executive director of the Las Cruces Downtown organization joined the officials at the farmers' market area, where Domenici delivered remarks and mingled with vendors and shoppers. 
   "In my recent visits to Las Cruces, I have witnessed the tremendous growth the area is experiencing. The revitalization project will help downtown Las Cruces keep up with this growth, and once again become a thriving center of culture and commerce," said Domenici. 
   "I appreciate and applaud the years of hard work that have gone into this project. The residents of Las Cruces will enjoy this gathering place for family and community activities for years to come," Domenici said. 
   Domenici, who is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has supported the Las Cruces Downtown Revitalization Project through the appropriations process. The Senator secured $2 million in the FY 2008 Transportation-HUD Appropriations Bill to help fund the renewal efforts. The funding will be provided through the Federal Highway Administration and will allow the City of Las Cruces to renovate the Main Street roadway corridor, construct pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, and aesthetically enhance the streetscape. 
   In 2003, Domenci secured $900,000 in Department of Housing and Urban Development funding to renovate the Rio Grande Theater on Main Street.
