SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FAA GRANT FOR CLOVIS AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today the Department of Transportation's (DOT) plans to release $80,000 to the city of Clovis to upgrade its approach system at the Clovis Municipal Airport. 
   The funds, which will be awarded through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are expected to support a "runway end survey" to assess current obstructions related to a new Wide Area Augmentation (WAAS) Lateral Precision Vertical (LPV) guidance approach system at the municipal airport.
   "I expect these funds to help Clovis Municipal as it takes steps to upgrade its approach system consistent with current technology. As the economy in the area grows, the city airport will get more use, too. This new technology can work to ensure safe operations," said Domenici. "I am pleased the Department of Transportation will provide funding to support the project's early stages."
   The new approach is expected to provide vertical guidance to a particular runway end, thus making the airport more accessible to pilots.
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and serves on the subcommittee that determines federal funding for the DOT and the FAA.
