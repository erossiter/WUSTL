SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA OFFERS $325,542 IN DISASTER MITIGATION FUNDS TO NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici, who serves on Homeland Security authorizing and funding committees, today welcomed news that federal funding is being made available to New Mexico to undertake preventive measures to improve disaster responses during emergencies.  
   FEMA is offering $325,542 in Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Program grant funding to support safety projects proposed by the University of New Mexico, New Mexico Tech, and Otero, Lincoln, and Sierra counties. The funding meets the 75 percent federal match for these projects, which are authorized under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. 
   "Taking preventative actions can help lessen the impact of an emergency or disaster. These projects will work to ensure that should a natural or other disaster occur, there will have already been actions taken to mitigate its harm to people and property," Domenici said. 
   The federal PDM awards to New Mexico, selected from among 470 applications nationwide, will support cost-effective mitigation projects. The awards to UNM and New Mexico Tech, for example, would support efforts to implement plans to mitigate potential disasters that could affect their specific campuses. 
   PDM funding, provided on a 75-25, federal/nonfederal matching basis, includes: 
   * UNM Multihazard Mitigation Plan - $ 185,158 
  * New Mexico Tech Hazard Mitigation Plan - $66,384 
  * Otero County Hazardous Mitigation Plan - $30,000 
  * Lincoln County Multihazardous Mitigation Plan - $29,000 
  * Sierra County Mitigation Plan - $15,000 
   FEMA is under the administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that approved $100 million for the PDM grant program in FY2007.
