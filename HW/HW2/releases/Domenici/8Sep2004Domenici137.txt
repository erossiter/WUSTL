SEN. DOMENICI: DORA, CORRALES AWARDED FIRE FIGHTING GRANT FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Dora Fire Department was awarded a grant by the Department of Homeland Security to promote firefighter safety.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), announced that the Dora Fire Department will receive $25,200 to purchase exercise equipment for the local station. 
   "It is important for our firefighters to be ready to address any emergency. Whether it is wildfires, structure fires or other situations that require immediate attention, we must make sure that our firefighters are prepared for anything," Domenici said. 
   The funding is a one-year award through the FY2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program, (AFGP) which is administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the USFA. 
   "In the past, it has been physical ailments such as heart attacks or respiratory problems that have endangered firefighters on the job. I am pleased that the Dora Fire Department chose to use these funds to address the health issues that so often arise among firefighters." 
   With these funds, Dora will be able to purchase several pieces of exercise equipment to stress physical fitness among firefighters at the station. 
   Domenici also reported that the Corrales Volunteer Fire Department was also awarded $28,503 to purchase new extraction equipment, such as the "jaws of life" to help firefighters during rescue operations. 
   The AFGP awarded these grants after Congress appropriated and President Bush signed into law $750 million in federal funds for firefighters throughout the nation.
