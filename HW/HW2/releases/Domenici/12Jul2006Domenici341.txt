DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AWARDS GRANT TO NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY TO SUPPORT SCIENCE PROGRAMS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has awarded 32 grants totaling over $9.5 million to minority institutions around the nation including New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. 
   The DoD awarded these grants as part of the Historically Black Colleges and University and Minority Institutions Support Program. The program was developed to enhance programs and capabilities in scientific discipline critical to national security and the DoD.
   "Scientific initiatives undertaken at our local universities are important aspects of defense research. NMSU being chosen by the DoD to conduct its research initiatives is a very good indication of the educational quality that the school is providing," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
   NMSU will use the award to fund two research initiatives including Distributed Source Coding Using Bitstream - Based Detection and Classification and Development of Scaled Hummingbird Models for Studying the Dynamics of Hovering and Low Speed Forward Flight.
   The DoD awarded 21 research grants ranging from $211,000 to $500,000 with performance periods of 12 and 36 months.
   The grants are distributed through the Army Research Office and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.
