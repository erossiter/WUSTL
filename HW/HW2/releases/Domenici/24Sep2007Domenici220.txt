SENATE SENDS BUSH NATIONAL WATER BILL INCLUDING SEN. DOMENICI PROJECTS FOR BOSQUE, SOUTH VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today joined the full Senate in giving final passage to a national water resources bill that contains authorization for $65.6 million to continue projects he championed to continue bosque restoration on the middle Rio Grande and flood control work in the Albuquerque area.  
   By a vote of 81-12, the Senate completed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and will now send it to President Bush. The administration has indicated it may veto the WRDA bill, which is intended to authorize appropriations for water resource projects and studies for the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. The House easily passed the measure by a vote of 381-40 in August. Domenici said it is likely that each house will have the two-thirds vote necessary to override a Presidential veto. 
   Domenici included provisions in the bill authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to continue its participation on Middle Rio Grande bosque restoration, South Valley flood control projects and overall Rio Grande environmental restoration work. 
   "This bill has been in development for years and the authorizations it contains will be critical to maintaining Army Corps involvement in the middle Rio Grande. I hope the President will give this bill its due consideration," said Domenici. "The New Mexico projects in this bill will help us provide the federal funds we need to make our bosque healthier and improve public safety and health by controlling flooding threats." 
   The final bill (HR.1495/S.1248) includes these three Domenici projects: 
   * The Middle Rio Grande Restoration Project authorizes the Corps to increase its work to remove jetty jacks, replace invasive species like salt cedar with native vegetation such as cottonwoods, and create paths, viewing areas and other educational and recreational opportunities throughout the Middle Rio Grande. This project is associated with Domenici's initiative to create a park-like bosque greenbelt through metropolitan Albuquerque. Domenici has requested that the federal government pay for all improvements on federally-owned lands. ($25 million authorization) 
   * The Southwest Valley Albuquerque New Mexico Flood Damage Reduction Project authorizes the Corps to construct detention basins and a pumping station in Albuquerque's North and South Valley. This is a continuation of a program supported and funded by Domenici since the mid-1990s. The Corps has worked with Bernalillo County and the city of Albuquerque on these projects. ($16.15 million federal authorization, $8.69 million nonfederal share) 
   * The Rio Grande Environmental Management Program for New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas authorizes the Corps to address environmental restoration and management on the Rio Grande and its tributaries through planning, construction, and evaluation of habitat rehabilitation and enhancement. This program also calls for long term river data acquisition coupled with an adaptive management program. ($15 million authorization.) 
   Domenici is ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that provides funding for WRDA-authorized projects. Within the Senate's FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, Domenici included $10.0 million for WRDA Section 595 projects like the North and South Valley flood control works, and $4.0 million for Rio Grande bosque restoration.
