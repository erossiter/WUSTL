SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DEFENSE RESEARCH GRANTS FOR UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, VALENCIA, ALBUQUERQUE CAMPUSES
  Senator Pete Domenici today announced that the University of New Mexico campuses in Valencia County and Albuquerque will be awarded four Department of Defense grants to support the purchase of research instruments. 
   While amounts have not yet been specified by DoD, the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) grant awards average $235,000 each, but can range from $50,000 to $1.0 million.
   In all, DoD will distribute $49.3 million for 210 DURIP grants at 98 college campuses. Two grant awards are going to UNM-Valencia, while another two have been chosen to support research at the main UNM campus in Albuquerque.
   "These competitive grants are intended to allow college campuses to attain the research equipment they need to offer advanced education in cutting-edge areas that could one day advance our national security goals," Domenici said. "I'm proud that the UNM campus in Valencia County applied for, and won, these grants."
   The DURIP grant program is carried out by the Army Research Office (ARO), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). In general, grants are going to advance such technologies as remote sensing, propulsion, electronics and electro-optics, and advanced materials.
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said the DURIP grants will support these projects:
   * UNM-Valencia - Instrumentation for Research on Light Filaments Detection (ARO)
   * UNM-Valencia - Pulsed Infrared Spectrometer (ARO)
   * UNM-Albuquerque - Surface Plasma Imaging and Optical Spectroscopy in High-Power Microwave Sources (AFOSR)
   * UNM-Albuquerque - Equipment for Bit-Error Rate Monitor for Laser Communications (AFOSR)
