SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES VA GRANT TO GALLUP'S CARE 66 TO HELP HOMELESS VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has awarded a $311,039 grant to CARE 66 in Gallup to assist homeless veterans.  
   The grant was awarded as part of over $16 million in funding to combat homelessness among veterans nationwide. CARE 66 is a non-profit organization that provides housing, work placement, and self-sufficiency services in the Gallup area (http://www.care66.org). 
   "CARE 66 is a valuable source of housing and support for veterans and others in need in the Gallup community," said Domenici. "Funds from the VA will help the organization as it expands to provide help and hope for those who once served our nation and now need help." 
   According to the VA, this latest round of grants is expected to create 950 beds for homeless veterans nationwide by utilizing public and community non-profit and faith-based organizations. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal agencies and programs, including those administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Earlier this year, Domenici lent his support to the FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill, which contains $43 billion in discretionary spending for the VA, $37.2 billion for veteran's health care, and $29 billion to for improved access to veteran medical services. 
   In September, CARE 66 also received $299,125 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to assist its housing, and work placement services.
