SEN. DOMENICI BACKS BILL TO EXTEND ADOPTION TAX CREDITS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced his support for a measure that would ensure that tax credits for those who adopt children become a permanent part of the federal tax code.  
   The tax credit, passed in 2001, will expire in 2010. Domenici is a co-sponsor of S.246, legislation introduced by Senator Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) that would make the adoption tax credit permanent. 
   "As a father of eight, there is nothing more important to me than family. I applaud those who adopt children and give them a happy and safe environment to grow up in. With President Bush's leadership, Congress passed this worthwhile tax credit to encourage families to adopt in 2001. There should be no reason why it would expire, and if this bill passes, it won't," said Domenici. 
   Last year, Domenici nominated Michelle Madrid-Branch of Santa Fe for a Congressional Angels in Adoption Award. Domenici nominated Madrid-Branch for the award after learning of her efforts in adoption awareness as founder of Adoption Tribe Publishing and the Adoption Means Love Foundation. 
   In FY2004, the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department placed 236 children in adoptive homes. Those parents who accept the children receive tax credits under current law.
