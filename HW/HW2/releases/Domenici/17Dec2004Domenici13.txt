SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD
  In light of recent comments regarding Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's job performance, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici, a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, issued the following statement: 
   "Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld has done a good job under very difficult circumstances. I have known him for decades and believe that he is an intensely dedicated, hard-working, and able public servant. 
   "I believe that all of us must be concerned about the steadiness of American leadership as we near the January Iraq elections. Even after those elections, we must have stability as we face what I believe will be a furious reaction by insurgent forces. 
   "In every war, serious difficulties in equipment and logistics emerge. I recall reading recently about the virtual chaos surrounding the American landing in Europe on D-Day more than 60 years ago. I am sure that a detailed accounting of equipment failures and logistical disasters during that invasion would remind modern-day reporters and politicians of the challenges that surround most major military actions, no matter how well-planned those actions were. 
   "I believe that Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush have made it clear that the remaining transportation vehicles in need of additional armored protection will be provided with it as soon as humanly possible, and I applaud their action. 
   "Finally, I find it impossible to believe that Secretary Rumsfeld would have neglected this problem had he been personally aware of its nature and extent."
