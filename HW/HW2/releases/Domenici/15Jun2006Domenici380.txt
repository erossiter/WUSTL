SEN. DOMENICI: ALBUQUERQUE BUSINESS GETS HHS GRANT TO RESEARCH NEW BLOOD ALCOHOL DETECTION DEVICE
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that TruTouch Technologies, Inc. in Albuquerque has been awarded $218,000 as a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to assist in blood alcohol measurement research. 
   The research will focus on an optical based technique as a way to measure the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream. The measurement will occur through the skin and replace breath, blood or urine testing and could be used by law enforcement and treatment centers.
   "The TruTouch research has the potential to develop a method of blood alcohol testing that will dramatically increase the health safety of law enforcement and treatment center employees. The intention of SBIR grants is to assist small businesses to commercialize good ideas and this is a very good example of that," Domenici said.
   "The DWI problem in New Mexico remains a serious problem and new technologies like this can be used to help make our roads safer," Domenici added.
   The project, entitled Advances in Noninvasive, Fluid-less Alcohol Measurements, was awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services.
