SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS EFFORT TO SUPPORT SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOR SAN JUAN YOUTH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that San Juan County Partnership Inc. will receive an award of $100,000 from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to counter substance abuse among youth in the Farmington area.  
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for DOJ programs, including the Continuation Drug-Free Communities Support program that helps deter youth from drug use. 
   "I'm pleased the DOJ awarded these funds in response to a continuing need for stronger anti-drug coalitions in San Juan County," Domenici said. "It is not enough to try to help them once the damage is done. This program targets preventative measures to help youth make good choices to avoid substance problems." 
   SJCP, which serves San Juan County and the surrounding areas, aims to reduce substance abuse among youth and adults by decreasing risk factors and strengthening collaboration among federal, state, local, and tribal governments. 
   SJCP will implement a number of strategies to support anti-drug efforts. These strategies include: increased support for research-based substance abuse prevention programming; increased sponsorship of mentoring programs designed to encourage healthy relationships between adults and at-risk youth; increased involvement of the faith community in prevention efforts; increased targeted awareness efforts and information events structured to more accurately convey the harmful effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; and to strengthen coalition building through membership development and increased opportunities for collaboration. 
   Last week, Domenici announced that Southern New Mexico Human Development Inc., which serves Luna and Do?a Ana counties, received $75,000 through this program. The city of Las Vegas also received $46,484 from the DOJ.
