SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FEMA COMMUNITY AID FOR 23 COUNTIES
  Sen. Pete V. Domenici announced today that 23 New Mexico counties have been awarded $942,040 in funds from FEMA to assist homeless and disadvantaged members of their communities. 
   The grants were awarded under FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program for FY2007 and were part of over $151 million in national funding. Funds will help provide food, shelter, rent, mortgage, and utility assistance for individuals with non-disaster related emergencies. Each county will receive the money where local boards will be responsible for distributing the funds according to the needs of their respective communities.
   "Although they have not suffered disasters to warrant typical FEMA assistance, there are individuals throughout the state who need a little extra help getting back on their feet," said Domenici. "I am glad to see this money awarded, especially during the holiday season, and hope that in the year ahead it will help provide for the needs of many New Mexicans."
   The following New Mexico counties received funding: Bernalillo ($290,981), Chaves ($30,418), Cibola ($13,10), Colfax ($7,427), Curry ($18,805), Do?a Ana ($97,115), Eddy ($23,055), Grant ($14,318), Lea ($21,917), Lincoln ($9,789), Luna ($32,071), McKinley ($40,057), Otero ($28,422), Rio Arriba ($26,855), Roosevelt ($7,642), Sandoval ($48,965), San Juan ($58,926), San Miguel ($17,023), Santa Fe ($63,241), Socorro ($8,844), Taos ($23,721), Torrance ($8,029), and Valencia ($33,252).
   In addition to these counties, the New Mexico state committee also received $17,557 in EFS funds.
   The EFS program was commissioned by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and is overseen by a national board composed of FEMA and representatives from charities including the American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, and The Salvation Army. Over the past 24 years, the program has distributed more than $2.952 billion to America's local communities.
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for determining funding for federal programs, including those administered by FEMA. For more information, visit http://www.efsp.unitedway.org.
