SEN. DOMENICI HIGHLIGHTS FIREFIGHTER GRANT DEADLINE AS N.M. FIREFIGHTERS VISIT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today met with members of the New Mexico Professional Firefighters Association who were taking part in the International Association of Firefighters' "Alfred K. Whitehead Legislative Conference" in Washington. 
   The New Mexico delegates included John A. Davis of Farmington, David Jenkins of Santa Fe, Emily Kane of Albuquerque and Kenneth McFaul of Deming. The annual conference is designed to allow participants to visit Capitol Hill to share their views on federal policies relating to firefighting and public safety. Domenici serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that funds local public safety grants through the Department of Homeland Security.
   Domenici highlighted an April 4 deadline for local communities to apply for grants through the 2008 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. Congress provided $560 million for the AFG program this year. (www.firegrantsupport.com)
   Last year, New Mexico communities, including Deming, Lordsburg, Pinos Altos and Do?a Ana County, received money for their firefighting forces.
