SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA TO PROVIDE HELP TO FIGHT COST OF CASA FIRE IN NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Homeland Security will provide aid to offset the cost of containing the Casa Fire that has currently burned about 12,000 acres in Colfax County.  
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant assistance is provided by the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP) and allows for emergency assistance when a fire threatens such destruction that could constitute a major disaster. 
   "The assistance that FEMA is providing to Colfax County is greatly needed. We need all the help we can get in order to contain this potentially disastrous fire without breaking the bank so early in the wild fire season," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that funds FMAGP. 
   The Casa fire which has been described as extreme and severe has threatened approximately 900 homes near the communities of Cimarron, Miami and Springer. 
   The FEMA grant will cover 75 percent of the total cost of eligible fire fighting expenses.
