   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici says President Bush has signed a bill including an extended continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government through Dec. 14. He says there have only been cursory talks between the House and Senate on the FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill to fund Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories. He believes the FY2008 funding for the labs will not be resolved until after the Thanksgiving holiday. 
   02:25 Domenici says he believes layoffs at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories are only the beginning of staff reductions expected within the nation's nuclear weapons complex. He says he understands that an incentive package for possible retirees and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory has not been finalized. 
   03:58 Domenici says he hopes strong candidates are elected in 2008 to fill his Senate seat, as well as for all three open House seats. He says that while some may believe the New Mexico delegation may lose its "triple A" rating, he does not believe New Mexicans should be "worried sick" about having a delegation with little seniority. He says the political shakeup in New Mexico ought to please those who support term limits. 
   06:43 Domenici says the energy loan guarantees included in his Renewable Fuel Standard amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill have already been enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   09:00 Domenici says the fate of his Farm Bill amendment is initially up to the Senate Majority Leader, who can decide whether the amendment is debated and considered. He says the energy loan guarantees require some clarification to ensure that the loan guarantees for nuclear and other energy sources are not paid by taxpayers. He says the loan guarantees are expected to be self-funded. 
   11:42 Domenici says the days of picking on nuclear energy are finished, that more environmentalists understand that it is a clean source of energy that can help meet future U.S. and global energy needs without adding to global warming. 
   13:02 Domenici says he believes Congress can come up with an acceptable FY2008 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill that President Bush can sign. Bush vetoed the first FY08 Labor-HHS bill Tuesday. Domenici says he believes Congress must continue to support funding for the U.S. military in combat zones, while still advancing health care and education programs through the Labor-HHS bill. 
   14:27 Domenici says the derailed attempt in the House to consider articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney amounts to "pure politics. It's not going to happen." 
   16:24 Domenici says he suspects that the impeachment attempt was levied against the Vice President because he is viewed as being too powerful as a behind-the-scenes advisor to President Bush. Domenici says Congress has more important work to get done than to waste time considering impeachment charges, and says the President and Vice President will serve out their full term. 
   21:27 Domenici acknowledges everyone who has written or called to express concern about him, but stresses that he is ready to push on with his work. He says the prospects for a true nuclear energy renaissance would be a very good legacy to leave the nation.
