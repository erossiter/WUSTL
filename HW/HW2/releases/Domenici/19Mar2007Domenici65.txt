SEN. DOMENICI: FALL IN BUREAU FUNDS FOR N.M. WATER PROJECTS DUE TO UNFINISHED SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said New Mexico will lose almost $4.0 million in FY2007 funding for Bureau of Reclamation projects in the state, largely because of Congress' failure to finish funding bills last fall. 
   Domenici, now the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, on Monday received the Bureau of Reclamation funding levels for projects and activities in New Mexico for the remainder of FY2007. Overall, the Bureau's FY2007 budget amounts to $1.024 billion.  
   The Bureau was left to distribute funding without congressional direction due to the new congressional leadership decision to roll the FY2007 Energy and Water appropriations into a massive comprehensive bill without any specific project funding. 
   Under this scheme, the Bureau has eliminated funding for a variety of New Mexico projects funded in FY2006, including the Albuquerque Metro Area Water Reuse program, the Chimayo Water Project, and other projects. 
   "We are reaping what has been sown," Domenici said. "This is the unfortunate situation we face because of the failure to pass the Energy and Water Bill and instead roll it into a package that leaves it to Washington bureaucrats to decide where funding is needed." 
   "I am particularly disappointed that the Chimayo Water Project is not funded, especially when we've been looking for the Bureau to make progress on that very much needed project. The same goes for the Albuquerque water reuse program which has made progress on water conservation in the middle Rio Grande," he said. 
   "I will work with the Bureau to see that our state is fairly treated as the Bureau works within its major programs like Water 2025," he said. 
   The Bureau will fund the Middle Rio Grande Project at $27.6 million. This is a $456,000 cut from FY2006 and well below the $39.5 million Domenici included in the Senate's unfinished FY2007 appropriations bill. 
   The Bureau eliminated funding for the Chimayo Water Project to provide water to the Chimayo area. It is authorized under the Domenici-authored Chimayo Water Supply System Act of 2004. Domenici secured $1 million in FY2006 for construction of the system, which will complete the first phase of the project and provide water to approximately 150 homes. 
   The Bureau eliminates all funding for the Albuquerque Metro Water Reclamation and Reuse program, which was funded at $1.0 million in FY2006. Domenici was trying to secure $2.77 million for the project, in addition to $250,000 for a Rio Rancho water recycling program. 
   The Bureau is funding its Desalination and Water Purification Program at $2.025 million in FY2007, well below the $7.02 million outlined by the Senate to support projects like the Tularosa Basin Desalination Facility. 
   Another $8.5 million is provided for the Bureau Science and Technology program, but it is unsure how much of this funding will be directed toward New Mexico for such projects as efficient irrigation development. The Senate bill had sought $2.0 million in Bureau funding for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District to continue more efficient irrigation practices, and provides another $2.5 million for salt cedar eradication on the Rio Grande ($1.0 million), Pecos River ($1.0 million) and Canadian River ($500,000). 
   Finally, the Bureau will provide $475,000 to support the Bureau's Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Program.
