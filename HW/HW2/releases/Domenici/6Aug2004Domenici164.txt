SEN. DOMENICI CREDITS PARK SERVICE FOR PROGRESSON MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AT NATIONAL PARKS IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today welcomed the visit of a high-level Interior Department official to the Petroglyph National Monument in Albuquerque, a growing natural attraction in New Mexico for which the Bush Administration has requested $1.6 million to operate and maintain next year.  
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Interior Department. On Friday, Lynn Scarlett, Assistant Secretary of Interior for Policy, Management and Budget, visited the prehistoric petroglyphs in New Mexico to highlight the progress on maintenance issues in the state. 
   "I'm glad to see Assistant Secretary Scarlett in New Mexico. So many wonderful properties have been set aside as national parks and monuments, but Americans still sometimes overwhelm them by visiting in such large numbers," Domenici said. 
   "The Bush administration emphasis on pouring money into operations and maintenance of these areas has been remarkable. The need is great, but the administration has been focused on reducing a maintenance backlog as expeditiously as possible in difficult budgetary times," Domenici said, noting that National Park Service operations budgets have increased more than 20 percent higher than when the Bush administration began in 2001. 
   Scarlett reported that since 2001, over $21 million has been used to carry out more than 120 maintenance and improvement projects at New Mexico's 13 national park units. These attractions draw more than 1.8 million people annually. 
   Overall, the administration is seeking $2.4 billion for the National Park Service in FY2005, which is a net increase of $102 million above the 2004 level. Domenici pointed out if Congress meets the President's FY2005 budget requests, $1.8 billion would be available next year for operating National Park Service units nationwide. The Senate has yet to take up the FY2005 appropriations bill. 
   National Park units in New Mexico would be funded slightly higher in FY2005 than the current funding levels: Aztec Ruins National Monument * - $833,000; Bandelier * - $2.5 million; Capulin Volcano - $621,000; Carlsbad Caverns - $5.3 million; Chaco Culture Natural Historical Park* - $1.95 million; El Malpais * - $1.1 million; El Morro * - $569,000; Fort Union * - $687,000; Gila Cliff Dwellings - $218,000; Pecos National Historical Park - $1.3 million; Petroglyph - $1.6 million; Salinas Pueblo Missions * - $1.1 million; White Sands - $1.4 million; Santa Fe National Historic Trail - $603,000; Masau Trail $34,000; and, Route 66 National Historic Highway - $299,000. (* These park units will also receive funding through the Vanishing Treasures program funded at about $4.8 million in 2004.) 
   Domenici also noted that the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program is also being used to cut into the maintenance backlog at Park Service units. In May, the NPS and congressional appropriators approved $7.29 million in fee demonstration program funds to undertake a major renovation of the visitor center at the Carlsbad Caverns National Monument.
