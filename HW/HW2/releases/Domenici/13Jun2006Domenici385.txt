SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS MAJOR RURAL HEALTH CARE, MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today signed on to a major rural health care package that includes his provisions to improve Medicare and Medicaid payments to physicians who treat seniors in rural, under-served areas.
   Domenici is an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Rural Hospital and Provider Equity (R-HoPE) Act of 2006, which was introduced Tuesday by Senators Craig Thomas (R-Wyo), Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). All are members of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.
   The comprehensive measure is intended to extend expiring rural health provisions from the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), the prescription drug benefits law and to take further steps to shore up health care availability in rural states like New Mexico. 
   "The health care dynamic in New Mexico is tenuous because it is a large rural state and because of the socio-economic makeup of its population. We made progress with the Medicare Modernization Act to make it easier to attract and retain physicians and health care workers in rural states like ours, but more must be done," Domenici said.
   "This bipartisan wide-ranging and comprehensive bill will extend benefits we are already providing and address inequities that continue to make it harder, not easier, to provide health care to people in rural areas," he said.
   Including in the R-HoPE Act is an extension of provisions-included in the MMA that Domenici first authored and offered as legislation in February 2003-to put rural physicians more on par with urban doctors in terms of Medicare reimbursement levels. The R-HoPE Act would extend these Physician Fee Schedule Work Geographic Adjustment provisions through Jan. 1, 2009. They are set to expire at the end of this year.
   Medicare bases physician payments, in part, on geographic adjustment factors. The purpose of the geographic index is to reflect relative cost differences in a given area compared to the national average. Payments to physicians in rural areas are adjusted downward by this geographic index, thus lowering the reimbursements to rural caregivers.
   "Before the change enacted in 2004, Medicare was in effect devaluing rural physicians' skill time and effort just because they serve rural areas. We need to extend the law that treats them more fairly and not allow it to lapse and create yet another disincentive to work in rural states," Domenici said.
   Overall, the R-HoPE Act would extend benefits to New Mexico hospitals that serve a disproportionate share (DSH) of low-income Medicaid recipients and rural hospitals. The bill also includes provisions to benefit community health care centers, which play an important role in health care delivery for many low-income and rural New Mexicans.
   Earlier this year, Domenici joined with other Senate Rural Health Caucus members to outline FY2007 rural health care appropriations priorities, including expanding funding for the National Health Service Corps to decrease health care shortage areas and the telemedicine outreach effort.
   The following are highlights of provisions in the R-HoPE Act:
   * Equalize Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments - Removes a current 12 percent cap on the total amount of inpatient rural add-on payments to hospitals. This would put rural hospitals on par with urban hospitals that have unlimited add-ons related to the amount of patients served.
   * Reinstate the Hold Harmless for Rural Hospitals under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System and Make Other Improvements for Sole Community Hospitals - Reinstates "hold harmless" for small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals until Jan. 1, 2009. The Medicare outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) went into effect on August 1, 2000. In 1999, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) included provisions that would hold harmless rural hospitals with less than 100 beds. Essentially, the BBRA allowed small rural hospitals to continue being reimbursed under pre-PPS rules.
   * Assistance for Low-Volume Hospitals - Builds on an MMA provision to a payment adjustment for certain small rural hospitals that serve a low volume of patients. The MMA established a graduated adjustment/add-on payment for low-volume hospitals. Eligible hospitals are those located more than 25 miles away from another hospital and have less than 800 discharges in a given year. The maximum total adjustment is 25 percent of the otherwise applicable prospective payment rate. The benefit would phase out for facilities that discharge more than 2,000 patients a year.
   * Continuation of Geographic Reclassification for Certain Hospitals in Sparsely Populated States - Allows rural hospitals to apply to re-classify their wage index to another area if they believe their labor costs are more reflective of another market. As part of this process, hospitals must be located in a county that is adjacent to the county in which they propose to reclassify. The provision continues an appeals process to address proximity/adjacency requirements.
   * Reasonable Lab Costs Payment Extension for Rural Hospitals - Extends Section 416 of the MMA which provided reasonable cost reimbursement for clinical lab tests performed by rural hospitals as part of their outpatient services (i.e. for area patients receiving care at home or in nursing homes).
   * Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Improvements - This section includes a variety of provisions aimed at improving the CAH program. These provisions include reinstating cost-based reimbursement to CAHs for lab services provided to patients who are not physically present in the hospital, and eliminating a 35-mile ambulance service restriction to receive reimbursements.
   * Capital Infrastructure Loan Program - Authorizes through September 2010 a program to loans available to help rural facilities improve crumbling buildings and infrastructure.
   * Extend the Medicare Incentive Payment (MIP) Program - Extends MIP through Jan. 1, 2009, to continued 10 percent bonus payments to physicians practicing in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). The MMA built upon this program by requiring CMS to identify eligible rural providers and automatically provide the 10 percent add-on payment to all Medicare claims.
   * Extend the Physician Fee Schedule Work Geographic Adjustment - Extends current law through Jan. 1, 2009 to carry on MMA provisions that increased the work geographic index to a base of one over a two year period for any locality for which such index was below one.
   * Services Provided to Home Health and Hospice Patients - Ensures physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists - who have no financial relationship with a home health or hospice agency and are legally authorized to perform the services - will be eligible to directly prescribe home health and hospice care. These providers will be reimbursed by Medicare at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule for such services.
   * Rural Health Clinic (RHC) Reimbursement - Raises the RHC all-inclusive reimbursement cap to $82, from approximately $63 today, making it comparable to the payment rate Community Health Centers (CHC) receive.
   * RHC and CHC Collaborative Access Expansion - Makes it easier for RHCs and CHCs who choose to work together to share services, coordinate care, and combine financial resources to improve patient care in rural, underserved areas. Current CHC legislative and regulatory requirements mandate these facilities offer a single model to deliver essential health care services. While this model works in urban areas, it does not always work well in rural and frontier communities.
   * Extension of Rural Home Health Add-On Payment - Extends through Jan. 1, 2008 the Deficit Reduction Act provisions that reestablished a 5 percent add-on payment increasing reimbursements to home health agencies for services furnished in rural areas.
   * Use of Medical Conditions for Coding Ambulance Services - Requires the Health and Human Services Secretary to make mandatory on the part of carriers and fiscal intermediaries the use of coding of medical conditions requiring ambulance transportation. Condition codes would help reduce the number of legitimate claims that are denied by carriers and eventually overturned on appeal.
   * Temporary Ground Ambulance Payment Extension - Extends through Jan. 1, 2008 current law that increased Medicare payments by 2 percent for rural ground ambulance services. This was initially enacted as part of the MMA to help rural ambulance services survive financially.
   * Create Appropriate Definition of "Rural" for Ambulance Reimbursement - Creates a new definition of "rural" based on Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA) designations developed by the Agriculture Department and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This would aid rural services located near official Metropolitan Statistical Areas for purposes of Medicare reimbursement.
   * Mental Health Provider Reimbursement - Permits marriage and family therapists and licensed professional counselors to bill Medicare for their mental health care services to seniors and be paid the rate of social workers. The Medicare program only permits psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and clinical nurse specialists to bill Medicare for mental health services provided to seniors.
   * Technology Projects to Improve Home Health Services - Requires the HHS Secretary to create pilot projects providing incentives for home health agencies to purchase and utilize home monitoring and communications technologies.
   * Facilitating the Provision of Telehealth Services Across State Lines - Direct the HHS Secretary to work with stakeholders to adopt regulations allowing for multi-state practitioner licensure across state lines for the purposes of providing telehealth services. Telehealth has helped to bring health care into rural areas that otherwise lack access to such services.
