ALAMO NAVAJO SCHOOL AWARDED 'SAFE AND DRUG-FREE' GRANT
  Safety and drug-prevention efforts for the Alamo Navajo School in Magdalena will be reinforced through a $557,404 grant from the U.S. Department of Education (DoED), Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today reported. 
   The funding award was made through the DoED Safe Schools/ Healthy Students Initiative (SS/HS), a three-year collaborative grant with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and U.S. Justice Department (DOJ). 
   "This initiative confronts school safety using a comprehensive approach, combining education, health, justice and social services tactics to reduce violence in schools. I hope that with this grant students at Alamo Navajo School will be better able to focus on their studies without the risk of violence or drug exposure," Domenici said. 
   The New Mexico lawmaker confirmed the SS/HS funding award is geared toward providing students, schools and communities the benefit of enhanced services in the areas of comprehensive education, mental health, and social, law enforcement and juvenile justice systems. 
   Domenici said the services and activities are targeted toward the development by young people of the social skills and emotional resilience necessary to avoid drug use and violent behavior, and the establishment of school environments that are safe, disciplined, and alcohol and drug-free. 
   The SS/HS is based on evidence that a comprehensive, integrated community-wide approach is an effective way to promote healthy childhood development and address the problems of violence, alcohol and other drug abuse. 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding levels for the DoED, HHS and DOJ.
