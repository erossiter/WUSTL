SEN. DOMENICI INSTRUMENTAL IN SECURING FUNDING FOR FARMINGTON BUS SHELTERS, FOUR CORNERS AIRPORT ALSO GAINS AID
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the city of Farmington has been issued $80,000 in funding he secured during the FY2004 appropriations process to support the construction of bus shelters in downtown Farmington.  
   The funding is being awarded through the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration. Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "I am pleased to have been able to obtain these funds for Farmington to install bus shelters at twenty stops around the city," Domenici said. "Farmington is among several growing New Mexico communities striving to better their local transit systems and I applaud them." 
   Four Corners Regional Airport will also receive $650,000 from the Department of Transportation (DOT) to make improvements in the air service provided at the community airport. 
   "Four Corners Regional Airport should be able to lower air fares to increase passenger numbers," Domenici said. "These funds allow Farmington to negotiate lower prices with airlines to make Four Corners Airport more accessible and decrease the need to travel miles to other airports for cheaper rates." 
   The DOT awarded these funds under the Small Community Air Service Development program (SCASDP) to bring down prices at Four Corners that have escalated due to conditions such as high elevation and temperature which limit the types of aircraft that can operate at the airport.
