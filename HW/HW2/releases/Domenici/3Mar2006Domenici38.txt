SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO GRANT TO STUDY SKIN CANCER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the University of New Mexico has been awarded a $142,500 grant to study new ways of detecting and imaging melanoma.  
   The UNM study will help determine whether Electronparamagnetic Resonance (EPR), an MRI-like machine, can better detect molecular signatures that are specific only to melanoma which can expedite the diagnosis and treatment. 
   "Effective cancer detection research is something that is very important to the heath of all our citizens especially those who live in places where there is greater exposure to the sun, such as New Mexico. I applaud UNM for being a part of this type of research that may be critical to a real cure." Domenici said. 
   The success of this research may provide for the production of hand-held EPR's which would make detection and imaging of possible skin melanomas much easier and more efficient. It would provide for a better way to look at questionable growths on the body and see what is causing the growth and how it is formed. 
   The grants were all awarded through the Department of Health and Human Services.
