SEN. DOMENICI PROMOTES 'NAMI WALKS' THIS MAY 12
  Sen. Pete Domenici today released a radio PSA to promote a 5k walk to benefit advocacy activities for better mental health, an event being hosted by the National Alliance on Mentally Illness-New Mexico (NAMI). 
   Domenici and his wife Nancy are honorary co-chairs of the 2007 NAMI Walks, a walk-a-thon that will take place at 8 a.m., Saturday, May 12, in Albuquerque.
   "I'm honored to support the 2007 NAMI walk-a-thon. NAMI Walks is a national campaign brought to New Mexico to promote hope for those living with serious biological brain disorders," Domenici said.
   Participants may walk as part of a team or individually. Check-in begins at 7 a.m. Saturday at the north end of the Albuquerque Academy in the parking lot of the Hoffmantown Church, 8888 Harper N.E.

   The Senator and Mrs. Domenici are longtime mental health advocates. Domenici is currently working with Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to enact the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 (S.558). This bill represents the culmination of more than a year's negotiations involving lawmakers, mental health, insurance and business organizations to craft compromise legislation. The new policy would build on the landmark 1996 Mental Health Parity Act, a law authored by Domenici and the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone that began the process of ending health insurance discrimination against people with mental illness.
