SEN. DOMENICI EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER LOST VETERANS AFFAIRS DATA
  In response to news that a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee recently took home unauthorized electronic data containing identifying information about up to 26.5 million veterans and their families, Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement: 
   "In light of the major loss of sensitive information at the Department of Veterans Affairs, I think it is clear that the VA must take significant steps to better protect their data. Identity theft is a serious issue. Veterans who are retired or on a fixed income could be particularly vulnerable to identity theft. I'm concerned that they might not have the resources to respond to the consequences of identity theft should it happen.
   "Fortunately, so far, it does not appear that anyone has illegally used the missing data. Nevertheless, I expect the Department to minimize the disturbance for those affected as much as possible, and I want to be fully informed as to what steps the VA has taken to make sure it never happens again."
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, which today had a hearing featuring VA Secretary Jim Nicholson about the missing data.
   Domenici submitted written questions to Nicholson asking for a complete explanation of what happened and what steps will be taken to protect sensitive information within the department.
