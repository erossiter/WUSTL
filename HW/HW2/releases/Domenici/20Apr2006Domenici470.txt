SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES OVER $1.8 MILLION IN DOE WEATHERIZATION AID FOR NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority will receive over $1.8 million from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to fund the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) for low-income families. 
   The Weatherization Assistance Program provides assistance to low income homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and reduce utility costs. The WAP grants may be used for specific energy saving procedures including leakage reduction, weather stripping, insulation materials and other repairs.
   "I am pleased to see that the DOE will be providing funds to help low income families reduce their energy costs. While some cuts to this program have been proposed, I will do all that I can to ensure funds for weatherization remain available," Domenici said.
   During a recent Energy and Natural Resources hearing chaired by Domenici, the Senator criticized a proposed $78 million cut to the WAP program and said that this type of reduction will shut off assistance to 33,000 families who are facing rising energy bills.
   The Central New Mexico Housing Corp. this week will host a tour of recently weatherized housing units funded by WAP. A representative from Domenici's office will be on hand to view a demonstration of the technology that is used to assess energy efficient housing.
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which sets DOE funding levels.
