   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici explains the mechanics of a Senate filibuster and how it is being applied to the nomination of Samuel Alito to be an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. He predicts that the filibuster threat will fail and that Alito will be confirmed Tuesday with about 54 positive votes. 
   03:45 - Domenici notes his opposition to expected reductions to National Guard force levels in the upcoming FY2007 federal budget, and discusses Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's ongoing effort to reform the overall force structure of the U.S. military, including Guard and Reserve units. 
   05:51 - Domenici says he and Senator Bingaman have decided to oppose a plan to create a separate pension plan for Los Alamos National Laboratory workers because the new managers have not adequately convinced them that the move is necessary or in the best interests of LANL workers, retirees and dependents. 
   10:00 - Domenici says he is very pleased that HUD has released the funding he secured to equip the new communications facility at Eastern New Mexico University-Portales. 
   11:46 - Domenici says he will join President Bush on his visit to Albuquerque on Friday, and believes New Mexico will provide a good setting for highlighting the need to boost scientific and educational competitiveness--topics expected to be part of the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday. 
   14:01 - Domenici says he has spoken to the family of Army Sgt. Clifton J. Yazzie of Fruitland, N.M., who was recently killed in Iraq. He calls Yazzie a hero and discusses his sorrow and hopes for his family. 
   15:37 - Domenici says he expects the President to address border security in the State of the Union address. He says he hopes the President sheds light on everything that is being done to secure the borders. He discusses the difficulty facing policymakers in terms of addressing illegal immigration and the status of the more than 9 million people now in the United States illegally. 
   19:00 - Domenici says President Bush is likely to give the American people a frank assessment of the war in Iraq and the progress and challenges we face there. He says the State of the Union speech may also be used to discuss the importance of the allied mission in Iraq in context to other problems areas in the Middle East. 
   19:52 - Domenici expresses his dismay with the partisan nature of the debate on the Alito nomination, saying the debate is remarkably different that the qualifications-based assessments carried out in previous Supreme Court nominations. He dismisses criticism that Alito will shift the court to the right, but noting that no justice ever offers any guarantee of how he or she will decide cases once on the court. 
   23:30 - Domenici says he will vote to confirm Alito based on his qualifications, just as he has assessed other liberal or conservative nominees over the past 34 years. He says the American people understand that Alito is qualified, which is why a majority supports his confirmation.
