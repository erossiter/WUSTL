NEW MEXICO NETS OVER $12 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN HOSPITAL BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that New Mexico's health care providers will have over $12.1 million in federal funding to better prepare facilities and personnel for potential bioterrorism threats.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will make $1.3 billion available nationally to support several programs that help hospitals to prepare for disease outbreaks and large-scale emergencies stemming from bioterrorism. 
   "New Mexico will put this significant award to good use by tightly monitoring infectious trends that arise on the border in addition to preparing for any future emergency that threatens the larger population," Domenici said. "The funding provided will strengthen New Mexico's health care system all the way down to better protective gear in local hospitals." 
   HHS will make the funding available to New Mexico through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 
   A total of $8,810,432 is being provided to New Mexico through CDC to support preparedness against bioterrorism, infectious diseases and public health emergency preparedness statewide. This includes improving integrated response systems and the medication distribution to affected masses. CDC funding can also support chemical agent testing done at New Mexico's national laboratories and early warning, surveillance, and detection of diseases along the border. 
   The remaining $3,343,195 in HRSA funding will allow New Mexico to expand its capacity to deal with mass emergencies. Funds can support expansion of hospital beds, establishing hospital-based pharmaceutical caches, providing mental health services, improving trauma and burn care, and providing personal protective equipment.
