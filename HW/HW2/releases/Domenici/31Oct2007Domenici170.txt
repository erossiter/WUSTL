SENS. DOMENICI, CLINTON, BACKED BY FIRST LADY, OFFER BILL TO FORTIFY U.S. HISTORIC PRESERVATION WORK
  U.S. Senators Pete Domenici and Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined by First Lady Laura Bush, today unveiled bipartisan legislation to formally authorize two historic preservation programs used to preserve and protect American "heritage and treasures"--including a variety of cultural resources in New Mexico. 
   The lawmakers announced the bill introduction at a news conference at the historic Sewall-Belmont House and Museum on Capitol Hill. Laura Bush serves as the honorary chair of the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures programs.  
   The Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act (S.2262) would, for the first time, formally codify the Preserve America and the Save America's Treasures programs. Both are grant programs that were started through presidential executive orders. Administered by the Department of the Interior with the cooperation of other federal agencies, the programs have operated without congressional authorization since their inception. 
   "Old buildings are more than just old haunts. They can tell a story about the people who helped create American communities. There are centuries' worth of structures and artifacts that deserve to be saved in order to teach future generations about who we are," Domenici said. "Our goal with this bill is to provide the long-term stability that formal authorization will bring to these federal preservation programs." 
   "New Mexico, with its long and colorful history, has already benefited from these two programs, and so much more can be done. From the Palace of the Governor's Collections in Santa Fe to the Lincoln Historic District, where the outlaw Billy the Kid participated in the Lincoln County War, these programs have proved invaluable to preserving the rich heritage of New Mexico," he said. "I believe our bill can set the stage for even more historic preservation activities in our state." 
   In New Mexico, Las Vegas and Silver City have been designated Preserve America communities, and 15 Save America's Treasure grants worth almost $5.0 million have been issued for historic preservation work throughout the state. 
   "Saving America's Treasures is about more than bricks and mortar. It's about more than documents and artifacts. It's about our past - the lessons and legacy of our history which can educate and inspire us. And it's about the future we can build together, guided by the values that have united us as Americans and that have helped us build a fairer, freer, stronger nation," said Clinton. "I was proud to help create Save America's Treasures and I am thrilled that nearly ten years later it is still going strong. I could not be more pleased to be part of this bipartisan effort to formally authorize Save America's Treasures and Preserve America." 
   Formal congressional authorization of the two programs would work to ensure their long-term viability. The bill would authorize competitive grant programs for both Preserve America and Save America's Treasures. 
   Preserve America grants complement the Save America's Treasures grant program, which funds "bricks and mortar" improvements to historic structures and assets, by providing competitive grants to encourage sustainable historic resource management through heritage tourism. Both build on preservation goals set in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. 
   Senator Richard Burr cosponsored the Senate Bill. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Brad Miller (D-N.C.), chairman of the House Historic Preservation Caucus, and Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio). 
   Established in 2003 by President Bush, the Preserve America initiative encourages and supports community efforts to preserve their cultural and natural heritage. Since 2003, 549 cities in all 50 states have been designated Preserve America Communities, and 140 of the Preserve America Communities have received a combined total of $10 million to develop sustainable resource management strategies related to the preservation and use of heritage assets. Preserve America grants support planning, development and implementation of innovative heritage tourism activities and programs which focus on historic preservation and education.

   The Save America's Treasures program, launched in 1998 by President Clinton, is a national effort to protect threatened cultural treasures, including historic structures, collections, works of art, maps and journals related to the history and culture of the United States. It was originally created as the centerpiece of the White House National Millennium Commemoration, and as a public-private partnership that included the White House, the National Park Service and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. From 1998 through 2006, over $300 million in Federal and private funding has been awarded for over 1,000 grants. (More information: http://www.saveamericastreasures.org/)
