SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATUS OF MILK INCOME LOSS COMPENSATION DAIRY PROGRAM DURING UPCOMING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS
  In response to instructions issued by House Speaker Dennis Hastert that call for House negotiators to include the Milk Income Loss Compensation (MILC) dairy subsidy program into the Deficit Reduction Budget Reconciliation Act, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici issued the following statement. 
   Domenici is a senior member and former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and will serve on the Senate-House conference committee for the reconciliation bill. 
   "MILC is a deeply flawed program that punishes successful dairy farmers. It is doing little to aid the changing American dairy industry. While some lawmakers from the Northeast, for instance, claim that MILC is the lifeblood of their dairy industry, the facts show that dairies have continued to go out of business in that region since MILC was implemented in 2002. 
   "With upcoming trade talks and increasing international pressure to reduce subsidies, extending MILC is the wrong direction for this nation. If MILC proponents are able to craft a compromise solution that represents better national policy, I am certainly willing to listen. Extending MILC in its current form is unacceptable, and I will oppose it vigorously in conference." 
   New Mexico is the seventh largest dairy producing state in the nation, behind California, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and Minnesota. The dairy industry in New Mexico directly employs more than 8,000 workers, with the leading dairy producing counties being Chaves, Curry, Roosevelt, Do?a Ana, Lea and Eddy. There is also significant production in Bernalillo, Socorro and Valencia counties.
