SEN. DOMENICI VOTES AGAINST FY09 BUDGET PLAN, HIS LAST AS LONG-TIME MEMBER & CHAIRMAN OF PANEL
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today voted against committee passage of the FY2009 Budget Resolution, a $3 trillion Democratic fiscal plan that would lead to increased federal taxes and spending.  
   Domenici, a former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, on Thursday participated in the committee's markup of the FY2009 Budget Resolution, which would serve as a budget plan for federal government activities. The plan is expected to be debated on the Senate floor next week. 
   "This 2009 budget is a Democratic blueprint that will again try to increase taxes, spend more and not address the ever-growing entitlement spending problem facing this nation," Domenici said. "I hope we have a chance on the Senate floor to try to improve this budget." 
   The markup is the final committee resolution on which Domenici will have worked, following almost 33 years on the committee. Prior to the final votes on the FY2009 plan, Domenici was recognized by the committee--Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), ranking member Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and former ranking member Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.)--for his leadership on federal budget issues since joining the committee in 1975. He served as Senate Budget Committee chairman for many years at various points during his career. 
   "I know that every Budget Committee chairman faces a very difficult and usually thankless job in putting together the federal budget. So I appreciate all the kind remarks today. The budget process is important and I hope it will be used to better serve the nation," Domenici said. 
   While critical of a budget plan that would increase taxes by allowing the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts to expire next year, Domenici was pleased that the budget plan would make room to pay for the costs of implementing a national Mental Health Parity policy.
