SEN. DOMENICI HIGHLIGHTS 10TH BIRTHDAY FOR RADIO DISNEY AS CHARACTER COUNTS PARTNER, SEPT. 11 STATE FAIR CELEBRATION PLANNED
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged New Mexico school children and their families to join in celebrating the 10th birthday of Radio Disney AM 1240 during "Character Counts Day" at the New Mexico State Fair. 
   The annual "Character Counts Day" is Monday, Sept. 11, at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque. Festivities are planned to mark Radio Disney's partnership with Character Counts in New Mexico.
   "Radio Disney is the perfect partner for Character Counts," said Domenici, a national Character Counts advocate since 1994. "Radio Disney gives us great family entertainment every day of the week, and we are proud to have Radio Disney support character education."
   The Radio Disney birthday party will be 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Ford Pavilion. Festivities will include performances from Radio Frequency and "Disney-style" games. There will also be birthday cake for all comers.
   Character Counts is Domenici's most important non-legislative initiative. Character Counts includes lessons for young people built around the six basic pillars of good character-Respect, Responsibility, Trustworthiness, Citizenship, Fairness, and Caring.
   "Every year, we come to the State Fair to crow about the success of Character Counts the past twelve months," Domenici added. "One of our major achievements is partnering with the business community to help our young people learn that ethical behavior and good character guarantees success in life."
   "It is gratifying that Radio Disney is such a good community partner, and I am happy to wish everyone associated a very happy birthday, and I wish many more decades of Disney on the airwaves," he said.
