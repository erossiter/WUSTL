SENS. DOMENICI, DORGAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WOULD UPGRADE U.S. BORDERS WITH MEXICO, CANADA
  With 20 years gone without any major attention to border infrastructure needs, Sens. Pete Domenici and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) today launched a comprehensive bid to improve border security by improving infrastructure, equipment, technology and manpower along U.S. land borders.  
   The Domenici-Dorgan Border Infrastructure and Modernization Act of 2007 would authorize greater federal resources and would require the General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a comprehensive plan to systematically begin improving security on the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. 
   The last comprehensive border improvement effort was in 1986, with a $237 million border improvement plan sponsored by Domenici and former Arizona Senator Dennis DeConcini. 
   "Congress has acted to improve security at airports and seaports, but we have not yet addressed our busiest ports, located on our land borders. This is where our infrastructure is its weakest, and we must act to prevent criminals and terrorists from exploiting this weakness. It is critical that we give our northern and southern borders the resources they need to address these vulnerabilities," Domenici said. 
   "We need to do a better job of protecting our borders so we know who is entering our country," Dorgan said, "but we need to do it in a way that also facilitates commerce. Senator Domenici and I have developed legislation bill that meets those two goals, by improving port of entry infrastructure and technologies, and by increasing personnel at those ports. We can protect our borders while allowing robust trade with other countries. Our bill provides a blue print for doing just that." 
   The Domenici-Dorgan bill would: 
   * Authorize annual hiring increases for the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement Directorate and the DHS Customs and Border Patrol Directorate; 
   * Require the General Service Administration (GSA) to identify on an annual basis the port of entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects needed to enhance border security and legitimate commerce; 
   * Direct the GSA, working with the Department of Homeland Security, to prioritize and implement these projects based on need; 
   * Direct the Homeland Security Secretary to prepare a Land Border Security Plan to assess the vulnerabilities at each port of entry on the northern and southern land borders; 
   * Require the Homeland Security Secretary to consult and cooperate with federal, state and local entities involved on the borders in the development of the Land Border Security Plan; 
   * Authorize the expansion of Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Programs; and 
   * Establish three to five technology demonstration programs at ports of entry to test and evaluate new technologies to improve inspections, communications, and detection of weapons of mass destruction. 
   "I am particularly excited about authorizing and implementing demonstration programs to test and evaluate new border technologies. Because equipment and technology alone will not solve the security problems on our border, we need test sites that also house facilities so personnel who must use these technologies can train under realistic conditions," Domenici said. 
   The GSA completed its last comprehensive assessment of infrastructure needs on the southwestern and northern borders in 2001. That assessment showed that that overhauling both borders would cost $784 million.
