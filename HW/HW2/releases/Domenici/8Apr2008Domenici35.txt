SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON GEN. PETRAEUS ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ SITUATION
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement regarding the U.S. military situation in Iraq. 
   General David Petraeus, commander of Multi-National Force-Iraq, and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq David Crocker appeared at two hearings Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   "I think we would do well to listen to General Petraeus and his assessment of what is still needed in Iraq. He has asked Congress for flexibility in guiding our American forces.
   "I believe the American-led military surge is working. We are in the process of bringing more servicemen and women home-about 16,000 more by July. But General Petraeus has also asked for a 'pause' when we reach 140,000 troops so we can check the status of the Iraqis' ability to sustain the security of their own nation.
   "Our ultimate withdrawal from Iraq will require a major surge by the Iraqi government on the security, diplomatic and political fronts. The Iraqi government is making some progress and must continue to do so. But the American people are also right to expect the Iraqis to redouble their own efforts to squash insurrectionists and rebuild a government that works for all their people."
