SEN. DOMENICI SALUTES ALBUQUERQUE-AREA TEENS HONORED FOR 'CHARACTER COUNTS' CITIZENSHIP QUALITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated four Albuquerque-area teens who Tuesday were honored for their Character Counts citizenship traits. 
   The students were named Tuesday evening at the annual YMCA of Central New Mexico dinner. The 2006 "Pete Domenici Character Counts Citizenship" Award winners are: Cassidy Hoggan, 13, Desiree Padilla, 13, and Victoria Lopez, 14, all students at Hoover Middle School; and Eddy Matthews, 15, an Eldorado High School student.
   "It is such an honor to have these young people saluted in my name," said Domenici. "Every year, our friends at the Y find remarkable young people to get this award, and this year is no exception."
   The annual YMCA dinner marks the climax of the annual YMCA "Invest in Youth" campaign to raise money for scholarships.
   Character Counts is an education initiative designed to help young people and adults live by the virtues of Respect, Responsibility, Trustworthiness, Citizenship, Fairness, and Caring.
   "We have watched the Y use the pillars of Character Counts to positively influence the behavior of Y kids and their parents," Domenici said. "The YMCA is an incredible Character Counts success story."
   The YMCA has been a partner in Character Counts since Domenici helped launch the program in New Mexico 12 years ago. Since 2000, the YMCA has given the Domenici Citizenship award to dozens of youth.
   The student award winners were selected by YMCA staff based on, among other things, commitment to community service, role model and mentorship skills, and overall attitudes toward the Y and improving its programs.
