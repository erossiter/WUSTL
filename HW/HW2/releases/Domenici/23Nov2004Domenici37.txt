SEN. DOMENICI ASKS FOR REVIEW OF FEDERAL ELECTION FUND USAGE IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici has sent a letter asking the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to review the use of federal election funds by the Office of the New Mexico Secretary of State.  
   New Mexico was provided $14.28 million in federal funds through the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). Payments made to states under HAVA must be used only for certain purposes enumerated in the bill, including "improving the administration of elections for Federal office" and "educating voters concerning voting procedures, voting rights, and voting technology." 
   "Among other expenditures, $1 million in HAVA funding was spent on an advertising campaign to educate people about their most fundamental right to vote (Albuquerque Tribune, 11/6/04). Many New Mexicans have questioned whether this ad campaign was an appropriate used of the funds," Domenici wrote in the letter. 
   Domenici asked the EAC to review the New Mexico's use of federal funds to ensure the expenditures were in compliance with HAVA. The Senator intends to introduce legislation in the 109th Congress that expands on the reforms he proposed to HAVA this past September. That legislation (S.2818) would have extended the existing federal identification requirements to individuals who have not registered in person with their authorized government entity and enhanced criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly and fraudulently register 10 or more persons. 
   The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by HAVA to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for information and review of procedures with respect to the administration of Federal elections. Among the Commission's duties is to audit persons who received federal funds authorized by HAVA.
