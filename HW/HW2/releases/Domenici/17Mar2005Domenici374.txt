SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES ANOTHER CARLSBAD SMALL BUSINESS LANDS WIPP CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that a Carlsbad company has been awarded a contract worth over $1.23 million from the Department of Energy (DOE) for services at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).  
   Domenici, who serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the DOE and WIPP, applauded the contract awarded to Hall Machine & Welding Co., Inc. of Carlsbad. 
   "This new DOE contract serves as further proof of the WIPP facility's positive economic impact on the Carlsbad community. It is encouraging to see yet another local business benefit from its association with WIPP," Domenici said. "I will continue working to ensure that local companies have the opportunity to compete for major contracts with this and other federal facilities in our state." 
   Hall Machine & Welding will provide WIPP with 55-gallon open head steel drums (DOT 7A Type A), the most common container used for packaging transuranic (TRU) waste at the facility. 
   The President's budget for FY2006 includes $225.5 million for the DOE Carlsbad Area Office and WIPP. This amount includes $24.5 million in transportation funding to be provided directly to the state.
