SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF ARMY SPC. JOS? ZAMORA IN IRAQ
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the death in Baghdad on Aug. 6 of Army Specialist José Zamora of Sunland Park: 
   "Today we are again faced with the grim reality of war with the death of another young New Mexican in a foreign land. I salute the service of Specialist Zamora. His family is in my thoughts and prayers as they face their loss in the sad days ahead. I hope they can find comfort in knowing their son served bravely for his country.
   "The fact that José is the third New Mexican to die in Iraq and Afghanistan in less than a month is sobering, and should call attention to dangers our American men and women in uniform face in carrying out missions to fight terrorism and promote freedom. Their resilience and strength are so remarkable that when they fall their loss is all the harder to accept."
   Zamora, 24, who served with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., was killed in Baghdad when a roadside bomb detonated near the Humvee in which he was riding.
   Army Sgt. Leroy Segura Jr., 23, was killed Aug. 4 in a vehicle rollover in Habbaniyah, Iraq, and Sgt. Robert P. Kassin, died on July 16 at Larzab Base, Afghanistan. Both were natives of Clovis.
