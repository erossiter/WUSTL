DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUDNING FOR N.M. CRIME VICTIMS REPARATION COMMISSION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded $650,000 to the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission (CVRC) for crime victim compensation. 
   CVRC will receive the award in order to enhance state victim compensation payments to eligible crime victims. Payments from the funds will be disbursed to eligible victims throughout the state.
   "Crime victims can often have a difficult time putting the pieces of their lives back together," said Domenici. "I know that these federal funds only touch the surface of their needs as survivors, but I hope that they can at least address some of the issues that are of concern to them."
   The CVRC was formed in 1981 under the Crime Victims Reparation Act to provide assistance, primarily financial, to violent crime victims. Additionally, it acts as a bridge between federal justice assistance funding and private non-profit groups in New Mexico.
   The grant will be administered under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) which provides financial assistance to federal and state victims of crime.
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and serves on the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee which plays a large role in determining funding for DOJ programs.
