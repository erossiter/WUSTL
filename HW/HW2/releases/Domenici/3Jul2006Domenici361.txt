SEN. DOMENICI EXTENDS INDEPENDENCE DAY GREETINGS TO NEW MEXICANS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today extended the following Fourth of July message to all New Mexicans: 
   "As we celebrate the 230th birthday of this great nation, I wish New Mexicans a safe and happy Independence Day holiday. As we set out to spend time with family and friends, we should also remember those men and women of our Armed Forces who, like our forefathers, put themselves in harms way to protect us and everything we hold dear as a country.
   "This Fourth of July, I believe we should celebrate what we have in common as Americans. We are the greatest nation on earth because of our unique American ability to be many but ultimately one. Let us celebrate our diversity and let us celebrate our unity as Americans.
   "My wife Nancy and I wish you all a happy and safe Independence Day. God bless America."
   Domenici's offices in New Mexico and Washington will be closed Tuesday, July 4.
