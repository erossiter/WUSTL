NEW MEXICO RECEIVES $3.8 MILLION FOR HEALTH INITIATIVES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded three grants worth over $3.8 million to fund various health initiatives throughout New Mexico. 
   The grants were awarded through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).
   "There are very important health initiatives in New Mexico and I am happy to see assistance being administered on such a wide scale. From recognizing brain injuries to providing health care to patients with the HIV/AIDS, these programs will help many New Mexicans who suffer from a wide range of health issues," Domenici said.
   New Mexico Aging & Long Term Services Department will receive $100,000 to create education based modules to assist physicians, early childhood educators and community health representatives on reservations in detecting and recognizing brain injuries.
   New Mexico Department of Health will receive $3,489,677 to fund the Ryan White Care Act Title II. This grant funds Health Management Alliance programs for persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. This program provides patients with case medication, case management counseling, physical and mental health consultations all in one office.
   The New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology will receive $220,650 to fund research aimed at developing more accurate ways of analyzing cellular processes. The research will allow doctors and patients in the future to test blood composition and get instant results. This information can be life saving for individuals who suffer from certain diseases such as diabetes or heart disease.
   As part of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Domenici has signed a letter reiterating to appropriators that the Senate's FY2007 budget blueprint includes a $235 million increase over the President's request for the HRSA, and that this increase is primarily intended to support rural heath programs.
