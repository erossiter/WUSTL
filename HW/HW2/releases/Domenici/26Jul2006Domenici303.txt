SEN. DOMENICI'S GULF ENERGY BILL ADVANCES AS LEADERS CELEBRATE ENERGY POLICY ACT ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today won a vote for the Senate to consider his bill to open areas of the Gulf of Mexico rich with American-owned natural gas and oil.
   The Senate vote (86-12) to debate S.3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, came as Domenici joined House Energy Chairman Joe Barton and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to mark progress related to the upcoming first year anniversary of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   "I am delighted by this vote. I think it reflects the Senate's recognition that this focused, bipartisan energy bill is the most important thing we can do in the near-term to ease our energy supplies and stabilize energy prices," Domenici said.
   "I look forward to beginning debate on this important bill. I remain optimistic that we can pass this legislation before we recess," he said.
   "Last year's enactment of the Energy Policy Act cannot be our final act for easing U.S. dependence on foreign energy and bringing relief from high energy prices to the American people. There's no doubt that the Energy Policy Act has spurred significant progress on multiple fronts to diversify and maximize domestic energy production, but more must be done. Tapping our natural gas and oil resources in the Gulf is a logical next step," he said.
   Senate debate on S.3711, which has bipartisan support, is expected to extend into next week. The bill would open Lease Area 181 and 181 South where there is an estimated 6 trillion cubic feet of federally-owned natural gas and 1.26 billion barrels of oil to the American public.
   At a Capitol Hill news conference with Bodman, Domenici praised Energy Department efforts to implement the Energy Policy Act, which was signed into law Aug. 8, 2005 in Albuquerque.
   "Secretary Bodman knows that his department has to be vigilant and continue implementing this bill. I look forward to the next steps on the electricity reliability provisions we enacted that can help make blackouts a thing of the past in this country," Domenici said.
   "Because of the bipartisan law we put together, we're seeing wind farms and ethanol plants planned all over the country, and the rebirth of the nuclear power in this country is happening now," he said.
