  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated Dr. Elise Pookie Sautter of Las Cruces on being named New Mexico's Professor of the Year for excellence in undergraduate teaching and mentoring.  
   National recognition has been given to Dr. Sautter and other honorees from around the nation who have been honored with 2005 Professor of the Year awards. Sautter is currently Professor of Marketing at New Mexico State University. 
   Sautter has taught in the NMSU College of Business Administration and Economics since 1989, after receiving a Ph.D. from Florida State University. She is being honored for her dedication to teaching, commitment to students, and her innovative instructional methods. "I sincerely congratulate Dr. Sautter for her commitment to teaching college students the principles of a good education and the eagerness that can be had from learning. NMSU has cultivated some of the brightest students, in part because of Dr. Sautter's efforts and I am pleased she is being honored today," Domenici said. 
   The U.S. "Professors of the Year" program started in 1981 and is the only national award program to recognize college and university professors for their teaching accomplishments. The program is sponsored by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which hosts the final round of judging and sponsors the cash award given to winners.
