SEN. DOMENICI: BAYARD SCHOOLS GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that six schools in Grant County will be able to provide quality mental health care for students because of a new $214,750 grant provided by the U.S. Department of Education (DoED).  
   The funds have been made available through the DoED Mental Health of Children Program to Cobre Consolidated Schools to develop approaches that help six local schools in Bayard partner with local mental health systems. 
   "These schools will have the opportunity to form alliances with mental health care providers so students receive quality care when they need it," Domenici said. "I am pleased there will be a component to Bayard schools that has the capacity to handle mental health situations that may arise." 
   The program will help schools improve or develop collaborative efforts with mental health service providers, enhance availability of crisis intervention services, provide training for school and mental health professionals, and provide consultation to schools, health agencies and families. 
   Cobre Consolidated Schools include Bayard Elementary, Central Elementary, Hurley Elementary, and San Lorenzo Elementary Schools, as well as Snell Middle School, and Cobre High School.
