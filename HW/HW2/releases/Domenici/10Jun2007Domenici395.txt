SEN. DOMENICI: LACK OF PATIENCE, NOT TIME, STALLED BORDER SECURITY-IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said the Senate should rejoin the stalled debate on a major border security and immigration reform package that was put on ice late Thursday.  
   Domenici, appearing on the Fox News Weekend program, expressed his belief that the Senate can, and should, revive and pass the Border Security and Immigration Reform Bill (S.1348). 
   "We ran out of patience, not time," Domenici said. "It is critical that we get comprehensive immigration reform. I believe it is the single-most important domestic issue we face. We need to get the bill back on track. If we find the will, bringing this bill back up for passage could happen any time." 
   Domenici called on Senate leaders to work on finding the means for allowing more amendments to be considered on S.1348, noting that the Senate has generally been open to voting on scores of amendments on major policy bills. 
   "We have had major debates much longer than this during my 30 plus years in the Senate," Domenici said. "We had 130 votes on one bill. On this immigration bill we've had 29. We can secure the borders, first, and then deal with illegal immigrants if we have the will."
