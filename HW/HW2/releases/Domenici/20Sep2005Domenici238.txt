SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON SENATE VALLE VIDAL LEGISLATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement related to the introduction of Senate legislation to ban oil and gas exploration on the Valle Vidal in northeast New Mexico.  
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, had conferred with Senator Jeff Bingaman on the Valle Vidal issue and the legislation Bingaman introduced Tuesday to block energy exploration on federal lands in the area. Domenici declined to cosponsor the bill as introduced. 
   "I am not cosponsoring this legislation because we are in a process to determine the assets at Valle Vidal. This process will take time, but in the meantime the Valle Vidal will remain as it is. I think it is premature to be making decisions on whether or not oil and gas leasing should occur in this area. 
   "I believe the Forest Service and BLM must go through with the Forest Planning and Leasing Analysis, and subsequent exploration and development of environmental documentation before we can really understand what is in the area, or what type of management should be undertaken. I want that assessment to be completed before we make any decisions on this area."
