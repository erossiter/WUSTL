SEN. DOMENICI: USDA GRANTS $14.9 MILLION LOAN TO EXPAND RURAL ELECTRIC SERVICE IN NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Farmers Electric Cooperative, Inc. of Clovis has been approved for a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan totaling $14.9 million to build new electricity distribution lines and conduct needed improvements in northeast New Mexico. 
   The 35-year, low-interest loan will be used to provide services to 559 new consumers, build 71 miles of distribution line and provide improvements throughout De Baca, Guadalupe, Curry, Harding, Quay, Roosevelt and San Miguel counties.
   "The rural development loans through the USDA provide important funding to New Mexico's rural communities. The electric cooperatives will continue to have my full support so that they may continue to provide these essential services to our communities," Domenici said.
   Recently, Domenici met with members of electric cooperatives throughout New Mexico, including Farmers Electric Cooperative, Inc. during the annual National Rural Electric Cooperative Association's legislative conferences.
   During the visit, Domenici discussed a number of issues affecting electrical service to rural customers including proposed interest rate increases for Power Marketing Administrations, railroad coal deliveries, and the need to reform the Endangered Special Act.
