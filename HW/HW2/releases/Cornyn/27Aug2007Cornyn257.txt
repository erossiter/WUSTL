SEN. CORNYN ANNOUNCES 13 TEXAS HEALTH CENTERS TO RECEIVE $7.1 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING, GAIN NEW FEDERALLY QUALIFIED STATUS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn announced Monday that 13 community health centers in Texas will receive $7.1 million in federal funding and have gained Federally Qualified Health Clinic Status (FQHC). The funding and FQHC designation, which come through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will help these centers continue offering a wide range of preventive and primary health care services to medically-underserved areas.  
   "Community health centers are an important way to increase access to health care and decrease costs," Sen. Cornyn said. "This funding will help ensure these community health centers have the resources necessary to continue current services and expand new ones for local patients. In addition, these centers reduce the cost of health care for all Texans by increasing access to non-emergency medical care and relieving the strain on Texas's emergency rooms."
   The FQHC designation allows community health centers to qualify for federal funding, reduced physician's insurance, larger Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and to participate in a low cost prescription drug program. The funding comes from the Health Resources and Services Administration's Consolidated Health Centers (CHCs) grant program, within HHS. 
   Sen. Cornyn continues to help community health centers receive funding by working with them and HHS during the application process. He and his staff regularly meet with federal, state and local officials, as well as community leaders to highlight the importance of increasing the number of FQHCs in Texas. 
   "I have visited Federally Qualified Health Clinics across the state to see their effectiveness firsthand," Sen. Cornyn said. "I'll continue working to increase the number of these important clinics in Texas and ensure that existing centers receive the funding they need to serve Texans well." 
   The 13 new FQHC clinics are in addition to 50 already established centers that provide primary and preventive treatment to individuals who do not have access to such care. FQHCs currently serve more than 700,000 underinsured and uninsured Texans.
