SEN. CORNYN VOTES AGAINST AMNESTY PROPOSAL, COMMITTEE IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Immigration and Border Security subcommittee, made the following statement Monday regarding his vote against final passage of a committee bill that included amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants: 
   "I voted against this committee bill because it rewards illegal immigrants and will be considered an amnesty by Americans. It will encourage further disrespect for our laws, and will undercut our efforts to shore up homeland security. There is a better way to address this national security concern, and several of those who voted for the committee bill--including the chairman--did so with reservations.
   "Adding border security measures to the McCain-Kennedy bill is not enough. But now that the full Senate debate is underway I'll work for a comprehensive solution to our immigration situation, one with additional border security, interior enforcement, and employer accountability. And while we must address the12 million illegal aliens already here, we have to do so without granting them amnesty."
   Sens. Cornyn and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) are the authors of The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S.1438). The legislation will strengthen enforcement, bolster border security, and reform immigration laws.
