SEN. CORNYN ADDRESSES TEXAS FEDERATION OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN'S 26TH BIENNIAL CONVENTION
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today addressed the 12,000-member Texas Federation of Republican Women's (TFRW) 26th Biennial Convention in El Paso. The Senator administered the Oath of Office for newly elected TFRW officers, and delivered remarks regarding many of the nation and Texas' most pressing issues, including border security, access to health care, economic growth, and fiscal discipline in government.  
   "The Texas Federation of Republican Women is a powerful organization that includes some of the brightest, most successful, and motivated women in the state of Texas. These women care deeply about the well-being of their families and future generations of Texans, and you won't find a single one of them sitting idly by on the sidelines. They are involved, proactive, and committed to creating a brighter tomorrow for all Texans," Sen. Cornyn said. 
   "I was delighted to have the opportunity to address this impressive group of women and discuss many of our shared priorities: boosting access to quality health care, reforming our flawed immigration system while ensuring a secure border, and continuing to create jobs and economic growth through common-sense tax relief. I'm encouraged by the TFRW's dedication to making a positive difference for all Texans, and I will continue to work to promote our shared goals in Washington." 
   Background: 
   The TFRW is an organization that makes it possible for women to influence how local, state, and federal government manages such critical issues as health, crime, education, taxes and financial security. 
   The TFRW's long-standing goals of education, training, participation in government, electing Republicans and encouraging Republican women to run for office has helped create a powerful organization that is approximately 12,000 members strong with 164 Local Clubs across the state of Texas.
