SEN. CORNYN: CONGRESS MUST FUND PRIORITIES WITHOUT OVER-SPENDING
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding Congress's failure to send a single appropriations bill to the President:  
   "Today marks the first time in 20 years that Congress has failed to send the President a single appropriations bill this late in the year. This is unacceptable. Since no appropriations bill has been sent to the President yet, and we're currently operating on a Continuing Resolution through Nov. 16, we'll likely see an omnibus appropriations bill in which all 12 of the appropriations bills will be rolled into one giant spending package and sent to the President. My fear is that the amount of money appropriated by Congress will vastly exceed what the President has requested and will tempt the majority party to dramatically increase taxes to pay for it. 
   "The American people continue to send the message loud and clear to Congress that they are tired of Congress over-spending. Now they're becoming increasingly wary of the Democrats' attempts to implement the largest tax increases in American history. I'll continue doing all I can to hold the line on spending. Congress must work together in a bipartisan manner to fund our priorities such as urgent resources for our troops and veterans, without the over-the-top spending levels in other areas the Democrats have tried to set in recent months."
