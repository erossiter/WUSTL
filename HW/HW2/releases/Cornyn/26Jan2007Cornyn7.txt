SEN. CORNYN INTRODUCES MEASURE TO ENCOURAGE HEALTH IN WORKFORCE
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced an amendment to the minimum wage bill on Friday to encourage better, healthier lifestyles in the workforce. The measure is based on Sen. Cornyn's previous legislation, the Workforce Health Improvement Program (WHIP) Act, and will correct an inequity in the tax code, allowing employers to deduct the cost of both on and off-site fitness centers on a pre-tax basis.  
   "This amendment will provide incentives that make it easier for people to live more active, healthier lifestyles," Sen. Cornyn said. "The benefits of this initiative are tremendous, including better health, fewer illnesses, improved productivity and reduced health care costs. It will also save taxpayers money. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important initiative."
   Under current law, businesses are permitted to deduct the cost of on-site work facilities, but if this health benefit is outsourced, the organization and its employees are responsible for the cost. Sen. Cornyn's amendment would correct this inequity in the tax code and will help smaller businesses and their employees by allowing them to deduct the cost of providing health benefits to their workers. 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
