SEN. CORNYN PLEDGES TO WORK TO IMPROVE 2007 FARM BILL TO MEET NEEDS OF TEXAS FARMERS, RANCHERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today addressed close to 1,000 Texas farmers and ranchers at the Texas Farm Bureau's 74th Annual Convention in Waco. Sen. Cornyn pledged to work to improve the pending 2007 Farm Bill, although Democrat leaders in Congress have closed debate and refused to allow amendments:  
   "While the new Farm Bill maintains and strengthens many important policies that have been helpful to the Texas agriculture industry in the past, there are several new initiatives in this 1,500-page bill that would have a negative impact on Texas farmers and ranchers. As extensive and complex as the Farm Bill is, it would be unwise to prohibit individual senators and members of Congress from improving the bill through amendments. 
   "I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate as we return to Washington to open debate on the Farm Bill and amend provisions like the new Livestock Title, which would lessen our agriculture industry's competitiveness, increase government control, and take away the storied independence of Texas farmers and ranchers." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
