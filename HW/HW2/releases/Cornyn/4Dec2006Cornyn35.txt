SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF AMBASSADOR BOLTON
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Monday regarding the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton: 
 "At a time when the United States is facing several critical international diplomacy issues, it is deeply disappointing that we will be losing a leader like John Bolton. From Iraq to Iran to North Korea, Ambassador Bolton proved himself as a dedicated and determined diplomat who is exceptionally qualified to represent the United States at the United Nations. 
 "The President used his authority under the Constitution to end the obstruction against John Bolton, and it is unfortunate that even after his exceptional work this year, he was prevented a fair up-or-down vote in the Senate. 
 "I would like to thank Ambassador Bolton for his service and call on my Senate colleagues to set aside partisan politics in future confirmation debates in order to do what is best for our nation and its people. 
 Within the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Cornyn chairs the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.
