SEN. CORNYN: SAN ANTONIO PROVIDES BEST QUALITIES FOR KEY HOMELAND SECURITY FACILITY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn reiterated his strong support Tuesday for San Antonio's bid on the proposed National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff as the San Antonio community meets to discuss the effort:  
   Dear Secretary Chertoff: 
   Thank you for the opportunity to reiterate my support for establishing the Department of Homeland Security's proposed National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in San Antonio, Texas. 
   As DHS continues into this next phase of potential site reviews, I am confident that the Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium will continue demonstrating that its proposal not only meets, but exceeds the criteria needed for success in such a critical mission. Key among the assets represented in the Texas bid are a well-established research capacity, a skilled and diverse workforce, transportation infrastructure, and strong community support. This is in addition to already existing, nationally-recognized bio-defense research facilities and expertise. 
   All of these benefits exist within my home town of San Antonio, which offers a high quality lifestyle through the diversity and friendliness of its citizens, a bustling economy, and cultural heritage unique to Texas. 
   The purpose of NBAF is critical to national security and should be located where it can best fulfill its mission. It is for this reason that I support establishing the facility in Texas. It provides the best qualities for a key homeland security effort. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with you and make the NBAF a success. 
   Sincerely, 
  JOHN CORNYN 
  United States Senator
