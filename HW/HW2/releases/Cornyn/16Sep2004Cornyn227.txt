SEN. CORNYN: LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION ON SCHOOL FINANCE PREFERABLE TO JUDICIAL MANDATE
  Sen. John Cornyn, a former state supreme court justice and attorney general, made the following statement Thursday regarding the ruling on the Orange Cove ISD case on school finance: "The judge's ruling is hardly a surprise with the state now paying only 38 cents on the dollar for public education in Texas.  
 The state of Texas must keep up with its commitment to educate all children so they can be competitive in a global economy. "This issue is not just about money, but there's no doubt that the school finance system is in a state of serious disrepair. Ultimately, this question is one of results. Every child must be provided the tools to live up to their God-given potential and so that Texas can produce a well-educated workforce that can compete for good, high-paying jobs. "I agree with Gov. Perry that this is an issue for the legislature and the state's leadership, and that a legislative solution is preferable to a judicial mandate. I'm confident that our state and its elected leaders are up to this challenge."
