SEN. CORNYN: PASSAGE OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDES IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR TROOPS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Thursday following unanimous Senate passage of the Defense Appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, which provides approximately $450 billion in funding for troops and military programs:  
   "The most important role of the federal government is to provide for the defense of our nation. This legislation is a key step toward making sure our military men and women have the essential cutting-edge equipment, training, and innovative technology they need to complete the mission we have asked them to accomplish. The resources provided through this legislation will help protect our troops as they continue to take the fight to radical Islamic terrorists and other enemies of the United States to keep us safe here at home. 
   "This bill includes a pay raise and other benefits for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, making sure we provide them what they need and deserve. It contains funding for the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, which I co-sponsored to improve treatment and delivery of health care for our troops, particularly those who have been wounded in battle. In addition, funding in the bill will help increase the size of both the Army and Marine Corps by 13,000 and 9,000 troops respectively, a crucial step in ensuring the military is able to meet our national security requirements. 
   "The bill also contains substantial funding for several programs that are critical for our national defense, such as the Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 Raptor and the V-22 Osprey aircraft. The men and women of our military, their dedicated families who support them, and these world-class defense programs are the key reason we continue to say: Texas defends America."
