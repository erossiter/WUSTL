UPDATE FROM SEN.CORNYN
  The fundamental responsibility of the federal government is our national defense. Each year, Congress must pass legislation to fund our security, including critical resources for our armed services. This is particularly important for Texas, home to one in ten military personnel and 18 major, active-duty military installations. 
   On Friday, Congress achieved a dubious new distinction. For the first time in 20 years, Congress failed to send the President a single one of the annual appropriations bill this late in the year. Moreover, of these funding bills currently under consideration, the majority party is proposing massive spending hikes they intend to fund with a $1.3 trillion tax increase. 
   We must work together in a bipartisan manner to fund our priorities and hold the line on government spending. The approval rating of Congress is reaching all time lows. The American people want more cooperation and results, and less partisan bickering.  
   Last week, the majority in Congress again failed to pass their version of an SCHIP reauthorization bill through the House of Representatives by a veto-proof margin. Congress now finds itself in the exact same place as two weeks ago-without an SCHIP bill to help Texas's and America's low-income kids. On Friday, I renewed my call to Senate Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi to end this political gamesmanship, meet Republicans at the negotiating table and pass a bipartisan bill to expand, strengthen and reauthorize SCHIP in a responsible manner.

   Dear Friend,
   Sincerely, 
  U.S. Senator John Cornyn

Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Bob Corker (R-TN) are also original cosponsors of the bill. "This is a matter of fundamental fairness for Texas taxpayers," Sen. Cornyn said. "Making the sales tax deduction permanent will put our state on a level playing field with others that can deduct their state income tax. Texans should be allowed to keep their hard-earned money, not be punished with an additional tax..."

   Cornyn: Americans Deserve Action On Immigration Reform, Not Political Posturing - 10/24/2007 [http://src.senate.gov/public/_files/television/cornyn_dream_oct24.ram]
   WASHINGTON-U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement today regarding his vote against the motion to proceed to the DREAM Act (S. 2205), which was introduced by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The motion to proceed, which required 60 votes, was rejected by a bipartisan vote of 52 to 44. "This was a difficult vote because I have a great deal of sympathy for the plight of children who have no moral culpability for being in this country illegally. Congress must continue seeking reasonable and responsible ways they can complete their education and achieve opportunity. Unfortunately, this bill had nothing to do with helping children or addressing the critical issue of immigration reform, and everything to do with political posturing and partisan gamesmanship by the Senate Democratic leadership..."

   Texas Times: Weekly Newspaper Column
   Protecting Our National Sovereignty: Our state, and our country, are struggling to keep up with the effects of globalization-the increasingly free flow of ideas, information, goods and capital across borders and around the world. One major challenge is making certain that our national sovereignty is protected, even as international commerce increases. This is no small matter.
   The State Fair - A Texas Tradition: In late October, organizers closed another highly successful State Fair of Texas in East Dallas. Between three and four million visitors spent time at the 2007 version, making it again the largest state fair in the United States. Some fairgoers came to see the Texas Longhorn football team take on the Oklahoma Sooners, a rivalry at the Texas Fair since 1929. Others came to sample fried food, see the auto show, ride North America's largest Ferris wheel, or watch entertainers such as the Jonas Brothers or Billy Ray Cyrus. The Texas Fair has something for everyone.
