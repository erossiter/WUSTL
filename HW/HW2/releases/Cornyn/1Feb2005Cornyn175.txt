SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBIA EXPLOSION
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) made the following statement Tuesday regarding the two-year anniversary of the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy:  
   "As we rightly remember the honorable astronauts of the Columbia, it's also important to recognize the men and women who respond to such catastrophes. Texas police, fire and emergency personnel, and thousands of volunteers, worked so hard two years ago to prevent further tragedy on the ground, and they continue to serve their communities admirably today.
  "Literally within minutes of the disaster, ordinary Texans did extraordinary things. By working together, they helped ensure the safety of their neighbors and helped speed the investigation. Their efforts, then and now, help make the nation's space program successful."
   Following the Space Shuttle Columbia explosion in 2003, Cornyn traveled to Johnson Space Center for the memorial honoring the astronauts who lost their lives. His first ever speech on the Senate floor was a special tribute to the seven astronauts who died, and later that year he traveled to Nacogdoches to thank the recovery workers for their efforts after the Columbia explosion.
