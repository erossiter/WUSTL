SEN. CORNYN: PASSAGE OF BIPARTISAN FISA BILL TO HELP KEEP NATION SAFE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, made the following statement Tuesday regarding Senate passage of bipartisan legislation, S. 2248, which modernizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act:  
   "America's intelligence professionals must have the necessary tools to track foreign terrorists plotting future attacks on our homeland and our troops fighting the war on terror. America's troops in the battlefield should not have their hands tied by judges and lawyers when lives are on the line. This would be unacceptable. 
   "Without these critical tools, U.S. intelligence officials would be blind and deaf to the important information that allows them to detect our enemies and deter attacks against Americans and our allies. So I'm encouraged that the Senate finally overcame the partisan obstacles and delays to pass this important wartime legislation to help keep Americans safe. And I urge the House to pass this bipartisan legislation swiftly." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
