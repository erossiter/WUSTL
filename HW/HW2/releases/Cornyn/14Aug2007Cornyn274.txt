SEN. CORNYN: FUTUREGEN IMPORTANT FOR TEXAS, EXPANDING ENERGY PRODUCTION, JOB OPPORTUNITIES
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn visited the proposed site of FutureGen near Odessa Tuesday to highlight the project's importance for Texas and expanding energy production and job opportunities. Sen. Cornyn has worked to ensure the Texas sites are fully considered for the new $1 billion zero-emissions, coal-fired power plant. He was joined by FutureGen representatives and local elected officials, including Ector County Judge Susan Redford; State Rep. Buddy West; and Dan Hollmann, FutureGen Alliance.  
   "FutureGen represents the latest in advanced technologies capable of producing traditional fossil fuels in an environmentally responsible way," Sen. Cornyn said. "FutureGen's state of the art technology is ideal for Texas, and will help ensure our state remains a leader in innovation and energy production. If successful, FutureGen technologies could help lower energy costs, increase domestic energy resources and eliminate sources of harmful pollutants." 
   Sen. Cornyn added: "Recently, Texas submitted its final documents to the Department of Energy for the two proposed Texas FutureGen sites. I am hopeful that these applications will provide the necessary evidence to the FutureGen Alliance and the Department of Energy that Texas is ideal for this clean-coal energy project." 
   Texas is home to two of four national finalists for FutureGen - Odessa and Jewett. FutureGen is a demonstration project launched by President Bush in 2003 to test new technology in refining coal and generating electricity. The project uses a chemical process to release the energy from coal - known as gasification - rather than burning the coal to achieve the same result. More specifically, coal gasification is an innovative way to chemically break down coal using heat and pressure. The FutureGen plant will also use technology to capture and safely store harmful emissions before their release into the atmosphere.
