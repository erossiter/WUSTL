SEN. CORNYN: WE MUST PROVIDE TROOPS FUNDING, REJECT 'SURRENDER DATE'
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Monday regarding a proposal by Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) to cut off funding for the troops fighting in Iraq:  
   "The Democrats have offered nearly 20 proposals on how to lose in Iraq, but not a single plan on how to succeed. Their latest legislation cuts off funds for our troops, micromanages our commanders on the ground and gives a 'surrender date' to our enemies. This proposal not only undermines our military men and women serving on the front lines of the war on terror, but does nothing to defeat terrorism. The Reid/Feingold legislation is a recipe for defeat. We must provide the necessary funding for General Petraeus and our military commanders to complete their mission."
