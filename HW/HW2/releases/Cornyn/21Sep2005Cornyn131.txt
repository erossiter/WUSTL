SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE RITA
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) made the following statement Wednesday regarding Hurricane Rita: 
   "I urge Texans and all those who may be in the path of Hurricane Rita to listen to the warnings and advice of their local officials. I also encourage citizens to help a neighbor in need, those who may not be able to carry out the evacuation or other preparation efforts on their own.  
   "I remain in close contact with local leaders in Texas and with FEMA and other federal agencies, and I urge the federal government to rapidly consider any emergency declaration requests. 
   "There is a massive federal preparation effort underway in Texas and along the Gulf Coast to ensure that we are ready and that we'll be able to respond quickly to any damage that may occur. I'm encouraged by the federal government's efforts to pre-position resources to prepare for Rita's landfall. 
   "Having said that, it is the state and local leaders who know best what Texas will need, so we will ensure that the federal government is an effective partner and provides the necessary support and resources. We'll continue working closely with FEMA and other federal agencies to ensure that state and local officials have what they need, and that Texas is well prepared."
   FEMA is currently mobilizing personnel, assets and supplies - including ice, water, and food -medical teams, search-and-rescue forces, and mobile emergency response personnel, in addition to air assets from the Department of Defense and Customs and Border Patrol.
