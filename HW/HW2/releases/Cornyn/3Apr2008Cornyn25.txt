SEN. CORNYN MEETS SAN ANGELO CHAMBER MEMBERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, hosted a meeting Thursday in his Washington office with San Angelo Chamber of Commerce members to discuss issues important to the area, including improvements to Goodfellow Air Force Base and increasing water access. 
   "This meeting was a good opportunity to get a first-hand update from San Angelo area leaders on the issues that matter most to the local community," Sen. Cornyn said. "We discussed making sure Goodfellow has the resources necessary to continue playing a vital role in our national security and winning the war on terror, particularly their intelligence training mission."
   Sen. Cornyn added: "We also talked about improving water access, which is certainly an important concern in West Texas. I reiterated my commitment to making sure the needs of the San Angelo community are addressed on the federal level."
   On hand for the meeting were San Angelo Chamber of Commerce President Phil Neighbors, Chamber members and a representative of the City of San Angelo.
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
