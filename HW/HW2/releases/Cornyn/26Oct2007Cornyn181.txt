SEN. CORNYN: INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM EXTENSION VICTORY FOR TAXPAYERS, CONSUMERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding passage of a bill to extend the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce for seven years:  
   "This is a victory for taxpayers and consumers. The Internet is an important economic engine, which also helps users learn and communicate. The tax moratorium has helped the Internet expand and has protected entrepreneurs from burdensome taxes. I hope Congress will act quickly to reach an agreement on the extension and continue to protect the Internet from multiple and discriminatory taxes." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
