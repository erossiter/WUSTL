SEN. CORNYN NAMED TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, received assurances Thursday from Senate leadership that he will be among the group of Senators and Representatives who will work out the differences between the Senate and House immigration bills, the conference committee.  
   "Serving on this panel will allow me a seat at the table to continue crafting solutions to our broken immigration system. My focus will remain on fighting for stronger border security, interior enforcement, employer verification and reform that brings the current illegal population into compliance with the law," Cornyn said. "The differences between the House and Senate bills are significant, and the solutions will be difficult. But it's important to have border state Senators on this committee to help craft a final bill that meets our national security and economic needs." 
   Sen. Cornyn, author of The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act, chaired a series of hearings examining all aspects of the broken immigration system and addressing the need for reform. Through the hearings he conducted a top-to-bottom review of the holes in the system to determine which challenges can be solved with more resources or additional legal tools, and which require more fundamental and comprehensive reforms to current immigration law and other domestic policies. 
   Cornyn has traveled to the border numerous times, discussed the issues with Texans across the state, and chaired numerous hearings to examine these problems.
   Cornyn served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
