SEN. CORNYN: ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE DESERVES SWIFT CONFIRMATION VOTE BY FULL SENATE
  Following today's vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee to advance the nomination of Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Judge Mukasey deserves a swift up-or-down vote by the full Senate.  
   "Throughout his career, Judge Mukasey has proven to be an independent voice for justice and a strong advocate for the United States Constitution. His experience and qualifications as a lawyer, judge, and dedicated advocate for the rule of law are unimpeachable and undeniable. 
   "This position is critical for our continued prosecution of the war on terror. Judge Mukasey's bipartisan support is a recognition that he is the right man for this job and will do what is needed to protect America's national security. 
   "My colleagues in the majority party made clear earlier this year that partisan politics have no place in the Department of Justice - this nomination is an opportunity to put those words into action. 
   "Judge Mukasey's nomination has been delayed now for almost seven weeks. It is imperative that the President has his national security team at full strength and the unnecessary delay of Judge Mukasey's nomination has prevented that. He deserves an immediate up-or-down vote by the full Senate." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
