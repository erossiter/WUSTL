CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT TWO-YEAR HIGH
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Budget Committee and the President's Export Council, made the following statement Tuesday regarding reports that consumer confidence in the U.S. economy is at the highest level in two years:  
   "Though some politicians on the campaign trail continue to preach doom and gloom, Americans aren't buying it-they're buying homes instead.
   "Consumer confidence is at a two-year high, record job numbers show Americans are going back to work, and home-ownership is growing at an impressive pace.
   "So, despite the ceaseless negativity, our economy is strong and will continue to grow. This new consumer confidence rating is further evidence that Americans are optimistic that our country and our economy are on the right track. Maybe someone should tell my colleague from Massachusetts."
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased sharply in June to 101.9, up from 93.1 in May.
