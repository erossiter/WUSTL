SEN. CORNYN: DISASTER DECLARATION WILL BOOST EL PASO RECOVERY
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Tuesday regarding President Bush's federal major disaster declaration for the flood-stricken El Paso area: 
   "I applaud the President for recognizing the urgency of the recovery needs in El Paso following the devastating floods. It's encouraging that the flood-stricken area will receive this much-needed federal assistance. 
   "The El Paso community has been hit hard and it's fitting that the federal government provide this additional relief to help the area make a full and speedy recovery. We'll continue working together-local, state and federal officials-to ensure the people of El Paso have what they need to get back on their feet." 
   Sens. Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison urged President Bush after the flooding to expedite the federal major disaster declaration for the El Paso area to assist in recovery of the devastating floods. And Cornyn has been working with the El Paso community and the Texas congressional delegation to offer assistance at the federal level.

He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
