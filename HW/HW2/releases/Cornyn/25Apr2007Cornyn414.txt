  Sen. John Cornyn today made the following statement regarding the tornados which struck the Eagle Pass area: 
   "My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this natural disaster and with all of the citizens in Eagle Pass. At times like this, it is important that all of us work together to help this community recover and rebuild. Earlier today, I spoke with Eagle Pass Mayor Chad Foster and Maverick County Judge Jose Aranda to make clear that I stand ready to assist in any way possible. In addition, my office has been in contact with FEMA and local officials on the ground to ensure that federal assistance is available if needed. In the hours and days ahead, I will continue to work with the appropriate federal agencies and our state and local officials to ensure that the citizens of Eagle Pass receive the help that they need to get back on their feet following this storm."
