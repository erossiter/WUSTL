SEN. CORNYN: SIX TEXAS COUNTIES DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR TROPICAL STORM ERIN RECOVERY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Wednesday encouraged eligible individuals in six Texas counties to apply for federal aid to help recover from the effects of Tropical Storm Erin, which hit in mid-August. President Bush late yesterday added the following counties to the major disaster declaration making them eligible for the assistance: Bexar, Harris, Jones, Kendall, Medina and Taylor.  
   "This federal assistance is important to provide individuals in these counties much-needed relief," Sen. Cornyn said. "I'll continue working with local officials and the Texas Congressional delegation to make sure all those who need storm recovery assistance get it." 
   Individual assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. 
   In addition to the Individual Assistance program for eligible counties, all counties in Texas can apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. 
   For more information or assistance on applying for aid, call 1-800-621-FEMA or visit: www.fema.gov.
