SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Thursday in advance of the first observance of the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11. Sens. Cornyn and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced and passed a bipartisan resolution in the Senate last June in support of establishing the awareness day, which is intended to be observed annually. 
   "We must continue working to eradicate human trafficking by raising awareness and strengthening efforts to combat it at home and abroad. This remains one of the most pressing human rights concerns of our time.  
   "Americans would be shocked to learn that slavery still exists today--not just in remote parts of the world, but hidden away in communities across our nation. So we need to improve protection of victims, punish the criminals and prevent more innocent people from suffering this fate. 
   "This national awareness day will focus attention on a terrible crime that targets primarily women and children, and will help generate opposition to it." 
   Sen. Cornyn's resolution states: "Congress supports the goals and ideals of observing the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11 of each year and all other efforts to raise awareness of and opposition to human trafficking." 
   There are more than 12 million people in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor and sexual servitude at any given time, according to estimates by the International Labor Organization. 
   Background on Sen. Cornyn's efforts to combat human trafficking 
   * Sen. Cornyn introduced the Stop Trafficking of Persons (STOP) Act, in the 108th Congress, to strengthen U.S. efforts to combat human trafficking. This legislation would specify that governments engaging in human trafficking are not immune from prosecution within the U.S. court system; require the U.S. State Department to include in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report accounts of steps foreign governments are taking to combat the sex tourism industry; and ensure that nongovernmental organizations investigating human trafficking in foreign countries are not required by U.S. law to notify foreign governments or targets of investigative activities. 
   * Sen. Cornyn introduced the End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005, which built on the STOP Act by continuing to combat commercial sex trade activities by targeting the demand for this atrocity. This legislation would protect children from being exploited by these activities, prohibit the operation of sex tours, assist state and local enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial sexual activities, and reduce trafficking in persons. 
   * The Senate unanimously passed a Cornyn-sponsored resolution in 2004 urging all states to adopt legislation that will ensure the full coordination of local, state and federal efforts to fight the scourge of human slavery and sex trafficking. 
   * Provisions in Sen. Cornyn's End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005 were passed, in part, in the reauthorization of the anti-sex trafficking legislation in 2006--the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. 
   * Sen. Cornyn helped pass the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 in the 108th Congress. This legislation would authorize appropriations to combat human trafficking, refined the criteria for judging whether countries meet standards for combating human trafficking, and created a new country "watch list." Since passage of this legislation, countries that, according to the Trafficking in Persons Report, do not cooperate in the fight against trafficking are subject to U.S. sanctions. 
   * In 2005, Sen. Cornyn chaired a hearing titled "Examining U.S. Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery," in his capacity as then-chairman of the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights subcommittee. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
