SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS PARTIAL RE-OPENING OF JAPANESE MARKET TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the President's Export Council, made the following statement Thursday regarding the partial re-opening of Japanese markets to U.S. beef:  
   "This is good news for Texas cattlemen and beef producers. The re-opening of Japanese markets to U.S. beef from cattle 20 months of age and younger is a positive step forward and we'll keep working until we have full market access to Japan. Texas is the leading cattle producing and cattle feeding state, so fully opening the Japanese export market is important to our cattlemen and the economy of our state." 
   Prior to the ban, Texas exported approximately $210 million in beef to Japan. In 2003, the United States exported $1.4 billion worth of beef and beef products to Japan. The ban was temporarily lifted in December 2005 and then reinstated after just one month. 
   Advanced science-based standards allow Texas and the nation to produce the safest beef supply in the world. Sen. Cornyn continues to work for full market access for U.S. beef. He has continually pressed the Japanese Ambassador to the United States to lift the ban, including in a meeting last year, and has been in regular contact with U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following key Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is a member of the President's Export Council and the Congressional Oversight Group on Trade.
