SEN. CORNYN URGES INVESTIGATION OF RECENT DEATHS AT DALLAS VA MEDICAL CENTER
  In a letter sent today to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Dr. James Peake, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, strongly urged the VA to fully investigate a recent string of apparent suicides by veterans who received psychiatric treatment at the Dallas VA Medical Center. As reported by the Dallas Morning News this morning, a fourth suicide has led the hospital to temporarily close its psychiatric ward. 
   The text of Senator Cornyn's letter to Secretary Peake is as follows:
   Dear Secretary Peake:
   I am extremely troubled by recent reports of the apparent suicides of four Texas veterans who received psychiatric treatment at the Dallas VA Medical Center. The two most recent deaths occurred on the grounds of the Medical Center. In late January, two other veterans reportedly took their own lives after being released from the VA psychiatric unit.
   I strongly urge the department to fully investigate this string of tragic deaths and request that my staff be briefed on the results as soon as the investigation is complete. We have a solemn obligation to determine whether the VA system failed these veterans and what actions need to be taken to correct any flaws in the system. Our nation's veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure our safety and defend the freedoms we hold dear. These men and women deserve the best medical care America has to offer. As you would agree, we must not tolerate anything less.
   I look forward to your prompt response on this matter.
   Sincerely,
  John Cornyn
  United States Senator
