SEN. CORNYN JOINS COLLEAGUES TO ANNOUNCE PLAN FOR EFFECTIVE, WORKABLE HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured, joined colleagues Wednesday in announcing a plan to achieve effective, workable healthcare solutions. Cornyn addressed the Senate to discuss the proposals, which will increase accessible and dependable healthcare and strengthen the safety nets in our healthcare system.  
   "The task force recommendations are a common sense effort to make sure we are good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, while ensuring that individuals with limited incomes do not have their access to healthcare limited. We need to ensure that people without insurance can have access to dependable healthcare when they need it." 
   Cornyn added: "Some people without health insurance have chosen, for better or worse, to buy their healthcare more directly. Yet, there are many other Americans who are uninsured not out of choice, but because they lack the economic means. Our task force proposals will help them." 
   The task force was appointed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and is chaired by Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). The recommendations are the product of a six-month effort to better define the problems, review existing proposals, and develop effective, workable solutions. 
   Healthcare costs are increasing faster than any other basic service in the nation. There are an estimated 21 million Americans uninsured for more than one year. The safety net of care for uninsured and low-income individuals, especially community hospitals and neighborhood health centers, is pressed to the limit, so the task force is proposing needed relief. 
   "Another key mission of the task force has been working to increase access and lower costs by ending medical lawsuit abuse and passing real reform. And we are promoting individual responsibility by highlighting the importance of preventive care and wellness programs. Helping the uninsured maintain a healthy lifestyle today is a lot cheaper than treating them in the emergency room tomorrow," Cornyn said. 
   Below are effective, workable solutions the task force is recommending to improve access and dependability of healthcare: 
   * Increase the number of neighborhood-based Community Health Centers by 225, providing new funding for these important centers to cover an additional 500,000 people where they live and work, regardless of their ability to pay.
   * Improve access to specialty care, allowing physician specialists to claim a tax deduction when they provide care for patients referred from safety net providers.
   * Make prescription drugs more affordable and available for those in the safety net by extending the federal $340 billion discount pricing program to additional providers, and freeing eligible providers to use multiple pharmacies.
   * Create a way for religious-sponsored health systems, some of our most successful institutions, to qualify as federally funded health centers. 
   * Require projections of the number of uninsured patients who will be served by a new clinic, to give priority treatment to the facilities that will help those most in need.
   "These proposals are designed to ensure that our commitment to health care access and quality is strengthened to deal with the challenge of the uninsured," Cornyn said. "There are other steps we must take, as well. In particular, we must pass comprehensive medical lawsuit abuse reform to increase access to care and lower healthcare costs. And, as we move forward, we must ensure that our health care safety net is never in question for those who truly need it."
