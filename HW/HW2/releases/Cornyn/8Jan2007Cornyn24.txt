SEN. CORNYN MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ON WAR ON TERROR, IRAQ
  Following a meeting with President Bush and a small group of Senators at the White House today, Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding the war on terror and Iraq:  
   "With a new Congress in place, it's more clear than ever that both parties must work together to support our troops and aggressively prosecute the war on terror. I commend the President for doing his part and reaching out to Senators in both parties to find common ground.
   "All of us want our troops to come home as soon as possible, but our military strategy must be based on clear national security considerations. Iraq is the central front in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism. If we abandon that nation today, we risk the very same situation that gave rise to the Taliban in Afghanistan and one that created a safe harbor for terrorists like al-Qaeda to plan attacks against our people. 
   "In today's meeting the President gave us a broad summary of his plans for moving forward with a strategy for victory in Iraq. I look forward to hearing additional detail when he addresses the nation Wednesday night."
