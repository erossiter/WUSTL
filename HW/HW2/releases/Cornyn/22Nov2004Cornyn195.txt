SEN. CORNYN SECURES FUNDING FOR SAN ANTONIO PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER
  The Senate passed the conference report to the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY 2005 late Saturday evening.  
 Included in the funding bill was $1 million requested by Sen. John Cornyn to help establish a regional pediatric cardiovascular services program in San Antonio dedicated to the treatment of children with congenital heart problems. The bill passed by a vote of 65-30. 
   CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health Care of San Antonio, in conjunction with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSC-SA) and Bexar County, is establishing the regional program with the goal of improving access through a more efficient, coordinated approach to care. 
   "This funding will help protect the region's children in a more efficient and patient-friendly manner," said Cornyn, who worked with U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and the Texas delegation to secure the funding. "This effort is an important one, and it's encouraging to see the level of cooperation within Bexar County to help make it a reality."
   In particular, the funding will help fund is a cardiac catherization laboratory. Such labs are high tech areas for imaging and monitoring equipment that allow physicians to diagnose and treat congenital heart problems in a minimally invasive manner.
