SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF CUBAN PRESIDENT CASTRO
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Tuesday regarding the announcement of Fidel Castro who is resigning as President of Cuba and commander in chief of Cuba's military: 
   "I hope the resignation of this brutal and heartless dictator expedites the long road back to freedom and democracy for the Cuban people. We must stand arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder, in opposition to oppressive regimes that govern by fear. The American people should unite in solidarity with Cuban-Americans and those in Cuba who seek real change, and not simply replacing one dictator for another. We ought to do everything we possibly can to support them."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
