The "online office" enhances the ability of constituents to contact Sen. Cornyn, receive information about resources available through Congress, and receive news about Senate business. The site also provides information in English and Spanish. 
   "The improved accessibility of my revamped 'online office' will help ensure that I can continue to address the needs of Texans in a timely manner," Cornyn said. "It's important that constituents are able to let their voices be heard and can take advantage of opportunities available through Congress. My new Web site is aimed at achieving these goals."  
   The new Web site features a revised contact information section to facilitate correspondence with Sen. Cornyn and his staff, and improved access to forms and applications of interest to constituents. 
   The site also includes new information and technology features such as an RSS feed, which updates news to constituents' home pages in real-time; expanded audio and video presence, including podcast services; additional ability for constituents to transfer information, such as press releases, from person to person; and improved search capabilities. 
   "I encourage all Texans to visit and take advantage of my new Web site," Cornyn said. "I appreciate hearing from Texans and will continue working hard to address their needs." 
   The Web site includes information on the following items: Academy Nominations; Flag Requests; Congratulatory Letters; Traveling to DC; Texas Tuesday Coffee with Sen. Cornyn; Employment; and Photo Requests. There are also sections that feature biographical information about Sen. Cornyn, available resources, applications for internships and law clerkships, and Sen. Cornyn's position on the issues.
