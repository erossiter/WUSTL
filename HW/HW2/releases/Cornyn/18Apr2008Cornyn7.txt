SEN. CORNYN: TEXAS OFFERS ROAD MAP TO JOB OPPORTUNITY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding the announcement that Texas employers added 13,500 new jobs in March, the most in the nation, and added a total of 213,700 in the past 12 months: 
   "This new report shows that Texas continues to lead the nation in job creation. It is a great testimony to the roadmap Texas offers for job opportunity and economic prosperity. Last year, thirty percent of all new private sector jobs in America were created in Texas.
   "The latest numbers show that the right policies lead to growth. This includes keeping taxes low, allowing free trade, common sense tort reform and a right-to-work policy. There are certainly challenges, but the Texas economy remains resilient. In fact, the President of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank recently said Texas is a 'thriving engine of growth in an otherwise anemic economy.' The new job numbers are another indication that Texans are taking advantage of opportunity and our state continues to serve as an example for strong economic growth."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
