SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON POPE BENEDICT XVI'S U.S. VISIT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement Tuesday regarding Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United States: 
   "Pope Benedict XVI's visit to America is an occasion of great joy for Catholics across Texas. As an eloquent voice for peace, justice and hope, the Pope challenges us to bring light to others in our daily lives. His powerful defense of the most vulnerable among us inspires men and women to look beyond themselves, and is a reminder of the foundation for any just society. I join Texas Catholics-indeed all Christians, and people of faith and good will-in welcoming his visit."
