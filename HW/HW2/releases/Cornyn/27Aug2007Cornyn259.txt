SEN. CORNYN HIGHLIGHTS JOB TRAINING AT CENTER FOR WORKPLACE LEARNING IN GRAYSON COUNTY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn was in Denison on Monday, August 27 to highlight the importance of job training partnerships at the Center for Workplace Learning (CWL). Sen. Cornyn delivered remarks, met with trainees and toured the center. He has a strong record of supporting efforts to expand job opportunities on the local level and make Texas and America more competitive through education and job training.  
   The Center for Workplace Learning is a non-profit partnership between Grayson County College, Workforce Texoma, the Sherman Economic Development Corporation, and the Denison Development Alliance. CWL, through this collaboration, provides workforce training and professional development for area residents. 
   Sen. Cornyn also visited the Center for Workplace Learning in 2004. In addition, he convened a summit in Austin last year to focus on workforce partnerships--collaborations between community colleges and local employers (public-private partnerships) designed to equip employees with new skills or help them transition to better careers. 
   Sen. Cornyn co-sponsored bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate last month to expand American job opportunities and competitiveness by bolstering education in math, science and technology - the America COMPETES Act (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science).
