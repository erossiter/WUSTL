SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding Religious Freedom Day. President Bush proclaimed January 16, 2008 as Religious Freedom Day to call Americans "to reflect on the great blessing of religious liberty." President Bush issued the proclamation from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  
   "In recent years, there has been increasing hostility toward religious expression in the public square in America, particularly among some courts. Public expression of faith is one of the freedoms most cherished by our Founding Fathers. Americans of all faith traditions have the right and freedom to exercise their religious beliefs openly and to celebrate collectively those beliefs. 
   "In addition, America's commitment to religious liberty should be a beacon to those around the world who are persecuted for their faith. Interestingly, President Bush reminded Americans of our constitutional commitment to religious freedom while visiting a nation that has earned a place among the worst-of-the-worst when it comes to religious freedom. As Americans celebrate our own freedom of religion, we should remember the many people who are denied this basic human right by repressive regimes." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
