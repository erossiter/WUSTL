SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF U.S.-INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT
  Sen. John Cornyn, Co-chair of the Senate U.S. India Caucus, today made the following statement regarding Senate passage of S. 3709, the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement: 
   "India is a key ally of the United States in the global war on terror. Passage of this critical legislation will not only advance our strategic relationship with India, but will strengthen our national security by bringing India into the mainstream of nuclear non-proliferation efforts. As Secretary Rice has noted, our relationship with India will be one of the 'most important partnerships the United States will have in the 21st century,' and with the Senate's passage of this agreement, we are continuing to move forward in a positive and responsible manner. This legislation is a win-win for the United States and India." 
   The U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement was announced by President Bush and Prime Minister Singh in New Delhi last March. It states that India will separate its military and civilian nuclear programs, making its civilian nuclear program almost completely transparent. Civilian facilities left under the program will be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency oversight.
