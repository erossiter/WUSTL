UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS TO LOWEST LEVEL IN NEARLY THREE YEARS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding the Labor Department's latest figures that show 11 straight months of job growth and the unemployment rate at its lowest level in nearly three years:  
   "These positive numbers, coupled with the 1.5 million new jobs created in the last year, show the economy continues its solid recovery. While some on the campaign trail will surely try to spin the numbers as a sign of doom and gloom, that can't change 11 straight months of job growth, including 10,000 new manufacturing jobs, and the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest level in nearly three years. "Also, consumer confidence has reached its highest point in two years and homeownership is at record highs. However, we can't let up and will continue striving to make sure that every American who wants to work can get a job." 
   The Labor Department reported 11 straight months of job growth, with the economy adding 32,000 new jobs in July. The unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level since 0ctober 2001, down to 5.5% - below the average in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
