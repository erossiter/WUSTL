EL PASO TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT
  The U.S. Senate completed its work on funding bills for FY 2005 over the weekend, and included in the funding package was $300,000 to upgrade communications equipment for the City of El Paso's first responders.  
 The funding was requested on the city's behalf by Sen. John Cornyn.
   In order for El Paso's first responders to effectively communicate between departments during an emergency, upgrades are needed to the decade-old interoperable communications system. The current communications system suffers from blind spots and prevents local, state and federal security and safety personnel from using uninterrupted radio communications. The blackout spots pose a dual security and safety risk for agencies in the region. 
   "Through discussions with first responders around our state, it has become clear that the ability to communicate effectively in an emergency is a top priority," said Sen. Cornyn, who worked with U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and the Texas delegation to secure the funding. "This funding is a concrete step toward making the citizens of El Paso safer and better prepared for emergencies."
   Cornyn, who will be in El Paso next Tuesday, said that the funding will help with city-identified upgrades to communications equipment, including such items as microwave, radio and phone frequencies for adequate public safety and security from related local, state and federal agencies. 
   Sen. Cornyn has held roundtables with first responders in cities and towns across the state, including Houston, Dallas, Sherman, Waco, Lubbock, Midland-Odessa and Beaumont, to discuss local emergency preparedness as part of an ongoing effort to familiarize himself with and highlight the security needs in Texas hometowns. The first responder roundtables provided communities the opportunity to express their needs and concerns directly to Sen. Cornyn.
