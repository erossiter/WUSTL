SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS SUCCESSFUL SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Saturday following the successful launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery: 
   "I applaud NASA and the team at Johnson Space Center for their successful launch which I'm sure will be an important confidence builder for future missions. It's important for NASA to press on as we continue to explore space, and develop technology that will benefit mankind.
   "This is important for all of us as a nation-for our aspirations and our desire to remain a nation of innovators and pioneers. This also serves as an inspiration for young men and women, boys and girls in school who, perhaps, aspire to follow the brave examples of these pioneers into space."
   Sen. Cornyn recently introduced a bill, S. 3238, to create a commemorative coin recognizing the 50th anniversary, in 2008, of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). 
   The bill directs the U.S. Mint to design coins that will be emblematic of the 50 years of exemplary and unparalleled achievements of NASA and JPL.
