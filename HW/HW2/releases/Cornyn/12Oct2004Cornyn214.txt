CAPITOL POLICE, DHS SAY NO SPECIFIC THREAT TO CAPITOL
 following statement:
   Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding potential threats to the U.S. Capitol, and concerns raised by a Senate colleague: 
   "Though the threat is always higher in D.C. than it is in Minneapolis or Mexia, I know of no specific threat that would cause me to shut down the office. Neither the Capitol Police or the Department of Homeland Security are recommending a retreat at this time, nor did any of the security briefings I have attended with my fellow Senators in recent weeks. Our office is open for business."
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights, and is the only former judge on the committee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
