BIN LADEN TAPE MADE ON THE RUN, NOT FROM SAFE HAVEN
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, made the following statement Friday regarding reports of a new taped message from Osama bin Laden: 
   "Osama bin Laden said in his tape that countries that do not attack them, will not be attacked. This is a false promise, one echoed by those with a September 10th mentality. Al Qaeda can not dictate our actions, and President Bush has made clear that we will not stop pursuing terrorists and their sponsors wherever they may be. We will not rely on promises from terrorists; we will hunt them down around the world so that we don't have to fight them here.
   "This tape also makes one thing perfectly clear: Osama bin Laden is gone from his safe haven, and because of that, America and her allies are now safer. Thanks to coalition efforts, Osama bin Laden didn't make the tape from a safe haven in Afghanistan, instead, he's on the run. No amount of tapes there, or critics here, will change that.
   "With bin Laden gone, the Afghan people held a free and fair election for the first time ever; two thirds of known al Qaeda leadership has been killed or captured; and Democracy has replaced tyranny and terror. We are winning the war on terror, and we will finish the job."
   Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has visited every active duty military installation in Texas and meets regularly with community groups from military areas in his Washington office.
