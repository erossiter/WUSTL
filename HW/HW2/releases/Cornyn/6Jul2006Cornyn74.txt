TEXAS RECEIVES CRITICAL SECURITY FUNDING
  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded the State of Texas over $7.6 million in security infrastructure grant programs, Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, announced Thursday. DHS awarded over $7.3 million throughout the state under the 2006 Buffer Protection Zone Area and $300,000 to Houston as part of the 2006 Transit Security Grant Program. 
   A total of $7,377,700 was allocated for the state of Texas under the 2006 Buffer Zone Protection Program (BZPP). The BZPP is designed to protect critical infrastructure from acts of terror by implementing preventive and protective measures that make it difficult for terrorists to launch attacks within the vicinity of these areas. Funds are used at the state and local levels to build security and risk-management capabilities.
   DHS also awarded $300,000 to the City of Houston under the 2006 Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP). The TSGP protects the nation's most critical transit infrastructure, including heavy, light, and commuter rail, and intra-city bus and ferry systems. The program funding will be used to bolster security on the Houston ferry. 
   Texas is also eligible for, but has not received, funding under other DHS infrastructure programs, including the Port Security Grant Program, the Intra-city Bus Security Grant Program, the Intra-city Passenger Rail Program and the Trucking Security Program. 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
