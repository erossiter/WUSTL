SENATE CONFIRMS BIVINS TO BE AMBASSADOR TO SWEDEN
  The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed the nomination of Amarillo native, Teel Bivins, on Friday to be the new U.S. Ambassador to Sweden.  
 Bivins, 56, was nominated by President Bush on December 1, 2003. He will replace Ambassador Charles A. Heimbold, Jr.
   "Teel knows there is much to be done to press our national interests in Stockholm, and I am confident he will hit the ground running," U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said. "Sweden is a long way from Amarillo, but Teel is the right man for the job."
   Cornyn added: "The cooperation of peaceful, democratic countries like Sweden is vital to our international security and free trade. Texas companies, and Texas workers, know this better than anyone else-they've exported $153 million in goods to Sweden last year alone."
   The U.S. has close economic relations with Sweden. For example, Swedish telecommunications company, Ericsson, has their North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. Ford Motor Company owns Volvo and other American companies have invested in computer, telecommunications, manufacturing and health care companies in Sweden. Sweden is also an important destination for American exporters.
   Sweden is currently considering Texas as the site for their next U.S. consulate office.
   Cornyn and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison introduced Bivins during his confirmation hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee in March of this year.
   In 1997 and in 2003, Senator Bivins was recognized as "Ten Best Legislators" by Texas Monthly magazine, and in 1999 he was named one of the most influential lawmakers in Austin by the Dallas Morning News.
   Before being elected to serve in public office, Bivins worked as a businessman and cattle rancher in Amarillo. He graduated from Tulane University and earned his law degree from Southern Methodist University.
