SENATE CONFIRMS BOYLE FOR JUDGESHIP
  The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously approved the federal judicial nomination of current U.S. Attorney Jane Boyle to be the U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Texas. Boyle, 49, will be based in Dallas , and replaces retired Judge Jerry L. Buchmeyer. The Northern District's jurisdiction includes 100 counties.  
   "Jane Boyle has remarkable experience and knowledge of the law. She has done an outstanding job as U.S. Attorney in Dallas , and I'm confident that she will continue to serve Texas and the nation with excellence," Cornyn said. "She has garnered the respect of her colleagues, those who work for her, and most notably, she has gained the respect folks from across the political spectrum." 
   U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, along with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, recommended Boyle to President Bush on September 9, 2003. The President nominated Boyle on November 24, 2003 , and she was confirmed by the Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004 . 
   Boyle was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 to be U.S. Attorney for the Northern District after a long and distinguished legal career in Texas . Prior to that selection, she served as U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District for twelve years, earning significant judicial experience in the region. 
   Boyle also worked for a number of years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney for Dallas County. She earned a J.D. degree from Southern Methodist University School of Law in 1981 and graduated with honors from The University of Texas at Austin in 1977. She has been published in numerous legal periodicals, including the Texas Bar Journal. 
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights, and is the only former judge on the committee. He also serves on the Armed Services, Environment and Public Works, and Budget Committees. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
