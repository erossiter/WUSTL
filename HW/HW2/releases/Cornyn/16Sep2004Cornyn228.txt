SEPT. 17-23 CELEBRATES 217TH ANNIVERSARY OF SIGNING OF CONSTITUTION
  "In the summer of 1787, the Founders crafted a document based on the fundamental principle that freedom must be protected against the excessive use of government power, and that liberty can only be preserved through the separation of powers, both between the three branches of the federal government, and between the federal government and the states.  
 Our Constitution ensures that America will always be a nation ruled by laws, not by men. 
   "The Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, which I am honored to chair, has exercised jurisdiction over constitutional issues and constitutional amendments ever since its inception on January 20, 1947.  
   "For more than 200 years, Americans have revered the wisdom and foresight embodied in the Constitution, and it is appropriate to set this week aside to honor it." 
   A joint resolution of Congress on requested that the President proclaim the week of September 17 through September 23 of each year as Constitution Week. As in years past, President Bush will issue the annual Constitution Week proclamation and call on civic, social, educational and governmental leaders to celebrate our Constitution and reaffirm our commitment to the nation.
