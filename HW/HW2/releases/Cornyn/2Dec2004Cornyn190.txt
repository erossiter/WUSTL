SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS CHOICE OF NOMINEE TO LEAD USDA
  Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement Thursday regarding the nomination of Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns to serve as Secretary of Agriculture:  
   "Governor Mike Johanns will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience on food, farming and conservation issues to Washington. His will be an important voice to ensure agriculture is not overlooked or misunderstood, in a city where it all too often is. 
   "Texas agriculture is facing many issues that we will seek to address in the next Congress. The good news is that the existing Farm Bill is working - it has helped farmers by allowing them to plan and operate based on market realities, not based on what government dictates, and it has cost less than expected. But we must work together to find solutions for the problems of BSE and other animal health issues; to strengthen property rights for all our great farms and ranches; and to permanently end the death tax that has attacked family-owned farms, ranches, and businesses. And I'm confident Gov. Johanns will help achieve these goals.
   "As the Governor of the Cornhusker State, he has seen firsthand the challenges of today's agricultural producers as they compete in the global economy. I thank him for his willingness to serve, and will work with him and his team in the stewardship of our resources, ensuring the security and safety of our food supply, creating sound farm policy and growing trade opportunities around the globe."
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the Congressional Oversight Group on Trade which supervises and consults with the U.S. Trade Representative. He also serves on the President's Export Council. Both groups allow Cornyn the opportunity to push for increased opportunities to market Texas agriculture products abroad.
