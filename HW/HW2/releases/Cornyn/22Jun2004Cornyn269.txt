SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS FEMA FUNDING OF BEACH PROTECTION IN SURFSIDE BEACH
  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will grant more than $1.1 million to the City of Surfside, Sen.  
 John Cornyn announced Wednesday. The funding will be used to construct Pro-tec tubes to prevent future beach erosion from storms such as Hurricane Claudette, which devastated the area in July, 2003. 
   Pro-tec tubes are installed along beaches to prevent erosion and protect engineered beaches, critical shoreline and improved property. The tubes are constructed of a material similar to rubber and filled with sand and water. 
   "This funding will greatly assist in protecting local residents and infrastructure from the effects of terrible disasters," Cornyn said. "It's important to provide people a way to protect their homes and their families from serious storms, and I applaud FEMA for seeing this need and funding it. Mitigating now will prevent the need for costly rebuilding later."
   FEMA provides 75 percent of eligible project costs and the remaining 25 percent comes from local resources. Where feasible, recovery efforts incorporate mitigation measures to help protect against possible future flooding.
   "We know that mitigation works. Hurricane Claudette struck the Texas coast nearly one year ago, and this project will help to protect the community," said Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response. "We encourage communities, businesses and residents to take steps now to prevent future flood losses." 
  The federal funds are made available under the FEMA Public Assistance Program. The state of Texas administers the program under which eligible disaster-related costs are reimbursed to government units and certain non-profit organizations providing essential government-like services in the areas of emergency protective measures, debris removal and restoration of public facilities.
