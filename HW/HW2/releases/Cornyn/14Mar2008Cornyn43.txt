SEN. CORNYN: HOUSE SHOULD PASS BIPARTISAN SENATE BILL TO PROTECT AMERICA
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Judiciary committees, made the following statement Friday regarding the House Democrat leaders' inadequate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation: 
   "It is deeply troubling that House Democrat leaders insisted on passing a partisan bill that undermines our national security. They had ample opportunity to approve bipartisan Senate-passed legislation that enjoyed majority support in the House.
   "Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the Senate-passed terrorist surveillance bill is critical to keeping our troops and citizens safe. But it has become clear that House Democrat leaders would rather cater to their left-wing base and trial lawyers than give our troops and intelligence professionals the terrorist-tracking tools they need."
