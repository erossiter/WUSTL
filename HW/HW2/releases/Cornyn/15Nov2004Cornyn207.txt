SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON COLIN POWELL
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the President's Export Council, made the following statement Monday regarding Secretary of State Colin Powell: 
   "Colin Powell has devoted his life to the service of his country. In his most recent role as Secretary of State, he was a powerful voice for American ideals on the world stage in a time of historic challenge. I'm confident the President will choose a successor that understands, as Sec. Powell does, the need to maintain continuity in the goal of spreading liberty in regions long untouched by freedom, and the role of diplomacy in the fight to eradicate terror.
   "I join the nation in thanking Sec. Powell for his service, and I wish the entire Powell family all the best for the future."
