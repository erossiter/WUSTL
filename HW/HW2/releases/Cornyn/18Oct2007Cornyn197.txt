SEN. CORNYN SUPPORTS $5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR PREVENTION OF STAPH-SUPERBUG
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today voted in favor of $5 million in emergency funding that would help efforts to stop the spread of a drug-resistant superbug, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), that has already claimed the life of a Virginia student and has infected students in other schools across the country. As of today, school districts in at least six states have reported students infected with MRSA.  
   MRSA, which does not respond to penicillin and other antibiotics, can be spread by skin-to-skin contact or by sharing an item used by an infected person. Texas health officials believe the number of cases of MRSA is increasing in the state. 
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week that MRSA infections are a growing, major public health problem, and that it is more widespread than previously calculated. 
   "Today's emergency funding is a necessary, initial step in combating the spread of this dangerous superbug," Sen. Cornyn said. "In addition to research and medical funding, we must each do our part to increase awareness and educate our family members, neighbors, and classmates on ways to prevent the spread of MRSA. 
   "I will continue to look for ways to keep Texas schools and communities safe from this deadly bug, and I encourage all Texans to stay vigilant and follow the recommended prevention steps." 
   The Texas Department of State Health Services issued new guidelines Wednesday for preventing the spread of MRSA in common locations such as high school athletic departments, child-care centers, college dorms, and gyms. The primary recommendation is regular hand-washing with soap and water, for at least 15 seconds.
