SEN. CORNYN ANNOUNCES $1.55 MILLION FOR EQUIPMENT, TRAINING FOR TEXAS FIRST RESPONDERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn announced Thursday that fire and police departments across Texas will receive $1,545,083 in federal funding for equipment and training to enhance first responder capabilities throughout Texas and the nation. The funding comes through the Department of Homeland Security's Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP).
   "First responders serve on the front lines every day to keep our communities safe," Sen. Cornyn said. "This funding will provide additional equipment and training to help assure they have the resources needed to do their jobs." 
   CEDAP provides funding to smaller communities and rural areas for technology, equipment, training and assistance for first responders. This includes communications interoperability equipment, information sharing technology, chemical detection devices, sensors and personal protective equipment.
   Sen. Cornyn has held roundtables with emergency first responders across the state as part of his ongoing effort to highlight security needs in Texas hometowns. The events provide communities the opportunity to express their needs and concerns directly to Sen. Cornyn.
