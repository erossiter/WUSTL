SEN. CORNYN: IRVING SELECTION FOR U.S. BLACKBERRY HEADQUARTERS INDICATION OF TEXAS' ECONOMIC STRENGTH
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today issued the following statement regarding the announcement that Research in Motion (RIM), the creator of the BlackBerry, has chosen Irving to serve as its U.S. headquarters. The new facility is expected to create 1,000 new jobs in Irving.  
   "The selection of Irving as the U.S. headquarters for Research in Motion is welcome news for the surrounding communities. This is another indication that Texas leads the nation when it comes to creating job opportunities. The Dallas-Fort Worth area is an excellent choice for this new facility. It is a technology hub, a leader in economic growth and home to one of the nation's most skilled workforces. 
   "Our state continues to show its economic strength by attracting new businesses and development. Texas reported the largest job increase in the nation for October, and our unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is the lowest level in more than 30 years. I remain committed to working for lower taxes and providing incentives for Texas business owners to expand and create jobs."
