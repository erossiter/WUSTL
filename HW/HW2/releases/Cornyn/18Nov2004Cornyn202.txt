SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN COMMENT ON SELECTION OF SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN
  Texas' Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn issued the following joint statement today following the announcement that Sen.  
 Specter has issued a public commitment of support for the President's judicial nominees. He has committed to expeditiously move every one of President Bush's judicial nominees to the Senate floor for an up or down confirmation vote, and in January will be the next Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: 
   "One unmistakable lesson of the last election was the absolute need to put the people's business ahead of political gridlock. No issue better illustrated that unacceptable partisan gridlock than the unprecedented filibuster of judicial nominees. 
   "This week, we talked at length with Sen. Specter about how he would carry out the responsibilities of Judiciary Committee chairman. We now also have his statement in which he promises he will expeditiously move every one of President Bush's judicial nominees to the Senate floor for an up or down confirmation vote. We appreciate Sen. Specter's commitment, and we intend to hold him to it. 
   "For years, we have argued that the filibuster of judicial nominees was unconstitutional and unacceptable. As recent elections have shown, the American people overwhelmingly agree with that view. As we move forward, we are determined to end this practice and return the Senate to its traditional roots in providing the President of the United States speedy advice and consent on nominations."
