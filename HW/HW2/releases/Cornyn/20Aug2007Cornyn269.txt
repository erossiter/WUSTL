SEN. CORNYN: EXPANDING HARLINGEN VA FACILITY GOOD NEWS IN SHORT-TERM, BUT WE MUST CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD NEW HOSPITAL FOR SOUTH TEXAS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement today regarding the results of a recent study conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs that looked at efforts to improve veterans' health care in the Rio Grande Valley. The VA study calls for increasing the current VA health facility space in Harlingen from 11,700 square feet to nearly 160,000 square feet by 2010.  
   "This study gives voice to what many in South Texas have known for far too long which is that the current level of access to quality health care for our veterans is absolutely unacceptable. The federal government needs to take action. 
   "Expanding the current VA health facility in Harlingen is good news and an important step to address this problem in the short-term. However, it should not be the last step or a final answer for the long-term. Our veterans in South Texas have risked their lives to preserve our freedom and democracy. They deserve access to top health care at a first-rate facility that provides them with the same deep commitment that they provided to our nation over these many years.
   "So while I applaud the results of this study and will work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the funding is provided, I will continue to make sure the federal government fully meets the inpatient hospital needs of South Texas veterans. The federal government must remain focused on the long-term by providing for the over 100,000 veterans in South Texas who deserve a new health care facility in the region." 
  Background: 
   On July 20th Senator Cornyn introduced the South Texas Veterans Access to Care Act of 2007, S. 1838. This is a Senate companion bill to similar legislation introduced in the U.S. House in January by U.S. Reps. Ortiz, Hinojosa, Doggett and Cuellar.
