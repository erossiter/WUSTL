SEN. CORNYN SECURES FUNDING FOR LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
  The Senate has passed the conference report to the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY 2005, which includes $1 million requested by Sen.  
 John Cornyn to improve the levees along more than three miles of the Rio Grande near the Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge. 
   "This funding will improve the levees on the Rio Grande to help keep area residents safe from flooding and protect their homes and property from damage," said Cornyn, who worked with U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and the Texas delegation to secure the funding. "This is an important effort, and it's encouraging to see the level of cooperation within the local community that helped make it a reality."
   The funding is included in the budget for the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), and addresses weaknesses that the Commission has previously identified in the levee system. Under the plan, levees will be raised three to four feet through most of the stretch that is being improved. 
   In addition, the low approach to the Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge and the low spot in the levee adjacent to the old Pharr/San Juan Pump will be repaired. Levee work will entail both the reinforcement of existing earthen levees and the construction of concrete retaining walls. 
   Work on the project is expected to be divided into three phases: pre-design, design and construction. The project is scheduled to be complete by March, 2007.
