SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION COURT DECISION
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Tuesday regarding the decision by a federal judge in San Francisco that said the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is unconstitutional:  
   "It's discouraging that this judge would substitute her will for that of Congress and the American people. We've expected that this fight would go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and I think that's where it's heading. I'm afraid that this decision is the first step in what is going to be a long judicial process. 
   "The barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion has no place in our society. And I'm committed to continue building a culture that respects and protects every human life, from conception to natural death." 
   Sen. Cornyn is a co-sponsor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, S. 3, which prohibits all partial-birth abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother. President Bush signed the legislation last year, following passage by the Senate.
