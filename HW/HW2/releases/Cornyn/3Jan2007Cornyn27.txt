SEN. CORNYN: CONGRESS MUST WORK TOGETHER ON CRITICAL ISSUES FACING NATION
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Wednesday regarding President Bush's meeting with his Cabinet and as the 110th Congress prepares to convene:  
   "There are a number of very important issues facing the Congress and the nation, and it's my hope that both parties can work together in a bipartisan manner on our common goals. In particular, Congress must work to maintain the strong economic growth that has been created in the last several years. This includes making the President's tax relief permanent, reforming mandatory spending and changing the way Congress spends the people's money. 
   "In doing so, I believe we should make the process as transparent as possible so the American people can better see how their money is being spent and how the government is working on their behalf. I've long sought to bring more Texas sunshine to Washington. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and I intend to pursue open government legislation, to improve public disclosure and make the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) more effective.
   "We must repair our broken immigration system and restore respect for our laws. In a post-9/11 world, we need to know who is coming into our country and why. This broken system is affecting our economy, families, and eroding traditional respect for the rule of law. This situation will only deteriorate if Congress fails to act.
   "Finally, bipartisanship must include Iraq and the war on terror. Protecting the American people is our first responsibility. We all want the troops home as soon as possible, but our military strategy in Iraq must be based on clear national security considerations. We owe it to all Americans to establish.
