SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday regarding the annual National Day of Prayer: 
   "Prayer is an important part of our American heritage. The annual National Day of Prayer is an opportunity to ask that God's hand be on our nation and sustain us through all our endeavors. We also pray for unity in compassion, comfort for those who mourn, aid for those who are sick, and justice for those who do evil.
   "On this National Day of Prayer, it's especially important that we ask the Almighty to protect and guide the men and women who are serving bravely on behalf of our security and our freedom, and remember those who have lost their lives in defense of our country. We should also be grateful for the many gifts in our lives and the freedom and prosperity we enjoy."
   In 1952, Congress passed a joint resolution that President Truman signed, declaring an annual national day of prayer. In 1988, the law was amended and signed by President Reagan, permanently setting the day as the first Thursday of every May. Each year, the president signs a proclamation, encouraging all Americans to pray on this day.
