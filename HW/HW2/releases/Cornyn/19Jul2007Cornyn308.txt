SEN. CORNYN SEEKS INTERIM RELIEF FOR AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
  Building on his efforts to protect U.S. competitiveness, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, ranking Republican on the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, today introduced an amendment to the Higher Education Reconciliation, currently under consideration by the Senate, which would strengthen employer access to skilled employees. 
   "A key part of the American economy is our ability to innovate. Yet, today, our country's technology companies are facing an impending crisis which requires critical interim relief," U.S. Sen. Cornyn said today. "USCIS's announcement this year that the cap for H-1B workers was met in just one day, coupled with the recent July announcement that employment-based visas were no longer available for those with advanced degrees, makes clear that industry needs interim relief today until we can return to comprehensive immigration reform. This amendment will go a long way to help out businesses that are the life-blood of the U.S. economy and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it."
   Specifically, the Cornyn Amendment would allow the Department of State and DHS to "recapture" unused employment-based visas. This is not an increase in employment-based numbers but rather, a direction for the agencies to use all the visa numbers that are available today. These visa numbers will be distributed to nurses and physical therapists and aliens with extraordinary ability, advanced degrees, and needed skills. In addition, the Cornyn Amendment also includes a one-time H-1B increase of 115,000 (up from the 65,000) for FY 2008 only.
