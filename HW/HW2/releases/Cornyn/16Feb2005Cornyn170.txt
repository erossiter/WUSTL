SENS. CORNYN, LEAHY INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO PROMOTE OPENNESS IN GOVERNMENT
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation on Wednesday to achieve meaningful reforms to federal government information laws, most notably the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (FOIA). The bipartisan Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005 (OPEN Government Act) is aimed at substantially enhancing and expanding the accessibility, accountability, and openness of the federal government. Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), the committee's senior Democrat, is the bill's co-sponsor. The legislation is supported by groups from across the political spectrum, from ACLU to the Heritage Foundation. More information is available at http://cornyn.senate.gov/FOIA.
   "This reform legislation was created from the belief that FOIA establishes a presumption of openness," said Cornyn, who in 2001 was presented with the James Madison Award for his efforts to promote open government by the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. " Open government is one of the most basic requirements of any healthy democracy. It allows for taxpayers to see where their money is going; it permits the honest exchange of information that ensures government accountability; and it upholds the ideal that government never rules without the consent of the governed." 
   "This bill advances one of the most fundamental rights of Americans, the public's right to know what its government is doing," said Leahy, who has been a longtime champion of FOIA in Congress. Leahy sponsored the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments, which updated FOIA for the Internet age, and in 1996 he was installed in the Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame. 
   "Access to public information in a timely and effective manner is a vital piece of our democratic system of checks and balances that promotes accountability and imbues trust," said Leahy. "FOIA represents the foundation of our modern open government laws and this bill builds on that by updating its protections to include new technologies and refining the process to reduce delays and encourage accessibility." 
   The Cornyn-Leahy legislation is not just pro-openness, pro-accountability, and pro-accessibility - it's also pro-Internet. It includes a hotline enabling citizens to track their requests, including Internet tracking, and grants privileged FOIA fees for bloggers and writers for Internet outlets, providing the same status as traditional media. 
   The last time Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade ago, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has not convened an oversight hearing on compliance issues since April 30, 1992. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which shares jurisdiction over federal government information, has not held a FOIA oversight hearing since 1980. 
   "Congress must close loopholes, help requestors obtain timely responses to requests, provide strong incentives for agencies to act on requests in a timely manner, and provide FOIA officials the tools they need to ensure the openness of our government for the people it represents," Cornyn said. "Achieving the true consent of the governed requires informed consent, and such consent is possible only with an open and accessible government." 
   Cornyn said that America's national security should never take a back seat, but that it shouldn't be used as a barrier against informed consent either. He cited a broad consensus that the federal government over-classifies, with many documents placed beyond public view "without real justification." He called for a system of classification that "strikes the right balance between the need to classify documents in our national interest and security, and our national values of open government." 
   The OPEN Government Act contains more than a dozen substantive provisions, designed to achieve the following four objectives: 
   * Strengthen FOIA and close loopholes 
   * Help FOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their requests 
   * Ensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on FOIA requests in a timely manner 
   * Provide FOIA officials with all of the tools they need to ensure that our government remains open and accessible 
   STRENGTHEN FOIA AND CLOSE LOOPHOLES 
   * Ensure that FOIA applies when agency recordkeeping functions are outsourced 
   * Establish a new open government impact statement, by requiring that any future Congressional attempt to create a new FOIA exemption be expressly stated within the text of the legislation 
   * Impose annual reporting requirement on usage of the DHS disclosure exemption for critical infrastructure information 
   * Protect access to FOIA fee waivers for legitimate journalists, regardless of institutional association - including bloggers and other Internet-based journalists 
   * Provide reliable reporting of FOIA performance, by requiring agencies to distinguish between first person requests for personal information and other kinds of requests 
   HELP FOIA REQUESTORS OBTAIN TIMELY RESPONSES 
   * Establish FOIA hotline services, either by telephone or on the Internet, to enable requestors to track the status of their requests 
   * Create a new FOIA ombudsman, located at the Administrative Conference of the United States, to review agency FOIA compliance and provide alternatives to litigation 
   * Authorize reasonable recovery of attorney fees when litigation is inevitable 
   ENSURE THAT AGENCIES HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES TO ACT ON FOIA REQUESTS IN TIMELY FASHION 
   * Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action by ensuring that the 20-day statutory clock runs immediately upon the receipt of the request 
   * Impose real consequences on federal agencies for missing statutory deadlines 
   * Enhance authority of the Office of Special Counsel to take disciplinary action against government officials who arbitrarily and capriciously deny disclosure 
   * Strengthen reporting requirements on FOIA compliance to identify agencies plagued by excessive delay, and to identify excessive delays in fee status determinations 
   PROVIDE FOIA OFFICIALS WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT REMAINS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE 
   * Improve personnel policies for FOIA officials to enhance agency FOIA performance 
   * Examine the need for FOIA awareness training for federal employees 
   * Determine appropriate funding levels needed to ensure agency FOIA compliance
