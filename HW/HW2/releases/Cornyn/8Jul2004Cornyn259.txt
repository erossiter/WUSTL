SEN. CORNYN: TERRORIST THREAT WILL NOT DISRUPT DEMOCRACY
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, made the following statement Thursday regarding an announcement by Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge on terrorist threats facing our nation:  
   "Secretary Ridge was exactly right when he said that terrorists 'hold the mistaken belief that their attacks will have an impact on America's resolve.' 
   "Ridge's announcement is a reminder of the need to stay strong and stay vigilant. The war on terror isn't just law enforcement anymore - we are at war, and we will continue to go after terrorists wherever they may hide. 
   "President Bush's strong leadership in the war on terrorism is helping to keep the American people safe. And I commend the administration for their efforts to eradicate the threat of al Qaeda and to keep Congress and the public informed."
