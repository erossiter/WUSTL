SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF 9-11
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, made the following statement regarding the three-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11: 
   "Three years ago, September 11 forced us to realize that the terrorist foe we had been fighting on the margin for years sought a more deadly goal than we ever suspected. They do not just seek victory over America. They seek the extermination of our unity, our culture, and our liberty - everything that makes the free world what it is today.  
   "Under President Bush's leadership, we have confronted this evil for what it is, and we have employed our best weapon in this cause: the power of liberty. At this moment, all around the world, our brave men and women in uniform are battling the terrorist threat. 
   "The terrorists have flocked to battle us as coalition forces liberated Iraq and Afghanistan, because they realize that their dark ideology of hate will not - and cannot - survive the spreading light of freedom. We must continue to give our forces all the support they need, and while our enemies began this fight on their terms - we will finish it on ours.
   "None of us asked for this task - we cannot erase 9/11, and as much as our hearts desire it, we cannot change the past. But I also know that this charge has now fallen to us, in this time, for this generation, and we must and will win.
   "So let us mourn the losses of September 11 - let us comfort our neighbors and our friends - and then let us return to the mission at hand, resolute in our cause, and by our labor ensure that our children will grow up in a just, free and peaceful world."
