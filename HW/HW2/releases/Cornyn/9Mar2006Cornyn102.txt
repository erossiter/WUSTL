TEXAS POSTS LARGE JOB GAINS IN PAST YEAR
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Small Business, Joint Economic and Budget Committees, applauded the new state job figures released Thursday, saying "Texas continues to lead when it comes to expanding economic opportunity."  
   Texas posted the third largest job gains in the nation for January and 2005. The Department of Labor reports that the state saw a net increase of 269,800 jobs in 2005. Texas added 13,400 jobs to the nonfarm payrolls in January.
   "The latest jobs figures released are an encouraging sign that the economy in Texas continues to grow," Cornyn said. "But we still have improvements to make in some parts of the state. We'll keep working to ensure that every Texan who wants a job can find a job. I'm confident that our state's strong business-friendly climate will continue to attract jobs and ensure that hardworking people can thrive."
   The state unemployment rate also dropped to five percent in January. Nationwide figures for February will be released on Friday morning.
