SEN. CORNYN HONORS LIFE, LEGACY OF LADY JOHNSON
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today issued the following statement in memoriam of former First Lady Claudia Alta Taylor Johnson:  
   "Today, Texas mourns the loss of one of her finest citizens. I don't know anyone who didn't love Lady Bird Johnson. She was a great Texas treasure. A devoted wife, loving mother, successful businesswoman and a tireless public servant--Lady Bird Johnson's distinguished legacy will be cherished for generations to come. She was a pioneer in defining the modern role of the First Lady, offering advice, ideas and support for causes that enabled every citizen of our land. Spurred by her love for this country and the environment, she devoted herself to preserving and enhancing our nation's natural beauty. 
   "From the wildflowers that canvass the Texas countryside to the trees and rich vegetation that line our nation's highways, Lady Bird Johnson's imprint on our state and country will continue to live on as a source of pride for all Americans. 
   "My prayers go out to the Johnson family as they grieve the loss of this remarkable Texan and inspiring woman."
