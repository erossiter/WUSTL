SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT OPPOSING LARGEST TAX INCREASE PROPOSAL IN HISTORY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement this evening regarding his opposition to the Democratic Majority's FY 2009 federal budget proposal - the centerpiece of which is a $1.2 trillion tax hike on 43 million American families, the largest tax hike proposal in U.S. history: 
   "Across Texas and America, working families are facing rising gas prices, high health care costs, and an uncertain economic future. They make sacrifices and tough economic decisions day in and day out in order to live within their means. The United States Congress should be held to no less of a standard with its budget.
   "Yet, instead of putting more money back in the pockets of working Americans or making the tough decisions that will secure Social Security and Medicare for future generations, this budget does the exact opposite. It raises taxes by more than $2,300 on 43 million families, it increases federal spending by $210 billion and it grows the federal debt by $2 trillion.
   "Quite simply, the family budget of millions of Texans would be harmed if Congress were to make this majority party's budget law. It is filled with gimmicks that are focused on the next election, and not the next generation. It is a classic tax-and-spend proposal that symbolizes why Washington is broken and needs to be fixed."
   The Senate is scheduled to vote on final passage of the FY 2009 budget proposal later this evening.
