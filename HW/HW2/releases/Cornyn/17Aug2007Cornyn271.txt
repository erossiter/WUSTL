SEN. CORNYN CONGRATULATES LUBBOCK WESTERN ALL-STARS AS THEY HEAD TO LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today congratulated the Lubbock Western All-Stars who have won their way to compete in the 2007 Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. With an 18-0 record, the team of 11- and 12-year-old boys recently won the Southwest Regional Tournament in Waco and will now play their first Little League World Series game Saturday. The All-Stars are one of eight U.S. teams playing in the series.  
   "With a perfect season behind them, the Lubbock Western All-Stars are representing Lubbock and the great state of Texas in the Little League World Series, and I know I'm not the only one who is proud to call these young men fellow Texans," Sen. Cornyn said. 
   "The Lubbock Western All-Stars have worked their way to the top because they're team players, hard workers, and talented athletes. I congratulate the Lubbock Western All-Stars on their success and wish them all the best as they take on the Coon Rapids from Minnesota this weekend." 
   The Lubbock Western All-Stars play their first Little League World Series game at 5:00 p.m. Saturday against the Coon Rapids Little League of Minnesota. The game will be aired on ESPN.
