SENATE PANEL APPROVES SEN. CORNYN-BACKED BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON TERRORISM HOAXES
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding unanimous Judiciary Committee approval of the bipartisan Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act, S. 735, which Sen. Cornyn co-sponsors:  
   "It is encouraging to see this bill to crack down on terrorist hoaxes move forward. This legislation will ensure those guilty of these crimes are brought to justice. By imposing harsher penalties for hoaxes, we will be able to focus our resources more effectively on real terrorist threats.
   "In a post-9/11 world, it is critical that members of our law enforcement community have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs. This bill takes additional steps to provide that. I urge my colleagues to support it in the full Senate." 
   The Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act expands current law to include punishment for hoaxes involving any terrorist offense on the U.S. Code's official list of terrorist offenses. The bill increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes regarding the death or injury of a U.S. soldier during wartime. The bill will also help first responders receive reimbursement.
