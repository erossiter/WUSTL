IF KOFI HAD HIS WAY, SADDAM WOULD STILL BE IN POWER
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding comments by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that the liberation of Iraq did not conform to the United Nations charter: 
   "As we saw with the 17 U.N. resolutions that Saddam Hussein ignored, madmen, dictators and terrorists aren't swayed by idle threats. Genocide and terror can't be stopped with platitudes and lawyers; the oppressed aren't liberated by idle threats. 
   "Kofi Annan, and those on the campaign trail who share this view, must explain the inconvenient fact that if they had their way, Saddam would still be in power, mass graves would still be growing in size, and tens of millions of newly liberated people would still be under the boot of a brutal dictator."
   Cornyn, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, convened a hearing in June 2003 to discuss the issues facing the reconstruction of Iraq and the role the U.S. can and should play in ensuring a stable government and protection of human rights. 
   He joined eight Senate colleagues in July 2003 for an Armed Services Committee trip to Iraq and the surrounding region. The delegation met with U.S. and Iraqi officials involved in the reconstruction effort. While there, Cornyn visited with troops and received briefings from coalition forces and humanitarian organizations.
