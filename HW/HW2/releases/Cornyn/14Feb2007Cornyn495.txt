SEN. CORNYN HOSTS MEETING WITH U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES
  Sen. John Cornyn, Ranking Member of the Immigration, Refugees and Border Security subcommittee, hosted a meeting in his Capitol Hill office today with UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Antonio Guterres, in order to discuss Guterres' recent trips to Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Lebanon.  
   "This was an important opportunity to discuss the challenges facing organizations that aim to protect refugees in these regions," Sen. Cornyn said. "One often overlooked problem is the issue of Iraqi refugees and the strain this is placing on the resources of its neighbors in Jordan and Syria. Both the United States and the UNCHR play an important role in addressing this issue and it was important to hear the UNHCR's perspective. The refugee issue and its consequences is particularly important as some in Washington push for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq." 
   "Finally, I remain very concerned with the situation in Darfur and we discussed the ongoing effort to place a UN peacekeeping force into that region to stabilize the situation. I welcomed today's meeting and I will continue to work with international organizations and others to ensure the rights and well-being of international refugees," Sen. Cornyn concluded. 
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, is in charge of international efforts to protect refugees worldwide; it aims to protect the rights and to ensure the well-being of refugees. UNHCR is located in 116 countries and has assisted an estimated 50 million refugees over the last five decades.
