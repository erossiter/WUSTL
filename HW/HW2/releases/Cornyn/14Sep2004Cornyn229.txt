REP. GOSS NOMINATION SHOULD NOT FACE PARTISAN OBSTRUCTION
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding the nomination of Rep.  
 Porter Goss (R-Fla.) to be the new Director of Central Intelligence: 
   "This is no time to leave the CIA without the leadership it needs, and I would encourage my colleagues to set partisan agendas aside, carefully consider this nomination, and allow for an expedited up-or-down vote on this well-qualified candidate. 
   "Now is the time to build on the important reforms we've made over the past three years by considering and quickly moving on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We must move this nomination forward and continue working together, with the leadership of the President, to do everything possible to secure our nation from current and future threats." 
   As part of a comprehensive anti-terror legislation package introduced in July, Cornyn introduced the Prevention of Terrorist Access to Destructive Weapons Act of 2004 (S. 2664), and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Prohibition Improvement Act (S. 2665). Among other protections, S. 2664 deters the unlawful possession and use of terror-related weapons, including MANPADS, 'dirty bombs' and biological weapons. The aim of S. 2665 is to expand federal criminal prohibitions against the use and proliferation of WMD, and tighten existing law.
