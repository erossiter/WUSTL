SENATE CONTINUES DEBATE ON MARRIAGE
  Sen. John Cornyn, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, addressed the Senate on Monday afternoon as the debate on the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) and the importance of defending traditional marriage continues.  
   Sen. Cornyn has continually played a leading role in the marriage debate. He has chaired three hearings on marriage in the Senate, including one last September on whether the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act is in peril, another in March on whether an amendment to the Constitution is necessary, and the third hearing, also in March, addressed specific amendment language that has been introduced in the Senate. 
   At the September hearing, legal experts predicted that there would be lawsuits across the country challenging all traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional, including the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Legal experts and senators across the political spectrum agree that the only way for Congress to reverse an incorrect federal constitutional ruling is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights, and is the only former judge on the Judiciary Committee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
