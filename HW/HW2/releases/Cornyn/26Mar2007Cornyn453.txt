SEN. CORNYN PARTICIPATES IN HIGH-LEVEL SIMULATION OF GLOBAL ENERGY CRISIS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today joined several other Members of Congress and senior Executive Branch and military officials for a simulated exercise at the National Defense University that focused on how the U.S. would respond to a prolonged energy crisis.  
   "Protecting America's energy supply is one of our most important national security priorities. As we work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we must also constantly remain prepared in the event that our energy supply is threatened," Senator Cornyn said today. "Today's exercise brought together officials from key branches of government, including the Departments of State and Energy and the military, to simulate and prepare for that very scenario. This experience was helpful as we shape policies that will help our nation gain energy independence, ensure an adequate supply and prepare for potential threats to America's national security." 
   Organized by the Institute for Strategic Studies at National Defense University, these crisis simulation exercises are designed to provide senior government officials with new insights into the complexity of policymaking in the current global security environment. While other simulation exercises rely on former decision-makers to fill seats, these exercises are distinctive in that all participants are current officials and incumbent Members of Congress, giving attendees a chance to exchange ideas and points of view with other current policy experts and lawmakers. Today's exercise focused on the impact of hypothetical events such as man-made energy shortfalls and the impact of foreign government decision-making on U.S. and global energy and economies.
