SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
  Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement Monday regarding Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman: 
   "As Secretary of Agriculture, Ann Veneman helped to ensure the safety and security of our food supply and led the way on conservation issues and stewardship of our resources.
   "I thank Secretary Veneman for her service, and will work alongside her successor to continue investing in Texas's farm and ranch communities and to improve our trade and agricultural policies for future generations."
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the Congressional Oversight Group on Trade which supervises and consults with the U.S. Trade Representative. He also serves on the President's Export Council. Both groups allow Cornyn the opportunity to push for increased opportunities to market Texas agriculture products abroad.
