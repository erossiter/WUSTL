SEN. CORNYN: CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY BILL TO HELP KEEP CHILDREN SAFE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday following passage of the Consumer Product Safety bill. Sen. Cornyn voted for the legislation: 
   "I am encouraged the Senate acted to strengthen our consumer product safety network. In particular, this legislation will make imported toys and other products safer for children. It will enhance government scrutiny of both foreign and domestic products and provide federal inspectors the flexibility to keep pace with modern safety standards.
   "There are critical improvements that must still be made to the bill. For example, I offered an amendment to prevent the possibility for lawsuit abuse. That amendment was rejected, and I hope this area will be strengthened in the House-Senate reconciliation."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
