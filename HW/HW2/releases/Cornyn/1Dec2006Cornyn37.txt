SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON WACO VA MEDICAL CENTER
Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement today regarding the status of the Waco VA Medical Center: 
 "I am proud to announce that the efforts of the Waco VA Task Force, the Texas Congressional delegation, and countless others in the Waco area to keep the doors of the VA Medical Center open have been successful. I have confirmed that the Department of Veterans Affairs will make an official announcement this afternoon, and I could not be more pleased for our Veterans and all those who depend on this critical facility. 
 "As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as the proud son of a Veteran, I have been - and will always be - personally dedicated to looking out for the interests of all of our military personnel, both active and retired. We must always remember that our own freedom was not won without cost. It was bought and paid for with the sacrifices of previous generations. Their health care and welfare should always be top priorities for us. 
 "The campaign to keep this facility open in the face of a very real threat to close its doors was truly a team effort, and I would like to thank everyone who was involved. This is great news for Waco and for our Veterans." 
 Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following key Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
