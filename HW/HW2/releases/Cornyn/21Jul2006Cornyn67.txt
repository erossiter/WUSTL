SEN. CORNYN HAILS NEW EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Joint Economic and Budget Committees, made the following statement regarding the June employment report released this morning by the U.S. Department of Labor:  
   "This continued good news on the economic front demonstrates that the low tax and pro-growth policies advanced by President Bush and the Republican-led Congress are working. With over 30,000 news jobs created in Texas in just the last month, and roughly 260,000 new jobs created over the last year, Texas workers and businesses are benefiting from our state's strong entrepreneurial spirit and government policies that allow that spirit to grow. 
   "Yet again, today's report makes clear that members of Congress must work together to prevent a tax increase on our working families and small businesses. With our economy moving forward, new jobs being created and small businesses flourishing, the last thing we should do is raise taxes. Yet, that is precisely what will happen unless a small group of Senate Democrats cease their obstructionist tactics and help us make the tax relief permanent. Our low tax, pro-growth policies are working - let's not adopt policies that would take Americans backward."
