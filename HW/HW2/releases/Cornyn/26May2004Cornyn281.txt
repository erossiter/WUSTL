'IT DOESN'T TAKE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO KNOW THE WORLD IS SAFER,' SEN. CORNYN SAYS
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Wednesday regarding comments by Amnesty International Executive Director William F. Schulz that the U.S.-led war against terror "is making the world more dangerous": 
   "Critics of the war on terror don't have to look far to see that the world is a safer place thanks to U.S. and international efforts to find and remove terrorists around the globe. And it doesn't take an annual report to know that the world is safer without the Taliban running Afghanistan; with Hussein and his thugs in a prison rather than a palace; and with Osama bin Laden working from a cave rather than from the safeguards of state sponsorship. And for the millions of Iraqis and Afghans who have been liberated, the world is undoubtedly a much safer place.
   "Fighting the war on terror has made the world safer than it was on 9/11, continuing the efforts against terror will make it safer still. We will not return to the days where terrorists received a pass, and operated without threat to their existence and operations. We will press forward, and we will win."
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
