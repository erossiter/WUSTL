  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday regarding Temple being selected as the location for a new Gulf States Toyota multi-million dollar Vehicle Processing Center, in partnership with the City of Temple and the Temple Economic Development Corporation. It is expected to create hundreds of new jobs in the area.  
   "This new facility is a great step forward for Central Texas. It will increase job opportunities for working families in the area and boost the local economy. Gulf States Toyota's willingness to invest in this new vehicle processing center and capitalize on the talents in Central Texas is just another indication of the strength of Texas for doing business and the excellence of our workforce. I commend leaders of the City of Temple and the Temple Economic Development Corporation for their efforts to secure this facility, and will continue doing all I can in the Senate to expand job opportunities for Texans."
