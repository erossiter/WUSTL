SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF ETHICS REFORM BILL
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and a strong advocate of open government, made the following statement Thursday regarding final Senate passage of the Ethics Reform Bill, S. 1:  
   "This legislation is an important step forward in reforming the way we do business in Washington. It's a strong victory for fiscal responsibility and open, honest government, which the American people have demanded and deserve. 
   "The most immediate benefit will be increased transparency in the legislative process. Our founders understood a free society could not exist without informed citizens and an open, accessible government. This legislation will allow the average citizen to better understand how their tax dollars are being spent and to know that their lawmakers will be held accountable with greater public scrutiny. 
   "This is a strong, bipartisan accomplishment and a positive start for the 110th Congress. There are many important issues that remain ahead, but today's vote should strengthen the trust that the American people have placed in their elected officials. I was proud to support it and will continue to work to bring more Texas sunshine to our nation's capital."
