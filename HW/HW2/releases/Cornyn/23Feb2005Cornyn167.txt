SEN. CORNYN GIVES KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT VALLEY WATER SUMMIT
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) gave the keynote address at the 2005 Valley Water Summit in Harlingen on Wednesday calling for a "shared vision" to address the state's water needs. The day-long summit, held at the Marine Military Academy, brought together federal, state and local officials to discuss enhancing water supplies in the region.  
   "The long term needs of the Valley and the people of Texas are growing," Sen. Cornyn said at the Summit. "And as Texas continues to grow and prosper, it will only add increased pressure on our limited water supplies. In order to maintain our quality of life, fill the needs of our communities, and strengthen our economic competitiveness, everyone must work together to address our vast water needs."
   The day-long Valley Water Summit program included general sessions designed to provide background information on water issues and projects in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and work sessions focused on specific technologies and processes and their potential for enhancing water supplies in the region.
   "Communities must be able to utilize all possible tools - from employing alternative methods and varied technologies to creating partnerships within regions and watersheds," Cornyn said. "I also believe the Corps of Engineers must have all the tools they need, enabling them to work more effectively with local partners to identify water needs and strategies for meeting these needs. We should give the Corps a mission in supporting state and local leadership of integrated water management. By sharing data and water analysis among the federal, state, and local sectors, we can improve water management in this country and save money at all levels of government."
   Also at the Summit, Sen. Cornyn said an issue that must be dealt with at a federal level is continued meetings with top Mexican officials to make sure that they fully comply with the 1944 treaty. He has continually urged the Mexican government to repay its entire water debt owed to Texas. 
   "Unfortunately, Mexico consistently has failed to meet its requirements under the treaty. I've continually worked to help Texas obtain its fair share of water, both as Attorney General now in the Senate," Cornyn said. "Whether it's by diplomatic negotiation, legal measures or some other pressure, we cannot rest until we obtain the much-needed water, which is so important for our jobs, our economy and our way of life."
   Sen. Cornyn reiterated his commitment to continue working with all parties to help Texas meet the State Water Plan. "This long-term effort will take cooperation at all levels - local, state, and federal - and I believe it is my job to ensure that the federal government is a worthwhile partner in this effort," Cornyn said. 
   "I don't doubt that water will become one of the leading economic drivers of the 21st Century. So I believe that we must take steps to ensure that the interests of regions and local communities take the first priority in developing projects that the environment can sustain and the people need. When it comes to water issues, I hope that we can work together toward a common vision, resolving our conflicts, and balancing the needs of the citizens, the producers, and the land."
   In 2004, Sen. Cornyn received the Friend of Rural Water award from the Texas Rural Water Association.
