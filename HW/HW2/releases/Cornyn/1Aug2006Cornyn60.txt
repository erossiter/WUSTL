SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF BILL TO PROVIDE TEXAS REVENUE SHARE FROM NEW ENERGY EXPLORATION
  Sen. John Cornyn applauded Senate passage Tuesday of a bipartisan bill that will allow Texas to share revenue from new offshore exploration of oil and gas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and increase our domestic energy production. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, S. 3711, passed by a vote of 71-25. Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor.
   "This bill is an important step toward increasing domestic energy production and reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources," Cornyn said. "Texas is an energy leader and our state will play a strong role in this new offshore oil and gas exploration. I'm encouraged that we will benefit from a reasonable and fair revenue sharing program to help coastal states."  
   The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for energy development and would give Texas a share of that revenue and a portion of revenue from new leases in the entire Gulf of Mexico after 2017. 
   "This bill is absolutely critical to our ability to reduce our dependence on foreign energy to both improve our national security and improve the prospects for our economy," Cornyn said. He added that it is possible for us to explore and develop our domestic energy supplies in an environmentally sound way. 
   It is estimated that the new lease will yield an estimated 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
   "Congress can pass a lot of laws," Cornyn said. "We can repeal a lot of laws. But the one law we cannot repeal is the law of supply and demand. Demand continues to grow, and this bill brings a solution by increasing supply." 
   The revenue will benefit communities along the Texas Gulf Coast to address critical coastal issues, including erosion, habitat restoration and energy infrastructure.
   The bill's main sponsor is Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.). It is co-sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and others.

   What will the Texas share of revenue be? 
   The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for exploration. The new leases would begin between 100 and 125 miles south of the Alabama / Florida border and total approximately eight million acres: 
   * 37.5 percent of all revenues from these areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico will be shared with states based upon proximity to the production area. Because of our proximity, Texas would be eligible for 10 percent of these shared revenues. 
   * 12.5 percent of revenues provided to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for grants to states to pay 50 percent of the cost of parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational and conservation opportunities. 
   All new leases issued in the Gulf of Mexico after 2017:
   * 37.5 percent of revenues from new leases in the entire Gulf of Mexico shared with states based upon proximity to the production areas. Texas would share approximately 21 percent of these funds. 
   * 12.5 percent of revenues provided to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for grants to states to pay 50 percent of the cost of parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational and conservation opportunities. 
   How will Texas be able to use the revenue? 
   The uses are similar to those outlined in the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) that was passed in the 2005 Energy Bill. Those include:
   * Projects and activities for the conservation, protection, or restoration of coastal areas, including wetland. 
   * Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources. 
   * Planning assistance and the administrative costs of complying with this section. 
   * Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal or comprehensive conservation management plan. 
   * Mitigation of the impact of Outer Continental Shelf activities through funding or onshore infrastructure projects and public service needs.
