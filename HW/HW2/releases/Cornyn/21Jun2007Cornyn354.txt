SEN. CORNYN: GALVESTON CHANNEL DEEPENING STRENGTHENS PORTS' POSITION AS NATIONAL LEADER
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday regarding the signing of the agreement between the Port of Galveston and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on deepening the Galveston Channel. Sen. Cornyn joined port officials, federal officials and other members of the Texas congressional delegation at a Capitol Hill signing ceremony of the agreement:  
   "This agreement with the Corps of Engineers will help ensure that both the Galveston and Houston ports remain among our state's most important economic and commercial assets. This project will allow both ports to continue growing, while also protecting the environment. 
   "Texas's ports are a large and underappreciated part of the nation's economy. They play host to every kind of industry, including international shipping and fishing, scientific research and commercial transport. The use of our ports reduces highway congestion, improves air quality and expands economic growth throughout the state. In short, the nation needs Texas ports. 
   "This project is an important step in keeping Galveston, Houston, and Texas as a whole, competitive with the rest of the country. Growing port capacity means increased industry, revenue and jobs for Texans. I know that as this project proceeds, Galveston and Houston will further strengthen their positions among the nation's primary ports."
