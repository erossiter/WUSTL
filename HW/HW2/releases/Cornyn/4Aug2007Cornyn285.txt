SEN. CORNYN TO PARTICIPATE IN ROUND ROCK EXPRESS TRIBUTE TO FT. HOOD TROOPS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, visited Round Rock Texas on Saturday Aug. 4, 2007 to participate in the Williamson County Soldier Appreciation Day events at Dell Diamond Baseball Stadium. Sen. Cornyn joined U.S. Rep. John Carter and other community leaders and military supporters in honoring Ft. Hood troops and their families. Many of the troops in attendance have recently returned from serving in Iraq. Sen. Cornyn will help serve dinner to the soldiers and their families, give brief remarks, and attend the Round Rock Express vs. Colorado Springs Sky Sox game following dinner.  
   "It's a privilege every time I have the opportunity to visit with the brave men and women who are serving our country, and thank them and their families," Sen. Cornyn said. "I hope the Ft. Hood troops who attend the Williamson County Soldier Appreciation Day will be encouraged by the show of support and enjoy a night off with families, friends and Texans who stand united behind them and are grateful for their brave service."
