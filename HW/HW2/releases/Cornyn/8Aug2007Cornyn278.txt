SEN. CORNYN: TEXAS' CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT 'A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES'
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement commending the excellent work of the Texas Attorney General's Child Support Division which was recognized today as the nation's best child support program by the National Child Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA).  
   "I congratulate the Texas Attorney General's office on being named the best child support program in the nation. Attorney General Abbott, Deputy AG Alicia Key, and the entire staff of the Child Support Division work hard every day for children in Texas. They are committed to improving the well-being of our children and strengthening their prospects for a better and brighter future. 
   "Texas' performance stands as a model for other states, and I'm proud to have been part of it as a former Attorney General. It is my hope that Congress will recognize Texas' outstanding work and provide other states the means to excel in their own right.  
   "The Child Support Protection Act of 2007, which I have sponsored along with Sen. Jay Rockefeller, will ensure that the federal government maintains its commitment to supporting state programs that succeed. When federal and state governments partner together, children in Texas, and around the country, are better off."
