SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON TRANSFER OF POWER TO IRAQ
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Monday regarding the transfer of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority to the Iraqis:  
   "The handover today is an important landmark. While it is not going to be easy going forward, we know at last that the Iraqi people now have the responsibility and the power to make their own future and to live out their own dreams.
   "By completing the handover ahead of schedule, the coalition and Iraqi government have defied the attempts of terrorists to disrupt this process. Now the Iraqi people are continuing on the path to a free and secure nation. 
   "We're already seeing Iraqi life beginning to return to normal with the building of hospitals and schools, young women going back to school - many for the first time - and all Iraqis enjoying the liberty that they never knew, or even dreamed of, under the terrible dictator Saddam Hussein."
   "Unfortunately, we're still hearing the chatter of those who are trying to score political points through pessimism. The truth is we're making great progress in Iraq. Things are improving, but we have to stay the course, not let the terrorists weaken our resolve. And I expect life for the Iraqi people to continually get better in the weeks and months to come."
   Cornyn, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, convened a hearing last year to discuss the issues facing the reconstruction of Iraq and the role the U.S. can and should play in ensuring a stable government and protection of human rights. 
   He joined eight Senate colleagues in early July for an Armed Services Committee trip to Iraq and the surrounding region. The delegation met with U.S. and Iraqi officials involved in the reconstruction effort. While there, Cornyn visited with Texas troops and received briefings from coalition forces and humanitarian organizations.
