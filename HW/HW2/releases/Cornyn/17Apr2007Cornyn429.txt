SEN. CORNYN: $48.59 MILLION ALLOCATED TO TEXAS FOR COASTAL PROTECTION
  The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) has allocated $48,591,202 to Texas for the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP), Sen. John Cornyn announced Monday. The funding will be used for coastal protection and restoration-including conservation, planning assistance, and infrastructure projects-in relation to offshore energy exploration.  
   The funding was authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It directs the Department of the Interior, through the Minerals Management Service (MMS) program, to distribute $250 million annually in fiscal years 2007-10 to six coastal states that host offshore energy production, including Texas, Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, and Mississippi. 
   The Department of the Interior said that 20 percent, or $48,591,202, of the overall CIAP funding will be available to Texas. Of this total, $31,584,281 is available directly for the state and $17,006,920 is available for the Coastal Political Subdivisions, or specific counties. 
   "The Texas coast is vital to the economy of both the state and the nation. It must be protected," Sen. Cornyn said. "Energy is fundamental to our quality of life and economy in Texas and America. So too is the preservation of our coastal lands and habitats. Through responsible stewardship, we can fulfill our responsibility in both areas-increasing domestic energy supplies without harming our Texas coastline."
   Sen. Cornyn joined several Senate colleagues from coastal states earlier this year in urging the Secretary of the Interior to find an administrative solution to help speed the funding. In addition, in the February 16, 2007 omnibus appropriation funding bill, Congress approved a three percent appropriation of the CIAP funds to be used by MMS to administer the CIAP program.
   "The enactment of the CIAP is the result of years of work to address the unique challenges facing states that host offshore energy production," Sen. Cornyn and others wrote in the letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. "Any delay in the distribution of funds to states will prevent urgent environmental, coastal protection, mitigation and estuary management work from being completed."
   MMS will begin accepting grant applications for the CIAP funding in mid-October 2007. All funds will be disbursed through a grant process. A final plan for at least the first year's funds should be submitted to MMS for approval by July 1, 2008. 
   CIAP includes funding for a comprehensive strategy to protect marine species, coastal wildlife and conservation efforts. Congress passed an additional bill in 2006 providing Gulf States, including Texas, a portion of royalties from offshore energy exploration to support increased efforts to conserve critical coastal habitats and wetlands and to shore up infrastructure and public service needs along their coasts. 
   Texas counties that will receive funds include Brazoria, Calhoun, Chambers, Galveston, Harris, Jackson, Jefferson, Matagorda, Orange, Victoria, Aransas, Kleberg, Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio, Cameron, Kenedy and Willacy.
