SEN. CORNYN: ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO FORT BLISS, FORT HOOD BOOST TEXAS' NATIONAL DEFENSE ROLE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding the Army's decision to send 12,500 additional soldiers to Texas in the coming years. As part of the "Grow the Army" initiative, two new combat brigades and one support brigade will be heading to Fort Bliss and two new support brigades to Fort Hood.  
   "These additional soldiers will strengthen the vital role Texas plays in our national defense. The decision to make Fort Bliss and Fort Hood their homes is another indication that Texas presents ideal conditions for our military. Our level of community support, space and climate for training are second to none. 
   "The new troops and combat units heading to Fort Bliss will enhance an already rapidly expanding post. This dramatic increase will give Fort Bliss a prominent role in maintaining our national security for decades to come. 
   "The influx of new soldiers to Fort Hood will boost the importance of what is already the largest military installation in the free world. 
   "Expanding the size and strength of our Army is critical to America's safety and winning the war on terror. Substantial parts of this growth will occur in Texas. I welcome these troops and will work to provide the support they need."
