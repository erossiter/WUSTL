SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS ACT
  Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement today regarding Senate passage of H.J. Res. 20, the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007.  
   "I supported this flawed appropriations legislation because I could not in good conscience vote to shutdown the government. Yet, my vote comes with deep reservations. The bill funds many important initiatives, such as Veterans' health care, but leaves out a lot of priorities. The $3.1 billion cut in military funding is my biggest concern. Military bases and military families throughout Texas are depending on these funds. It was deeply disappointing that Democrat leadership would not allow amendments to address it in this bill. I'll work to provide the funding as quickly as possible as we head toward a supplemental appropriation bill. We simply must honor our commitment to our military community and provide the funding they need and deserve."
