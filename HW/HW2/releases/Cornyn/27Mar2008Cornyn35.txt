SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW TEXAS JOB NUMBERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding the new Texas job numbers. Texas employers added 13,500 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. 
   "These numbers are evidence that Texas has the right policies to facilitate job opportunities. Lower taxes, less regulation and the right to work are keys to expanding economic growth. We should allow Texans to spend, save and invest their own money. We also need to implement or maintain these policies on a national level. This is the most effective way to create jobs, keep the flow of goods and services moving, and boost the economy."
