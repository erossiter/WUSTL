SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PASSING OF WILLIAM BUCKLEY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Wednesday regarding the death of William F. Buckley:  
   "William F. Buckley was the intellectual inspiration for the modern conservative movement. For more than a half-century, he prodded, and questioned, and amused and inspired millions. His work served to lift up countless Americans. His influence on both policy and history is almost immeasurable. America is safer, stronger and freer thanks to his life. 
   "Mr. Buckley has been honored by President Reagan and countless others for his contributions, and justifiably so. He was the embodiment of "morning in America," the optimistic conviction that our values are enduring and our best years are still ahead. His role in the development of conservative thought was unique, and he can never be replaced." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
