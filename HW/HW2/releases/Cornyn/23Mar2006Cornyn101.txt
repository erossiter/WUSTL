SEN. CORNYN: IMMIGRATION REFORM MUST NOT INCLUDE AMNESTY
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), chairman of the Immigration and Border Security subcommittee, made the following statement Thursday regarding the ongoing work on border security and immigration reform: 
   "I appreciate the President continuing to highlight the importance of this issue."
   "I remain committed to a comprehensive solution to our immigration situation, one that includes additional border security, interior enforcement, and employer accountability. And while our national security requires that we address the 12 million illegal aliens already here, we have to do so without granting them amnesty. The Cornyn-Kyl bill achieves these objectives."
   "It's discouraging that before the debate has even begun in the full Senate, the Democrat leadership is threatening to filibuster any legislation that doesn't include amnesty. This is not the way to improve our national security and keep Americans safe."
   Sens. Cornyn and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) are the authors of The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S.1438). The legislation will strengthen enforcement, bolster border security, and reform immigration laws.
