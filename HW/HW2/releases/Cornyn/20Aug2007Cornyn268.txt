SEN. CORNYN PRESENTS BELATED PURPLE HEART TO PEARLAND VETERAN
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today visited Pearland and presented Korean War veteran Nyles Reed with a belated Purple Heart. Sen. Cornyn was able to ensure the delivery of the medal, after Reed was told by Navy Personnel Command that the Purple Heart medals were out of stock, and that he could re-apply for one or purchase his own at a military supply store for $42. Sen. Cornyn presented the medal at a luncheon of Brazoria County chambers of commerce at the Pearland Lions Club.  
   "More than 50 years ago, on an operating table in Panmunjom, Nyles Reed was offered one of the nation's highest military honors for his brave service on the front lines of the Korean War. Not to be deterred from his mission, Mr. Reed simply said he didn't have the time to worry about a Purple Heart, and instead rushed back to battle. 
   "Today, that 50-year-old offer was accepted, and a brave Texan received the recognition he had long been due. It was my privilege to present the much-deserved Purple Heart to Mr. Reed, and to see the sense of pride it brought to him, his family, and his community. The sacrifice and service of our nation's veterans is a priceless contribution to our country's history and security, and today's presentation was a fitting recognition of the selfless service of one of Texas' finest." 
   Three years ago, Reed decided to look into the status of the Purple Heart he had been offered in 1952, and was told by the military there was no record of the incident. After locating two fellow Marines who provided eye-witness statements confirming the incident, Reed contacted Sen. Cornyn's office, and the Senator was able to help him secure the much-due recognition.
