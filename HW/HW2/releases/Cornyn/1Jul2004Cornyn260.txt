SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRE-TRIAL HEARING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, made the following statement Thursday regarding the pre-trial hearing of Saddam Hussein: 
   "It now appears that Saddam Hussein is one step closer to receiving a fair and public trial, which is in sharp contrast to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens who lie in mass graves and will never receive a trial under his government.
   "This pre-trial hearing is yet another strong indicator that Iraq will now be governed by the rule of law and not by the rule of a tyrant. This is another example for the Iraqi people who will begin to see for themselves what life in a democracy, under a representative government respecting the rule of law, will be like. And this is further evidence of America's intentions, which were not to occupy Iraq, but rather to liberate Iraq and create a free Iraq for generations to come." 
   Cornyn, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, convened a hearing last year to discuss the issues facing the reconstruction of Iraq and the role the U.S. can and should play in ensuring a stable government and protection of human rights. 
   He joined eight Senate colleagues in early July for an Armed Services Committee trip to Iraq and the surrounding region. The delegation met with U.S. and Iraqi officials involved in the reconstruction effort. While there, Cornyn visited with Texas troops and received briefings from coalition forces and humanitarian organizations.
