SEN. CORNYN DISCUSSES DYESS PRIORITIES WITH ABILENE LEADERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today hosted a meeting with Abilene leaders to discuss several issues important to Dyess Air Force Base and the surrounding community. Sen. Cornyn was joined in his Washington office by members of the Abilene Military Affairs Committee (MAC) and the Abilene Chamber of Commerce. Among the priorities they discussed were critical aircraft upgrades, military construction priorities, and existing and future missions for the base.  
   "As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I will continue working to ensure we address the needs of Dyess Air Force Base and the tireless community members who support the base. I assured the members of the Abilene Military Affairs Committee and the Chamber that I will strongly advocate for their funding requests, equipment upgrades, and other priorities. Together, we will further elevate Dyess's respected status and protect the hundreds of jobs on the base's payroll." 
   Sen. Cornyn added, "Just today, I reiterated the importance of upgrading Dyess's C-130 fleet to the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Moseley. These upgrades are essential to ensure the safety of the pilots and the continued advancement of the base. I will also continue to work to secure the necessary resources and support for the signature mission at Dyess-the B-1B bombers. 
   "As our nation's men and women in uniform continue to wage the war against terrorism, it's critical that we bolster the bases and communities, like Dyess and Abilene, that provide them with the tools, equipment and support they depend on to defeat terrorism and defend America." 
   Among the attendees at today's meeting were: 
   * Air Force Col. Bill Ehrie (Retired), former wing commander at Dyess and B-1B pilot 
   * Mike McMahon, head of Abilene Chamber of Commerce and former B-1B pilot 
   * Celia Davis, outgoing chair of Abilene MAC 
   * Jim Webster, incoming chair of Abilene MAC 
   On a related note, Senator Cornyn also met earlier today with General Michael Moseley, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, to discuss Texas military priorities, including future production of the F-22, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, and the C-130 fleet at Dyess. 
   "These air force programs not only provide thousands of Texas jobs, but they are critical components of the U.S. military, present and future. I welcomed the opportunity to meet with General Moseley today and offer my support as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to ensure that these programs continue and that the U.S. Air Force has the tools and resources to defend our nation," Sen. Cornyn said.
