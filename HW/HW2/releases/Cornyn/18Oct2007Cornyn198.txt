SEN. CORNYN: IT'S TIME TO WORK TOGETHER, PASS BIPARTISAN SCHIP BILL
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday regarding the need to reach a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), following the failure of House Democrats to override the President's veto:  
   "Now that the House has predictably voted to uphold the President's veto, it's more important than ever for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a bipartisan, compromise SCHIP bill and send it to the President to sign immediately. 
   "Democrats stalled for weeks to play political games and run partisan attack ads. This program is too important to be used as a political pawn. Low-income children in Texas and across the country are depending on Congress to get the job done. I hope my Democratic colleagues will join us in sitting down, rolling up our sleeves and doing the job that the people have sent the Congress here to do." 
   Sen. Cornyn co-sponsored and voted for a $10 billion expansion of SCHIP. The Kids First alternative he supported provides a 40 percent increase in funding and resources to address the key problem in Texas of outreach and enrollment. 
   Last Thursday, Sen. Cornyn sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging them to reconsider their decision to shutdown negotiations on SCHIP. Senator Cornyn wrote, in part, "If you believe that covering low-income children in Texas and across the country, requires more than the 40 percent funding increase that Republicans have introduced, I am more than willing to work with you to find a reasonable, bipartisan solution. But, reauthorization of SCHIP is too important to be used as a political pawn for campaign purposes."
