SEN. CORNYN RECEIVES ASSURANCES THAT TEXAS WILL RECEIVE EQUITABLE TREATMENT ON CDBG FUNDING DISTRIBUTION
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Tuesday regarding his call with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the $1 billion in unallocated Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding in the supplemental bill, expected to pass on Wednesday:  
   "I spoke with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Alphonso Jackson, on the phone this evening. He assured me that Texas will receive equitable treatment when HUD distributes the $1 billion in unallocated Community Development Block Grants in the supplemental. I'm convinced that Secretary Jackson recognized that Texas suffered a significant amount of damage and loss during the storms and that we deserve a fair shake.
   "I expect the supplemental bill to pass overwhelmingly in the Senate as early as Wednesday, and to be signed into law soon by the President. The Texas delegation will keep working to ensure that our state receives enough funding to meet our recovery needs."
   Congress provided $11.5 billion in CDBG funds for hurricane relief last year. But only $74.5 million under that program, CDBG funds, was allocated to Texas, or less than one percent. In May, Cornyn introduced an amendment that was accepted to the Senate version of the supplemental bill to substantially increase CDBG funding for Texas.
   The CDBG program is a flexible funding source that provides communities with assistance to address a wide range of unique community development needs. 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
