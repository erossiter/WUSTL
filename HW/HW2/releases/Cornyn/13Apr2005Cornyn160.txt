SEN. CORNYN RE-INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN BILL TO ENCOURAGE BETTER HEALTH IN WORKFORCE
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured, re-introduced the bipartisan Workforce Health Improvement Program (WHIP) Act on Wednesday, calling it an important step in encouraging people to live healthier lifestyles. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) is a co-sponsor of the bill.  
   "A physically fit population results in lower health care costs, reduced government spending, fewer illnesses and improved worker productivity," Cornyn said. "It's important to create as many incentives as possible to get Americans up and moving." 
   Cornyn noted that "disease prevention and the promotion of healthier lifestyles offer us an excellent opportunity to begin reversing the steep rise in health care costs we are facing today, while improving quality of life." It is estimated that if all inactive adults engaged in regular exercise, the direct medical costs saved could be more than $76 billion. Better health and wellness would also increase productivity in the workforce which, among other benefits, would have a positive impact on the economy. 
   President Bush, known to exercise regularly, has also voiced his support of good physical fitness: "I know you're a better worker if you exercise on a daily basis. I know you'll help keep the health care costs down in America if you exercise on a daily basis." 
   An inequity in the current tax code allows for businesses to deduct the cost of on-site exercise facilities, which are provided for the benefit of employees on a pre-tax basis. However, if an employer wants or needs to provide an off-site fitness center subsidy, employees who take advantage of that subsidy are taxed on the benefit and the employers bear the associated administrative cost of complying with IRS rules. The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the current tax code to the benefit of many smaller businesses and their employees. By promoting physical activity, reducing obesity and preventing disease, it also would be an important step in reversing the devastating health trend that our country is facing. 
   "Public health experts unanimously agree that active lifestyles result in decreased health care costs, reduced governmental spending, fewer illnesses, and improved worker productivity," Cornyn said. "I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this preventive health and fitness bill." 
   Some of the benefits of further physical activity include: 
   * Reducing the risk of dying prematurely of heart disease
   * Reducing the risk of developing high blood pressure
   * Reducing blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure
   * Reducing the risk of developing colon and other types of cancer
   * Controlling weight 
   * Building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints 
   * Helping senior adults become stronger and better able to move about without falling
   * Reducing feelings of depression and anxiety
