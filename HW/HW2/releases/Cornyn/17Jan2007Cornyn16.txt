SENS. CORNYN, HUTCHISON MEET WITH DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY CHERTOFF, TEXAS BORDER LEADERS
  Sen. John Cornyn, Ranking Member of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, made the following statement Wednesday following his meeting with Texas border leaders, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff: 
   "I was encouraged to hear a strong consensus by all in the meeting that border security is a top priority and a non-negotiable item. It's ultimately a federal responsibility, but obviously has a local impact. So it is only right that local officials have their voices heard, particularly on the issue of a border fence. 
   We must do more to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws. In a post-9/11 world, it's simply unacceptable not to know who is coming into our country and where they are. We also need broader reform of our immigration laws. It's also essential to balance security with legitimate trade and travel, which is so important to the economy of the border region. This remains a top priority for me in the new Congress. 
   This was a productive meeting and I appreciate Secretary Chertoff taking the time to meet with these Texas border leaders. It is good news that the Secretary agreed to visit the border again in the coming months. I'll continue working closely with local officials along the border to ensure their voices are heard as we secure our border and reform our broken immigration system."
