SEN. CORNYN: WE MUST CONTINUE TO TRACK, FIND, REMOVE THESE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS
  Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) nationwide arrests, announced in Houston, of illegal immigrant gang members, pedophiles, violent felons: 
   "These are exactly the kinds of offenders we must prevent from entering our country in the first place. We must continue to track, find and remove these dangerous criminals who have found their way into the U.S. to keep our streets and communities safe. 
   "We cannot have true comprehensive immigration reform until we have serious border security and interior enforcement. The federal government simply must do more, but this is a step toward reassuring the American people that the government is serious about enforcing our immigration laws." 
   Sen. Cornyn was successful in adding an amendment to the pending immigration bill that would prevent felons and repeat offenders from remaining in the country through amnesty. 
   Sen. Cornyn will serve on the conference committee that will reconcile the differences between the House and Senate immigration bills. Sen. Cornyn has played a key role in the Senate immigration reform debate and continues to work to bolster border security and implement comprehensive immigration reform. 
   Cornyn and Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) authored a separate bill titled: The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act (S.1438). The key components of their legislation include enhanced border security and interior enforcement, employer accountability, and reform to bring the current illegal population into compliance with the law.
