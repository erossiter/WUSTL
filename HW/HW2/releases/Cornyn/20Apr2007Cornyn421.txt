SEN. CORNYN ADDRESSES FORT BEND CHAMBER
  Sen. John Cornyn addressed members of the Fort Bend Chamber of Commerce this week in Washington, updating them on several important legislative initiatives, including immigration reform and troop funding. Among those participating in the three-day visit, which concluded Friday, was the President of the Fort Bend Chamber Louis Garvin, and area business leaders. 
   "The Fort Bend Chamber represents a key job-creating engine in the area. I was grateful for the opportunity to discuss issues important to the area and hear their local needs and concerns first-hand," Sen. Cornyn said. "I will continue to work with them and other local officials to make sure their priorities are addressed."
   Sen. Cornyn provided an update on the ongoing effort to implement border security and broader reforms of America's broken immigration system. He said we have taken some needed steps to bolster border security, but we can and must do more. Sen. Cornyn remains actively engaged in working toward an immigration bill this year that would secure our border, reform our broken immigration system and restore respect for U.S. law.
   In addition, Sen. Cornyn renewed his call for the Senate Democrat leadership to end their obstruction of critical funding for the troops. Democrats continue blocking the emergency war supplemental bill by insisting on including an artificial "surrender date" and billions of dollars in unrelated pork projects. Sen. Cornyn said the delay will harm the ability of our commanders on the ground to complete their mission.
   The Fort Bend Chamber has 1,500 business members and aims to serve as a voice and advocate for excellence in business and economic growth in the region.
