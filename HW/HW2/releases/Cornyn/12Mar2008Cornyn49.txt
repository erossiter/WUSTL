SEN. CORNYN SEEKS CRITICAL SAFEGUARD AGAINST FUTURE TAX INCREASES
  Renewing his past efforts to prevent irresponsible tax increases on working families, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, re-introduced legislation in the Senate today that would require a super-majority of the Senate, or 60 votes, to pass any legislation that increases income tax rates on the American people. 
   This legislation, introduced as an amendment to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 budget resolution, mirrors a similar Cornyn-backed measure passed by the Senate last year. Unfortunately, that provision was ultimately stripped-out behind closed doors by the Democratic leadership before Congress voted on the final FY '08 budget resolution.
   "Last year, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved this exact measure by a vote of 63-35. Unfortunately, through subsequent legislative maneuvering this pro-taxpayer provision was stripped from last year's budget. Today, I'm giving the Democratic majority another opportunity to stand on the side of working families and small business owners," Sen. Cornyn said today.
   "Creating a 60-vote threshold is an insurance policy to make sure Congress focuses on eliminating government waste, fraud and abuse and not on the pocketbooks of taxpayers across Texas and across America. Given the current concerns families and small businesses have about the economy, now more than ever we need to make sure people have more of their money to spend and invest as they see fit. I would ask my colleagues once again to support this strong bipartisan protection for American taxpayers," Sen. Cornyn concluded.
