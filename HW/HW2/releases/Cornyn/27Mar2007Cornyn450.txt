SEN. CORNYN HELPS SET MEETING WITH TEXAS BORDER SHERIFFS, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY CHERTOFF
  Sen. John Cornyn, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee, announced today that U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has agreed to meet in Washington with members of the Southwest Border Sheriff's Coalition (SWBSC), which includes several Texas sheriffs. The meeting, which Sen. Cornyn helped arranged, is expected to take place next month.  
   The meeting will focus on issues important to the border region. It is part of Sen. Cornyn's continued efforts to ensure the voices of those at the state and local levels are being heard in Washington. The Southwest Border Sheriff's Coalition unites sheriffs' departments in counties along the border in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California in their efforts to combat crime.
   "Fighting crime, securing our borders and ensuring legitimate trade and travel require strong partnerships throughout government. This meeting will allow those on the front lines to discuss these and other issues directly with Secretary Chertoff. I look forward to meeting with all of them in Washington next month," U.S. Sen. Cornyn said today. 
   Last month, Senator Cornyn hosted a similar meeting in Laredo with Texas border mayors, county judges and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Michael Chertoff. That meeting came as a follow-up to an initial meeting in Washington, D.C. co-hosted by Sens. Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison.
