SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF CAFTA
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Congressional Oversight Group on Trade and the President's Export Council, applauded final passage by the Senate Thursday evening of the implementing legislation for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), H.R. 3045.  
 The bill passed by a vote of 56-44 and now moves to the President for his signature.
   Cornyn said the key free trade accord negotiated between the United States, Central American countries and the Dominican Republic will "grow jobs in Texas by boosting opportunities for exporters and providing additional market access for our products."
   "CAFTA would be a great benefit to the United States and all countries involved," Sen. Cornyn said. "This important accord will grow jobs in the United States, Central America and the Dominican Republic."
   The group of countries includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. It will represent the second-largest export market for the United States in the region. Mexico is the largest, both for the U.S. and Texas.
   "CAFTA will boost opportunities for exporters in the United States and provide additional market access for our products in Central America," Cornyn said. "CAFTA will remove unnecessary barriers to free markets which is in the economic and national security interest of the United States and a prosperous Central America."
   Sen. Cornyn traveled to Central America last year to discuss promoting trade. He serves on the Senate Small Business and Joint Economic Committees, and is the chairman of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship Subcommittee.
