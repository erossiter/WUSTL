SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON UNANIMOUS CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL PETRAEUS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding unanimous Senate confirmation of Lt. General David Petraeus to be General and Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq: 
   "Overwhelming Senate support of General Petraeus's confirmation is an important step on our way forward in Iraq. Now we should make sure he has the resources he says he needs to achieve victory. We must allow General Petraeus and other military leaders a chance to execute and succeed in the new plan, without trying to micro-manage from Capitol Hill. 
   "In fact, it's ironic that many of my Democrat colleagues who voted for General Petraeus today are at the same time vowing to block the troop reinforcements that the General has said he needs to complete the mission. 
   The fact is that the consequences of failure pose a grave threat to our national security and economic interests. I hope in the coming days we can put politics aside and put America's security first."
