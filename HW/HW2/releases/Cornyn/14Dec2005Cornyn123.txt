SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S MOVE TO ENHANCE OPEN GOVERNMENT
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, joined President Bush at the White House Wednesday where the President signed an Executive Order enhancing current Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) policies. Sen. Cornyn, a leading proponent of open government and the author of bipartisan FOIA reform legislation, called the move an "important step toward more sunshine in government."  
   "Open government is one of the most basic requirements of a healthy democracy," Cornyn said. "The default position of our government must be one of openness. If records can be open, they should be open. If good reason exists to keep something closed, it is the government that should bear the burden--not the other way around." 
   Cornyn continued: "The President's directive moves us forward toward strengthening our open government laws and reinforcing our national commitment to freedom of information. This Executive Order affirms that FOIA has provided citizens with important information about the functioning of our government. It directs FOIA officials to reduce agency backlogs, create a process for everyday citizens to track the status of their request, and establishes a protocol for requestors to resolve FOIA disputes short of filing litigation." 
   The President's Executive Order: 
   * Affirms the principle that FOIA is important to our system of open government and a healthy democracy 
   * Creates a FOIA Service Center from which requestors can obtain information on their requests and track request status 
   * Creates a FOIA public liaison who acts as a supervisor of FOIA personnel and is available to resolve disputes between the requestor and the government 
   * Requires each Chief FOIA officer to review its agency's practices, including the use of technology, to set concrete milestones and specific timetables to reduce backlogs and efficiently administer its FOIA responsibilities. 
   In June the Senate passed Cornyn legislation to bring increased sunshine to the federal legislative process, another step toward strengthening government openness. The reform, co-sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), creates additional legislative transparency by requiring that any future legislation containing exemptions to requirements be "stated explicitly within the text of the bill." 
   In addition, Cornyn and Leahy introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005 (OPEN Government Act, S. 394) in February, and a separate bill in March to establish an advisory Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays. Sen. Cornyn chaired a hearing in March that examined the OPEN Government Act. Cornyn was presented with the James Madison Award in 2001 for his efforts as Texas Attorney General to promote open government by the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas.
