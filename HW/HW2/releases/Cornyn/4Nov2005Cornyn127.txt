SENATE CONFIRMS NEW CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF
  The U.S. Senate on Friday unanimously confirmed the nomination of Wan Kim to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ).  
 Kim, who was nominated by President Bush in June, currently serves as U.S. deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and author of the End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005, said Kim is the "right person" to continue the outstanding work of this critical division.
   "Wan Kim is a seasoned criminal prosecutor whose significant trial experience will serve him well as he directs our most important and sometimes difficult civil rights trials," Cornyn said. "It's important to continue the strong tradition of tough enforcement, and remain focused on those priorities that best protect the civil rights of all."
   Cornyn worked closely with Kim's predecessor, Alex Acosta, on fighting the scourge of human trafficking. The DOJ hosted a national training conference last year in Tampa, Fla., entitled "Human Trafficking in the United States: Rescuing Women and Children from Slavery." The conference focused on the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking--the coercion of adults and youth into commercial sexual activity, sexual exploitation, sweatshops, domestic servitude, and other criminal activity--and providing assistance to victims of such brutal crimes. 
   Prior to his service at DOJ, Kim was an assistant U.S. attorney, and was on the staff of U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He received a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University and his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School.
   Cornyn served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
