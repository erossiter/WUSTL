SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS SIGNING OF WRIGHT AMENDMENT LEGISLATION
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement regarding the Wright Amendment legislation which was signed into law by President Bush today. Sen. Cornyn was a co-sponsor of this legislation and worked closely with members of both parties to pass it in the Senate late last month. 
   "Citizens win when competition is allowed to exist and I'm glad to see that this local solution is now the law of the land. It represents a true compromise that was borne from many years of hard work and determination by parties on both sides of this issue. I want to commend everyone who worked to help pass this important legislation and I look forward to seeing the positive impact that it will have on North Texas."
