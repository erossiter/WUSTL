SEN. CORNYN RENEWS CALLS FOR COMMUTATION OF SENTENCES FOR BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS, COMPEAN
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement regarding today's guilty plea deal by Osvaldo Aldrete Davila, the illegal alien drug smuggler shot by Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean. 
   "In my view, this guilty plea opens even more questions than it answers. For example, when did the U.S. Attorney's office first learn that Davila violated the terms of his immunity agreement by engaging in drug smuggling in 2005? Was this purposefully withheld from the jury deliberating the fate of Ramos and Compean?
   "As I said last year, it is incomprehensible to me that an illegal alien drug smuggler was allowed to violate his immunity agreement, perjure himself and be granted a series of unlimited visas to roam free in our country while two border patrol agents were given excessive prison sentences. Unfortunately, because no trial will be held in this case, these and other critical questions remain unanswered.
   "What I do know is that there is a problem with our system of justice when a convicted drug smuggler will receive less time behind bars than the federal agents who attempted to apprehend him. It is clear that the prison sentences for Ramos and Compean do not fit the crime. It is well past time for the President to do the right thing and commute their sentences."
