SEN. CORNYN TO CHAIR SENATE'S EMERGING THREATS PANEL
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been named to chair the panel's Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee in the 109th Congress. Sen. Cornyn will also continue to serve on the Readiness and Management Support subcommittee, which oversees the BRAC process, along with the Strategic Forces subcommittee. Cornyn also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, providing Texas a greater voice on issues of critical importance to the state. 
   "In a post-9/11 world, this subcommittee has taken on even greater importance as we rightly focus our efforts on emerging threats to our nation, and the new weapons that can and are being employed by enemies of freedom around the world," Sen. Cornyn said. "This subcommittee is also responsible for authorizing many of the Pentagon's research and development programs and technology efforts, an area where Texas excels. I will have the opportunity to ensure that when key decisions are made in this area, Texas research facilities and all our anti-terror resources are given fair and appropriate consideration. 
   Cornyn continued: "As chairman of both the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee and the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, I'll look for ways to further strengthen our border and homeland security."
   The Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (ETC) was established in 1999 to provide a focus on the efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to counter new and emerging threats to vital U.S. national security interests. Through hearings and oversight of the relevant DoD and DOE programs and budgets, the subcommittee seeks to identify and ensure a farsighted U.S. Government response to emerging threats including: the proliferation and potential for terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction; international terrorism directed at U.S. interests, both at home and abroad; information warfare; and narco-trafficking. 
   The subcommittee also has oversight of the defense technology base funding, which will provide for the development of the technology necessary for the U.S. military to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. A key element of the subcommittee's responsibilities is the changing role of the U.S. military in the new threat environment, with an examination of emerging operational concepts and non-traditional military operations. In this connection, the subcommittee has oversight responsibility for the Special Operations Command.
   Key areas of jurisdiction of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee:
   * Non proliferation programs 
   * Programs to combat terrorism 
   * Chemical demilitarization 
   * Counterdrug programs 
   * Information Warfare and DoD cybersecurity 
   * Science and technology programs 
   * Special operations programs 
   * Joint experimentation 
   Sen. Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), a member of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, authored legislation last year to deter and prevent the use of Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), 'dirty bombs' and biological weapons. The bill, the Prevention of Terrorist Access to Destructive Weapons Act of 2004, was included in the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Act. Provisions of another Cornyn-authored bill, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Prohibition Improvement Act were also included in the intelligence reform bill, which was signed by the President in December.
   Sen. Cornyn will also continue serving on both the Judiciary and Budget Committees, and was recently named to the Small Business Committee, and the Joint Economic Committee. Before joining the Senate, he served as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
   In addition to his legislative committees, Sen. Cornyn is a Deputy Whip, chairman of the Senate India Caucus, vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs, vice chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and a member of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured, the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force, the Congressional Oversight Group on Trade, and the President's Export Council.
   Sen. Cornyn has traveled to Iraq twice, including a visit in December, to meet with Texas troops and receive updates from U.S. and Iraqi officials on operations there. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he has traveled to all 17 major active duty military installations in Texas.
