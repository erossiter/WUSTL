SEN. CORNYN: NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE DESERVES FAIR HEARING, NOT PARTISAN PREJUDGEMENTS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement today regarding recent comments by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and others criticizing potential nominees to be the next Attorney General:  
   "In many ways, these criticisms echo what the liberal establishment sought to do earlier this week by attacking General Petraeus. They are seeking to poison the well by attacking and undermining an individual before they even have an opportunity to make their case before Congress. 
   "The President has the right to nominate the next Attorney General. That individual deserves a fair hearing and a swift up-or-down vote in the U.S. Senate. This rush to prejudge certain individuals and play politics with this important position is beneath every member of the Senate. The American people are tired of the hyper-partisanship that has been the hallmark of this new Congress. 
   "It's my hope that Senate Democrats will stop playing politics with this critical position and do what is right for our country by working to fill it as soon as possible."
