HHS SECRETARY THOMPSON RESIGNS
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured, made the following statement Friday regarding the resignation of Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services:  
   "As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson has served as a leading voice on critical health care issues, and he helped move America's health care system forward by putting new ideas into practice. Under the President's leadership, he was the driving force behind the much-needed reform of the Medicare system to include a prescription drug benefit, helped lower costs through the use of new technologies, and refocused our health care system toward an emphasis on prevention. I thank Secretary Thompson for his dedicated service, and I pledge to work alongside his successor to help America's health care system adapt to the needs of the future."
   Sen. Cornyn joined colleagues earlier this year in announcing a plan to achieve effective, workable healthcare solutions. The proposals will increase accessible and dependable healthcare and strengthen the safety nets in our healthcare system. 
   The task force was appointed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and is chaired by Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). The recommendations are the product of a six-month effort to better define the problems, review existing proposals, and develop effective, workable solutions. 
   Healthcare costs are increasing faster than any other basic service in the nation. There are an estimated 21 million Americans uninsured for more than one year. The safety net of care for uninsured and low-income individuals, especially community hospitals and neighborhood health centers, is pressed to the limit, so the task force is proposing needed relief.
