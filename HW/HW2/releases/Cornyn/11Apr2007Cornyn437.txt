SEN. CORNYN ENCOURAGES FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO APPLY FOR GRANT FUNDING
  Sen. John Cornyn encouraged Texas fire departments on Wednesday to apply for grant funding available to help purchase firefighting vehicles and safety and rescue equipment, as well as fund training and support operations. Sen. Cornyn offered his assistance to firefighters in the application for the grants, which come through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "This funding will help ensure our first responders--those serving on the front lines of our hometown security--have the resources they need to keep our communities safe," Sen. Cornyn said. "I encourage firefighters to apply for these important funds and will assist throughout the application process."
   The Office of Grants and Training, a component of the DHS Preparedness Directorate, partners with state and local officials to strengthen the capabilities of first responders in addressing emergencies and catastrophic incidents. The program provides a broad array of assistance to America's emergency responders through funding, coordinated training, exercises, equipment acquisition and technical assistance. 
   More than $492 million is available this year to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency management organizations across the nation. 
   Sen. Cornyn has held roundtables with emergency first responders across the state as part of his ongoing effort to highlight security needs in Texas hometowns. The events provide communities the opportunity to express their needs and concerns directly to Sen. Cornyn. 
   The online application form is available on the Web at www.firegrantsupport.com. For more information or assistance with the grant process, please contact John Wyatt in Sen. Cornyn's Washington, D.C. office at 202-224-2934. 
   Fire departments have until May 4, 2007 to complete and submit their applications.
