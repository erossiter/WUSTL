SEN. CORNYN WELCOMES NATIONAL DRUG CZAR'S DALLAS VISIT TO INVESTIGATE SPREAD OF 'CHEESE' HEROIN
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement in advance of tomorrow's visit to the Dallas-Fort Worth area by White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director John P. Walters. Director Walters will meet with state and local officials to discuss the importance of curbing "cheese" heroin use, which is responsible for the death of more than 20 Dallas-area youth in recent years:  
   "This visit by the U.S. Drug Czar is an important step in shedding national light on the dangers of 'cheese' heroin, a highly addictive drug that has already taken an alarming toll on Dallas-area youth. Unlike some other drugs, 'cheese' heroin use is still in its infancy and largely unknown in other parts of Texas and the country. But if we don't tackle this dangerous drug soon, it is sure to fall into the hands of countless other young people and continue down a deadly path.
   "My legislation to add 'cheese' heroin to the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign will help target this dangerous drug on a targeted, local level. Director Walters should work closely with local officials and provide the tools and resources needed to protect our children from this drug's grips and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the state and nation." 
   Sen. Cornyn has been active in bringing attention to the fight against "cheese" heroin, having introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate to add "cheese" heroin to the list of illegal drugs in the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. His amendment was included in the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007, S. 456, which was recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and advanced to the full Senate for consideration.
