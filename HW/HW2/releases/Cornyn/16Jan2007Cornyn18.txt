SEN. CORNYN CO-SPONSORS MEASURE TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and a strong advocate of open government, co-sponsored an amendment to protect the rights of grassroots groups to contact congressional offices. The amendment, introduced by Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, would strike Section 220 of the Ethics Bill, S. 1, currently being debated in the Senate.  
   "I support this amendment to strike Section 220 of the Ethics Bill because it discourages the American people's first amendment right to let their voices be heard on issues being addressed in Congress," Sen. Cornyn said. "There are numerous examples of the Supreme Court upholding the freedom to associate and engage anonymously in grassroots activity. I'm concerned that this provision would greatly damage that ability." 
   Section 220 of the Ethics Bill would impose onerous disclosure requirements on issue-advocacy organizations that engage in grassroots lobbying. The Bennett amendment removing those provisions is expected to be debated in the Senate and voted on this week. 
   "I believe that accountability, accessibility and openness in government are principles that all elected officials should not only follow, but actively work to promote. Hearing from the American people is a key part of that," Cornyn said. "So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment by Sen. Bennett as we work to reform the way Washington works."
