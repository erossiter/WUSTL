SEN. CORNYN: DHS APPROVAL OF LEVEE PLAN A TESTAMENT TO LOCAL-FEDERAL COOPERATION
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today issued the following statement in favor of U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's approval of the proposal to incorporate the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) levees to serve as a portion of the border fence. Sec. Chertoff joined Sen. Cornyn, Texas Governor Rick Perry, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, IBWC Commissioner Carlos Marin, Hidalgo County Judge J.D. Salinas, Mission Mayor Norberto Salinas, Cameron County Judge Carlos Cascos, and other elected officials in Hidalgo County today to announce his approval. 
   "When Judge Salinas and Commissioner Marin first brought the levee proposal to my attention last year, I began working to see that the merits of this proposal received due consideration on the federal level. I brought this issue to the attention of Secretary Chertoff last year and invited him to visit the Valley to meet directly with the local leaders and Border Patrol officials who developed the concept.
   "Today marks the positive culmination of months of collaborative work by leaders on the local, state and federal level. Secretary Chertoff's approval of the Valley levee proposal is welcome news in the region, and an example of how some of the best and most innovative ideas often stem from the local level-from the men and women who deal firsthand with local challenges that have national implications.
   "I commend the Department of Homeland Security and Rio Grande Valley leaders for their efforts to combine security and flood control. We have more work to do, however, and I will continue to be in close contact with the various parties involved as this issue moves forward."
