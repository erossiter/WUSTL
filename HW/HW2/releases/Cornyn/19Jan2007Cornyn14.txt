  Sen. John Cornyn has been selected to serve as the top Republican on the Armed Services Airland subcommittee, according to an announcement by committee leaders on Friday. In addition, Sen. Cornyn will remain a member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee.  
   "I'm honored to serve as ranking member of this subcommittee, as it has a key role in the oversight of Army and Air Force programs critical to our national defense," Sen. Cornyn said. "Texas plays an important part in the development of many of these programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter, F/A-22 and the Army's Future Combat System. So serving on this subcommittee will not only help me ensure that our national security needs are met, but that Texas will continue to stand at the forefront of defending our nation." 
   The Airland subcommittee has jurisdiction over the majority of Army and Air Force procurement programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter, F/A-22 and the Army's Future Combat System. The subcommittee also has jurisdiction over Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation programs, and Army and Air Force National Guard and Reserve programs. 
   The Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, which Sen. Cornyn previously chaired, has jurisdiction over several areas important to Texas and the nation. It oversees programs to counter terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The subcommittee also has jurisdiction over chemical weapons demilitarization programs.
