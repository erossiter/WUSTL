SEN. CORNYN TO JOIN HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF & CHILD SAFETY ADVOCATES IN HOUSTON TOMORROW FOR BACK TO SCHOOL SAFETY EVENT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was in Houston Wednesday, Aug. 8, 2007, to participate in the "Back to School; Back to Safety" event at the Children's Assessment Center with Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas, local officials and other advocates for child safety, including representatives from Crime Stoppers of Houston. Sen. Cornyn stressed the importance of local efforts to educate and protect Texas youths against violent and sexual crimes, and discuss steps he is taking in the U.S. Senate to further those efforts.  
   Since his service as Texas Attorney General, Sen. Cornyn has been active in the fight against child sex crimes and has led several efforts on both the state and national level to strengthen enforcement of child sex offense laws, and toughen the penalties and sentences of offenders. Recently, Sen. Cornyn introduced comprehensive anti-crime legislation in the U.S. Senate, the Violent Crime Control Act of 2007, which includes a broad package of measures aimed at significantly increasing penalties and sentences on child sex offenders and online predators, and requiring stricter enforcement of existing laws to protect more children in Texas and across the country. 
   According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, as of April 2007, Texas was home to the second highest number of registered sex offenders in the nation, with 48, 877 on record. 
   Sen. Cornyn is also an original co-sponsor of the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007, legislation that recently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, which establishes new criminal laws and tougher penalties to deter and punish members of street gangs.
