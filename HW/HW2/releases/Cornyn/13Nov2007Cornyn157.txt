SEN. CORNYN: I-69 TRANSPORTATION PROJECT WILL RELIEVE CONGESTION, BOOST ECONOMY IN TEXAS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the I-69 Caucus, made the following statement Tuesday regarding the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the I-69 corridor transportation project. This initial draft by the Texas Department of Transportation, approved by the Federal Highway Administration, in part recommends that existing highways be considered first. The project now opens for a public comment period.  
   "The proposed I-69 corridor will be important to relieve congestion and improve safety on our roads, as well as boost economic growth. Progress on the impact statement brings us another step closer to Texas drivers being able to travel on this corridor. It is encouraging to see the effort move forward, and I'll continue working to improve transportation in Texas."
