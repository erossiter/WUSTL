SEN. CORNYN-BACKED CIVIL RIGHTS BILL APPROVED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has unanimously approved bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by Sen. John Cornyn to allow the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to reopen Civil Rights-era criminal cases prior to 1970. The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, S. 535, approved on Thursday, now advances to the full Senate for consideration.  
   "It is my hope that by demonstrating a commitment to solving these despicable crimes, Congress can advance the cause of justice for all Americans," Sen. Cornyn said. "I'm encouraged this legislation has passed the Judiciary Committee and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important effort." 
   The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act establishes an Unsolved Crimes Section in the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ and an Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Investigative Office in the Civil Rights Unit of the FBI. Both offices will be responsible for investigating unsolved criminal civil rights cases, prior to January 1, 1970, that resulted in death. It will strengthen cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors. Additionally, the bill authorizes $11.5 million in annual appropriations to fund these new services. 
   The legislation was named after teenager Emmett Till who was murdered and mutilated in Money, Mississippi in 1955. In many states, there are still unsolved Civil Rights crimes. The bill was introduced by U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and has 14 co-sponsors. 
   Sen. Cornyn co-sponsored similar legislation, the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, during the 109th Congress.
