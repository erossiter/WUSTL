SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S TERRORIST DETAINEE ACTION
  Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding President Bush's announcement regarding terrorist detainee policy:  
   "It is in America's national security interest to bring Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other terrorist leaders to justice. We have gained key intelligence information from them and they should now be tried by a military commission - a practice followed by American leaders since the early days of our nation. Furthermore, the President helped put a face on the enemy that wants to harm America. 
   "The President's proposal for military commissions meets the test of fairness - while necessarily preventing critical intelligence from getting into our enemies' hands. It would be unthinkable to establish procedures that require either providing the terrorists access to classified information or dismissing the case against them."
