SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRATS' VOTE TO BLOCK CRITICAL BORDER SECURITY AMENDMENT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Ranking Member of the Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee, made the following statement regarding a unanimous vote by Senate Democrats today to block consideration of a border security amendment that would, among other things, provide $3 billion in emergency funding for border security improvements. Senate Democrats argued that this amendment, the Border Security First Act, was not "germane" to the Homeland Security appropriations bill currently under consideration by the Senate. 
   "The decision by Senate Democrats to block this critical border security effort is nothing short of stunning. What is even more difficult to understand is their argument that border security is not relevant to our homeland security. America's broken borders and weak interior enforcement are in fact a direct threat to our homeland security.  
   "It has been almost six years since the attacks of September 11th and our government still does not know who is coming into this country and why. We still do not enforce our immigration laws and our government has lost the confidence of the American people. This amendment would have made enormous strides towards meeting those critical goals. 
   "Yet, once again, for reasons I simply do not understand, Senate Democrats have chosen to block a border security effort and keep our broken system in place. This is shameful and I hope the American people will ask every Democratic Senator who voted today, why they do not believe border security is 'germane' to America's homeland security." 
   By voting not to consider this amendment, Democrats argued that the following items are not relevant to Homeland Security:
   * Sanctuary Cities: Prohibits cities from banning the obtaining of information on immigration status by their own law enforcement agencies. 
   * Operation Jump Start/National Guard: Provides additional funding for Operation Jump Start to maintain a National Guard presence along the Southern border. 
   * Criminal Aliens: Strengthens laws to deny immigration benefits to aggravated felons, gang members, terrorists, sex offenders, and child abusers. The bill also expands the Institutional Removal Program and gives DHS the ability to detain criminal aliens for an extended period of time before they can be removed. 
   * State and Local Law Enforcement: Gives state and local law enforcement new authorities to detain illegal aliens and transfer them into DHS custody. Moreover, it allows state and local law enforcement authorities to use homeland security grants to train local law enforcement on how to enforce federal immigration laws and provides funding to cover the costs of detaining and transporting criminal aliens. 
   * Visa Overstayers: Requires DHS to detain aliens who willfully overstay their period of authorized admission for more than 60 days. 
   * Illegal Reentry: Increases criminal penalties and sets mandatory minimum prison sentences for aliens who have been removed and repeatedly re-enter our country illegally. 
   * Expedited Removal: Restricts the impact of outdated court injunctions that currently prevent DHS from certain illegal immigrants into expedited removal and returning them to their country of origin as soon as circumstances allow. 
   * US-VISIT and Entry Inspection: Clarifies DHS's authority to collect biometric entry and exit data at U.S. ports of entry, as well as requires the Department to provide Congress a timeline for implementing US-VISIT at all land border points of entry. 
   * Employment Eligibility Verification: Requires DHS to enhance the Basic Pilot Program to help facilitate broader use by employers as well as improved accuracy and efficiency.
  Liability Protection for Reporting Suspicious Threats: Grants civil liability protection to those who report possible threats to our nation's transportation system. 
   * The "Zavydas" fix gives DHS the authority to detain criminal aliens and those who are a threat to National Security after they've been ordered removed from the United States. Under current law DHS has to release these criminal aliens into society if after 6 months after they haven't been deported because their countries won't take them back. The provision would also allow DHS to detain criminal alien threats to national security while they're in removal proceedings.
