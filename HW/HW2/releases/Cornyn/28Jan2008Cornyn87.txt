SEN. CORNYN: IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement this evening regarding President Bush's State of the Union address: 
   "The President tonight offered a clear roadmap to the important, unfinished business that stands before Congress this year.
   "We need greater accountability and transparency in how taxpayers' dollars are spent, particularly by shedding light on the earmark process. We need to put more money back in the pockets of working families and small businesses to stimulate the economy in the long-term, not just the short term.
   "Health care, housing and high energy costs are squeezing America's middle class. Congress needs to tell the American people that we are listening by working together on bipartisan solutions, without compromising our principles.
   "We cannot afford to continue the partisan bickering that has delayed so many important bills, and which continues to prevent meaningful legislation from being enacted. Political posturing may seem a victimless tactic to some, but it's the American people who are left adrift, waiting for both parties to work together.
   "The President has laid out the key legislative priorities facing our country and our Congress. It's time for Members of Congress to roll up our sleeves and get to work for the American people. I am committed to doing just that."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
