SEN. CORNYN: CLEAN ENERGY ALTERNATIVES MUST BE KEY FOCUS OF U.S. ENERGY POLICY
  Speaking today at the Galveston Bay Biodiesel plant, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that the continued development of clean energy alternatives must be a key focus of America's energy policy and noted that Texas has been a leader in this effort. Sen. Cornyn was in Galveston to tour the plant, get an update on expansion plans, and highlight the need to provide American consumers with a secure, clean and domestic source of energy.  
   "In the last few years, Texas has become the largest producer in the country of biodiesel which is due in large part to the hard work, determination, and innovation that Texans are known worldwide for," U.S. Sen. Cornyn said today. "The Galveston Bay Biodiesel plant is an exciting venture for Galveston and will be a key player for Texas' growing energy industry, particularly as we work to lessen America's dependence on foreign oil. Encouraging conservation, developing alternative energy sources, and increasing the responsible production of our domestic sources of fossil fuels will help make our nation more energy independent and strengthen our future security." 
   Galveston Bay Biodiesel, which recently met and surpassed their 1-million-gallon production mark after 3 months in existence, is on the road to expansion-helping Texas and America to be more energy-independent and competitive in today's global market.
