  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding unanimous Senate confirmation of Preston M. "Pete" Geren, of Fort Worth, to be Secretary of the Army: 
   "Pete Geren is uniquely qualified to serve as Secretary of the Army. He brings proven leadership to the position. Pete has played a critical role in working to improve the quality of support to our wounded service members and their families after the recent events at Walter Reed. His strong leadership at a difficult time for the Army and the nation was critical to ensuring that our military and their families receive only the best care and support for their service and sacrifice for the country. I'm confident as Secretary he will continue playing a key role in the efforts to improve the care and support members of the U.S. military need and deserve. With his experience and commitment, Pete Geren is the right leader to take charge of an organization whose men and women continue to make such tremendous sacrifices for our nation."
