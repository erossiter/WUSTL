SEN. CORNYN: PASSAGE OF MEASURE TO BAN TOLLS VICTORY FOR TEXAS DRIVERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Wednesday regarding passage of an amendment by Sen. Hutchison he co-sponsored to ban tolling on existing federal highways: 
   "Passage of this measure is a victory for Texas drivers. It's unacceptable that Texans should face double taxation by paying tolls on existing federal roads. Passage of the amendment moves us one step closer to protecting drivers from these additional tolls. I'll continue working with Sen. Hutchison and other members of the Texas congressional delegation to make sure Texas's highway infrastructure needs are met."
