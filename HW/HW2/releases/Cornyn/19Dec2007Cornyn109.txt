SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON NEW MILITARY CONTRACT FOR SEALY ARMORED VEHICLE FACILITY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding a new $458 million military contract for BAE Systems' Stewart & Stevenson Tactical Vehicle division in Sealy, TX, for the production of 668 new Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. These vehicles are being built for the U.S. Armed Forces to protect our troops from roadside bombs on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan: 
   "More than 2,000 workers at the BAE plant in Sealy continue to play a critical role in protecting the men and women of the United States military. MRAP vehicles have saved countless lives in Iraq and elsewhere. This funding will help continue that mission. Sealy can and should be proud of their role in this wartime effort. I congratulate BAE's Sealy employees on this significant contract award and thank them for their efforts to keep our troops safe while overseas."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
