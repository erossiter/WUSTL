SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN HILL
  Sen. John Cornyn, former Texas Attorney General and Supreme Court justice, made the following statement Monday regarding the death of John Hill, who served as Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice and Texas Attorney General: 
   "John Hill had an enormous impact on Texas and its judicial system. He was dynamic, witty, compassionate and always a gentleman. He generated respect and admiration among his fellow Texans that transcended partisan politics. John Hill set a standard of excellence on the Texas Supreme Court and as Attorney General, and inspired all of us who followed him. He will be greatly missed, but his legacy will never be forgotten. Sandy and I send our condolences to his widow Bitsy and the Hill family."
   Sen. Cornyn was asked by John Hill to write the foreword for his Attorney General memoir, which A&M Press is publishing next year.
