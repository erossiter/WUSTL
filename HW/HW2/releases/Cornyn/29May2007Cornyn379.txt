SEN. CORNYN: PRESIDENT'S SANCTIONS NEEDED STEP TOWARD ENDING DARFUR GENOCIDE
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement on Tuesday regarding President Bush's announcement to increase pressure on Sudan's government to end violence and genocide in that country: 
   "Additional tough, targeted sanctions like those announced today by President Bush are long overdue. This welcome action is an important part of ongoing efforts to crack down on the genocide in Darfur. It's appropriate for the President to utilize every weapon in the economic and diplomatic arsenal to pressure the Khartoum government to end the genocide. In addition, lawmakers at every level of government, including state and local leaders, can make a difference in this fight by supporting divestment from companies that do business with agents of genocide in Sudan."
   Sen. Cornyn introduced the bipartisan Sudan Divestment Authorization Act, S. 831, in March along with U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The bill encourages divestment of holdings in companies that engage in certain scrutinized business operations in Sudan.
   In addition, Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the Genocide Accountability Act, S. 888, which would close a current loophole in federal law that prevents the U.S. Department of Justice from prosecuting people in the United States who have committed genocide in other countries. The U.S. Senate passed the bill in March. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice and Bexar County District Judge.
