SEN. CORNYN: DEMOCRATS' 'TAX & SPEND' BUDGET WOULD HARM WORKING FAMILIES IN TEXAS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement regarding the tax-and-spend budget passed by Senate Democrats today and the harmful effects it would have on working families in Texas: 
   "The budget the Senate passed today is a missed opportunity to address our nation's challenges and secure America's economic stability for future generations. It's the worst of all worlds-it dramatically grows the size of government, increases taxes at a record level and explodes the debt. 
   "As we move forward, the last thing we should consider is reversing the policies that have helped to bring about today's well-performing economy, have reduced the deficit, and have put more money in the pockets of Americans. Tax relief has created jobs and helped the economy grow. The numbers speak for themselves-21 consecutive quarters of growth, and 7.6 million new jobs over the past three and half years. This budget only jeopardizes future economic growth and the financial well-being of millions of Texans."
