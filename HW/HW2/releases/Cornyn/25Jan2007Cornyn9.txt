SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN ANNOUNCE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR NORTHERN DISTRICT VACANCY
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today announced they have begun the application process to fill the vacancy for the next U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Texas which includes Dallas, Fort Worth, Abilene, Amarillo, Lubbock, San Angelo, and Wichita Falls. 
   Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn have established a panel of leading legal officials and attorneys in Texas to help identify the most qualified candidates to fill the Dallas-based vacancy created by U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish, Chief Judge of the Northern District, who will be taking senior status later this year.
   "Texas has a strong history of accomplished judges who have answered the call to serve the people of Texas," said Sen. Hutchison, Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. "Serving on the federal bench is one of our most important judicial positions, and I look forward to working through the process with those interested in applying."
   "Texans deserve the finest legal minds to serve as U.S. District Judges throughout our state's four federal judicial districts. Public service is a great calling, and I encourage everyone who is interested in serving the Northern District of Texas to apply for this position," said Sen. Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Those interested in being considered should submit a résumé and completed questionnaire to both Senators by no later than February 16. Express mail is recommended because of delays due to the enhanced security procedures involving Congressional mail.
   The questionnaire is available on Sen. Hutchison's website: www.hutchison.senate.gov. It is also available on Sen. Cornyn's website at www.cornyn.senate.gov.
