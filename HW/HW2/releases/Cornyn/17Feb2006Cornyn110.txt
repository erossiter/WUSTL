SENATE CONFIRMS TEXAN AS UNDER SECRETARY OF ARMY
  The U.S. Senate on Friday unanimously confirmed the nomination of former U.S. Rep. Preston M. "Pete" Geren, of Texas, to serve as Under Secretary of the Army. The position is the senior civilian advisor to the Secretary of the Army. Geren was nominated by President Bush on January 18. He currently serves as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense. 
   U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said "the Army will benefit from Geren's many years of service and experience."
   Cornyn introduced Geren at his confirmation hearing before the committee Wednesday. 
   "Our Army is undergoing major changes while fighting the war on terror, and we are of course working closely with the Pentagon to ensure that as the Army and our armed services are transformed, they become an even more effective fighting machine," Cornyn said at the hearing. "At the same time, we must watch the budget, procurement and acquisition processes very carefully to ensure the taxpayers get all they can for their hard-earned dollars."
   Geren came to the Pentagon in 2001 and served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and briefly as the acting Secretary of the Air Force. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 1997, representing the 12th Congressional district. Geren is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Texas Law School.
