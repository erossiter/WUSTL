SEN. CORNYN: SUPPLEMENTAL VOTE REPRESENTS 'POLITICAL THEATER OF THE WORST KIND'
  Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement today regarding the Senate's passage of a supplemental appropriations bill for our troops which contains an artificial "surrender" date and billions of dollars in unrelated pork barrel spending: 
   "Playing politics with the critical funding that our troops need now is political theater of the worst kind. Yet, that is exactly what the Democrats have chosen to do today.
   "They have passed a bill knowing full well that the President will veto it and with the recognition that they do not have the support to override that veto. In fact, the Democrats do not even have the full support of their own party which is why they have loaded this legislation with billions of dollars in unrelated pork projects.
   "This course of action is deeply disappointing and it is an affront to the thousands of men and women serving on the front lines in our armed forces. It is my hope and expectation that once the President vetoes this bill in the immediate future that more responsible voices will prevail and the Congress will do what is right for our troops."
