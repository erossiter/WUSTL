SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JANICE ROGERS BROWN'S NOMINATION TO U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR D.C. CIRCUIT
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Wednesday following the Senate confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit:
   "Despite years of heated rhetoric and mischaracterizations of their records, up-or-down votes on Justices Owen and Brown did not result in the sky falling, or the end of the minority party's free speech rights. The same will be true when we vote on the President's other well-qualified nominees to the federal bench-and we will."
   Sen. Cornyn served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
