SEN. CORNYN COMMENTS ON LATEST DEMOCRAT IRAQ RESOLUTION
  Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding the latest resolution offered today by Senate Democrats aimed at micromanaging U.S. military policy in Iraq: 
   "This is the latest in a never-ending saga of Democrat attempts to try to figure out how to best undermine the necessary work that our men and women in uniform are doing so courageously in Iraq. To me, it seems unworthy of the sacrifice and commitment that our troops are making. It's also totally inconsistent with the actions of Congress itself. Congress has authorized the use of military force in Iraq, and just weeks ago, Congress confirmed a new general - David Petraeus - who has put forward a new plan to secure Baghdad. 
   "It seems to me that too much of the activity in Congress has been on debating non-binding resolutions, which by definition have no real effect, other than to undermine the morale of our troops and cause our military families grave concern. They also lend encouragement to our enemies in this battle of wills. 
   "I think this proposal is an embarrassment, although the people who seem to be proposing it don't act very embarrassed by it. But I believe most Americans recognize this for what it is - Washington politics. I believe we must support our commanders in the field, not micro-manage from Washington, and stop playing these partisan political games."
