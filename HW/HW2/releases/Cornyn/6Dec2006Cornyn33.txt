SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT
Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding the release of the Iraq Study Group (ISG) report: 
 "One of the best things this report has accomplished is to make clear that every course of action is being thoroughly examined without regard to political ideology and partisanship. The key now is for all the parties to work together to find a solution that will help secure Iraq and allow our troops to come home as soon as possible. In the Congress, it is my hope that Republicans and Democrats will set any partisan rancor aside and reach a bipartisan solution to this critical issue. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am committed to doing just that."
