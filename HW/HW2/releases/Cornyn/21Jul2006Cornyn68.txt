BILL INTRODUCED IN SENATE THAT WILL PROVIDE TEXAS WITH REVENUE SHARE OF ENERGY EXPLORATION
  Sen. John Cornyn joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing a bill that will allow Texas to share revenue from the exploration of offshore oil and gas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and increase our domestic energy production. Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, S. 3711.  
   "As an energy leader, Texas will play a strong role in this new offshore oil and gas exploration. Our state also stands to benefit from a reasonable and fair revenue sharing program to help coastal states," Sen. Cornyn said. "And I'm encouraged that this bill will increase domestic energy production, decreasing our dependence on foreign sources."
   The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for energy development and would give Texas a share of that revenue as well as a portion of revenues from new leases in the entire Gulf of Mexico after 2017. 
   Debate on the bill is expected to begin next week. The legislation's main sponsor is Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.). In addition to Sen. Cornyn, it is co-sponsored by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and others. 
   The revenue will benefit communities along the Texas Gulf Coast to address critical coastal issues including erosion, habitat restoration, and energy infrastructure.
   Below are questions and answers about the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006:
   What will the Texas share of revenue be? 
   The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for exploration. The new leases would begin between 100 and 125 miles south of the Alabama / Florida border and total approximately eight million acres: 
   * 37.5 percent of all revenues from these areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico will be shared with states based upon proximity to the production area. Because of our proximity, Texas would be eligible for 10 percent of these shared revenues. 
   * 12.5 percent of revenues provided to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for grants to states to pay 50 percent of the cost of parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational and conservation opportunities. 
   All new leases issued in the Gulf of Mexico after 2017:
   * 37.5 percent of revenues from new leases in the entire Gulf of Mexico shared with states based upon proximity to the production areas. Texas would share approximately 21 percent of these funds. 
   * 12.5 percent of revenues provided to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for grants to states to pay 50 percent of the cost of parks, wildlife refuges and other recreational and conservation opportunities. 
   How will Texas be able to use the revenue? 
   The uses are similar to those outlined in the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) that was passed in the 2005 Energy Bill. Those include:
   * Projects and activities for the conservation, protection, or restoration of coastal areas, including wetland. 
   * Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources. 
   * Planning assistance and the administrative costs of complying with this section. 
   * Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal or comprehensive conservation management plan. 
   * Mitigation of the impact of Outer Continental Shelf activities through funding or onshore infrastructure projects and public service needs.
