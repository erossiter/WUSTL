SEN. CORNYN: SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN A NECESSARY, OVERDUE STEP IN PROTECTING AMERICA, ALLIES
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the President's decision to place sanctions on Iran's defense ministry, Revolutionary Guard Corps, and a number of state-owned banks due to their continued support of terrorism:  
   "This move to impose the most significant sanctions on Iran in more than 20 years is a necessary and overdue step in curtailing Iran's threat to the United States and our allies. The sanctions follow the Senate's recent passage of legislation, which I supported, requesting the White House designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. We must hold the Iranian government accountable for their continued efforts to help insurgents harm and kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
