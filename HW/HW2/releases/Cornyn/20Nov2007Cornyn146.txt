SEN. CORNYN DELIVERS LEGISLATIVE UPDATE TO SUN CITY KIWANIS MEMBERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn was in Georgetown today to deliver a legislative update to members of the Sun City Kiwanis Club. Sen. Cornyn discussed the war on terror and recent security progress in Iraq; the need to secure America's borders and reform a flawed immigration system; and efforts to boost access to quality health care for Texas families.  
   "This was a good opportunity to hear directly from Texans on the issues that matter most to them and their communities, as I continue working in the Senate to address the challenges facing our state and nation. 
   "I was pleased to share an update on recent progress in Iraq. Our men and women in uniform are making significant strides in boosting security and pushing back against the insurgency. Even when many of their leaders in Washington have attempted to cut their mission short and play politics with essential funding, our troops have stood strong and stayed committed to succeeding in Iraq. 
   "As we gather with our families for Thanksgiving, I hope we each keep our servicemen and women in our thoughts and prayers, as they are far from their own families and making great sacrifices for our security and freedom." 
   As reported today in the New York Times, the troop surge implemented five months ago is having a positive effect across Iraq, with significant reductions in car and suicide bombings, and deaths of Iraqi civilians.
