SEN. CORNYN: POLITICS SHOULD NOT UNDERCUT HARD-EARNED MILITARY PROGRESS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement this evening regarding the President's address to the nation and his announcement that he will begin withdrawing some troops from Iraq by the end of the year:  
   "All of us want to bring our troops home as quickly as possible, but that determination should be made based on the recommendations of our commanders and their men and women in the field. It should not be made by armchair Generals and those with Presidential aspirations in the Congress. 
   "Our commanding officer in Iraq, General Petraeus, came before the Congress this week and made clear that the surge is working; military progress is being made to the extent that some troop withdrawals can begin in the months ahead. I'm pleased that President Bush is listening to his commanders on the ground and with his announcement this evening that some troops will come home before the year's end. 
   "The last thing we should do is allow politics to undercut this hard-earned progress. It is my hope that the facts on the ground, and not politics here at home, will be the focus of the debate on Iraq in the Senate. Mistakes have been made in recent years, but General Petraeus' plan is working and Congress has an obligation to protect this nation by allowing our troops to complete their mission. "
