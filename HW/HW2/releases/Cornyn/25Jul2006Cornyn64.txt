SEN. CORNYN JOINS IN RENEWED PUSH FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR HURRICANE RECOVERY
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Woodlands) joined Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Williams in a renewed push on Tuesday to ensure that Texas receives a fair share of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for ongoing hurricane recovery needs. Williams headed up the meeting with top-level officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to explain Texas's unmet needs.  
   "Texas opened its doors and provided important resources following last year's devastating storms," Cornyn said. "So we must receive a fair share of funding from the unallocated community development assistance. The Texas congressional delegation and state and local officials will keep working to ensure that the federal government plays its part to meet Texas recovery needs." 
   Cornyn has previously been assured by HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson that Texas will receive equitable treatment when HUD distributes the $1 billion in unallocated Community Development Block Grants that was approved by Congress in a recent funding bill.
   Congress provided $11.5 billion in CDBG funds for hurricane relief last year. But only $74.5 million under that program, CDBG funds, was allocated to Texas, or less than one percent. In May, Cornyn introduced an amendment to increase substantially CDBG funding for Texas.
   The CDBG program is a flexible funding source that provides communities with assistance to address a wide range of unique community development needs. 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
