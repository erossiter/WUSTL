SEN. CORNYN URGES SENATE TO PASS BILL TO BOLSTER SECURITY FOR JUDGES
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged his Senate colleagues on Wednesday to pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen and expand protections for judges, courthouse personnel and their families. 
   Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, which is currently under consideration by the Senate. The bill was introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the panel's top Republican. A vote on the bill is expected on Friday.  
   "Judges, witnesses and courthouse personnel must not face threats and violence for simply doing their job," Sen. Cornyn said on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. "Protection of the men and women who compose our judicial system and serve the public and law enforcement is essential to the proper administration of justice in our country. This important bill takes steps towards providing additional protections to these dedicated public servants. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support."
   Sen. Cornyn noted that as former judge and state Supreme Court justice, he has a personal interest in protecting those who personify the rule of law. In addition, he said he has a number of close, personal friends who continue to serve in the judiciary and work at courthouses. "I personally know judges and their families who have been victims of violence, and I've grieved with those victims and their families," Sen. Cornyn said.
   "The dedicated men and women who work in America's courthouses-from the judges to the court reporters to the bailiff's-are placed in harm's way by the very nature of their jobs. They fulfill essential roles that keep our democracy running smoothly," Sen. Cornyn added. "Unfortunately, violence directed at public servants is on the rise. From escalating violence against police officers to courthouse attacks, including in Texas, these despicable actions threaten the administration of justice and threaten our ability to invoke the rule of law." 
   Sen. Cornyn continued: "This Congress has the power and now we must exercise it to ensure that certain and swift punishment awaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts of violence," Sen. Cornyn added. "The administration of justice, indeed, the health of our very democracy, depends on our ability to attract dedicated public servants to work at our courthouses. We must do everything in our power to provide adequate security to these men and women who are too often targeted for violence or harassment simply because of the position they hold and the decisions that they are called upon to make." 
   The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 does the following: 
   * Establishes criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Authorizes additional funding to hire marshals to protect the judiciary;
   * Enhances penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses; 
   * Provides new resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; 
   * Creates provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn introduced legislation last year to provide additional protection for judges, police officers and other courthouse officials from those who seek to do them harm. The Court and Law Enforcement Protection Act would increase security for those who work in courthouses and toughen penalties for crimes against them. Sen. Cornyn plans to re-introduce similar legislation this year.
