SENATE PASSES SEN. CORNYN-BACKED BILL TO INCREASE PROTECTION FOR JUDGES, COURT OFFICIALS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement regarding unanimous Senate passage of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, H.R. 660, late Monday. The legislation takes steps to enhance security for judges and courthouse personnel, who are often targets of violence or harassment due to the nature of their professions. Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor.  
   "Our democracy depends on our ability to attract and protect dedicated public servants to administer justice. This vital role comes with serious security risks that place judges and their families in harm's way. 
   "As a former judge, I understand the concerns they have for their families and their own safety. The Senate has acted to ensure that those who engage in these criminal acts will meet swift justice. This bill will provide judges and court officials additional security and peace of mind as they carry out their jobs." 
   Sen. Cornyn noted that as former judge and state Supreme Court justice, he has a personal interest in protecting those who personify the rule of law. He has personal friends who continue to serve in the judiciary and work at courthouses, some of whom have been victims of violence. 
   The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, which now awaits passage by the House of Representatives, would do the following: 
   * Establish criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Authorize additional funding to hire marshals to protect the judiciary 
   * Enhance penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses; 
   * Provide new resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; and 
   * Create provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
