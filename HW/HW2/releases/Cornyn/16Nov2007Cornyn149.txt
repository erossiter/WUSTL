SEN. CORNYN: TEXAS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1976
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement regarding the latest Texas job numbers released today. The state unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest since the current series began in 1976. Employers in Texas added 24,200 jobs in the past month, for a total of 206,400 in the past year.  
   "The latest job figures are another indication of the strength of Texas for doing business and the excellence of our workforce. Economic growth in our state is strong and growing stronger. I hope we will continue to expand opportunities for Texans and all Americans by keeping taxes low and making the Republican-passed tax relief permanent. This is the best way to protect middle-class families, farmers and ranchers, and entrepreneurs across Texas, allowing them to spend, save and invest as they choose." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
