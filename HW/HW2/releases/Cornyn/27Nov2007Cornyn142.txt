SEN. CORNYN TOUTS ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AMARILLO
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today visited Amarillo to highlight the positive effects of community-driven efforts to grow the local economy and create jobs. He hosted a roundtable discussion with Mayor Debra McCartt and members of the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation, along with other local leaders, who have been working to attract business relocation and start-ups to Amarillo to increase job opportunities and economic growth.  
   Sen. Cornyn toured the Ben E. Keith West Texas Division, one of many businesses the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation has supported for its growth potential. Having recently moved to an expanded facility at the Amarillo CenterPort, the Ben E. Keith facility today announced the eventual creation of 40-45 new jobs, in addition to the 35 jobs it added to its payroll when it relocated. 
   "Due to the hard work, vision and initiative of local leaders, Amarillo is experiencing some of the most impressive economic growth in the state," Sen. Cornyn said. "The expansion and job creation at the Ben E. Keith facility is just one example of the positive impact a community can have when it comes together and develops innovative strategies to invigorate the local economy. 
   "I have and will continue to work to implement low-tax, pro-growth policies on the federal level that complement local efforts and make it easier for Texas businesses to expand and create jobs." 
   Sen. Cornyn is a strong advocate of fiscal policies that allow Texans to keep more of their hard-earned money. He supported Republican-led tax relief passed by Congress, which led to unprecedented economic expansion in recent years. Texas has experienced 24 consecutive quarters of economic growth, and the state unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 30 years at 4.1 percent. In addition, Amarillo is a leader in Texas, with an even lower unemployment rate of 3.0 percent.
