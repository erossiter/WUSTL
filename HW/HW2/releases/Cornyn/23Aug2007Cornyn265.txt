SEN. CORNYN, SAN ANTONIO LAW ENFORCEMENT & SAFETY ADVOCATES TO HIGHLIGHT EFFORTS TO CURB LOCAL GANG VIOLENCE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn will visit San Antonio Thursday to meet with local law enforcement, city officials, and safety advocates to discuss challenges the community faces, local efforts to curb violence, and legislation he has introduced to help San Antonio eliminate gang violence and related crime. After a roundtable discussion with representatives from San Antonio Fighting Back (SAFB), the city council, and local police, Sen. Cornyn and participants will host a press conference.  
   Sen. Cornyn has been actively working to implement policies on the national level that complement and further the hard work of local Texas communities and organizations like SAFB in working to prevent gang violence to keep their streets and schools safe. 
   Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007, legislation that recently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, which establishes new criminal laws and tougher penalties to deter and punish members of street gangs. It also provides more than $1 billion in funding for gang enforcement, prevention and intervention programs. In addition, Sen. Cornyn recently introduced the Violent Crime Control Act of 2007, a wide-reaching bill that builds on provisions in the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act to strengthen and expand criminal laws, such as tougher sentences and penalties for child sex offenders, human traffickers and other dangerous felons.
