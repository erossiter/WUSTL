SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. KERRY'S REMARKS REGARDING U.S. TROOPS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding Senator John Kerry's recent remarks disparaging members of the U.S. military. 
   "The members of the United States armed forces are the best trained, best equipped and best educated fighting force in the world, and it is shameful that a senior Democrat Senator would make them the butt of an apparent joke at a political rally. Sadly, this is not the first time Senator Kerry has disparaged the men and women in our military. Less than two years ago, he accused our troops of 'terrorizing' Iraqi children - remarks not dissimilar to his Vietnam-era testimony before the Senate in 1971. No one is lying about or distorting Senator's Kerry's remarks as he would have us believe. Senator Kerry's remarks yesterday were clear and they were shameful. He owes the brave men and women in our military a very sincere apology."

   "And there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the-of-the historical customs, religious customs. Whether you like it or not- Iraqis should be doing that." (Face the Nation interview, December 4, 2005)

   "You know education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. And if you don't you get stuck in Iraq." (Statement by Sen. Kerry on October 30, 2006)
