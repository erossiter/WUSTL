SEN. CORNYN COMMEMORATES FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBIA TRAGEDY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today issued the following statement commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy: 
   "Five years ago, seven brave men and women met a tragic ending to a bold mission on behalf of America's future and well-being. Now, we pay tribute to the astronauts of the Space Shuttle Columbia, whose sacrifice will serve as a lasting testament to the noble service of our nation's astronauts and their commitment to exploration, knowledge, and science," Sen. Cornyn said.
   "As we remember their families in our prayers, we also give thanks to the incredible efforts of thousands of volunteers, Texas law enforcement officials, and first responders who worked together immediately following the explosion to prevent further tragedy on the ground. These men and women deserve our deep gratitude, along with those who continue to work to preserve and honor the legacy of the Space Shuttle Columbia and its brave crew."
   Following the Space Shuttle Columbia explosion in 2003, Cornyn traveled to Johnson Space Center for the memorial honoring the astronauts who lost their lives. His first ever speech on the Senate floor was a special tribute to the seven astronauts who died, and later that year he traveled to Nacogdoches to thank the recovery workers for their efforts after the Columbia tragedy.
