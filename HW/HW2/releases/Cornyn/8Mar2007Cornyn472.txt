SEN. CORNYN TO VISIT BROOKE ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services, will visit Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston this Saturday to speak with military men and women, veterans and their families about conditions of the facility and the treatment of the patients, with a focus on outpatient care. He made the following statement in advance of his visit:  
   "We have an obligation to ensure that the men and women who are serving, and have served, in America's military are receiving the very best care and medical treatment. We cannot, and will not, tolerate less. 
   "San Antonio and Brooke Army Medical Center are at the forefront of modern Army medicine-second to none in the world. I am very familiar with Brooke Army Medical Center and the superb quality of health care it provides. But the situation at Walter Reed has prompted the appointment of investigating commissions by both the President and the Secretary of Defense, inquiries that will take several months to complete. I want to be informed about anything Congress can do immediately to clear away any problems that might adversely affect delivery of quality health care and related support to our military personnel and veterans. 
   "As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am committed to doing whatever it takes, including providing necessary resources and cutting bureaucratic red tape, to best meet the medical needs of those who defend our nation's freedom and security." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
