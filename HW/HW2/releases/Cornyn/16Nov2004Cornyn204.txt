   "Dr. Condoleezza Rice has proven herself a wise and trusted advisor of the President. She is someone who leads with purpose, conviction and clarity in fighting the war on terror and in handling the many important issues of our time.
   "As Secretary of State, I'm confident that she will be a constant and unwavering advocate for America's values and interests around the world.
   "In this time of historic challenge, I appreciate Dr. Rice's willingness to serve our nation in this new and critical role."
