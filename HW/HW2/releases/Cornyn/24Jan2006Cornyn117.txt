SEN. CORNYN: ALITO NOMINATION MOVES TO FULL SENATE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and former Texas Supreme Court justice, made the following statement Tuesday after the committee vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 The vote was 10-8 in favor of confirmation: 
   "Every member of the committee agrees that Judge Alito is one of the most well-qualified nominees ever nominated to serve the Supreme Court. But if qualifications, integrity, fairness, and judicial philosophy were all that mattered in this process, Judge Alito would have been voted out of this Committee unanimously. But the new rule is that any nominee who refuses to promise to impose a liberal agenda from the bench is subjected to, as one of his opponents called it, the 'you name it, we'll do it' tactics of distortion and smear. 
   "Judge Alito survived these unwarranted, baseless attacks. But at some point, we as a Committee will need to come to terms with our confirmation process which too often treats Supreme Court nominees more like pi?atas than human beings. That's something none of us should tolerate. 
   "We all agree that Judge Alito is well-qualified to serve on our nation's highest court. So it is unfortunate that we cannot all agree to treat his nomination in a fair, civil manner. Judge Alito deserves to be confirmed, and he will be confirmed. I'm proud to support his nomination." 
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, and is the only former judge on the committee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
