SEN. CORNYN VISITS DALLAS FACILITY TO HIGHLIGHT CUTTING-EDGE MILITARY WEAPONRY, TOOLS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was in Dallas today to highlight the latest cutting-edge technology and weaponry being developed by local defense specialists for the U.S. Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) initiative. Sen. Cornyn addressed members attending a regional conference on the FCS and took part in a tour of the Raytheon facility to view the equipment being developed, some of which has not yet been released to troops on the ground.  
   "North Texas is home to some of the brightest minds in military technology and defense systems. I had the opportunity today to see firsthand the cutting-edge work being done at this Dallas facility. It is another reason we say - Texas defends America," Sen. Cornyn said. "The advanced weapons systems and innovative equipment produced here are critical to protecting our troops, keeping America secure and winning the war on terror. 
   Sen. Cornyn added, "Some of the most important weaponry that our military depends on is being developed right here in Dallas by local engineers and specialists. This should be a source of pride for all Texans. In addition, this facility expands job opportunities and boosts economic growth in the area. I have and will continue to support full funding for initiatives such as the Future Combat Systems, which is an important part of providing our military the tools it needs to succeed." 
   This year, Sen. Cornyn supported the Senate Armed Services Committee's authorization of an additional $115 million for the program. He continues working to get this funding in the Defense Authorization bill approved by the full Senate.
