SEN. CORNYN: NEW TEXAS JOB NUMBERS ENCOURAGING
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement regarding the latest Texas job numbers released on Friday. The state unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 percent, down from 4.9 percent a year ago. Employers in Texas added 10,400 jobs in the past month, for a total of 229,000 in the past year. 
   "The latest Texas job numbers are encouraging and show that economic growth in our state remains strong. The unemployment rate in Texas is near its lowest level in more than thirty years and more than a quarter-million new jobs have been added in the past year.
   "To help ensure we continue expanding opportunities for Texans and all Americans, we must keep taxes low. This allows individuals to decide how to spend their wages and salaries--not government. Some in Congress want to raise taxes, however, thinking Washington knows best how to spend taxpayers' money. We need to implement policies to help working Texas families, such as making the child tax credit permanent, and eliminating the death tax and marriage tax penalty. This is the best prescription to ensure continued expansion across our state."
