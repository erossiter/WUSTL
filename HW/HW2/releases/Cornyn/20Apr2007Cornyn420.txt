SEN. CORNYN: SENATE TAKES IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE SECURITY FOR JUDGES
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday called Senate passage of the bipartisan Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 an important step to protect judges, courthouse personnel and their families against increased threats of violence. Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the legislation, which passed unanimously.  
   "This bill takes key steps to ensure we do everything in our power to provide adequate security to the men and women who are too often targeted with violence or harassment simply because of the position they hold," Sen. Cornyn said. "The administration of justice, and indeed, the health of our democracy, depends on our ability to attract dedicated public servants to work at our courthouses."
   The bill was introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the panel's top Republican.
   "The dedicated men and women who work in America's courthouses are placed in harm's way by the very nature of their jobs. They fulfill essential roles that keep our democracy running smoothly," Sen. Cornyn said. "Unfortunately, violence directed at public servants is on the rise. I'm encouraged the Senate has taken action to ensure that certain and swift punishment awaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts." 
   Sen. Cornyn noted that as former judge and state Supreme Court justice, he has a personal interest in protecting those who personify the rule of law. In addition, he said he has a number of close, personal friends who continue to serve in the judiciary and work at courthouses. "I personally know judges and their families who have been victims of violence, and I've grieved with those victims and their families," Sen. Cornyn said.
   The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 does the following: 
   * Establishes criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Authorizes additional funding to hire marshals to protect the judiciary; 
   * Enhances penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses; 
   * Provides new resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; 
   * Creates provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn introduced legislation last year to provide additional protection for judges, police officers and other courthouse officials from those who seek to do them harm. The Court and Law Enforcement Protection Act would increase security for those who work in courthouses and toughen penalties for crimes against them. Sen. Cornyn plans to re-introduce similar legislation this year.
