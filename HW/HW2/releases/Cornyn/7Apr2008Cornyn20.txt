SEN. CORNYN: TEXAS ECONOMY WOULD BENEFIT FROM U.S. - COLOMBIA TRADE AGREEMENT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a member of the President's Export Council, made the following statement regarding the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which President Bush sent to Congress Monday for passage: 
   "The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would further expand job opportunities in Texas and help keep our economy growing. Texas is arguably the overall top exporter in the nation, and our manufacturers and farmers sell more to Colombia than any other state. But our goods and services are currently subject to unfair treatment. This agreement would level the playing field, allow Texas companies greater access to a large market of consumers, and maintain good jobs here at home.
   "This agreement would also boost America's national security by improving our relationship with a strong ally in a volatile part of the world. Congress should put aside partisan politics and pass this agreement that is good for Texas and good for America."
   Note: Last year, Texas companies exported $2.3 billion to Colombia. For more than 16 years Colombian imports have been duty-free, while American exporters to Colombia still pay hundreds of millions in tariffs each year.
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
