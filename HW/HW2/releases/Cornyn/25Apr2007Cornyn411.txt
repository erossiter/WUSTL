SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CAPITOL HILL BRIEFING BY IRAQ COMMANDER
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding today's briefing by General David Petraeus, Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq, to members of the Senate:  
   "When General Petraeus was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in January, and he presented his plan to defeat the terrorists in Iraq, he made clear that the mission would be hard, but certainly not hopeless. He brought that same message to Capitol Hill today. 
   "The General was candid in his assessment of the challenges ahead, but optimistic in his plan for success. 
   "General Petraeus made it particularly clear that our military needs the funding contained in the emergency supplemental and they need that money now. The military needs to send new equipment, such as armored vehicles, up to the front lines, but they will be unable to do that without this additional funding. It is my continued hope that the Democrats will stop playing politics with such an important issue and send this funding to General Petraeus and his troops which they so urgently need."
