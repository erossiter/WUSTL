HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY RESIGNS
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge:  
   "Tom Ridge has provided strong and resolute leadership in the fight against terror during his service as America's first Secretary of Homeland Security. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Secretary Ridge developed and coordinated a comprehensive national strategy to protect against those who seek to harm America. 
   "Moving forward, I'm committed to working with Secretary Ridge's successor on critical homeland security efforts, especially border and port security, cyber security, and efficient distribution of resources and personnel."
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, and is the only former judge on the Judiciary Committee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
