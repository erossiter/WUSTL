SEN. CORNYN: BYRON NELSON WAS EXAMPLE TO US ALL
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, delivered remarks at the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony for the late Byron Nelson on Tuesday in the U.S. Capitol. The medal, the highest civilian award Congress can bestow, was presented to Nelson's widow Peggy Nelson.  
   "Although he earned the distinction of Champion 63 times in his golfing career, it was Nelson's reputation of generosity, kindness, and compassion that most distinguished him," Sen. Cornyn said. "Byron Nelson was an example to us all, leaving behind a legacy of sportsmanship, dedication, and compassion. His work both on and off the course made him a true champion in every sense of the word."
   Sen. Cornyn introduced and helped pass legislation last year to award Byron Nelson the Congressional Medal, which is given to individuals who exemplify the American spirit by serving their community and helping those less fortunate. The Byron Nelson Congressional Gold Medal Act, H.R. 4902, was signed by the President on October 16, 2006.
   "The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award which may be bestowed by Congress, and Byron Nelson is every bit worthy of this honor. I am honored to have been able to sponsor this award," Sen. Cornyn added.
   The Byron Nelson annual golf classic has helped raise more than $100 million for the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers, and his service to the Metroport meals on wheels program earned him the position of honorary chairman.
