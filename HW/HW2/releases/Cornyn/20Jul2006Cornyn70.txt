SEN. CORNYN HELPS PASS BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON CHILD PREDATORS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding unanimous Senate passage of an important child safety bill, The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. Sen. Cornyn played a key role in moving the legislation forward: 
   "There is only one way to deal with those who prey on children: they must be caught sooner, punished longer, and watched closer than they are today. I started advancing this important law enforcement theme as Texas Attorney General where I created a specialized unit to coordinate and direct efforts to fight Internet crimes such as fraud, child pornography and privacy concerns. Today, I am proud to add to those efforts on the federal level. It has long been said that societies are ultimately judged on how they treat their elderly and the young, and this bill is an important step forward toward improving the safety of those who are most vulnerable."
   Among other important provisions, The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, would require:
   * Sex offenders to register, and in the case of the most serious offenders, for up to life; Report in person at least once each year to update personal information and take a new photograph that will be publicly posted, for public access on the Internet; 
   * Imprisonment for up to 10 years for those who fail to register and, if they commit a violent crime while unregistered can be punished up to 30 years consecutive to any underlying conviction; 
   * Increased punishments for any crime of violence against a child; 
   * Imprisonment for a mandatory minimum of 20 years those who act in concert to commit at least three separate violations of federal child-pornography, sex-trafficking, or sexual-abuse laws against multiple child victims. 
   * The bill was named The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 as a tribute to the memory of Adam Walsh, a six-year-old who was kidnapped from a mall in Florida and murdered in 1981. Adam's parents, John and Revé, have dedicated their lives to helping victims of crime. John is the host of America's Most Wanted, and he has been an enormously successful advocate for victims rights across the country. 
   Cornyn said: "It is only appropriate that this bill honors the inspiration that John and Revé are to us all. I am told that the President intends to sign it on July 27, marking the 25th year since the day their son Adam was abducted. That would be a fitting tribute to Adam's memory."
