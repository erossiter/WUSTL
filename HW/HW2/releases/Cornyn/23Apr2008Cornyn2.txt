SEN. CORNYN URGES FELLOW ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SWIFTLY CONFIRM GEN. PETRAEUS, GEN. ODIERNO
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voiced his strong approval of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' decision to recommend to the President that Gen. David Petraeus serve as the next commander of U.S. Central Command, and that Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno succeed Petraeus as senior commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq: 
   "I heartily applaud Sec. Gates' decision to recommend Gen. Petraeus as the next commander of U.S. Central Command, and Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno to serve as his successor. Both of these individuals possess the firsthand leadership experience, skill, and record of success to fill these critical positions in our national defense.
   "Gen. Petraeus' innovative strategy in Iraq, including a highly contested troop surge and a brilliant counterinsurgency campaign, has significantly turned the tide in one of our nation's most challenging conflicts. His ability to stay keenly in touch with conditions on the ground and base his decisions solely on those objective conditions, despite pushback from some in Washington and political efforts to trump his military judgment, will certainly serve him and our country well as he assumes the leadership of CENTCOM.
   "Similarly, Lt. Gen. Odierno has gained invaluable experience on the ground in Iraq under Gen. Petraeus and is more than qualified to succeed him as the top commander there. I also applaud his past leadership and service to our nation as the commander of the Army's III Corps and Ft. Hood, Texas. I'm fully confident in his ability, and I look forward to supporting both of these generals as their confirmations come before the Armed Services Committee. I urge my colleagues to join me in swiftly confirming them for the security of our country and the well-being of our men and women in uniform."
