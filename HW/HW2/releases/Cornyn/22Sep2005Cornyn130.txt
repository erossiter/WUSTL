SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ONGOING PREPARATIONS FOR HURRICANE RITA
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) made the following statement Thursday regarding ongoing preparations for Hurricane Rita:  
   "As preparations for Hurricane Rita continue, I've been in contact with officials from Beaumont down through Corpus Christi. This is a serious storm and there is still a lot of preparation work to be done, but I'm confident in our progress thus far. In many ways our efforts began several weeks ago, when Texas answered the call in response to Hurricane Katrina. 
   "The local officials I spoke with assured me that the coordination between the state, local and federal levels is strong. I gave these local leaders my commitment that they will continue to get the support they need. The federal government will remain an effective partner, and everything that can be done will be done. 
   "While much remains to be done to complete the evacuation process, particularly on the roads and highways, officials are taking action to improve the transportation flow so that people can evacuate in an orderly manner. 
   "I was proud of the way Texas responded following the Katrina disaster, and I'm confident our state will respond appropriately and effectively to Rita."
