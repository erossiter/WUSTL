SEN. CORNYN AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE TEXAS AT LEAST $182 MILLION IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING
  Texas will receive an additional $182 million for hurricane recovery efforts under a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Sen. John Cornyn that was unanimously accepted to the pending Emergency Supplemental bill on Wednesday.  
   The amendment will provide Texas with at least $182 million in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) that can be used for various hurricane relief efforts including long-term recovery and infrastructure restoration. 
   "This amendment will ensure that Texas is not forgotten and continuing hurricane recovery needs are met," Cornyn said. "Texas will receive a fair share of this important funding source to help make our communities whole after last year's devastating storms." 
   The amendment is co-sponsored by Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). 
   The Cornyn amendment guarantees Texas at least 3.5 percent of the $5.2 billion included in the supplemental bill for CDBG funding - at least $182 million, more than double the amount allocated to Texas earlier this year ($74.5 million). 
   Congress provided $11.5 billion in CDBG funds for hurricane relief last year. But only $74.5 million under that program, CDBG funds, was allocated to Texas, or less than one percent. 
   The CDBG program is a flexible funding source that provides communities with assistance to address a wide range of unique community development needs.
   A final Senate vote on the overall supplemental funding bill could come as early as Wednesday.
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
