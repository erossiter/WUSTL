SEN. CORNYN INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO DOUBLE FUNDING FOR BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Ranking Member on the Immigration and Border Security subcommittee, introduced an amendment Wednesday to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill to double the amount of funding for local law enforcement officials for immigration enforcement efforts.  
   "The funding level set in a previous amendment to this bill was a step in the right direction. The federal government can and must do more to support the local law enforcement officials, so I'm seeking to increase the funding level as the Senate considers the homeland security bill this week," Sen. Cornyn said. 
   Sen. Cornyn added: "Local law enforcement and taxpayers along the border have been forced to bear the costs of our broken immigration system for far too long. The federal government has a responsibility to support those working every day on the front lines protecting our communities. Taxpayers along the border should not have to foot the bill."
   This funding reimburses border law enforcement officials who participate in immigration training programs to identify, process and detain immigration offenders. Sen. Cornyn's amendment doubles the amount of funding authorized in the bill from $50 million to $100 million for the Border Relief Grant Program. These funds can be used: 
   1. To obtain equipment; 
   2. To hire additional personnel; 
   3. To upgrade and maintain law enforcement technology; 
   4. And to cover operational costs, including overtime and transportation costs.
