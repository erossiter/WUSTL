SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFIRMATION OF GATES
Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding the Senate Armed Services Committee's unanimous approval of Robert Gates to serve as Secretary of Defense: 
 "I appreciate Dr. Gates' willingness to return to public service and accept one of the most difficult jobs in Washington. He has a distinguished record and I believe he is the right man for this job. I was proud to support his nomination in the Committee this evening and hope the full Senate will confirm him quickly this week. 
 "I am confident that Dr. Gates fully understands the need for victory in Iraq. Failure in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity by al Qaeda and regional instability as Iran tries to extend its sphere of influence. Decisions we make today will shape events in the region for years to come. We must base those decisions on national security considerations and not on political expediency."
