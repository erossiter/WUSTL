ECONOMY ADDS 144,000 JOBS, UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 5.4 PERCENT
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding new figures released by the U.S. Dept. of Labor that show the economy added 144,000 new jobs in August and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent:  
   "These latest job numbers show the economy continues on a path to recovery. The economy added 144,000 jobs in August, the unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years at 5.4 percent, and we've seen 12 straight months of job increases. 
   "No amount of pessimistic rhetoric, especially by those on the campaign trail, can change the fact that our economy is growing. But we'll continue working to make sure that all Americans who want a job can find one."
