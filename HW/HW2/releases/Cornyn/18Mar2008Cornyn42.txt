SEN. CORNYN: SUPREME COURT SHOULD AFFIRM SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT FOR ALL AMERICANS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement regarding today's hearing before the United States Supreme Court which, for the first time in seven decades, may adjudicate the Constitutional right of American citizens to keep and bear arms: 
   "This case before the Supreme Court has far greater implications than whether or not the District of Columbia's gun control law is constitutional. Rather, it is an opportunity for the highest court in the land to affirm the ideals and principles established under our Constitution - that all Americans have a Second Amendment right to defend their homes and families.
   "It is for this reason I signed an amicus brief to the Court on this case, along with Senator Hutchison. It has the most congressional signatures on any amicus brief ever filed before the Supreme Court. We wanted to make clear that while Texans have long cherished the fundamental individual right to bear arms, all Americans should have that same right. I hope the Supreme Court will uphold the will of our founders and affirm the Second Amendment rights of Texans and all Americans."
