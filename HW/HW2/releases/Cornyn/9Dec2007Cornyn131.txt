SEN. CORNYN DELIVERS COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON-VICTORIA'S FALL CEREMONY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today delivered the commencement address at the University of Houston-Victoria's fall ceremony at the Leonard E. Merrell Center in Katy. Sen. Cornyn spoke to 300 graduates, as well as their families, friends and UHV faculty.  
   "It was an honor to have the opportunity to address the graduating class from University of Houston-Victoria," Sen. Cornyn said. "I am always encouraged to see individuals who have embraced their educational careers with discipline and hard work, and pursued a college degree that highlights their individual talents and strengths. I encourage this year's graduating class from University of Houston-Victoria to continue to reach for success, whether in pursuit of a higher degree or their desired profession." 
   Sen. Cornyn is a strong supporter of higher education and ensuring that all Texans, from recent high school graduates to older working adults, have the opportunity to pursue a higher degree. He has worked on several initiatives in the U.S. Senate to lower tuition costs and provide incentives for low-income students to earn a college degree, including the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. With a significant Hispanic population in Texas, Sen. Cornyn has worked hard to increase access to higher education institutions for Hispanic students through a number of legislative initiatives, including measures to increase technology funding for Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and reduce the waiting period for HSI's applying for federal funding.
