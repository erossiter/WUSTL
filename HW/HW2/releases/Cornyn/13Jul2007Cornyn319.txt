SEN. CORNYN: FEMA MUST WORK WITH VALLEY OFFICIALS ON LEVEE PROJECT
  Following a visit to Washington by Cameron and Hidalgo County officials this week, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn called on FEMA to work with Valley leaders to ensure their concerns on the levee project are addressed. He also committed to continue fighting in Congress for adequate funding for levee repairs and upgrades.  
   Sen. Cornyn hosted a meeting in his Washington office with Cameron County Judge Carlos Cascos, Hidalgo County Judge J.D. Salinas, Brownsville Mayor Pat Ahumada and other local officials to discuss the levee project. Also, at Sen. Cornyn's request, federal officials came to the table to listen to the concerns of Valley leaders. On hand for a meeting in Sen. Cornyn's office were representatives from the FEMA headquarters, the International Boundary and Water Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
   "The levee project is important to prevent flooding and protect lives, homes and property in the Rio Grande Valley. I'm committed to making sure the concerns of Valley leaders are addressed and that they have all necessary input with federal officials as this initiative moves forward," Sen. Cornyn said. "The meetings this week were part of that effort, and I'll continue coordinating with local and federal officials. In the meantime, I am working with other members of the Texas Congressional delegation to fight for adequate funding for levee repairs and upgrades." 
   Among other topics, Sen. Cornyn updated Valley leaders on border security and immigration reform. He reiterated his commitment and work to ensure that no border fencing will move forward without local input. He also committed to work with them to find innovative solutions to border security, like enhancing natural barriers and the control of Carrizo cane.
