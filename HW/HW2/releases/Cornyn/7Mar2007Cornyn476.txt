SEN. CORNYN SEEKS TIMELY VOTE ON CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY INITIATIVES
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Republican Conference, made the following statement Wednesday regarding his amendment to the 9/11 Commission Bill that would close existing loopholes and strengthen national security in five key areas:  
   "It has been more than five years since we were attacked on September 11th. It is important that as time works to ease the pain of that terrible day, that we in Congress continue taking steps to ensure we're providing every possible tool to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil. We've made significant progress in updating our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, enabling them to better protect us at home and abroad - but there is still much more work to do. This is a step towards providing these tools and making America safer. They deserve a timely vote so we can move forward with this important legislation." 
   Background: 
   The Cornyn Amendment:
   * For the first time, makes it a crime to recruit people to commit terrorist acts. 
   * Authorizes the immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas are revoked on terrorist and other grounds. 
   * Prevents the release of dangerous aliens whose home countries will not accept them back into their country. 
   * Makes it a crime to encourage terrorism by rewarding the families of suicide bombers. This is not a crime under current law. 
   * Increases penalties for those who call families of soldiers serving overseas and falsely claim that their family member has been killed. 
   The Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) filed cloture on the Cornyn Amendment Wednesday afternoon to ensure that the underlying bill is finished in a timely manner.
