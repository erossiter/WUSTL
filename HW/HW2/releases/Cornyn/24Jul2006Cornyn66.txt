SEN. CORNYN SEEKS WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY FUNDING MEASURE
  Sen. John Cornyn, Chairman of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship Subcommittee, and Sen. Jon Kyl, Chairman of the Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security Subcommittee, on Monday requested the President's support for an emergency border security and immigration enforcement supplemental appropriation in order to fully fund enforcement priorities that Congress has authorized. 
   "While I'm still very much committed to a comprehensive immigration reform bill, I believe that for the legislative process to move forward, the White House and the Congress must restore public confidence in the government's ability - and will - to enforce the immigration laws," Sen. Cornyn said. "It is for this reason that we are seeking the President's support for a supplemental, and we are hopeful that it will re-energize discussions between all parties in our effort to reach a compromise on this very important issue."  
   Sen. Cornyn has played a key role in the Senate immigration reform debate and continues to work to bolster border security and implement comprehensive immigration reform. He will serve on the conference committee that will reconcile the differences between the House and Senate immigration bills.
    Cornyn and Kyl authored The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act (S.1438). The key components of their legislation include enhanced border security and interior enforcement, employer accountability, and reform to bring the current illegal population into compliance with the law.
   Below is the letter sent to President Bush on Monday from Sens. Cornyn, Kyl, Chambliss, Isakson: 
   July 24, 2006
   Dear Mr. President: 
   We strongly support your commitment to gain control of the borders and to comprehensively reform our immigration laws. While the House and Senate both have passed immigration reform bills, there has been little progress in finding middle ground between the chambers. 
   We have encountered deep-rooted skepticism regarding the federal government's commitment to enforcing the immigration laws - and this public skepticism is warranted. In 1986, Congress promised Americans that there would be a "one-time" amnesty, pledging that increased enforcement would prevent another build-up of millions of illegal immigrants. The government delivered the amnesty, but not the enforcement. 
   We believe little progress will be made on legislation until Congress and the Administration restore public confidence in the government's ability - and will - to enforce the immigration laws. It is not surprising that almost all Members agree that the government must secure the border and stem the tide of illegal immigration. To build on that consensus, we believe that fully funding border security and immigration enforcement programs will demonstrate our commitment to end illegal immigration. Your support would assuage the concerns of those who believe that recent Administration efforts to improve border security will fall by the wayside once a bill is passed. 
   We therefore respectfully call on you to present an immigration and border security emergency spending measure that would fully fund enforcement priorities that Congress has authorized. The recent Department of Homeland Security appropriations request represents a good - but not complete - effort. We have compared current and proposed funding levels with prior authorizations and have identified some shortfalls in key areas that clearly need to be funded. We believe that, should you present such a request, it would be well received in both Houses of Congress and would facilitate discussions and movement toward a compromise. 
   We stand ready to work with you to advance this important goal.

   More information on the key areas that need to be addressed:
   * Detention Beds: necessary to end "catch and release"
   * 94 percent of detained aliens are deported, but only 11 percent of non-detained aliens are deported. 
   * DHS releases 600 illegal Salvadorans each week.
   * Several years ago, the Intel Reform Bill authorized 8,000 beds every year from 2006 through 2010.
   * Even with the supplemental and Sen. Kyl's efforts on the DHS Appropriations bill, we are still 1,300 beds short of that authorization.
   * Border Patrol Agents: 
   * The Intel Reform Bill authorized 2,000 new Border Patrol agents a year.
   * From Fiscal Year 2001 through Fiscal Year 2005, there was a net increase of less than 2,000 agents over the five year period.
   * We have seen that the National Guard presence has resulted in a deterrent effect along the border. 
   * Almost 40 percent of illegal immigration has occurred during the last five years. So while the number of illegal immigrants has increased by 850,000 a year, the number of additional Border Patrol agents has increased by only a few hundred each year. 
   * Worksite Enforcement 
   * 45 percent of illegal immigrants are visa overstays.
   * In 1999 there were 2,849 worksite arrests for immigration violations. By 2004, that number had dropped to 159.
   * Last year, there were only three (3) Notices of Intent to Fine for violations of the enforcement laws.
   * Worksite Enforcement Program Performance: FY1999-FY2003
