SEN. CORNYN CO-SPONSORS BIPARTISAN BILL TO BOLSTER SECURITY FOR JUDGES
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, former judge and Texas Supreme Court Justice, joined a bipartisan group of Senators Wednesday in introducing legislation to strengthen and expand protections for judges and their families. The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 was introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the panel's ranking member. It has several co-sponsors. House Judiciary Committee members introduced a bipartisan companion bill as well.  
   "We must do all we can to provide adequate security to the dedicated men and women who are too often targeted for violence or harassment simply because of the position they hold," Sen. Cornyn said. "Congress should act to ensure that certain and swift punishment awaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts of violence. This bill takes important steps toward protecting those public servants who administer justice in our country." 
   Key provisions of the The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007: 
   * New criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Enhancing penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses; 
   * New resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; 
   * Provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn introduced legislation last year to provide additional protection for judges, police officers and other courthouse officials from those who seek to do them harm. The Court and Law Enforcement Protection Act increases security for those who work in courthouses and toughens penalties for crimes against them. Sen. Cornyn plans to re-introduce similar legislation this year.
