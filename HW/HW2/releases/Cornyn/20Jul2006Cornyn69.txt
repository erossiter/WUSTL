SEN. CORNYN URGES FUTUREGEN CEO TO LOCATE NEW PLANT IN TEXAS
  Sen. John Cornyn on Thursday urged the head of the FutureGen Alliance to locate a new nearzero-emissions coal-fired power plant in Texas. In a telephone call to FutureGen Alliance CEO Michael Mudd, Sen. Cornyn said: "Texas is the ideal location for the project because we have the necessary geology, unique expertise and strong community support."  
   "Texas has long provided America with valuable energy resources, we're already a significant coal producer and we remain a world leader in the energy industry," Cornyn said. "So, Texas is the right choice to develop the technology that fuels future generations of our global energy supply." 
   Two Texas cities - Odessa and Jewett - are among the 12 national finalists to host the design, construction and operation of FutureGen, the world's first nearzero-emissions coal-powered generation plant. This $1 billion demonstration project will test new electricity-generating technologies that will also produce other valuable products, like hydrogen, and will accomplish it without emissions. 
   "The President's FutureGen initiative and projects like it represent a serious commitment to research and development solutions to our rising energy demands using clean technologies," Sen. Cornyn said.
   In May, the U.S. Department of Energy selected Odessa and Jewett to compete with cities from our nation's leading coal-producing states. The alliance will narrow the list of finalists this Tuesday.
