SEN. CORNYN-BACKED BILL TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-METH LAW PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding unanimous Senate passage of bipartisan legislation he co-sponsored to strengthen the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act: 
   "This measure will further address the growing epidemic of meth use, particularly among young people. The original Combat Meth Act took important steps to curb use of this highly addictive and harmful drug. It is encouraging that the original act has helped reduce the number of meth labs in this country. But the Drug Enforcement Agency has identified areas of the law that can be improved. Passage of this latest legislation shows we will stay vigilant in our efforts to protect communities from the deadly use of meth." 
   Background: 
   The original Combat Meth Act passed by Congress and signed into law in 2006 required that cold medications containing pseudoephedrine be placed behind a pharmacy counter, required signature and proof of identification before purchase, and limited the amount of pseudoephedrine that one person can buy in a single day or month. 
   That law also required that most retail sellers of pseudoephedrine products file a "self-certification," attesting to their training about the law and its requirements, including behind-the-counter storage, logbook entries and daily limits on sales. 
   The Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act, passed late Monday evening, will improve the effectiveness of the self-certification process by: 
   * Requiring all regulated persons engaged in retail sales of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine products to self-certify that they have trained their personnel and agree to comply with the Combat Meth Act (currently, mail-order retailers of these drugs are exempted from the self-certification requirement); 
   *Requiring distributors of these products to sell only to retailers who have filed such self-certifications; 
   *Requiring the DEA to publish the list all retailers who have filed such self-certifications, on the DEA's website; and 
   *Clarifying that any retailer who negligently fails to file self-certifications as required can be subject to civil penalties.
   The Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act was introduced by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
