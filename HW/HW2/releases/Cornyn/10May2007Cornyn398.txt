SEN. CORNYN: WATER RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE BILL LONG OVERDUE
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement Thursday regarding the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The bill authorizes funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out several important infrastructure initiatives, including flood control, navigation and environmental restoration. The Senate voted 89-7 this morning to move WRDA forward for debate, which will take place in the coming days.  
   "This bill will provide resources for several important infrastructure initiatives in Texas, including flood control, waterway navigation and environmental restoration, such as wetlands and other wildlife habitats. It will particularly benefit Texas ports and coastal cities, including Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Galveston, Houston and others. After delaying for more than seven years, Congress should pass this long overdue authorization bill. 
   "Among the most important projects in the bill are the flood control and prevention measures, including in Harris County and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. These efforts will protect Texans and their homes. They will also help safeguard critical infrastructure in our local communities, keeping damage to a minimum and protecting the economy. 
   "This legislation also includes initiatives to widen and extend some of our state's coastal waterways, such as the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. This is important for our commerce and economic growth, but also for strategic national defense purposes. 
   "I'll work with my colleagues on areas where this bill may be improved, including making the Corps of Engineers more fiscally responsible. Congress should work in a bipartisan manner to pass a bill that meets our critical infrastructure needs."
