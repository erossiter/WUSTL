SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS LAUNCH OF NEW PROGRAM TO SUPPORT TROOPS
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, applauded the launch of the Department of Defense's (DoD) new "America Supports You" program.  
 The initiative is an effort by the DoD to showcase and communicate the many ways communities across America are uniting to support the men and women of the military. 
   "I'm pleased that the Department of Defense is highlighting the efforts of communities to voice support for our Armed Forces, especially those serving in harm's way," Cornyn said. "Through the 'America Supports You' initiative, American military personnel stationed overseas will now be able to see the support of people across the country on their behalf every day. I hope showcasing these efforts will have a positive impact on the morale of the men and women defending our country around the world."
   The DoD has created a website - www.AmericaSupportsYou.mil - to showcase the various activities and projects, and so that military men and women can log on and read first-hand how communities are displaying their support.
   One out of 10 military men and women call Texas home. While in the Senate, Cornyn has visited all active-duty military installations in Texas. In June 2003, Sen. Cornyn joined Senate colleagues for an Armed Services Committee trip to Iraq and the surrounding region. The delegation met with U.S. and Iraqi officials involved in the reconstruction effort. Cornyn also visited with Texas troops and received briefings from coalition forces and humanitarian organizations.
   Within the Armed Services Committee, Cornyn serves on the subcommittees for Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Readiness and Management Support, Personnel, and the Strategic Subcommittee.
