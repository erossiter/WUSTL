SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS TEXAS ECONOMY GROWTH
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Small Business, Joint Economic and Budget Committees, applauded the new job figures released Friday, saying "the Texas economy continues to grow."  
   "The Texas job figures are another sign of the strong economy in our state, and a result of a strong, jobs-friendly business climate. Not even the impact of two hurricanes can keep Texans from creating jobs and improving the economy. We know that when taxes are kept low, and when regulation is kept a minimum, that the economy will fill the void and create opportunities to employ hard working people in Texas and across the nation. 
   The Department of Labor reports that Texas saw a net increase of 17,300 jobs during the month of November, with 136,400 added over the past year. Nationwide, more than 4.4 million jobs have been created since May 2003. 
   "I'm confident that as we foster an environment where America's entrepreneurial spirit can thrive--by keeping taxes low, reducing the deficit and reforming civil justice--Texans will continue this welcome growth."
