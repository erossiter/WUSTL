SEN. CORNYN: ENERGY BILL MUST REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE SECURITY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement Friday following a failed Senate vote to invoke cloture, or end debate, on the Energy Bill. Sen. Cornyn voted to continue debate so he and others can make critical improvements to the bill.  
   "We need an energy bill that reduces energy costs, lowers gas prices and improves our security. Without significant changes, this bill would accomplish none of these goals. 
   "I will continue working for an energy bill that increases domestic production and protects American prosperity. A recent report showed that provisions in the proposed bill would increase energy prices and eliminate hundreds of thousands of Texas jobs in coming years. 
   "We cannot improve our energy security by raising taxes and penalizing domestic energy producers. The massive tax hikes and new red tape in this proposal will only stifle the production of affordable, made-in-America fuels. This would increase energy costs for American consumers, do nothing to lower gas prices and reward foreign companies."
