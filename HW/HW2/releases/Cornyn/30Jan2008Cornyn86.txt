SEN. CORNYN BACKS BILL TO PROVIDE GREATER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO MILITARY FAMILIES
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Wednesday signed on as an original cosponsor of the Montgomery GI Bill Educational Assistance Transferability Act of 2008, S. 2575, introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison to allow troops to transfer unused education benefits to their family members. 
   "As our men and women in uniform make daily sacrifices for our safety and freedoms while serving abroad, we have a duty to support their loved ones," Sen. Cornyn said. "I'm proud to support this new policy that would open the doors of education for military spouses and children across the country. Education is key to personal success and financial freedom-an opportunity we should gladly provide for the families of these selfless men and women.
   "I'm hopeful the Senate will act swiftly to pass this legislation, so we can provide more peace of mind and support to our troops as they carry out the critical mission of defending freedom and protecting America."
   The Montgomery GI Bill Educational Assistance Transferability Act would allow troops to transfer unused educational funds they have received through the G.I. Bill to their spouses or children. This legislation strikes language in the current statute that limits the ability of troops to transfer unused portions of the benefit.
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
