SEN. CORNYN TOURS TEXAN SOLAR-POWERED HOMES AT EFFICIENT ENERGY EXHIBIT
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn on Friday met with the teams from Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin who are participating in the U.S. Department of Energy's third Solar Decathlon. Students from Texas and around the world are on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to compete and showcase energy efficient homes they have designed and built.  
   "It is increasingly important that we pursue policies that diversify our energy sources," Sen. Cornyn said. "These Texas students have demonstrated their vision of how future homes can be more energy efficient and better for the environment. I commend them for their hard work and dedication in this competition." 
   Twenty teams of college and university students are competing to design, build and operate the most effective, energy efficient solar-powered homes. The decathlon began Oct. 12 and will conclude Saturday. 
   Sen. Cornyn continues to support diversifying our energy sources to include solar, biofuels, wind, nuclear, clean coal and other technologies.
