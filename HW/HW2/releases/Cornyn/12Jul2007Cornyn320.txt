SEN. CORNYN: FEMA APPROVES $3.8 MILLION FOR FLOOD RECOVERY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said today that FEMA has approved $3.8 million in individual assistance so far for Texans affected by flooding in recent weeks and that he'll continue pushing to ensure all the state's recovery needs are met. Sen. Cornyn encouraged eligible Texans to continue applying for this much-needed support. 
   "There is a lot of work remaining to help Texas families and businesses get back on their feet after weeks of harmful flooding, but recovery efforts are making progress," Sen. Cornyn said. "Help is on the way for thousands of individuals who have registered for assistance in the impacted parts of the state. Nearly $3 million has been approved in disaster housing assistance, which will go a long way toward making repairs to damaged homes and providing temporary housing to those whose homes are currently unlivable.  
   "Disaster Recovery Centers have opened their doors to flood victims in each of the 17 counties that have been designated so far as disaster areas by the President. More than $850,000 has been approved to help flood victims cover various expenses such as medical bills, transportation costs and clothing needs. 
   "I have and will continue to work with the rest of the Texas Congressional delegation, Governor Perry, local officials, and the Administration to ensure that every means of providing much-needed aid is pursued and exhausted. We'll continue pressing federal officials to deliver increased aid as needed. More than anything, I've been truly impressed by the way Texans come together in crises like this, reaching out to their neighbors and offering their all, even when their own burden is heavy to shoulder. 
   "This Saturday, I will tour the Trinity River project to get an update on its status and reiterate my support in moving forward with this critical flood prevention project. It's projects like these that when implemented, can do much to prevent the kind of flood damage we have seen in recent weeks." 
   Additional updates from FEMA on recovery efforts include: 
   * The June 29 Presidential declaration made FEMA's Individual Assistance programs available to residents in Archer, Bell, Burnet, Cooke, Coryell, Denton, Eastland, Grayson, Hood, Lampasas, Parker, Starr, Tarrant, Victoria, Webb, Wichita and Williamson counties. 
   * To date, FEMA has approved a total of $2,965,521 in disaster housing assistance, which includes temporary rental assistance for those whose homes have been severely damaged and funds to make essential repairs. An additional $857,330 has been approved for the Other Needs Assistance (ONA) program which helps pay for items and services such as: medical and dental care, funeral costs (as a result of the flooding), transportation expenses and household items and clothing. 
   * 2,367 Individuals and families affected by recent flooding have registered for assistance through FEMA's toll-free registration line, 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or by going online to www.fema.gov. Recovery specialists are available from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time seven days a week until further notice. The specialists can assist you with the registration process, provide counsel on assistance programs and also check on the status of your application. 
   * The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved $195,500 in disaster loan assistance. The SBA is the primary source of federal funds for long-term disaster recovery for owners of private property, including homeowners, renters, non-farm businesses of all sizes and private non-profit organizations. These low-interest loans cover costs of repair or replacement of damaged real estate, personal property and business assets not fully covered by insurance or other aid. 
   * Inspectors are examining damaged properties of those who have registered for disaster assistance. More than 1,300 housing inspections already have been completed, which enabled the approval of $3.8 million in disaster aid to date.
