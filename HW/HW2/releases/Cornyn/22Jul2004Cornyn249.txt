SENATE ENCOURAGES STATE COOPERATION ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROSECUTIONS
  Among the recommendations following a recent training conference to combat human trafficking was that states adopt an anti-trafficking criminal statute similar to the models already in place in Texas, Florida, Missouri and Washington State. The Department of Justice, which held the conference last week in Florida entitled Human Trafficking in the United States: Rescuing Women and Children from Slavery, announced a comprehensive model for such statutes. And on Wednesday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a bipartisan Senate Resolution (S.Res. 414) urging all states to adopt such legislation, ensuring the full coordination of local, state and federal efforts to fight the scourge of slavery and trafficking. The resolution was passed by unanimous consent. 
   Cornyn, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, said that although there have been many successes in the effort to eradicate slavery, "Most Americans would be shocked to learn that slavery and involuntary servitude continue to persist, not just around the world, but hidden in communities across America."  
   "For countless numbers of victims of traffickers, the American dream quickly turns into an American nightmare, and this resolution is an important step toward preventing these cruel acts. Such tales of human suffering should not exist anywhere in the world, and especially not in the United States of America," Cornyn said. "The American commitment to eradicating human trafficking and slavery from our midst is a profoundly moral commitment - not just to punish violators of our criminal laws, but to repel an assault on our nation's core beliefs about the fundamental worth and dignity of every human being."
   The resolution is co-sponsored by Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). It states that the Senate, "supports the bipartisan efforts of Congress, the Department of Justice, and state and local law enforcement officers to combat human trafficking and slavery," and encourages legislatures to "carefully examine the Department of Justice's model state anti-trafficking criminal statute." The resolution affirms that the Senate "supports efforts to educate and empower State and local law enforcement officers in the identification of victims of human trafficking."
   Cornyn chaired a hearing on July 7, "Examining U.S. Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery," which heard from Michael Shelby, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, and Johnny Sutton, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas on efforts to prosecute human trafficking cases in Texas - including a number of pending investigations. Also testifying at the hearing were several representatives of organizations involved in the fight against trafficking and slavery, including Sister Mary Ellen Dougherty of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and Dr. Mohamed Mattar, Co-Director of The Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University.
   "The stories of men, women and children trapped and coerced into lives of forced labor and sex slavery are heartbreaking, and the acts of the perpetrators are not just unconstitutional, not just criminal, they are profoundly evil, immoral, and wrong," Cornyn said. "Tragic examples of human suffering-from across Texas, and across the nation-are a constant reminder of the importance of a strong congressional and administration response."
   The DOJ conference was held July 15-17 in Tampa, Fla., and focused on investigation and prosecution of human trafficking-the coercion of adults and youth into commercial sexual activity, sexual exploitation, sweatshops, domestic servitude, and other criminal activity-and providing assistance to victims of such brutal crimes. 
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights. He is the only former judge on the Judiciary Committee and served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge. 
   Text of resolution follows
   S. RES. 414
   Encouraging States to consider adopting comprehensive legislation to combat human trafficking and slavery and recognizing the many efforts made to combat human trafficking and slavery.
    IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
   Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina, Mr. LEAHY, and Mrs. CLINTON) submitted the following resolution; 
   RESOLUTION
   Encouraging States to consider adopting comprehensive legislation to combat human trafficking and slavery and recognizing the many efforts made to combat human trafficking and slavery.
   * Whereas it has been nearly 2 centuries since the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, and well over a century since the ratification of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
   * Whereas most Americans would be shocked to learn that the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude continue to persist today-not just around the world, but hidden in communities across the United States;
   * Whereas according to Federal Government estimates, approximately
   800,000 human beings are bought, sold, or forced across the world's borders each year-including approximately 16,000 human beings into the United States each year-and are coerced into lives of forced labor or sexual servitude that amount to a modern-day form of slavery;
   * Whereas the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1865, abolishes the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude; 
   * Whereas numerous provisions of chapter 77 of title 18 of the United States Code have criminalized slavery since 1909;
   * Whereas the late Senator Paul Wellstone joined in a bipartisan manner with Senator Sam Brownback and many other Senators and Representatives to advance legislation to strengthen those laws, leading to the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton;
   * Whereas Congress made further bipartisan improvements to the law when it enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-193), which was signed into law by President George W. Bush;
   * Whereas the Department of Justice, under the leadership of its Civil Rights Division, has worked during the Clinton and Bush presidencies to strengthen anti-trafficking laws and to increase its own efforts to combat human trafficking and slavery in light of those recent bipartisan enactments;
   * Whereas the Trafficking in Persons Office of the Department of State continues to fight human trafficking around the world;
   * Whereas many nongovernmental organizations have made exceptional contributions to the prevention of human trafficking and to the care and rehabilitation of victims of human trafficking;
   * Whereas survivors of human trafficking crimes risk their lives and the lives of their families to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their former captors;
   * Whereas effective prosecution of human trafficking crimes will not be possible unless adequate protections are offered to the survivors;
   * Whereas the fight to eliminate human trafficking and slavery requires the involvement of State and local law enforcement officials, as well as Federal law enforcement efforts;
   * Whereas the enactment of comprehensive State laws criminalizing human trafficking and slavery may be necessary to ensure that Federal efforts are accompanied by robust efforts at the State and local levels;
   * Whereas the States of Texas, Washington, Missouri, and Florida have recently enacted comprehensive State criminal laws against human trafficking and slavery;
   * Whereas the Department of Justice recently announced a comprehensive model State anti-trafficking criminal statute, and encouraged States to adopt such laws, at its first ''National Conference on Human Trafficking,'' held in Tampa, Florida; and
   * Whereas the Department of Justice's model State anti-trafficking criminal statute is available at the Department's website, http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/model_state_law.pdf: 
   Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate -
   (1) supports the bipartisan efforts of Congress, the Department of Justice, and State and local law enforcement officers to combat human trafficking and slavery; 
   (2) strongly encourages State legislatures to carefully examine the Department of Justice's model State anti-trafficking criminal statute, and to seriously consider adopting State laws combating human trafficking and slavery wherever such laws do not currently exist; 
   (3) strongly encourages State legislatures to carefully examine the Federal benefits and protections for victims of human trafficking and slavery contained in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2003, and to seriously consider adopting State laws that, at a minimum, offer these explicit protections to the victims; and 
   (4) supports efforts to educate and empower State and local law enforcement officers in the identification of victims of human trafficking.
