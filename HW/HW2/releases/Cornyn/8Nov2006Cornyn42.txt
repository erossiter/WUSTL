SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECRETARY RUMSFELD'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today made the following statement regarding the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
   "Secretary Rumsfeld has served our nation honorably during one of the most challenging periods in our history. Certainly there will be those who will second guess and criticize different decisions that were made but the fact is that our nation is safer and more secure because of his leadership. It is neither a coincidence nor an accident that we have not had an attack on our homeland since September 11, 2001. He has served with honor and distinction and those of us who have worked with him wish him well.
   "New leadership and a new perspective are always healthy for our democracy though and it is my hope that with the election now behind us, the Democrats will work with the Republicans in fighting and winning the war on terror. There are still many challenges ahead of us and those on the front lines deserve the tools and resources needed to keep our nation and its people safe and secure."
