SEN. CORNYN: I WILL VOTE AGAINST AMNESTY
  Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the Immigration and Border Security subcommittee, made the following statement Friday. His comments come in advance of the Judiciary Committee finishing work this Monday on border security and immigration reform legislation and the full Senate taking up debate:  
   "I'm announcing today that I will vote against any immigration reform proposal that contains the guest worker provisions in the McCain-Kennedy bill. In my view, their proposal rewards illegal immigrants and will be considered an amnesty by Americans. It will encourage further disrespect for our laws, and will undercut our efforts to shore up homeland security.
   "I have always had three goals in seeking comprehensive immigration reform: to improve our security and obtain control over our borders; to identify those now in our country without documentation and provide a route for them to return home and get into compliance with our laws; and to do this with minimal disruption to our economy. The Cornyn-Kyl bill achieves these objectives.
   "Adding border security measures to the McCain-Kennedy bill is not enough. Any proposal that allows every single illegal alien to remain in the U.S., pay a fine and obtain permanent residence status is not acceptable; it will simply encourage additional persons to evade our laws.
   "I remain committed to a comprehensive solution to our immigration situation, one that includes additional border security, interior enforcement, and employer accountability. And while we must address the12 million illegal aliens already here, we have to do so without granting them amnesty."
   Sens. Cornyn and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) are the authors of The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S.1438). The legislation will strengthen enforcement, bolster border security, and reform immigration laws.
