SEN. CORNYN HOSTS MEETING WITH PORT ARTHUR MAYOR
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn met with Port Arthur Mayor Deloris "Bobbie" Prince and City Manager Steve Fitzgibbons on Tuesday afternoon in his Washington office to discuss various issues important to the area, including hurricane recovery funding.  
   "This meeting was an opportunity to discuss issues important to the Port Arthur area and listen to the local needs and concerns first-hand," Sen. Cornyn said. "I will continue working with local officials and the congressional delegation to press the federal government to make sure their hurricane recovery needs are met." 
   Sen. Cornyn joined Sen. Hutchison recently in urging President Bush to expedite Governor Perry's request for a federal disaster declaration for Texas counties that have suffered damage recently from Hurricane Humberto. Perry requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Jefferson, Orange, Chambers, and Galveston counties as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Humberto. Cornyn and Hutchison said in the letter to the President: "We ask you to carefully consider this request, which would expedite valuable federal assistance to impacted Texas communities." 
   Another topic discussed at the meeting was improving local postal service, an important issue for local residents. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn joined Port Arthur Mayor Prince and other local officials in touring the Motiva Refinery in Port Arthur in August. During that visit, Sen. Cornyn received an update on the refinery's proposed expansion, and discussed the importance of expanding refinery capacity in the United States for increased national and economic security.
