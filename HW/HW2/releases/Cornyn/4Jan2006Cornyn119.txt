JUDGE ALITO RECEIVES ABA'S HIGHEST RATING
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and former Texas Supreme Court justice, made the following statement regarding the American Bar Association's rating of Judge Alito: 
   "It should come as no surprise to anyone who has reviewed Judge Alito's 15 years on the federal bench that he has received the American Bar Association's highest possible rating. Unfortunately, the hard left groups decided long before these ratings were announced that they would oppose his nomination. And some Senate Democrats--including some who have previously described the ABA's evaluation as 'the gold standard'--will now dismiss the rating as meaningless. 
   "It seems that for some, qualifications, experience and temperament are less important than adherence to a liberal ideology. And for that partisan minority, no amount of judicial excellence can ever substitute for a pledge from a nominee to uphold the hard left's political positions. The Senate must reject that extreme view and instead give Judge Alito what all judicial nominees deserve: a full, fair hearing, an honest debate on the Senate floor, and an up-or-down vote."
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, and is the only former judge on the committee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
