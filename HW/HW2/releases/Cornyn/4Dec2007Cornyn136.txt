SEN. CORNYN-BACKED BILL TO PREVENT EMERGENCY, DISASTER RELIEF FRAUD PASSES SENATE
  The U.S. Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation on Tuesday evening co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that will help federal prosecutors fight against fraud, theft or embezzlement of disaster funds. For example, the Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act, S. 863, creates a penalty of up to 30 years in prison for any crime involving disaster and emergency relief funds.  
   "Texas has been hit hard by numerous disasters and emergencies in recent years. This bipartisan legislation will help make sure recovery resources get to those who need it, not criminals. We must send a message that the actions of those who defraud the government or otherwise illegally obtain a portion of disaster relief funds will not be tolerated," Sen. Cornyn said. "I'm encouraged the Senate passed this bill to provide federal officials the necessary tools to prosecute those who take advantage of victims of devastating disasters. It will say to those who may be thinking about illegally cutting corners or stealing disaster funds through fraud, theft or embezzlement that they will be caught, prosecuted and imprisoned." 
   Key Provisions of the Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act: 
   * Creates a new 18 U.S.C. Section 1040 to provide a new crime of fraud in connection with major disaster or emergency benefits. Violations of this section would be punishable by fines up to $250,000 for an individual or $500,000 for an organization, imprisonment of up to 30 years, or both. Note: This penalty structure is the same as the penalty structures currently available under the wire fraud and mail fraud statutes. 
   * Increases the penalties available for wire fraud that occur in connection with a major disaster or emergency declarations. Current law provides that violations of the wire fraud statute involving a financial institution are eligible for the maximum penalty (up to 30 years in prison). Under the bill, frauds related to a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency would receive the same treatment. 
   * Increases the penalties available for mail fraud that occur in connection with major disaster or emergency declarations. Current law provides that violations of the mail fraud statute involving a financial institution are eligible for the maximum penalty (up to 30 years in prison). Under the bill, frauds related to a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency would receive the same treatment. 
   In 2006, Sen. Cornyn co-sponsored the Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act of 2005 following disclosures by the Government Accountability Office that $1 billion, or 16 percent, in Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disaster relief were fraudulent payments. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn also co-sponsored the American National Red Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007 earlier this week. The legislation amends the Red Cross' congressional charter and modernizes its management structure.
