PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS SEN. CORNYN-BACKED BILL TO INCREASE COURT SECURITY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Tuesday after President Bush signed into law the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, H.R. 660. The bill takes steps to enhance security for judges and courthouse personnel, who are often targets of violence or harassment due to the nature of their professions. Sen. Cornyn is an original co-sponsor of the legislation, which the Senate passed unanimously in December.  
   "Enacting this bill into law will enhance security for the dedicated public servants who administer justice in our democracy. Judges and courthouse officials play a critical role that can put them and their families in danger. This law will ensure that those who engage in criminal acts against judges, courthouse personnel and their families will meet swift justice." 
   Sen. Cornyn noted that as former judge and state Supreme Court justice, he has a personal interest in protecting those who personify the rule of law. He has personal friends who continue to serve in the judiciary and work at courthouses, some of whom have been victims of violence. 
   The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 will do the following: 
   * Establish criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Authorize additional funding to hire marshals to protect the judiciary; 
   * Enhance penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses; 
   * Provide new resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; and 
   * Create provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
