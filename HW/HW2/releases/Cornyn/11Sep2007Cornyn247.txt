SEN. CORNYN: WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR STRONG RESOLVE AGAINST TERRORISM
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement today regarding the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks:  
   "As we observe the sixth anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country, I am reminded of the remarkable way our nation came together in the days following the attacks. During one of the worst times in American history, we saw the very best of the American people. We were united both in mourning and in our resolve never to allow the terrorists to strike our country again. 
   "Six years later - thanks to the sacrifice and diligence of our Armed Forces, first responders, intelligence community, and the eyes and ears of Americans across the country - numerous terror plots have been foiled and the terrorists have not been able to repeat the horrors of September 11th on U.S. soil. Even so, we cannot allow our resolve against terrorism to weaken. The threat remains very real, and our enemies are still determined to attack innocent Americans. We must remain on offense and continue taking the fight to the enemy. 
   "We should each pause on this year's anniversary to remember those who died on September 11th, along with the men and women in uniform who made the ultimate sacrifice for our safety and freedom. Let us pray for their families, the safety of our troops on the front lines and continued security here at home."
