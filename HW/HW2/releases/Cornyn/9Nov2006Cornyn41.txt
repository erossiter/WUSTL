SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GATES TO BE DEFENSE SECRETARY
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today made the following statement regarding the nomination of Robert Gates to serve as Secretary of Defense.  
   "Robert Gates is an individual of the highest integrity who has once again put his own interests aside and answered the call of duty to serve his nation. America is engaged in a different kind of war against a faceless, ruthless enemy, and his experience as a former Director of the CIA makes him uniquely qualified to lead our effort to defeat those who threaten our nation and its people. While he will be missed at Texas A&M, I am hard pressed to think of a better qualified and more experienced individual to lead the Defense Department at such a critical time. As I told him by phone earlier this afternoon, he has my full support and I will work to ensure his confirmation in the Senate."
