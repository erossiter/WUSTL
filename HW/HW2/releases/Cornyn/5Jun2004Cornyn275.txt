SEN. CORNYN: 'RONALD REAGAN - ONE OF THE GREATEST VOICES FOR FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN'
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) made the following statement Saturday regarding the death of President Ronald Reagan:  
   "Today, the nation mourns the passing of one of our greatest Presidents, one of the greatest voices for freedom and democracy the world has ever known. 
   "Ronald Reagan was a man of principle and purpose. As President, he confronted the Soviet Union as an Evil Empire that must be ended for the sake of all humanity. He brought America from the depths of economic despair to the heights of success. He was a voice of moral weight, a compassionate example of the American spirit, and he left the Oval Office as the most popular President in the modern era. Ronald Reagan loved America - and America loved him back. 
   "Today, in a time of crisis and war, Americans of every political stripe join together to honor a great leader dedicated to the cause of liberty, who rescued this nation in a time of need, when the wind seemed to be going against us. In ages hence, Ronald Reagan will be rightly remembered as one of the greatest Americans who ever lived."
