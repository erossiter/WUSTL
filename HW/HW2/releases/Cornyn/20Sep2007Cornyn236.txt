SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY CONDEMNS MOVEON.ORG AD
  The Senate today overwhelmingly passed an amendment sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Armed Services Committee, that strongly condemned a recent ad by MoveOn.org attacking the patriotism and integrity of General David Petraeus. The Cornyn amendment put the Senate on record in reaffirming "its support for all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, including General David H. Petraeus," and "specifically repudiates the unwarranted personal attack on General Petraeus by the liberal activist group MoveOn.org."  
   "This amendment was an opportunity for every Senator to declare with not only their voices but also with their votes that they fully support our troops and our commanding General in Iraq," Sen. Cornyn said today. "For MoveOn.org and their left-wing allies to brand General Petraeus a traitor and a liar crossed a historic line of decency. It was a despicable political attack by a radical left-wing interest group. I'm pleased that majority of the Senate, in a bipartisan vote, has repudiated it. We will not tolerate the patriotism and integrity of our troops and their leaders in the field being dragged down into the swamp of Washington politics." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
