SEN. CORNYN SECURES ADDITIONAL $25 MILLION FOR JOB TRAINING GRANTS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn successfully passed an amendment that will provide an additional $25 million for the Community Based Job Training Grant Program. The U.S. Senate unanimously accepted the amendment to the appropriations bill for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.  
   "This funding will give an additional boost to expanding job opportunities in Texas and across the country," Sen. Cornyn said. "Job training is a critical part of keeping our economy growing by better preparing employees for quality jobs. It will help provide Texans and other Americans the education and skills they need to compete in an increasingly global marketplace." 
   The amendment increases by $25 million the amount available for the Community Based Job Training Initiative within the Department of Labor. It raises the total amount available for the program to $150 million for fiscal year 2008. The funding does not increase the total amount of the pending appropriations bill because it reallocates funding priorities under an existing account. 
   The primary purpose of the grants is to strengthen the role of community and technical colleges to train workers for the skills required to succeed in high growth, high demand industries. In Texas, more than a dozen community colleges have applied and received funding totaling millions of dollars. 
   Sen. Cornyn continues to advocate for workforce partnerships and has visited community colleges across the state to highlight the importance of workforce training for job growth and the economy.
