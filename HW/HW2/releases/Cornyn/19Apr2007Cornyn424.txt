SEN. CORNYN: SENATE DEMOCRAT LEADER'S COMMENTS ON TROOPS ARE BOTH 'WRONG,' 'IRRESPONSIBLE'
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid's comments earlier today that the war in Iraq is "lost" and that it can only be won "diplomatically, politically and economically." 
   "It is now abundantly clear why the Democrat leadership in Congress has been holding hostage the critical funding that our troops need for body armor and weaponry - they simply do not believe our military can win, and they are no longer willing to stand behind them. I think that is both wrong and irresponsible. 
   "The Senate Democrat Leader is certainly entitled to his opinion, but his public lack of confidence in our troops is an insult to their deep sacrifice and a sign of encouragement to our terrorist enemies. You cannot negotiate 'diplomatically' with homicide bombers who kill innocent men, women and children. You cannot say you support our troops, but you don't support their mission and you're not willing to give them the funds they so urgently need. 
   "The Democrat Leader's comments today are deeply disappointing and are a disservice to the incredible sacrifice of the men and women in America's military." 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
