SEN. CORNYN JOINS IN INTRODUCING BILL TO ENSURE FREE, OPEN MEDIA
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined several Senate colleagues Friday in introducing legislation to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from using funds to impose the so-called "Fairness Doctrine" on America's broadcasters. Sen. Cornyn is an original cosponsor of the Broadcasters Freedom Act of 2007, S. 1748. The bill's main sponsor is Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn.  
   "A basic principle of our democracy is a press that is free of government influence or control. It is shameful that some now believe the federal government should dictate to Texans what they can say and when on the airwaves," U.S. Sen. Cornyn said. "If reinstated, the 'Fairness Doctrine' would be a direct assault on one of this nation's most cherished freedoms. This important legislation will ensure that all ideas can be expressed openly and freely on our nation's airwaves."
   In recent days, Democrat leaders in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate have expressed support for reinstating the "Fairness Doctrine," which was repealed some 20 years ago. This was an obsolete federal regulation that, until its repeal in 1987, required broadcasters to air all sides of controversial issues, regardless of listener choice, or risk the loss of their broadcast license.
