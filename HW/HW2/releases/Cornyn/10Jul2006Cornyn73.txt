SEN. CORNYN: DEFICIT REDUCTION ANOTHER SIGN PRO-GROWTH POLICIES WORKING
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding the improved budget deficit projection, showing a reduction from $423 billion to $296 billion: 
   "This is yet another loud and clear message that the pro-growth policies and the tax relief approved by this administration and the Republican-led Congress are working. 
   "The economy is strong. Job creation continues. Unemployment remains below the averages of the last four decades. 
   "Some people think the answer is to raise taxes, but month after month we see that growth increases when Americans have more money to spend and invest." 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. He is also the chairman of the subcommittees on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
