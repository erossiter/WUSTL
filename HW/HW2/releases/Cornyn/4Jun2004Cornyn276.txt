SEN. CORNYN APPLAUDS STRONG JOB GROWTH
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding the 248,000 new jobs created in May and strong economic growth in recent months:  
   "I'm very pleased that the important tax relief and jobs growth package that we passed last year with the leadership of President George W. Bush has turned out, as we expected, to reap such strong results. While we won't be happy until every person who wants a job has one, our robust economic climate is creating new opportunity, growth and hope for American families. 
   "May's figures of almost 250,000 new jobs mean that in the last three months alone nearly a million new jobs have been created in America due to the very strong economy. This is great news for the American people, but unwelcome news for those who have pinned their political hopes on convincing Americans that the economy is headed in a downward direction." 
   According to revised numbers announced by the Labor Department, nearly one million jobs have been created in the last three months alone. The hiring has been in all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, which until recently had shown limited growth. 
   The national unemployment rate stayed constant at 5.6% in May - down 0.7 percentage point from a peak of 6.3% in June 2003. The 5.6% unemployment rate is below the average of the last three decades.
