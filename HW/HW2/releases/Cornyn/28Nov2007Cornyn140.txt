SEN. CORNYN ADDRESSES IMMIGRATION SUMMIT WITH EAST TEXAS BUSINESS LEADERS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee, participated in the East Texas Business Leaders.
   Immigration Reform Summit in Tyler on Tuesday. He met with the leaders of various East Texas businesses and local leaders to discuss the need for immigration reform and how it would impact local businesses.  
   "Throughout all parts of the state, border security and immigration reform remain a top concern for Texans. We need an immigration reform package that balances our nation's security with America's economic needs. Congress should return to immigration reform without delay and address this problem in a comprehensive way," Sen. Cornyn said. 
   "I appreciated the opportunity to meet with business leaders from East Texas and hear their thoughts on this critical issue. These men and women are key job generators and contributors to our state's economy, and I value their unique perspective and input. 
   "Showing the American people the federal government is serious about border security and enforcement at the workplace is a key step to broader immigration reform. We need an employer verification system that allows Texas business owners to quickly and accurately determine if they have a legal workforce. Congressional leaders should put politics aside, provide the necessary security resources and work earnestly to produce a comprehensive reform package that restores respect for the rule of law and protects our economy." 
   U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall, Tyler Mayor Joey Seeber and Texas Association of Business President Bill Hammond attended the summit. Also on hand were more than 200 East Texas employers. 
   Sen. Cornyn has chaired or co-chaired almost a dozen Senate hearings on border security and immigration reform. His advocacy has helped produce thousands of new agents at the borders, increased assistance and funding for state and local efforts, and stronger worksite enforcement initiatives. He continues to lead the effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation. 
   Background on Sen. Cornyn's efforts to reform America's flawed immigration system and secure our borders
   * Sponsored the Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005: At the time, this was the most comprehensive immigration reform bill to be introduced in the Senate during the 109th Congress. Many of the immigration principles and proposals that passed the Senate and the House during the 109th Congress were first introduced in Sen. Cornyn's legislation. 
   * Co-sponsored the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Bill: This legislation authorized funding to reimburse state and local governments for incarceration costs related to illegal aliens. In 2004, Texas received $24.7 million under SCAAP. In 2005, Senator Cornyn worked to increase the funding and was successful in obtaining $26.5 million for Texas. 
   * Supported Critical Border Security Funding: This amendment to the FY 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill would have provided $3 billion aimed directly at protecting the border and enforcing existing immigration laws. Unfortunately, Senate and House Democrat leaders stripped this funding from the bill during recent negotiations. 
   * Led Effort to Reimburse State & Local Governments for Health & Education Costs: Successfully added an amendment to the Senate-passed immigration bill that would impose a surcharge on any illegal alien who applies for legal status. The funds collected by this fee would be used to provide financial assistance to state and local governments for health and education services caused by years of illegal immigration. 
   * Modification to Western Hemisphere Travel Document Initiative: Chaired the first hearing to explore the impact of the Administration's proposed passport document requirements on the Texas economy. As a result of his advocacy, Congress moved the implementation date back 18 months. 
   * Laser Visa Extension: Led efforts to extend the allowable length of stay for Mexican nationals entering the U.S. with Laser Visa border crossing cards from 72 hours to 30 days, and sponsored legislation to extend the stays for up to six months, similar to the permissible length of stay requirement for Canadians. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
