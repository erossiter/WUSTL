  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Wednesday regarding an Army contract for L-3 Communications Integrated Systems (of Greenville, Texas) for work on the Army and Air Force's Joint Cargo Aircraft (C-27J Spartan). The contract is expected to create 25-50 jobs in Waco in the short term, and up to 80 in the long term.
