SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. VISIT STUDY
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee, made the following statement Tuesday regarding a new Perryman report on U.S. VISIT:  
   "The positive impact that Laser Visa holders make on the South Texas economy has been clear for some time, and that's why it's so important to work toward ensuring that Mexicans who visit with Laser Visas are allowed to stay as long as Canadians engaged in similar travel. It's the right thing to do for both our border economy and our short-term visitors.
   "I've continually encouraged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to include the perspectives of border communities in the implementation of U.S. VISIT, and I'm pleased that DHS has committed to a new border outreach initiative to ensure that border communities are involved and have their voices heard."
   In his efforts to facilitate legitimate travel and trade in the Rio Grande Valley and all of South Texas, Sen. Cornyn proposed legislation last year that would extend the amount of time a Laser Visa holder can spend in the United States. 
   Currently, Laser Visa holders from Mexico who have undergone the appropriate background checks may enter the U.S. for up to 72 hours. On the other hand, Canadian visitors are allowed to stay in the Under States for up to six months.
