SEN. CORNYN: AMERICA COMPETES ACT WILL EXPAND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEXANS
  The U.S. Senate unanimously passed the final version of legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn to expand American job opportunities and competitiveness by bolstering education in math, science and technology. The America COMPETES Act (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) passed late Thursday night. It now moves to President Bush to be signed into law.  
   "This legislation will expand job opportunities for Texans by providing the resources necessary to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy," Sen. Cornyn said. "We must continue to encourage innovation and education in math, science and technology. This is an important investment in America's future and will ensure we continue increasing good job opportunities at home in Texas." 
   The America COMPETES Act will encourage and expand U.S. innovation by: 
   * Increasing research investment and; 
   * Strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school. 
   The America COMPETES Act is based in part on legislation also co-sponsored by Sen. Cornyn in the last Congress, including the National Innovations Act, the National Competitiveness Investment Act and the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act. 
   Sen. Cornyn has a strong record of working to enhance America's economic opportunities and competitiveness. In addition to backing previous legislation, he convened a summit in Austin last year to focus on workforce partnerships - collaborations between community colleges and local employers (public-private partnerships) designed to equip employees with new skills or help them transition to better careers. He has met with community colleges and employers across Texas to promote initiatives that will maintain America's competitive edge.
