SEN. CORNYN QUESTIONS ETHICS OF TAXPAYER-FUNDED WAR ROOM 'REPORT'
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former Texas Attorney General and Supreme Court justice, made the following statement Wednesday regarding a taxpayer-funded political report by the Democrat war room:  
   "It is beyond ironic that in an attempt to smear the ethics of others, the Democrat 'war room' chose to use taxpayer-funded staff and equipment to compile a blatantly political attack on Republican Senators. Researching, compiling and distributing what amounts to nothing more than a campaign ad on the taxpayer's dime raises serious ethical questions. Sen. Reid once chaired the Ethics Committee, he should know better. 
   "At a time when the Congress should be working together toward reform and safeguards against ethics violations, the Democrat leadership has instead chosen to run a political campaign out of the U.S. Capitol. 
   "If the Democrat leadership spent as much time working for America, and toward an agenda, they might actually stand for something other than personal attacks. And it would be a far wiser--and ethical--use of the taxpayer's dollar. 
   Sen. Cornyn served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
