SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROD PAIGE
  Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement Monday regarding Secretary of Education Rod Paige: 
   "Rod Paige brought great things to Washington: the experience and knowledge garnered from his compassionate work in Texas, a profound dedication to the schoolchildren of America, and a belief that when parents make decisions about their children's education, they should be able to focus on results. As Education Secretary, he presided over a time of change and improvement in our nation's education system as he implemented the No Child Left Behind legislation.
   "I join with my fellow Texans in thanking Rod Paige for his service to the President and the nation."
   Paige served as superintendent of the Houston Independent School District from 1994-2001; as a Houston school board member from 1989-94 and was elected president in 1992; as dean of the College of Education at Texas Southern University; and as head football coach at Texas Southern University.
