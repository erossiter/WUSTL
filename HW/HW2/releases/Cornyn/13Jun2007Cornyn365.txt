SEN. CORNYN: DEMOCRATS BLOCK EFFORT TO LOWER GAS PRICES
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) today made the following statement after Senate Democrats defeated an amendment aimed at lowering gas prices and lessening America's dependence on foreign oil by increasing the nation's refinery capacity: 
   "With the summer travel months upon us and gas prices at a record high, the Senate had an important opportunity today to strengthen America's domestic energy production. Yet, my Democrat colleagues defeated a needed, common-sense amendment that would have a direct impact on the cost of gasoline for the American people. 
   "Expanding refinery capacity must be a critical part of any comprehensive energy plan. Overburdened domestic refining facilities have been strained to keep up with record-level domestic demand. We must open more facilities, which we haven't done since 1976, to boost the production of refined oil products, like gasoline. It's deeply disappointing that we see nothing but roadblocks thrown up every time we try to pass measures to increase refinery capacity."
   The Senate today defeated S. 1505, the Gas Price Act, which Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.) offered as an amendment to the energy bill currently before the Senate. The Gas Price Act would have improved the permitting process for expanding current or building new oil refineries, encouraged and funded the development of fuels like coal-to-liquids, and increased the stability of the regulatory environment.
