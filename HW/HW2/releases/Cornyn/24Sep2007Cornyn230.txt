SEN. CORNYN: WATER RESOURCES BILL AUTHORIZES KEY INFRASTRUCTURE EFFORTS FOR TEXAS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn highlighted several projects important for Texas in the final Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), H.R. 1495. The Senate passed the bill on Monday by a vote of 81-12. It is the first time Congress has approved a water infrastructure bill since 2000. 
   "Passage of this bill is very good news for Texas. The legislation authorizes important infrastructure improvements to make Texas communities safer and boost economic growth. It is long overdue," Sen. Cornyn said. "The flood control and prevention measures are critical to protecting Texans' lives, homes and businesses. In addition, the bill includes initiatives to improve and expand some of our state's coastal waterways that serve as economic engines for both local communities and the nation. As we authorize important infrastructure priorities, we must do so in a fiscally responsible way. I remain committed to doing all I can to make sure Congress protects the pocketbooks of hard-working families and entrepreneurs."  
   Sen. Cornyn, along with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, successfully included the following projects in the final bill: 
   DALLAS-FORT WORTH / NORTH TEXAS
   * Dallas Floodway - Authorizes construction of the Dallas Floodway according to the most recently approved plans by the local sponsors. These improvements to the floodway will provide much needed protection in the heart of the city from potential flood damage to properties and infrastructure estimated at $8 billion or more. In July, Sen. Cornyn visited Dallas and received a briefing on this critical flood control project. 
   * Johnson Creek (City of Arlington) - Flood control project. 
   * Lake Texoma (City of Denison) - Authorizes the Corps of Engineers to sell 900 acres along Lake Texoma to the City of Denison. 
    HOUSTON / HARRIS COUNTY
   * Buffalo Bayou - Authorization of flood control construction project in Harris County. 
   * Jacintoport Channel at Houston Ship Channel - This would add this new channel to the federal ship channel if economically justified and environmentally acceptable. 
   * Halls Bayou - Authorization of flood control construction project in Harris County. 
   * Harris County - Flood control project for Upper White Oak Bayou. 
   * Houston Ship Channel, Bayport Cruise Channel and turning basin - This would add this new channel and turning basin to the federal ship channel if economically justified and environmentally acceptable. 
   * Port of Galveston - Authorizes a study for the beneficial placement of dredge material. 
   CENTRAL TEXAS
   * Lower Colorado River Basin - Flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration with a total cost of $110,730,000 (estimated federal share $69,640,000 and non-federal cost $41,090,000). 
   * Onion Creek (Austin) - Requires the relocation of houses be included in the cost-benefit analysis and requires actual crediting or reimbursing the City of Austin for relocating the homes toward the local project match. 
   CORPUS CHRISTI / COASTAL TEXAS 
   * Corpus Christi Ship Channel - This project will widen and deepen the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, construct barge lanes, and extend the La Quinta Channel in addition to addressing ecosystem restoration. Total cost of $188,110,000 with a federal cost of $87,810,000 and a non-federal cost of $100,300,000. ($87,810,000 federal, $100,300,000 local). 
   * Freeport Harbor - Makes all costs relating to the discovery of the sunken vessel COMSTOCK the responsibility of the federal government - including the vessel's removal and project delay costs. 
   * Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) / High Island to Brazos River - Would address the difficulties in navigating the GIWW in this area and allow for safer passage ($7,225,000 federal, $7,225,000 local). Also addresses Matagorda Bay Re-Route to create an alternative channel to provide safer passage for traffic along this part of the waterway ($8,640,000 federal, $8,640,000 local). 
   SOUTHEAST TEXAS
   * Cedar Bayou - Project for navigation. 
   * Sabine-Neches Waterway (Beaumont, Port Arthur, Orange) - Seeks to expedite the Chief of Engineers report, and if justified proceed directly to preconstruction, engineering, and design. Sen. Cornyn sent a letter earlier this year to the heads of the Environment and Public Works Committee calling for a provision that would authorize funding to widen and deepen this critical waterway. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee.
