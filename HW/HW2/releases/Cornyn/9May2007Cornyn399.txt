SEN. CORNYN RENEWS EFFORT TO SLOW ALL FUTURE TAX INCREASES
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, on Wednesday called for inclusion of his taxpayer-protection amendment in the final 2008 budget as Senate-House negotiators prepare to meet. Sen. Cornyn's amendment requires a super-majority of the Senate, or 60 votes, to pass any legislation that increases income tax rates on the American people. He introduced a resolution today instructing the Senate conferees, or those negotiating with House members on the final budget, to include the measure. Conferees are expected to be appointed this week. 
   "The power to tax is one of the most powerful tools Congress has at its disposal, and Congress needs to guard against abuse of that power. The budget conference report should include my point of order, which puts a safeguard in place that will help protect the pocketbooks of American taxpayers, including middle-class families, college students and entrepreneurs. We must maintain the pro-growth policies that have helped this economy perform so well. 
   "The last thing we should do is pull the rug from under the feet of America's small businesses, and roll back the tax relief that passed in 2001 and 2003. This relief has put money back into the pockets of middle-class families and entrepreneurs, helping to boost economic and job growth. The numbers speak for themselves: 22 straight quarters of economic growth and almost 7.9 million new jobs over the past 44 consecutive months.
   "Creating a 60-vote threshold is an insurance policy to make sure Congress focuses on eliminating government waste, fraud and abuse and not on the pocketbooks of taxpayers across Texas and across America."
   The Senate voted 63-35 earlier this year to include Sen. Cornyn's amendment in the Senate's version of the FY2008 budget.
