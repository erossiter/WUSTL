SEN. CORNYN: WORKING FAMILIES, FUTURE GENERATIONS TO BEAR BRUNT OF IRRESPONSIBLE BUDGET PROPOSAL
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement regarding the FY 2009 Budget introduced this afternoon by Senate Democrats. 
   "I would like to think both political parties can agree on some things - we need to balance the budget, create jobs, help working families and secure our country's economic future. Unfortunately, this year's budget again makes clear there are significant differences between the parties on how to achieve these goals. Republicans want to expand the budget of families across the country. Democrats want to expand the federal government's budget.
   "Senate Democrats are proposing massive tax increases on working families and billions of dollars in wasteful Washington spending, while doing nothing to reform entitlements and rein in our growing federal debt.
   "It's never a good day to raise taxes on working families and small businesses. It's never a good day to wash our hands of the entitlement tsunami that we all know is approaching. It's never a good day to allow the debt to grow. As we continue to borrow money from future generations to pay for the misguided programs of today, it is our children who will one day be left with the bill.
   "It is my hope that as the Senate considers this irresponsible budget in the days ahead, my Democratic colleagues will reject proposals to raise taxes on working families and saddle future generations with an unmanageable debt. We need a budget that is fiscally-responsible, protects families and sets our country on a path to a more secure economic future."
