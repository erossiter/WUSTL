SENATE PANEL RECEIVES DOCUMENTED CASES OF HOSTILITY TO RELIGION IN PUBLIC SQUARE
  The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, received an extensive report documenting numerous incidents of hostility to religious expression in the public square across the nation on Wednesday. The report was authored by the Liberty Legal Institute, of Plano, Texas, and prepared in response to questions issued by Sen. John Cornyn, chairman of the subcommittee, following a hearing he convened on June 8, entitled "Beyond the Pledge of Allegiance: Hostility to Religious Expression in the Public Square."
   The 51-page report documents countless acts of hostility towards, and discrimination against, expressions of faith by students, faculty, government employees, churches and religious organizations and ordinary citizens. The Liberty Legal Institute also identified three liberal organizations - People for the American Way, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State - as leaders in a nationwide campaign to remove religious expressions from the public square. 
   All three organizations have actively litigated against equal access for religious organizations in public schools, against school choice programs that give needy students equal access to parochial and nonsectarian schools alike, and against voluntary, student-led religious expression. In addition, the ACLU and Americans United have actively litigated to remove the Pledge of Allegiance from public schools.
   "Of course, no one will actually admit to being hostile to religious expression. They know full well that they are far more likely to advance their extreme ideology through the courts, rather than through the democratic process. So I was not surprised that, throughout the hearing, detractors denied that there was a real problem, let alone a pervasive one," Cornyn said. "That's why today's report by the Liberty Legal Institute is so important, and why I am so grateful that the Institute has completed its work and submitted it to my subcommittee." 
   Cornyn continued: "The campaign to purge expressions of faith from the public square is pervasive, national and well organized. The report not only contains page after page and example after example of hostility to religious expression, it also notes how this effort to cleanse the public square of all religious expressions is carefully orchestrated and organized by some of the nation's leading liberal special interest groups."
   Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights. He is the only former judge on the Judiciary Committee and served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge. He filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in November to defend the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled last year that it is unconstitutional for teachers to lead the pledge in public school classrooms because of the phrase "under God." This issue has taken on even greater visibility in light of the recent Supreme Court decision to consider two cases concerning the constitutionality of displays of the Ten Commandments in public spaces, including one from Texas.

   A sampling of incidents throughout the nation of hostility to religious expression in the public square follows: 
   (Sources: Liberty Legal Institute; testimony delivered on June 8, 2004)
   * A 12-year-old elementary school student was reprimanded by a public school in St. Louis, Missouri, for quietly saying a prayer before lunch in the school cafeteria, according to a federal lawsuit. The case was settled after the St. Louis School Board announced a new policy protecting the religious expression rights of students. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 11, 1996.)
   * A second grade school girl in Wisconsin was forbidden from distributing valentines during a Valentine's Day Exchange because her valentines happened to contain religious themes. After a federal lawsuit was filed, the school district settled the suit by publishing an apology to the student in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal and issuing a new policy protecting the religious freedoms of its students. (Capital Times (Madison), August 29, 2001.)
   * A kindergartener in Dayton, Ohio was forbidden by her public school teacher from distributing bags of jellybeans with an attached prayer to her classmates, according to a federal lawsuit. (AP, Feb 8, 2004.)
   * Public high school students in Massachusetts started a Bible club and tried to hand out candy canes with a Biblical passage attached. The school suspended the students for distributing the candy canes. A federal district court issued a temporary injunction against the school. (Westfield High Sch. L.I.F.E. Club v. City of Westfield, 249 F. Supp. 2d 98 (D. Mass. 2003).)
   * A public school sixth grader in Boulder, Colorado tried to complete her book report assignment by presenting the Bible, but was forbidden from doing so by her teacher. She was also forbidden from bringing the Bible to school. Only after a lawsuit was threatened did the school eventually back down. (Denver Post, December 13, 2002.)
   * According to a federal lawsuit, a public school teacher at Lynn Lucas Middle School in Houston, Texas, punished two sisters for carrying Bibles, confiscated and threw the Bibles into the trash, and threatened to call Child Protective Services, while another teacher forbade a third student from reading the Bible during free reading time and forced him to remove a Ten Commandments book cover from another book. The suit was ultimately resolved out of court. (Houston Chronicle, May 24, 2000.)
   * As explained in her Senate testimony, Nashala Hearn, a 12 year old girl in Muskogee, Oklahoma, was suspended for three days by her public middle school for wearing a hijab, a headscarf required by her Islamic faith. The school eventually backed down after intervention by the Justice Department. (Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, June 8, 2004.)
   * A Texas school district refused to hire a public school teacher for the position of assistant principal, because her children attended a private Christian school, in violation of the district's policy that the children of all principals and administrators attend public school. The district's policy was upheld by the federal district court but subsequently rejected on appeal. (Barrow v. Greenville Ind. Sch. Dist., 332 F.3d 844 (5th Cir. 2003).)
   * A Vietnam veteran and member of an honor guard at a New Jersey veterans' cemetery was fired for saying "God bless you and this family" to the family of a deceased veteran, even though the family had consented to the blessing beforehand. (Winston-Salem Journal, April 26, 2003.)
   * A public library employee in Logan County, Kentucky, was fired for refusing to remove her cross-pendant necklace while at work. A federal district court subsequently ruled that the library violated her constitutional rights. (American Libraries, October 1, 2003.)
   * As he explained in his Senate testimony, Barney Clark and other members of the Balch Springs Senior Center in Balch Springs, Texas, were forbidden from singing religious songs and appointing someone to bless their food at the city-owned senior center. The city eventually backed down, but only after a federal lawsuit and intervention by the Justice Department. (Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, June 8, 2004.)
