SEN. CORNYN: SENATE TAKES KEY STEP TO MAKE SALES TAX DEDUCTION PERMANENT, BENEFIT TEXAS TAXPAYERS
  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding unanimous Senate passage of an amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) to permanently extend the state and local sales tax deduction option for federal income taxes, currently set to expire at the end of this year:  
   "Passage of this amendment brings us one step closer to enacting important legislation to benefit Texas taxpayers. The measure is a matter of fundamental fairness. It will put our state's taxpayers on a level playing field with those in other states who can deduct their state income tax. Permanent extension of the deduction will allow Texas taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money, in particular middle-class families. It will also provide a direct boost to the economy in our state. I applaud Senator Hutchison for her efforts on the amendment."
   The amendment passed on Thursday was proposed to the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2008, S. Con. Res. 21, currently being considered by the Senate. 
   Sen. Cornyn is also a co-sponsor of the Permanent Sales Tax Deduction bill, S. 180, legislation introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison earlier this year.
