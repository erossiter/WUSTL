SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MOTION TO PROCEED TO IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. John Cornyn, top Republican on the Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee, made the following statement regarding today's vote by the Senate to proceed to a deeply-flawed immigration reform bill. Sen. Cornyn, along with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, voted against the decision to proceed to the legislation without adequate opportunity to amend it.  
   "Free and open debate is a hallmark of the United States Senate. So it is deeply disappointing that political expediency today took precedence over a serious public review of what is perhaps the most important domestic policy issue facing our country. 
   "On an issue as critical to America's future as immigration reform, there should be a full and fair debate conducted in the light of day before the American people. Instead, this process was conducted behind closed doors and the Majority Leader refused to allow Senators, such as myself, to even have important amendments considered. 
   "I have made clear that very serious loopholes exist in this bill, which strike at the heart of America's national security. Yet, the Senate failed to review, and even consider, efforts to fix it in a number of key areas. I fear that like in 1986, we are promising something to the American people that we cannot, and will not, deliver. If not addressed as the legislative process moves forward, this flawed bill will have very serious consequences for America's future security.
   "I have worked for years to find a common sense solution to our dysfunctional immigration system. I regret that a closed internal process this time has prevented several of my ideas from being considered, and has stopped the U.S. Senate from having a full and fair opportunity to debate and amend the current bill. Even so, I will continue to do my best to pursue a rational immigration policy, one that restores integrity and respect for our laws."
