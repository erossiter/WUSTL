SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding Veterans Day: 
   "On this Veterans Day, it's a time for us to pause and remember those who serve our nation so nobly and so patriotically in uniform, whether it's here in the United States or in far flung places across the planet. Also, it's a time for us to remember the families that support those men and women in uniform and those who have nobly served and no longer wear the uniform - our nation's veterans. It's our responsibility to give honor and to keep our commitments to those who have served this country so well and so nobly - and that's one of my highest priorities here in the United States Senate: to make sure we keep our priorities to our military, to our military families and to our veterans."
   In 1938, Congress passed a public law intended to honor every November 11 officially as "Armistice Day." After the end of World War II in 1954, Congress, wanting to recognize American veterans of all wars, passed a resolution to change the official name of "Armistice Day" to "Veterans Day."
