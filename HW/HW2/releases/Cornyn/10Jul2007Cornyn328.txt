SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW BOEING WORK IN SAN ANTONIO
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Monday regarding Boeing's plan to send 787 Dreamliners to San Antonio, creating up 400 jobs in the area:  
   "This is more proof that companies recognize the quality of the San Antonio workforce. And that San Antonio and Texas are great places to do business. This is good news for the area and further evidence that the Texas economy is growing."
   Sen. Cornyn toured the Boeing facility at the Port Authority of San Antonio last August to highlight the important work done there in support of national defense, and how its growth creates local jobs and benefits the San Antonio economy.
