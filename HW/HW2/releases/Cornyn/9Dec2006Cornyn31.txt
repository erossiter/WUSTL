SEN. CORNYN JOINS SENATE COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORTING FINAL PASSAGE OF CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. John Cornyn, Co-chair of the Senate U.S. India Caucus, made the following statement Saturday regarding unanimous Senate passage of the House-Senate conference report to S. 3709, the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement: 
   "India is one of our most reliable allies and has worked closely with our nation to fight the war on terror and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Passage of this cooperative agreement will further strengthen our strategic relationship and bring India into the mainstream of international nonproliferation efforts, while lessening India's dependence on fossil fuels. 
   "It was important to address this issue before Congress adjourned and send it to the President for his signature. This is good news and an important day for the U.S.-India partnership." 
   The U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, which will now be sent to the President for his expected signature, was announced by President Bush and Prime Minister Singh in New Delhi last March. It states that India will separate its military and civilian nuclear programs, making its civilian nuclear program almost completely transparent. Civilian facilities left under the program will be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency oversight.
