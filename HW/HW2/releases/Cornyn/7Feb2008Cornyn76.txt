SEN. CORNYN: CONFIRMING PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES MATTER OF FAIRNESS, SENATE DUTY
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding a renewed push to confirm President Bush's nominees. There are currently 180 nominees, judicial and non-judicial, waiting to be confirmed. 
   "These nominees have offered themselves for public service and deserve a simple up-or-down vote in the Senate. It is encouraging to see the President renewing his fight for their confirmation, and I hope our Senate colleagues will join in this effort.
   "Far too many judicial and executive nominees have been delayed by the majority party of the Senate. An up-or-down vote is a matter of fundamental fairness, and it is the Senate's constitutional duty to act on each nomination. It is also critically important to our judicial system and the proper functioning of our federal government to fill these positions.
   "Senators have a right to vote for or against any nominee-but blocking votes on nominations is unacceptable."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
