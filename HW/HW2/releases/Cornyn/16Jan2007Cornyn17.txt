SEN. CORNYN HELPS PASS MEASURE TO MAKE FEDERAL FUNDING PROCESS MORE OPEN
  Sen. John Cornyn, Vice Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and a strong advocate of open government, made the following statement Tuesday regarding unanimous Senate passage of an amendment to the Ethics Bill, S. 1, to increase transparency in the federal funding process, or specific allocations known as earmarks. Sen. Cornyn was an original co-sponsor of the amendment, introduced by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that enhances disclosure requirements for congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits.  
   "This is good news for taxpayers. This is their money and they deserve to see how it is being spent. It's also a victory for fiscal responsibility and open, honest government. I've long worked to bring more Texas sunshine to Washington D.C. and I'm pleased my Democrat colleagues ultimately joined us in supporting this effort today. It's an important step in the right direction. I will continue working with Senators from both parties on efforts to bring more transparency, accountability and responsibility to the federal government." 
   The Senate lobby reform bill introduced by the Senate Democrats originally required disclosure of just a small fraction of congressional earmarks, leaving taxpayers in the dark about thousands of pork barrel projects. As a result of this Republican-led effort, the Senate lobby reform bill now requires broad disclosure of earmarks, allowing taxpayers to see how their tax dollars are being spent. It requires full disclosure of earmarks, targetedtax and trade benefits, and all earmarks contained in committee reports, where approximately 95 percent of earmarks are inserted. A vote on the overall Ethics Bill is expected this week.
