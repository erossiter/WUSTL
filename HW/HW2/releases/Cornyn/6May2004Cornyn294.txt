SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH VA SECRETARY PRINCIPI
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Thursday following his meeting with VA Secretary Anthony Principi, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison and Rep. Chet Edwards to discuss the CARES Commission report which will be released Friday:
   "When Secretary Principi visited my office in December, and again in subsequent meetings, I found him to be well informed about the needs of Texas veterans. It is clear to me that he has listened to our concerns about the CARES commission and its recommendations.
   "I'm committed to continue working with the local community, Sen. Hutchison, Rep. Edwards, the Waco VA Task Force and other stakeholders to ensure the area's veterans have the access to the care they need, and that the policies set by the VA are in the best interest of the veterans of Texas and across America.
   "I appreciate Secretary Principi's efforts to improve access to healthcare for all veterans, and I will continue to press Waco's case until the last order is signed."
   Cornyn hosted Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony J. Principi, in his Washington office in December to discuss the pending CARES Commission report, Texas VA facilities, and the needs of Texas veterans.
