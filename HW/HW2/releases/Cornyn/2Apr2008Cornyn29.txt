SEN. CORNYN SEEKS ACTION ON FINAL FARM BILL
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn met with members of the Texas Farm Bureau on Capitol Hill today and said that he continues to advocate for their priorities as final negotiations continue on the Farm Bill. In attendance at the meeting with Sen. Cornyn were roughly 100 Texas Farm Bureau County Chairs and Texas Farm Bureau Board Members from throughout the state. 
   Sen. Cornyn expressed his frustration with the slow pace of the negotiations, stating, "Some Texas farmers have already planted their crops while congressional committee power plays are delaying the Farm Bill. It is time for negotiators to iron out remaining details that stay true to the legislation passed by both the Senate and the House."
   Sen. Cornyn also discussed efforts to reign-in skyrocketing farm input costs and the importance of a comprehensive immigration solution. "It's long past time for the federal government to meet its responsibilities and pass a comprehensive immigration bill," Sen. Cornyn said today. "Finally, those negotiating the farm bill should take care to avoid any tax hikes on individuals or businesses. With farm costs rising, the last thing we should even consider doing is burdening our farmers with new taxes and costly regulations."
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
