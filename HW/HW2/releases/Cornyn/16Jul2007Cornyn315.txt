SEN. CORNYN: SAN ANTONIO VA HOUSING FUNDING IMPORTANT PART OF COMMITMENT TO VETERANS
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Monday regarding the construction project at Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital in San Antonio receiving $10,527,000 through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): 
   "This funding is an important part of our commitment to honor our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation. It will allow important renovations at the Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital to move forward, providing tangible improvements in the lives of those who have served. We must continue doing all we can to ensure all veterans, active duty, National Guard and Reserve service members and their families receive the very best care, treatment and benefits. I'll continue working with Sen. Hutchison and others in the Texas congressional delegation in support of our state's veterans."
   The contract for building renovation was awarded by VA to McGoldrick Construction Services Corporation. The funding was appropriated in Fiscal Year 2004. Construction is expected to be completed in one and a half years.
