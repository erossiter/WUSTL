SEN. CORNYN ANNOUNCES $19,979,022 IN GRANTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION PREPARATION IN TEXAS
  Colleges and universities across Texas will receive $19,979,022 in federal grant funds for tutoring, mentoring and other assistance to help low-income high school students and veterans prepare for higher education, Sen. John Cornyn announced Monday. The funding comes through the U.S. Department of Education's Upward Bound program.
   "This funding will help ensure that low-income students and veterans are well-prepared and well-equipped to excel in higher education, which is so important to success in today's world," Sen. Cornyn said. "The tutoring, mentoring and other assistance provided through these programs will give a boost to students across Texas. In addition, in an increasingly global marketplace, the math and science preparation will help make sure America's students can compete with anyone in the world."  
   The grants will be used for academic instruction in math, laboratory sciences, composition, literature and foreign languages along with tutoring, counseling, mentoring and work-study programs. Upward Bound primarily benefits the following: high school students from low-income families; high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree; and low-income, first-generation military veterans who are preparing to enter postsecondary education. 
   On a related note, Sen. Cornyn has a strong record of working to enhance America's competitiveness in the global marketplace. He co-sponsored the bipartisan America COMPETES Act (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science), which recently passed the Senate. 
   Sen. Cornyn also convened a summit in Austin last year to focus on workforce partnerships, collaborations between community colleges and local employers (public-private partnerships), designed to equip employees with new skills or help them transition to better careers. He has met with community colleges and employers across Texas to promote initiatives that will maintain America's competitive edge. 
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
