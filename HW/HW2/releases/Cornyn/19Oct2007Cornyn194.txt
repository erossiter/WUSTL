SEN. CORNYN: TEXAS CONTINUES TO BE NATIONAL LEADER IN ECONOMIC GROWTH
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made the following statement Friday regarding continued, steady job growth in Texas, with 23,100 jobs added to Texas payrolls in September:  
   "These new job numbers are just the latest evidence that Texas continues to be a national leader in economic growth, business expansion and job creation. The best way to keep an economy thriving is through meaningful tax relief and good government stewardship. 
   "Unfortunately, the tax relief that helped cause the record economic growth in Texas is in jeopardy of expiring under new leadership in Congress. They are intent on inflating government programs and raising taxes on all Texans and Americans to do so. I hope Texans will join me in calling for the extension of across-the-board tax cuts that put more money back in the pockets of hard-working men and women, small business owners, and families." 
   Seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment in Texas grew by 23,100 jobs in September, for a total of 217,400 jobs in the past year. The Texas annual job growth rate is at 2.2 percent, surpassing the national rate of 1.2 percent.
