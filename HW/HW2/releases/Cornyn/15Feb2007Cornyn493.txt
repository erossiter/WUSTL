SEN. CORNYN HONORS BARBARA JORDAN, HECTOR GARCIA
  Sen. John Cornyn made the following statement Thursday regarding unanimous Senate passage of a bill to include the names of former Rep. Barbara Jordan and Dr. Hector P. Garcia, among others, in the title of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization of 2006. Sen. Cornyn was successful in getting both names included in the bill:  
   "It's fitting that we honor the legacies of Barbara Jordan and Hector P. Garcia, two legendary Texans, by permanently adding their names to the title of this law. 
   "Congresswoman Barbara Jordan fought passionately to improve the Voting Rights Act during her three terms in the U.S. House. Her accomplishments and admirers were legion.
   "Dr. Garcia led the way in fighting for civil rights and equality for Hispanic Americans. He answered the call of duty at every opportunity, serving his country in the military and making immense contributions in the medical field." 
   The bill, S. 188, changes the title of the recently reauthorized Voting Rights Act to: The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, Cesar Chavez, Barbara Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and Dr. Hector P. Garcia Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. It now moves to the U.S. House of Representative for approval.
