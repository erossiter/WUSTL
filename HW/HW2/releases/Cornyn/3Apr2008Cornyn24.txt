CPL. RUBIO TO BE GRANTED POSTHUMOUS CITIZENSHIP
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, announced Thursday that fallen U.S. Army soldier Cpl. Jose "Joe" A. Rubio Hernandez will be granted posthumous citizenship by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition, Rubio received lateral posthumous appointment to Corporal, from Specialist. 
   Sen. Cornyn said: "Cpl. Rubio gave his life defending America and protecting our freedom. Granting posthumous citizenship is an important way to honor his sacrifice and show gratitude for his service. I join his family and loved ones in mourning his loss, and assure them his sacrifice made our nation safer, stronger and freer."
   Congressman Cuellar said: "Jose's courage will live on in his family-his wife, child, brothers and sisters. He will serve as a role model to numerous others as they remember the true meaning of patriotism. Patriotism is believing in your country-the country that's in your heart-and Jose's heart belonged to the U.S. We're proud of his service to the U.S. and granting him with his citizenship."
   Sen. Cornyn attended a vigil for Cpl. Rubio last Friday in Mission. Mario Ortiz, District Director for USCIS in San Antonio, helped facilitate the posthumous citizenship.
