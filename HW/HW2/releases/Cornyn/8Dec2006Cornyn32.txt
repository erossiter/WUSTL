SEN. CORNYN PRAISES SENATE'S CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT GATES
Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding this evening's confirmation by the Senate of Dr. Robert Gates to serve as Secretary of Defense: 
 "The State of Texas' loss today is America's gain and I thank Dr. Gates for once again answering the call of public service. I believe he has the temperament and ability to lead the Department of Defense in what is the most important priority of the federal government - the defense of our nation and its people. 
 "Dr. Gates fully understands the need for victory in Iraq. He recognizes that failure would lead to increased terrorist activity by al-Qaeda and regional instability as Iran seeks to extend its sphere of influence. We cannot afford to simply pull the covers over our head and hope this problem will go away, or simply think that by immediately withdrawing from Iraq there will be no consequences. The enemy we face is bent on the death and destruction of our democracy and they will follow us here. 
 "The seriousness of this challenge that confronts our nation is bigger than any election or any political party. Dr. Gates recognizes that and I believe he will make an outstanding Secretary of Defense." 
 Sen. Cornyn participated in Gates' confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also met with him on Monday to discuss a wide range of issues including the situation in Iraq and the war on terror, transformation of the military and Texas defense priorities.
