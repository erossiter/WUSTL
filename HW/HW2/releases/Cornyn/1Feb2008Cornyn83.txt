SEN. CORNYN ENCOURAGES TEXANS TO GET HEART-HEALTHY DURING AMERICAN HEART MONTH
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today issued the following statement in support of American Heart Month (February) and the efforts of organizations such as the American Heart Association in educating Americans about steps they can take to prevent heart disease:
   "Heart disease has sadly become the leading cause of death among adults in our country. While it has already taken a dramatic toll on too many American lives, there is still time to reverse this dangerous trend through awareness, education, and lifestyle changes. 
   "I encourage all Texans, if they have not already, to use American Heart Month as an opportunity to adopt healthy habits that have been proven to reduce risks of heart disease, like exercise, a balanced diet, and quitting smoking.
   "On my part, I will continue to work to implement policies on the federal level-such as a bill I've introduced to prevent tobacco manufacturers from targeting young people-that promote preventive care and healthy lifestyles to turn the tide on deadly diseases and save more lives."
   Sen. Cornyn also announced today his support for the HEART for Women Act, legislation that seeks to prevent and improve early detection of heart disease and stroke among women. The bill would authorize increased funding to educate health care professionals about the prevalence and unique aspects of care for women in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The HEART for Women Act would also improve screening for low-income women at risk for heart disease and stroke.
   "I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in supporting the HEART for Women Act, which would equip the health community with advanced tools to educate women about the steps they can take to prevent heart disease and stroke-two of the leading causes of death among women today," Sen. Cornyn said.
   Sen. Cornyn has worked in the Senate to pass several other initiatives that support preventive health care and awareness efforts that teach families steps they can take to prevent disease and illness:
   * Introduced the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, S. 625, to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to keep tobacco manufacturers from enticing young people to smoke and reduce overall tobacco use. According to the American Heart Association, cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of premature death in the United States. More than 90,000 people die each year from heart diseases caused by smoking.
   * Has been a strong advocate for the Carol M. White Physical Education Program (PEP), a national effort that was created to help initiate, expand and improve physical education programs for K-12 students. According to the Texas Heart Institute, physical inactivity is a leading cause of heart disease and also increases the risk of developing other heart disease risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.
   * Supported the Senate-passed 2007 Farm Bill that includes several provisions to improve childhood nutrition. Sen. Cornyn secured an amendment to combat childhood obesity through the Food Stamp program-the largest federal nutrition program-and ensure the government does not encourage unhealthy diets.
   * Introduced the bipartisan Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act that would boost diabetes prevention and treatment efforts. Among other provisions, the bill would help monitor progress against diabetes by creating a National Diabetes Report Card to track prevention and screening efforts. It would also encourage states to do more to combat the disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among diabetics.
   Sen. Cornyn serves on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Budget Committees. In addition, he is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Border Security and Refugees subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee's Airland subcommittee. He served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
