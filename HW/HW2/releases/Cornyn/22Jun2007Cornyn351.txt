SENATE PASSES SENS. CORNYN, FEINSTEIN RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL DAY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS
  The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution on Friday introduced by. Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to create an annual National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11.
   The resolution is intended to focus attention on, and generate opposition to, a crime in which victims, primarily women and children, are trafficked into the United States by the thousands and coerced into lives of forced labor and sexual slavery. 
   "I believe most Americans would be shocked to learn that slavery continues to exist today - not just in remote parts of the world, but hidden away in communities across America," said Sen. Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We must keep working to eradicate human trafficking by raising awareness and strengthening efforts to combat it both abroad and here at home." 
   The resolution states that: "Congress supports the goals and ideals of observing the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11 of each year and all other efforts to raise awareness of and opposition to human trafficking."
   "Eliminating the scourge of human trafficking and slavery from our midst remains one of the most fundamental human rights issues of our time," Sen. Cornyn said. "So we must continue efforts to protect the victims of human trafficking and slavery, to punish the evildoers, and to prevent other innocent human beings from ever having to suffer the same fate." 
   The International Labor Organization estimates there are more than 12 million people in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor and sexual servitude at any given time. 
   -Background on Sen. Cornyn's efforts to combat human trafficking-
   * Sen. Cornyn introduced the Stop Trafficking of Persons (STOP) Act, in the 108th Congress, to strengthen U.S. efforts to combat human trafficking. This legislation would: specify that governments engaging in human trafficking are not immune from prosecution within the U.S. court system; require the U.S. State Department to include in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report accounts of steps foreign governments are taking to combat the sex tourism industry; and ensure that nongovernmental organizations investigating human trafficking in foreign countries are not required by U.S. law to notify foreign governments or targets of investigative activities. 
   * Sen. Cornyn helped pass the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 in the 108th Congress. This legislation would authorize appropriations to combat human trafficking, refined the criteria for judging whether countries meet standards for combating human trafficking, and created a new country "watch list." Since passage of this legislation, countries that, according to the Trafficking in Persons Report, do not cooperate in the fight against trafficking are subject to U.S. sanctions. 
   * Sen. Cornyn introduced the End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005, whichbuilt on the STOP Act by continuing to combat commercial sex trade activities by targeting the demand for this atrocity. This legislation would protect children from being exploited by these activities, prohibit the operation of sex tours, assist state and local enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial sexual activities, and reduce trafficking in persons. 
   * Provisions in Sen. Cornyn's End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005 were passed, in part, in the reauthorization of the anti-sex trafficking legislation last year - the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. 
   * The Senate unanimously passed a Cornyn-sponsored resolution in 2004 urging all states to adopt legislation that will ensure the full coordination of local, state and federal efforts to fight the scourge of human slavery and sex trafficking. 
   * In 2005, Sen. Cornyn chaired a hearing titled, "Examining U.S. Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery," in his capacity as then-chairman of the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights subcommittee.
