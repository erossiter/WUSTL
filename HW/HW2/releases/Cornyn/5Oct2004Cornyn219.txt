SEN. CORNYN ADDRESSES CLEAT CONVENTION
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, addressed the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas (CLEAT) convention in San Antonio on Saturday to emphasize federal, state and local cooperation, as well as providing law enforcement officials with the tools they need to keep Texas communities safe. 
   "Our first responders are the frontlines of our hometown security," Sen. Cornyn said. "Organizations like CLEAT represent many of our law enforcement personnel who, along with our firefighters and paramedics, are the ones who respond when we dial 9-1-1."
   Among the topics Sen. Cornyn discussed was the importance of federal funding through programs such as the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) program, which provided more than $6.8 million to Texas localities in the past year. The funding is used to hire or train new officers, increase security measures in local communities, and create multi-jurisdictional task forces to fight crime.
   In fiscal year 2004 alone, the Department of Justice provided more than $166 million dollars worth of grants and funding to jurisdictions in Texas to help fight crime. CLEAT has more than 14,000 members, including Texas police officers, deputy sheriffs, and detention officers.
   "It's absolutely critical that we work with local government and local organizations to do everything we can to give first responders what they need to be successful as they continue to protect us and provide us greater security here in our homeland and in our hometowns," Sen. Cornyn said.
   Sen. Cornyn served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.
