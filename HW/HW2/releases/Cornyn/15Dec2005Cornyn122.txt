SEN. CORNYN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ ELECTIONS
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement Thursday regarding the elections in Iraq:  
   "The elections in Iraq appear to be going very well. Voter turnout has exceeded all expectations and we're seeing broad participation from the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shiites. This has to be bad news for the Saddam loyalists and the foreign fighters who regard Iraq as the central front on the war on terror.
   "We may not know the final results of the election for some time, perhaps a matter of a few weeks, but, the Iraqis will have elected their first free representatives. They will be forming their permanent government and will determine for themselves what their future should be, as all democracies do. At the same time, we will see security efforts continue and begin to turn that over to the Iraqis as they become able to provide for their own security and eventually begin to bring our forces home." 
   Sen. Cornyn is a member of the following key Senate Committees: Armed Services; Judiciary; Budget, Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Joint Economic. Since joining the Senate in 2003, he has traveled to Iraq and the surrounding region twice.
