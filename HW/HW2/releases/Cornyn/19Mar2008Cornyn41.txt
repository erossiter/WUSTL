SEN. CORNYN RENEWS CALL FOR REFORM OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today said a new Department of Education pilot program to enhance state flexibility is a "good step forward," but that more needs to be done. Sen. Cornyn's renewed call for reform comes following the Department of Education's announcement yesterday to implement a pilot program designed to give up to 10 states increased flexibility to meet the mandates of the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
   "It's encouraging to see the Administration increasingly recognize that one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington have not served our children or teachers well. I hope the Department will also see the importance of expanding flexibility to include all of the states instead of limiting it to just 10 states. Sweeping federal mandates have placed onerous burdens on school systems, which have resulted in a tangled bureaucratic web of regulations that hamstring states, parents and students. Many educators are too busy checking the requirements of a federal 'to do' list, instead of focusing properly on each child's needs. This must change," Sen. Cornyn said today. 
   Sen. Cornyn renewed his call for the Senate to consider legislation he has introduced with U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that would give more decision-making power to parents and teachers. "The recent announcement by the Secretary of Education is a good step forward, but we can and must do more," Sen. Cornyn said. "Texas, for example, already had a strong accountability system prior to No Child Left Behind. Now, the new law requires teachers and administrators in our state to implement an entirely new set of regulations in addition to the already successful program. In every state, the federal government has consistently mandated bureaucracy in education - that has consistently produced poor results. Now is the time to give states the option to restore responsibility and authority in education and return decision-making where it belongs - with parents and teachers on a local level."
   The purpose of the Academic Partnership Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) Act is three fold. First, A-PLUS gives states maximum freedom to implement initiatives that work in their individual state. Secondly, A-PLUS reduces regulatory burdens associated with federal education programs so educators can focus on teaching rather than filling out paperwork. Finally, A-PLUS ensures that states are accountable to schools, parents and the general public for advancing the academic achievement of all students, especially disadvantaged children.
   Briefly, the bill would give all states the option to sign five-year performance agreements with the Secretary of Education that allow the state to accept NCLB funding while opting out of the NCLB requirements. The performance agreements would define the achievement/proficiency goals and annual assessments necessary to achieve the goals. States would have to submit annual reports documenting their progress towards achieving their goals. In short, A-PLUS preserves the accountability features of NCLB while improving the transparency for parents, teachers and taxpayers. Senator Cornyn's A-PLUS currently awaits action before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
