SEN. CORNYN: REMEMBER THOSE WHO PAID ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
  Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement regarding Memorial Day: 
   "On this Memorial Day, it's time to remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live in freedom and prosperity. But we also remember those families who support all the active-duty men and women in the service, including those in the Reserves and National Guard who have now been called to active duty.
   "As we remember the greatest generation, we must also remember the newest greatest generation - those who are serving with such great honor, nobility and purpose in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and around the world. Having inherited the blessings of liberty, the task now falls to us to make sure that we keep that freedom and that liberty for future generations.
   "And so, even when it's hard, when the news is tough and we are reminded once again that the war, and all war, is ugly and brutal - we must remember that our resolve is critical to support not only the troops in the battlefield, but also to the cause of liberty and justice for all."
