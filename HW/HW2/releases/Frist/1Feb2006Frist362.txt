SEN. FRIST SMART GRANT INITIATIVE PASSES HOUSE, AWAITS PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement:  
   "SMART grants will help us confront tomorrow's challenges today. As President Bush said in his address to the nation last night, our country's national security and global competitiveness depend on America's educated, hardworking citizenry. This legislation, which is now on its way to his desk, guarantees motivated students from underserved communities will have the resources they need to pursue degrees in math, science, engineering, technology, and critical foreign languages. I'm proud to have worked with my House and Senate colleagues to make this legislation a national priority, and I'm confident our efforts will help sustain America's legacy as a land of creation and innovation."
