SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO NATION
  U.S Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the president's national address:  
   "The president delivered a strong speech tonight, explaining why victory must be achieved in Iraq and outlining a brave and bold vision for the future of Iraq. While the fight ahead will remain a challenge, it's critical to our continued successes in the War on Terror. 
   "Just this past week, Iraq achieved another tremendous milestone by holdings its first election for a permanent representative government. With over 70% of all eligible voters defying terrorist threats and exercising their new democratic rights at the polls, December 15 marked another major milestone toward the vision of a free, democratic and prosperous Iraq. I applaud the Iraqi people for their bravery and their steadfast commitment to securing a free and democratic future. 
   "The American people will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Iraq as they move forward to rebuild and renew their country. I fully agree with the president that while there is always a place for thoughtful dissent here at home, the stakes are too high for us to allow political games and partisanship to detract from our objective of helping establish a free, stable and democratic Iraq. 
   "Tonight the president outlined a clear and cohesive strategy for achieving the goal of stable and sustainable democracy in the heart of the Middle East-a democracy that will serve as a model for others. Achieving this vision for Iraq is critical to our nation's security and to keeping the American people safe. And I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure our troops have the resources and support they need to finish the job. As the president said, we can win the war in Iraq, and we are winning the war in Iraq!"
