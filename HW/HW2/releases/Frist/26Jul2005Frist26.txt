SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON EGYPT BOMBING RESOLUTION
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the passage of a Senate resolution condemning the terrorist attacks in Egypt:  
   "The terrorist attacks on the resort city of Sharm el-Sheik were senseless, barbaric, and cowardly acts against innocent civilians. On behalf of my Senate colleagues and the American people, I express my deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and to the people of Egypt. 
   "These heinous attacks are another grim reminder of the indiscriminate brutality of our terrorist enemy. Egypt has been a friend and ally of the United States in the Global War on Terrorism, and we will stand in solidarity with the people of Egypt to confront and defeat this terrorist enemy." 
   In the early morning of July 23, 2005, the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, was struck by a series of explosions in a crowded hotel that killed dozens of Egyptians and foreign tourists from around the world, including a U.S. citizen, and injured approximately 200 others.
