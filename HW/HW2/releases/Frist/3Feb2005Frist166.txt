SEN. FRIST HAILS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF CLASS ACTION BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding committee passage of the Class Action bill:
   "I applaud the Judiciary Committee's swift passage of the Class Action Fairness Act with a bipartisan vote and without amendment. Chairman Specter has done an outstanding job of moving this bill expeditiously so that it can be brought to the floor next week. I hope this bipartisan cooperation continues. If we can succeed in passing a clean bill through the Senate, it is my expectation that the House will act quickly and we can send a bill to the President."
