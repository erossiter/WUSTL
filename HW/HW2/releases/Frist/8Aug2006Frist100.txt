SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION SHIFT IN POLICIES TOWARD CUBA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after news reports that the Department of Homeland Security might make a change to the Administration's U.S.-Cuba policy: 
   "This would be a great change in U.S. policy because it will allow for the reunification of Cuban families that have found refuge in third countries. Furthermore, it can create a wave of change for the Cuban people currently living under the yoke of despotism to rise up and demand their freedom. I encourage the Administration to continue to show leadership at a time when the Cuban people need it most."
   "I am disappointed that last week the Senate could not pass the Cuba Transition Act of 2006, which I cosponsored along with Senators Ensign and Martinez. I will try again to clear this bill through the Senate when we reconvene in September."
   This bill would have authorized assistance to the people of Cuba, encouraged a democratic election process and created a fund to support independent civil society-building efforts. It would have created the "Fund for a Free Cuba," which would have provided assistance to a transition government in Cuba and included assistance to political prisoners and their families, other dissidents, independent libraries, youth organizations, workers' rights activists, agricultural cooperatives, associations of the self-employed, journalists, economists, and medical doctors.
