SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF NORTH KOREA NONPROLIFERATION ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the Senate's passage of the North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006, which would add North Korea to the list of countries currently covered by the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act:  
   "I applaud my Senate colleagues for unanimously passing the North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006. I authored this legislation following the dangerous and provocative missile launches by North Korea earlier this month. If enacted, this legislation will authorize U.S. sanctions on foreign persons or companies that transfer missile and WMD-related items to North Korea or that buy such items from North Korea."
   "This Act will also reinforce the resolution unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council on July 15th. North Korea's recent missile launches illustrate the threat this regime poses to the American people, the people of the region, and peace and stability in East Asia. We must do everything within our power to prevent Kim Jong Il from obtaining additional materials to advance his weapons and missile program, and enactment of this legislation will enhance the tools available to the President to realize this objective."
   "I commend the Senate for approving this legislation that will help protect the American people from Kim Jong Il's dangerous regime."
