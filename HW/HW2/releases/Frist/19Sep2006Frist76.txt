SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate passed H.R. 5684, the Oman Free Trade Agreement:  
   "The 9/11 Commission Report recommended fostering relationships with moderate Middle East countries as a way to encourage development and more open societies. Passage of this trade agreement is an important step toward that end by strengthening our ties with an ally in the war on terror. It is unfortunate that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle obstructed this measure for so long, an identical version of which was approved earlier this year." 
   On June 29th of this year the Senate approved S. 3569 by a vote of 60 to 34. The language of S. 3569 and H.R. 5684 are identical.
