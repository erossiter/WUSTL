SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS ENERGY COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee unanimously approved S. 2197, the PACE-Energy Act, which Frist is cosponsoring:  
   "The PACE-Energy Act reflects the twin goals of preserving America's leadership in science and technology and ensuring a reliable supply of clean, affordable energy, both of which are critical to our economy and our quality of life. America's role as a global leader depends on our ability to generate new, innovative solutions to our nation's energy challenges. This forward-thinking legislation will help to ensure that we are training the scientists and engineers of tomorrow to tackle these difficult challenges and to preserve our competitive edge. 
   "The PACE-Energy bill is a key component of the competitiveness legislation I expect the Senate will consider later this year. I applaud the members of the Energy Committee for approving this measure on a bipartisan basis, particularly Chairman Domenici and Senator Alexander for their continued leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the great scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century occur in the United States of America."
