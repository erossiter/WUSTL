SEN. FRIST HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF BANKRUPTCY REFORM BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following Senate passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Bill:  
   "I'm pleased by today's Senate passage of the Bankrutcy Reform Bill. This legislation restores personal responsibility and fairness to an abused system. These common sense initiatives will provide needed consumer protections while ensuring that those who have the means to do so repay their debts. 
   "The Bankruptcy Reform Bill provides resources for meritorious cases while cutting out the fat of fraudulent and abusive filings. I'm proud of this overwhelmingly bipartisan vote and commend my colleagues for remaining focused on the issues that matter most to halting bankruptcy abuse. This passage is a great victory for the American people, and coupled with last month's passage of the Class-Action Reform Act, reflects our commitment to governing with meaningful solutions. 
   "I look forward to swift passage by the House of Representatives, and a final signature by the president."
