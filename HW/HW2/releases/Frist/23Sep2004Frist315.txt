SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $8.75 MILLION FOR TENNESSEE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 VA-HUD Appropriations Bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, includes $8.75 million for several Tennessee economic and community development initiatives.  
   "Economic development is critical to Tennessee, and the funding recommended in this bill supports a number of vital Tennessee projects," said Frist. "This bill will strengthen Tennessee communities while establishing programs that further bolster business, education and job growth in all parts of the state. I commend the Senate Appropriations Committee for supporting critical Tennessee community development projects."
   "This bill funds local priorities in communities across Tennessee such as economic development, the environment and public housing initiatives," said Alexander. "From the revitalization efforts in Nashville, to the extension of water services to Pikeville, to the efforts of the Memphis Biotech foundation, the Senate has made significant investments in our state. I will continue to work with Senator Frist and our colleagues to fund these important community projects."
