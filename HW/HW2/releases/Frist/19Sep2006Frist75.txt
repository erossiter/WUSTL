SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS APPOINTMENT OF SUDAN ENVOY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the President announced he would appoint former USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios as a Presidential Special Envoy to Sudan:  
   "I have long supported the appointment of a new special envoy to coordinate our efforts to end the genocide in Darfur and deal with other political flashpoints in Sudan. The looming expiration of the mandate for African Union peacekeepers in Darfur has made the need for high-level diplomatic engagement all the more urgent. I believe that Andrew Natsios is an outstanding choice and I look forward to working with him.
