SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY RIDGE'S RESIGNATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:        
   "Tom Ridge has made significant contributions to the continued safety and security of the United States. Just over three years ago, Secretary Ridge answered President Bush's call to duty by becoming the first homeland security adviser and overseeing the monumental creation of a new Cabinet-level agency. Throughout his tenure, Tom Ridge led with resolve and confidence. 
   "Tom Ridge is committed to protecting our country and its citizens. He faced significant challenges in coordinating the agencies and organizations responsible for securing our nation. I applaud Secretary Ridge for his sacrifice and patriotism, and wish him and his family well for their future."
