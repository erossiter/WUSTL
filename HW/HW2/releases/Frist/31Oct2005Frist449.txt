SEN. FRIST COMMENDS U.N. RESOLUTION ON SYRIA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding Syrian cooperation with the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri:  
   "I commend today's U.N. Security Council Resolution that demands Syrian cooperation with the investigation into the politically motivated assassination of Prime Minister Hariri. The Security Council passed the resolution unanimously and demonstrated the international community's intent to bring to justice those responsible for Prime Minister Hariri's death. 
   "The U.N.'s Mehlis report reveals that Syria has failed to fully cooperate with the investigation. It also strongly suggests that the assassination could not have happened without the knowledge of senior Syrian officials. 
   "I strongly urge the Syrian government to come forth with any and all information relating to Prime Minister Hariri's death. And, I continue to encourage the United States and the international community to pressure the Syrian government to come clean, cooperate fully in the investigation, and bring those responsible to justice."
