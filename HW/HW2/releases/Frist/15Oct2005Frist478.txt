SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SUCCESS OF IRAQI REFERENDUM TO APPROVE CONSTITUTION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the successful conduct of the October 15 referendum to approve of Iraq's constitution:  
   "This weekend's successful national referendum on Iraq's permanent constitution marks yet another historic moment for the Iraqi people and their new democracy. Once again, millions of Iraqis demonstrated courage and determination in defying violence, threats and intimidation by participating in the referendum. 
   "Although segments of Iraq's Sunni population opposed the constitution, it now is vital for all Iraqis to work together in order to prepare for the next step in Iraq's democratic transition. The upcoming national elections in December will lead to a new Iraqi government that will implement the constitution and will provide the Iraqi people with another opportunity to move Iraq forward on its path to freedom and democracy. 
   "Throughout the summer, we witnessed the complex and painstaking nature of the constitution drafting process. The product is a result of patience, flexibility, and compromise. I commend Iraq's leaders and the Iraqi people on reaching out to all segments of Iraqi society and for their bravery exhibited during the referendum. 
   "While we can expect the terrorists to continue their attacks, they will not derail Iraq's continued political progress. I believe the success of the political process is the basis by which all Iraqis will eventually rise up in opposition to the terrorists and their dark view of the world. The new constitution lays a solid foundation for a stable and democratic Iraq in the heart of the Middle East that will provide hope and opportunity for all. The United States will continue to support the Iraqi people as they prepare for the December elections and continue to build a free and democratic Iraq."
