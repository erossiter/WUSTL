SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON CORNYN-KYL BORDER SECURITY FUNDING PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding a proposal by Sens. Cornyn (R-Texas) and Kyl (R-Ariz.) to devote an additional $3.7 billion in emergency funding to secure the border:  
   "This proposal recognizes the importance of border security as the first step in achieving comprehensive immigration reform. The Republican Congress has devoted significant resources to strengthen our border defenses, and I commend Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl for emphasizing our continuing border needs as the reform process moves forward. Their plan is an important element of a full immigration reform proposal that protects the border, puts a good employment enforcement system into place, and takes on the problem of the 12 million who are here illegally."
   The Homeland Security appropriations bill, which the Senate passed earlier this month, provided more than $14 billion to strengthen the nation's border defenses. Under this legislation, the Republican Congress added 2,000 new border patrol agents, bringing the total to 14,320 agents, and increased new detention beds by 5,000, bringing the total to 25,300 beds.
