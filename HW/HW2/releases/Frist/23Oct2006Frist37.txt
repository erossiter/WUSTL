SEN. FRIST, REP. HASTERT COMMENT ON SENDING SECURE FENCE ACT FOR PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) and Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) made the following statement after sending the Secure Fence Act to the president for his signature:  
   "Today we are transmitting H.R. 6061, Secure Fence Act of 2006, to the President. This legislation is a key component to keeping America safe and stemming the tide of illegal immigration. The American people demand a secure border, and this Republican Congress has responded to the American people's demand for a secure border by increasing the physical barriers and infrastructure along the border, and by providing state of the art monitoring technology. We look forward to the President's signature of this legislation. 
   "Unfortunately, the House and Senate Democrat Leaders voted against the Secure Fence Act. The Democrat immigration plan would fail the American people, allow dangerous criminals into our country and would set our homeland security back to pre-9/11 levels."
