SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate unanimously passed legislation to reauthorize the Education Flexibility Partnership Act (Ed-Flex):  
   "Today's Ed-Flex extension marks another milestone in turning control of federal education resources over to those in the best position to use those funds most effectively: educators. I authored the original legislation to create Ed-Flex in 1999 after hearing from school administrators and education leaders about the bureaucratic obstacles that were impeding their ability to improve education through innovative instruction methods. Ed-Flex eliminates some of the strings attached to federal funds in exchange for greater accountability for student achievement. America's students need the best education possible to succeed in the global economy. Ed-Flex allows educators to improve the quality of education free from bureaucratic interference."
