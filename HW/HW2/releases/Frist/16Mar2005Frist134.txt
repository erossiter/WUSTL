SEN. FRIST CONGRATULATES IRAQIS ON FIRST MEETING OF NEW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the first meeting of newly-elected Iraqi National Assembly:  
   "I congratulate the Iraqi people and their democratically elected representatives on the first meeting of the new Iraqi National Assembly. This is an historic achievement for the Iraqi people and a reflection of their courage and determination, which led to the success of the January elections. 
   "I urge the National Assembly to form a government quickly so that the great work of writing and ratifying a new constitution can begin and the democratic process can continue in Iraq. Today, we witnessed a remarkable step in the process of building a free and democratic Iraq, and I'm confident that this new National Assembly will help fulfill the hopes and dreams of the Iraqi people. 
   "The transformative power of liberty is evident in Iraq's transition to democratic government. The United States of America will continue to stand by and support the Iraqi people in their efforts to build a free and prosperous Iraq." 
   On January 30, 2005, more than 8 million brave Iraqis defied the terrorists and voted for Iraq's first freely-elected parliament in half a century. Frist traveled to Iraq just weeks prior to the election to visit with U.S. troops and discuss the situation in Iraq with a variety of Iraqi political leaders. The 275-seat assembly is charged with forming a government, drafting a permanent democratic constitution, and preparing Iraq for the next round of elections scheduled for late 2005.
