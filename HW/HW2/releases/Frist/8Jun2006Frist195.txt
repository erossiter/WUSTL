SEN. FRIST PRAISES PLAN TO KEEP MEDICARE DRUG PREMIUMS LOW
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Administration announced plans to keep Medicare Part D premiums low for low-income earners:  
   "Today's announcement ensures that low income seniors will continue to benefit from low prescription drug premiums generated by fierce competition in the Medicare program. This is a good first step for the poorest among us, but it is not enough. I will do everything in my power to make certain the Administration acts to ensure that all seniors continue to see low premiums. We must keep our commitment to provide America's seniors with the health security they need and deserve through this benefit."
