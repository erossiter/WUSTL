SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF PENSIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Pensions Protection Act (H.R. 4):  
   "Promises made to the American worker will be promises kept with the passage of this pension bill. We have protected the interests of retirees by strengthening pensions funding rules and making permanent the retirement security provisions from the 2001 tax bill, which is a major step toward making the president's tax cuts permanent. This bill also protects the American taxpayers from having to assume airline pension plans by providing responsible, targeted relief." 
   The pension bill had bipartisan support and carried out the most extensive reforms to U.S. pension laws in more than 30 years. This bill updated and improved outdated pension funding rules, which no longer served the interests of hard-working Americans and retirees. The bill also addressed: 
   * Tightening funding requirements so employers make more cash contributions to their worker pension funds; 
   * Closing loopholes that allow under-funded plans to skip making cash pension payments; 
   * Prohibiting employers and union leaders from digging the hole even deeper by promising extra benefits if their pension plan is significantly under-funded; 
   * Strengthening disclosure to give workers and retirees more information about the status of their pension plan; 
   * Protecting multiemployer pension plans for workers and their employers; 
   * Restricting "golden parachute" executive compensation arrangements while the retirement security of rank-and-file workers remains at risk; 
   * Giving workers new access to face-to-face, personally tailored professional investment advice; and 
   * Shielding taxpayers from a possible multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout of the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
