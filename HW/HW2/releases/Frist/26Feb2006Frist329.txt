SEN. FRIST RESPONDS TO REQUEST BY DP WORLD FOR FURTHER U.S. REVIEW OF PORT DEAL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following the announcement by Dubai Ports World of the United Arab Emirates allowing a broader U.S. review of the deal:  
   "Last week, I asked for a full review of the DP World deal by the administration. 
   "Upon my recommendation, DP World has agreed to segregate its US operations and request a full national security review from the CFIUS. 
   "I hope DP World will submit its request for CFIUS review as soon as possible. It is my expectation that CFIUS agree to DP World's request to begin a full 45-day review to bring a sharp and comprehensive focus on this deal and how it impacts our national and homeland security. If CFIUS acts as I expect, I will recommend to the Senate that we await the outcome of that work before deciding on any legislative steps related to the DP World deal. 
   "In the meantime, I expect the full and vigorous oversight process by Senate committees will continue to explore all aspects of this arrangement, our security at our ports, our foreign and trading relations, and the best way to reform the CFIUS process to bring greater transparency and understanding to it, so that as we go forward, national and homeland security is enhanced."
