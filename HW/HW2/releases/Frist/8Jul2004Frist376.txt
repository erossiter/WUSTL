SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON CLASS ACTION CLOTURE VOTE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement on the attempt to invoke cloture on S. 2062, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004:  
   "Over the past two days, many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have come down to the Senate floor to express their support for class action reform. 
   "We also made every attempt to provide members an opportunity to offer and debate amendments related to the legislation. However, a minority of Senators preferred to use this piece of legislation as a vehicle for miscellaneous political amendments. This is a missed opportunity. 
   "We all know there is only one way to support class action reform: you must vote Aye when the roll is called. Unfortunately some of my colleagues are choosing politics over enacting good public policy. Voting against cloture on this bill delays relief to our judicial system, our economy and hurts average Americans."
