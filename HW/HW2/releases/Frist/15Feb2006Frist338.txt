SEN. FRIST HONORS PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER OF REP. JENKINS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after Rep. Bill Jenkins (R-Tenn.) announced his intention to retire at the conclusion of the 109th Congress:  
   "No one cares more deeply about the people of the First District than Bill Jenkins. His heart and soul lie in the values of upper East Tennessee, and he has been a tireless advocate for the region throughout his five terms in Congress. I will miss his wise counsel and the commonsense approach he always adopted when tackling the issues facing our nation.
   "Bill's decision to retire will end a long tradition of public service. As a judge, member of the TVA board, speaker of the state House, and congressman, Bill has devoted much of his life to the people of Tennessee. Because it is deeply ingrained in his character and countless accomplishments, the spirit of Bill's public career will live on for years to come."
