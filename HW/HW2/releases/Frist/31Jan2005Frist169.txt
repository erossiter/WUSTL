SEN. FRIST HAILS IRAQI ELECTIONS
  Statement by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-TN:
   I congratulate the Iraqi people on their participation in this election.  
 I am particularly heartened by reports of participation by women. On this historic day for the nation of Iraq, we should honor all of those who sacrificed their lives to make this possible. The willingness of the Iraqi people to vote under the specter of violence speaks to the power of democracy and the passion for freedom.
   While it will take several days before the results are known, I encourage the newly elected leaders to continue on the path to democracy. These elections are only the first step in that journey.
