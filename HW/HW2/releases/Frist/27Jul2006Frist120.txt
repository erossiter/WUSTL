SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOUSE PASSAGE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the House passed legislation promoting electronic health records:  
   "This legislation takes us a step closer to my health care vision of a patient-centered, consumer driven, provider-friendly system fueled by information, choice and control. Electronic medical records can improve health care quality, protect patient privacy, promote the secure exchange of lifesaving information and seamlessly integrate health care quality standards with information technology. 
   "In light of the Institute of Medicine's extensive report, I want to thank the House Leadership for making this legislation a priority. I look forward to quickly conferencing the House and Senate legislation." 
   Last November, the Senate unanimously passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act - bipartisan legislation coauthored by Frist - that creates a secure, interoperable health information technology (IT) infrastructure that, in conjunction with the quality measurement system established in the legislation, will help reduce costs, enhance efficiency and improve overall patient care. 
   The National Academies' Institute of Medicine released the most extensive report ever conducted on medication errors. It found that at least 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured or killed each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing and taking medications. 
   On average, a hospital patient is subjected to one medication error each day, and the extra expense of treating drug-related injuries in hospitals alone is $3.5 billion per year. The report recommends increased use of electronic health records and electronic prescribing tools.
