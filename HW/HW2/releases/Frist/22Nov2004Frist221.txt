SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Omnibus Conference Report, which the Senate passed late Saturday, includes more than $4 million for Tennessee commerce, justice and state projects. The conference report will now go to the President for his signature.   
   "This funding will help Tennessee protect and equip our law enforcement agencies, educate our children, and foster partnerships between public and private institutions that will grow community businesses," said Frist. "These projects will inspire economic growth and provide better protection to our citizens, and I'm pleased that they've been included in this conference report." 
   "We must do all we can to keep our citizens safe," said Alexander. "This bill funds equipment needs for our police officers, youth programs to keep children out of trouble, and an ozone study in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park to monitor air pollution." 
   The Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Bill was passed as part of the FY 2005 Omnibus Conference Report. The Tennessee funding in the bill includes: 
   WEST TENNESSEE 
   * $1.5 million for the City of Memphis and Shelby County to install a regional law enforcement communications system to improve emergency communications.  
   * $75,000 for the Shelby County Youth Violence and Gang Prevention Initiative. This initiative will serve as the focal point for all activities related to youth services, including gang, drug, and crime prevention, as well as counseling and family support. 
   * $375,000 for the Leadership Institute in Judicial Education at the University of Memphis to support intensive training programs for judges, judicial educators and court administrators. During its 13-year history, over 400 judges, judicial educators, and court administrators from 44 states have participated in the program. 
   * $100,000 for the City of Martin Police Department to install in-care video systems. This equipment will enhance enforcement capabilities and improve officer safety.

   * $300,000 for the East Tennessee Ozone Study to monitor ground-level ozone and other air pollutants in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
