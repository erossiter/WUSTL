SEN. FRIST DISCUSSES U.S. INDIA NUCLEAR DEAL
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn) made the following statement after a telephone call with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation bill:  
 "I spoke today by telephone with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding the pending legislation to authorize civil nuclear cooperation between the United States and India. I assured Prime Minister Singh that one of my top priorities for the remainder of this Congress is to enact this legislation, and I told him I am confident that we will be able to complete congressional action on it this week.
 "Prime Minister Singh stressed that there are a number of provisions in the House and Senate-passed bills that are problematic for the Indian government because they depart from the understanding reached with President Bush on this issue on July 18, 2005. We discussed several of these provisions, and I assured him that the conferees are well aware of the Indian government's concerns. I noted that I had appointed myself as a conferee in order to be able to participate personally in the process of refining the legislation, and assured him that we are working on the issues of concern to India. 
 "The enactment of this legislation will lead to a much more friendly and robust relationship between the United States and India. I told him we share that objective and are working hard to produce legislation that would help our two nations achieve it." 
 Yesterday Senator Frist appointed Senate conferees, and the conferees have begun working with the House of Representatives to produce a conference report that we can pass and send to the President later this week.
