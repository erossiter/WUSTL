SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CONFIRMATION TO COURT OF APPEALS FOR D.C. CIRCUIT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after Senate confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit: 
   "Today, principle has won a victory over partisan judicial obstruction. After almost two years, the Senate has finally given Janice Rogers Brown the respect and the up or down vote that she deserves. With the confirmation last week of Justice Owen and today's confirmation of Justice Brown, we continue to make progress on the principle of up or down votes. I hope we can continue working together to do our constitutional duty as Senators and give other judicial nominees the fair up or down votes they deserve."
