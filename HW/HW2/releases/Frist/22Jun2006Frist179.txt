SEN. FRIST HAILS CONTINUED PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate confirmation of two new District Court judges:  
   "Today the Senate continued its progress on confirming qualified judicial nominees to the federal bench with the confirmations of Andrew J. Guilford for the United States District Court for the Central District of California and Frank D. Whitney for the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina." 
   "These confirmations mark another step forward in restoring fairness to the judicial nominations process, demonstrating that the United States Senate is committed to ensuring that qualified judicial nominees get a fair up-or-down vote. As Majority Leader, I'm committed to confirming qualified nominees to the federal judiciary who will interpret the law strictly and not legislate from the bench." 
   Currently 95 percent of all judgeships are filled, including 91.1 percent of all circuit court judgeships and 96 percent of all district court judgeships. Since Senator Frist became Majority Leader, the Senate has made considerable progress on President Bush's judicial nominees, including confirming two Supreme Court Justices, 29 circuit court judges, and 119 district court judges, and decreasing the number of circuit court vacancies by 36 percent. Overall, the Senate has confirmed 89 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees, giving him the highest confirmation rate of federal judges since President Reagan.
