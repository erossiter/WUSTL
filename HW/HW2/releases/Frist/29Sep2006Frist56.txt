SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report:  
   "Building on the national security agenda, this legislation puts forth the funds necessary to strengthen security at our borders, ports, chemical plants and transit systems and also revamps our nation's disaster response. The Republican lead Congress is responding aggressively to the security demands required to fight and win the battle against terrorism. 
   "To combat illegal immigration, Congress will add 1,500 new border patrol agents, increase new detention beds by 6,700 and provide $1.2 billion for border fencing, vehicle barriers, technology and infrastructure. 
   "This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to require high risk chemical plants to implement security measures that will prevent terrorist attacks. DHS will also have the authority to audit, inspect, and shut down facilities failing to comply with agreed upon security standards. I applaud the hard work of my colleague Senator Susan Collins in reaching an agreement on these provisions. 
   "With this legislation, Congress will improve the autonomy of FEMA within DHS allowing the Director to report more directly to the President. It is critical that FEMA respond more quickly and effectively to major disasters in which local communities are overwhelmed, and these reforms will aid in that priority. 
   "Our enemies continue to adapt and change their tactics, so we need to focus our resources to fill gaps in our national defense systems. I look forward to the President signing this bill into law, which will make American communities safer."
