SENS. FRIST, GREGG ISSUE STATEMENT ON FY06 BUDGET RECONCILIATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) today released the following statement:  
   "Congress' fall legislative agenda has been significantly modified due to the tragic events caused by Hurricane Katrina. In consultation with Chairman Gregg and those Senate committee chairmen who had been instructed to report recommendations related to outlay reduction reconciliation legislation to the Senate Budget Committee, a modified schedule has been decided. The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has announced that the committee will report the package of recommendations on October 26, 2005. 
   "This decision will allow the Congress and committees to address the immediate concerns related to the recent hurricane and not be encumbered by budget reconciliation requirements in the near term. In consultation with the Senate Parliamentarian's Office, this decision to delay reporting by the Budget Committee will not jeopardize the privileged status of any reported reconciliation bill."
