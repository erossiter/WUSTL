SEN. FRIST URGES HUMANITARIAN AID FOR DARFUR
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today called for the Senate to grant authority to the Secretary of State to draw upon federal resources to provide humanitarian support and assistance to the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. 
   "A survey of mortality rates by the World Health Organization was released today concluding that as many as 10,000 people are dying from disease and violence each month in the Darfur region of Sudan. This further highlights the need to urge the United Nations to move forward with a full and unfettered investigation into the atrocities in Darfur, and to bolster humanitarian assistance for the people of Darfur. 
   "Today's action answers the call by President Bush and Secretary of State Powell to provide additional funding to help aid the people of Darfur and to support the African Union force that is attempting to provide monitors and security to the people of the area. The Government of Sudan has failed to take credible steps to comply with the demands of the international community and now the international community must take decisive steps to act. But the people of Darfur shouldn't continue to suffer from lack of food, water, shelter and medical care in the meantime." 
   The language was attached to the Senate Foreign Operations Bill and would grant authority to the Secretary of State to draw up to $150 million from the Iraq reconstruction fund to provide humanitarian assistance in Sudan's Darfur region.
