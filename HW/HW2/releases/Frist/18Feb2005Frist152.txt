SEN. FRIST PRAISES CLASS ACTION REFORM BILL SIGNING
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after President Bush signed the Class Action Fairness Act into law:  
   "Today's bill signing is a victory for American consumers and entrepreneurs. The Class Action Reform Act takes a significant first step to reining in lawsuit abuse. It ends the practice of 'judge shopping' class actions in 'lawyer friendly' state courts and establishes a consumer bill of rights that ensures class action settlements justly compensate legitimate victims, not enrich their lawyers. This bill helps restore justice and fairness to our court system. I'm hopeful that the swift passage of this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill reflects a continuing commitment by members of both chambers to put good policy ahead of partisan politics. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and look forward to building on this momentum as we continue moving America forward."
