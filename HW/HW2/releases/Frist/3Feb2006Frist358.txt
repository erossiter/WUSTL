SEN. FRIST PRAISES COAL MINE SAFETY PROVISIONS IN TAX LEGISLATION
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Tax Relief Extension Act that includes two critical mine safety provisions:  
   "These commonsense provisions will help improve mine safety. I will continue working on this critical issue with my colleagues to ensure that Congress addresses mine safety in a responsible manner." 
   The first provision provides immediate expensing for 50 percent of the cost of qualified underground mine safety equipment such as communications technology, electronic tracking devices, emergency breathing equipment and atmospheric monitors. 
   The second provision provides a tax credit for training mine rescue team members. This credit is intended to offset 20 percent of the cost of training a miner to serve on a mine rescue team (up to a maximum of $10,000). In an effort to encourage companies to quickly build up their mine rescue capabilities, the credit will be available for only the next three years. 
   The legislation now moves to a conference committee, which will reconcile differences in the bills passed by the House and Senate.
