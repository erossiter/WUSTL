SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORTED CAPTURE OF CHARLES TAYLOR
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the reported capture of former Liberian warlord and dictator Charles Taylor:  
   "I am pleased to hear the reports that former Liberian warlord and dictator Charles Taylor has been apprehended. Under his brutal rule, Liberia descended into instability, violence, and civil war. 
   "Taylor also fomented unrest in neighboring countries, stands accused of war crimes and atrocities, and was a severe threat to the peace and stability of the region. Since his ouster in 2003, Taylor has reportedly attempted to undermine Liberia's democratic transition from his asylum in Nigeria. 
   "It is important for the future of Liberia and the peace and security of West Africa that Charles Taylor finally be held accountable for his crimes. I applaud Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's principled stand that Taylor be apprehended and stand trial. For the sake of the region, and the best interests of the Liberian people, Charles Taylor must now be brought to justice."
