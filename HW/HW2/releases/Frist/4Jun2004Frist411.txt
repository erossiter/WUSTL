"This funding is an investment in Tennessee, and I applaud the Department of Homeland Security for supporting the critical work of our firefighters."  
   "I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security's investment in the Benton County and Livingston communities for emergency preparedness," Alexander said. "This grant will help give firefighters the vital resources they need to save lives. Senator Frist and I will continue to work together to ensure that they have the necessary resources to keep our citizens safe."
