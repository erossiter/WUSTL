SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON OFFSHORE ENERGY PRODUCTION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after he and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues today announced that an agreement has been reached that will expand domestic production of oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico:  
   "I'm pleased that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to give American consumers access to more American energy. This agreement will help make America more energy independent and will help ease the burden on hard-working families who are feeling the pinch of high energy prices. Our national security demands that we work to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign sources of energy, and this agreement will do just that. I look forward to considering it on the floor of the Senate in the near future." 
   This agreement builds on legislation reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in April. It will allow leasing in the so-called Lease Area 181 and an additional area just south of the 181 Area. 
   The agreement provides historic protections for the State of Florida by establishing a 125-mile buffer in Florida waters through the year 2022 and by protecting military training activities in the Gulf. 
   In addition, it also provides a fiscally-responsible revenue-sharing system for revenues generated by new leases in certain areas in the Gulf.
