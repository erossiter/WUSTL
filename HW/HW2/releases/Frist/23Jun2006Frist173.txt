SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY MINETA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta announced his resignation: 
   "Norm Mineta has compiled an impressive record as the longest-serving transportation secretary in American history. An effective partner for President Bush from the beginning of this administration, Secretary Mineta faced challenges after 9-11 never encountered by his predecessors. His decisive, bold response to the events of that day helped Americans feel safe flying again, and his dedication to strengthening America's infrastructure has helped make all forms of transportation safer and more efficient. I wish Secretary Mineta well as he enters this new phase in life."
