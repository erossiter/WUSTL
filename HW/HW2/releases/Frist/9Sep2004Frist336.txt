SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS ADMINISTRATION'S FINDINGS ON DARFUR
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today applauded the findings released by the Administration in regards to atrocities occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan.  
 His comments are the result of a hearing today by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Sudan where Secretary of State Powell testified. 
   "President Bush and Secretary Powell have shown immense leadership in addressing the crisis in Darfur. I applaud Secretary Powell's testimony and the newly released State Department report for bringing critical focus to the atrocities in Sudan. Secretary Powell's determination that genocide has occurred, and that the Government of Sudan bears responsibility for this, is consistent with the conclusion reached by the United States Congress in late July. During my visit in August to a UN camp in Eastern Chad it was clear to me that genocide was occurring and that the international community must act. It is now up to the United Nations to take more decisive action, beginning with making the determination that what is occurring is genocide.The people of Darfur can't afford anymore delay." 
   Frist traveled to Eastern Chad in early August where he met first-hand with refugees displaced from Darfur. He also traveled to Southern Sudan and Kenya. He also joined State Department officials to listen to the personal testimony of several refugees.
