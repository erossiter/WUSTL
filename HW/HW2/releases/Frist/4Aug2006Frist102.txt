SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON JULY JOBS NUMBERS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced the latest jobs report for the month of July:  
   "An exuberant U.S economy churns along with 35 straight months of job growth and over 5 million new jobs created since August of 2003. Despite the cost of living squeeze imposed by high gas prices, consumer confidence remains strong further reinforcing the resiliency of this economy. We must continue to lead in Congress with pro-growth policies that help move us toward greater energy independence and provide a fair tax system for American families and businesses."
