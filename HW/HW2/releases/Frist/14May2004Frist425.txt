SEN. FRIST HONORS ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION DECISION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement commemorating Monday's 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision: 
   "On Monday, America will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the monumental Brown v. the Board of Education Supreme Court decision. On May 17th, 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the 'separate but equal' doctrine that had been established by Plessy v. Fergusson nearly 60 years earlier. The Brown v. Board ruling is considered by many to be the most important Supreme Court decision of the twentieth century. It energized the civil rights movement and the victories that would follow, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And it catalyzed a tectonic shift in our nation's social consciousness. 
   "Fifty years on, America has undergone a dramatic transformation. No longer is segregation an accepted, let alone celebrated, way of life. We recoil at the pictures of the Little Rock Nine being jeered and threatened by angry, white protesters. We hail the courage of those who led us forward, and we tell their story so that we may always aspire to America's true purpose so powerfully expressed in our founding: that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." 
   Frist will join President Bush, Education Secretary Rod Paige, fellow lawmakers and others in Topeka, Kansas, on Monday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. The event is organized by the Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission, and will also mark the opening of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site.
