SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON TENNESSEE DELEGATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT FOR STATE HOSPITALS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement in response to Rep. Harold Ford's comments regarding efforts to ensure 15 Tennessee hospitals receive awarded Medicaid payments:  
   "Congressman Ford is using Tennessee's hospitals as pawns in his game of partisan politics. His accusation that I have 'not taken the lead... to protect Tennessee hospitals' on the Disproportionate Share Payment issue could not be further from the truth. My staff and I have been talking to the administration, relevant committees and the hospitals about this issue for months. In the last 48 hours, I reached out to every single member of the Tennessee delegation and asked them to cosign with me a letter I drafted to the administration to support Tennessee's hospitals. All other members of the delegation have agreed to sign this letter. The letter recounts the legislative history of the policy at issue. 
   "Tennessee's hospitals are best served if we put their interests first and work together in a bipartisan manner to support them. Political stunts are easy - bringing folks together in a bipartisan way to support Tennessee's interest is a measure of true leadership. I urge Congressman Ford to work with me and sign the letter I drafted, which was circulated to his office prior to his issuance of his press release this morning. I am pleased, however, to join Senator Alexander and my colleagues in the House to make sure Tennesseans continue to receive the care they need."
