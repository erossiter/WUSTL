SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST, SPEAKER HASTERT ISSUE STATEMENT ON TERRI SCHIAVO
  Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist released the following statement today: 
   "We're very disappointed by the Florida court's decision to allow Terri Schiavo's feeding tube to be removed. The House and Senate leadership are committed to reaching agreement on legislation that provides an opportunity to save Mrs. Schiavo's life. Now that the House and Senate have each passed different legislative remedies, the House and Senate Committees are working urgently together. We will be working through the weekend to resolve the differences and reach an effective solution that can clear our chambers and be signed by the President."
