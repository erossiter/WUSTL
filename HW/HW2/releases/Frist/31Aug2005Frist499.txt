SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST, HOUSE SPEAKER HASTERT ISSUE STATEMENT ON HURRICANE VICTIM'S ASSISTANCE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) today said they are committed to "swift action" in response to the widespread damage and dislocation caused by Hurricane Katrina in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida: 
   "Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida who have been so severely affected by Hurricane Katrina. Thousands have seen their lives uprooted and in some tragic instances lost, due to this unprecedented natural disaster. We will not rest until everyone that has been affected by this disaster has been given proper assistance. As has been the case in other national tragedies, such as 9/11, Congress will move quickly to assist those affected by this tragedy.
   "This powerful storm has caused a national tragedy and Congress is committed to bring immediate relief and aid to Hurricane Katrina's victims. We have called on the chairmen of our committees to make immediate recommendations for assistance and plan to respond to the suffering by those citizens who have been affected. We anticipate swift action by both the House and Senate. 
   "Given the scope of this disaster and the need for a timely legislative response we will continue working with the administration and our committee chairmen to develop proposals that will respond to the needs of those affected. As the leaders of the House and Senate, we will make an aid, relief and support package for the victims of Hurricane Katrina our highest priority."
