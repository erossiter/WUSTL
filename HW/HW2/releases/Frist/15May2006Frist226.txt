SEN. FRIST CONGRATULATES VANDERBILT DEAN CAMILLA BENBOW ON PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT TO NATIONAL MATHEMATICS ADVISORY PANEL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement congratulating Dr. Camilla Benbow (Dean, Peabody College of Education and Human Development, Vanderbilt University) on her appointment by President Bush to the National Mathematics Advisory Panel: 
   "I applaud President Bush's decision to appoint Dr. Benbow to the National Mathematics Panel. Dr. Benbow's distinguished record of research on students with advanced mathematics abilities demonstrates her exceptional qualifications for this appointment.
   "Today's youth are the backbone of America's competitiveness in the 21st century global economy. It's clear that we must act now to equip tomorrow's workers with the math skills they'll need to stay ahead of our competitors. That's why Congress recently passed my SMART grant initiative to encourage college students to major in competitive fields such as math, and that's why President Bush commissioned this panel. I look forward to reviewing the recommendations Dr. Benbow and the panel produce."
   On April 18, President Bush issued an Executive Order creating the National Mathematics Advisory Panel. The Panel will advise the president and the secretary of education of the best use of scientifically based research to advance the teaching and learning of mathematics. Comprised of 17 expert panelists and 6 ex-officio members, the panel is modeled after the influential National Reading Panel and expects to issue two reports containing policy recommendations on how to improve mathematics achievement for all students.
