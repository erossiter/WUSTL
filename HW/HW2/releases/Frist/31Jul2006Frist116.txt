SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS U.N. RESOLUTION ON IRAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution giving Iran until August 31 to suspend its uranium enrichment or face the threat of sanctions:  
   "I applaud today's action by the Security Council demanding the suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment program. The mandatory requirements of this resolution will send a strong, clear message to the Iranian regime. Iran must now comply with the Security Council's demands or face the threat of economic and diplomatic sanctions."
   "Iran's nuclear weapons program constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security. If Iran refuses to comply with the Security Council's mandate and continues down the path of defiance and international isolation, the Council's own credibility will require it to proceed as quickly as possible to tough sanctions to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons."
   "The people of Iran deserve to be full-fledged members of the community of nations. Regrettably, as demonstrated by today's Security Council vote, the Iranian regime's relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and its continued support for terrorism remain obstacles to the realization of this objective."
