SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF MIKE JOHANNS TO BE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns as the next Secretary of Agriculture: 
   "Governor Johanns is an outstanding choice for Secretary of Agriculture. With roots that began on an Iowa dairy farm, he recognizes the challenges farmers face today. He has spent most of his public life fighting for a strong farm economy and a more global role for American agriculture. As governor of Nebraska, he's been committed to economic development in rural areas, a safe and secure food supply, and the continued development of alternative energy sources like ethanol. Governor Johanns will provide an experienced voice for the future of agriculture, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through Congress."
