SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on the passage of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation on Nuclear Damage:  
   "I applaud today's approval of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation on Nuclear Damage (CSC). This Convention will help level the playing field for exporters of U.S. nuclear equipment and technology by removing liability concerns that have limited the ability of these U.S. companies to provide the full range of safety assistance to some of the world's most unsafe nuclear reactors. This will translate to additional high-paying jobs for Americans. The CSC will also assure that victims of any civil nuclear accident outside the United States will be adequately and promptly compensated. 
   "America's leadership is necessary to draw other countries to the Convention and for it to enter into force. I applaud my Senate colleagues for demonstrating that leadership by unanimously approving this important convention. In addition, I hope that other countries interested in nuclear cooperation with the United States will take note of the Senate's action and follow our example."
