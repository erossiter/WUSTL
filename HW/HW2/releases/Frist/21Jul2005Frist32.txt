SEN. FRIST TO INTRODUCE 'SUPPORT OUR SCOUTS ACT OF 2005' AS AMENDMENT TO DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZATION BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced that he would introduce the "Support Our Scouts Act of 2005" as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill.  
 The amendment will ensure that the Boy Scouts of America are treated fairly by guaranteeing their right to equal access to public facilities, forums, and programs. This provision addresses attempts to exclude the Boy Scouts from such facilities at the federal, state, and local levels, and legal moves by groups to proscribe longstanding Defense Department support to the Scouts. 
   The following is a statement Senator Frist delivered this morning on the Senate floor: 
   "I plan to offer an amendment to the Defense bill to preserve the long-standing relationship between the Department of Defense and the Boy Scouts of America. This legislation is necessary to press back on lawsuits that seek to sever the ties between our military, which has hosted the Boy Scout Jamboree on its bases. America's youth can learn so much from the men and women in uniform - love of country, commitment to values, sacrifice for others. 
   "It is simply wrong headed to conclude that Pentagon support of the Boy Scouts of America violates the establishment clause. It is time to return some common sense to the courts. On Monday, July 25, thousands of Scouts from around the country will begin arriving at Fort AP Hill. Let's protect this special relationship." 
   The National Scout Jamboree will take place from July 25 - August 3.
