SEN. FRIST PROMOTES STOP OVER-SPENDING ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) introduced the Stop Over-Spending (S.O.S.) Act of 2006. Frist is a cosponsor of the legislation and attended today's press conference unveiling the bill: 
   "Changes in the budget process are long overdue. It's my belief that the new tools in S.O.S. are the most effective measures available for strengthening fiscal discipline and fixing our broken budget process. Enacting the entire proposal will be a challenge, particularly in Washington, where the forces of spending remain active and strong. But achieving even one element of the S.O.S. reform package would be a major accomplishment in our struggle to control spending - and it's my goal to see this done before I leave here. I thank Chairman Gregg for his leadership on this issue and applaud his dedication to strengthening our budget process."
   S.O.S. adopts the President's proposal to establish a legislative line item veto and would reestablish statutory spending caps. The bill would also establish a new two-year budget and appropriation cycle while initiating automatic across the board reductions in entitlement spending if the federal deficit failed to meet established targets.
