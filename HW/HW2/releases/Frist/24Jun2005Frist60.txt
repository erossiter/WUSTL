WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. FRIST
  It was an historic week here in Washington, DC. In addition to visits from the Prime Minister of Iraq and the Prime Minister of Vietnam, we moved closer to implementing America's first national energy policy in over a decade. 
   Yesterday, I was honored join a group of bipartisan Senators in welcoming Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari to Washington. While the situation on the ground remains tough, the Prime Minister brought hopeful news from the region, and emphasized that Iraq is making significant progress. For more information on our a visit, please check out my weekly column: http://frist.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Columns.Detail&Column_id=66&Month=6&Year=2005
   The other big issue of the week was the debate over the energy bill. As I mentioned last week, a secure, reliable, independent and clean source of energy will be vital to our nation's future. We made a lot of meaningful progress this week, and the bill is slated to pass the Senate early next week.
   Also, this week the Senate Appropriations Committee passed out the Agriculture spending bill which includes significant funding for Tennessee's farm projects. Please check out the press release below to see what valuable projects are being supported in this legislation.
   Finally, this week afforded an opportunity to remember Juneteenth - the day our nation finally ended the immoral and heinous institution of slavery. For my floor statement honoring this critical event in our nation's history, please look below.
   Another fast-paced week in the United States Senate, and I was honored to represent Tennessee as we governed on the issues mattering most to Americans. For more in-depth information on what happened, I, as always, encourage you to check out my website at http://frist.senate.gov
   Have a good week.
