SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD EPA'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF CLEANER AIR QUALITY IN MEMPHIS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the announcement from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Mike Leavitt that the Memphis region will attain clean air standards three years sooner than required.  
   "Today's announcement reflects Memphis' continuing commitment to improving its air quality," Frist said. "Responsible environmental stewardship today will ensure that Memphis remains a clean, growing and vibrant city in the years to come." 
   "This is real progress and a good example of teamwork between local, state and federal officials to address our clean air challenges," said Alexander. "Ultimately, we will need strong federal legislation to clean the air in Memphis and across Tennessee, but today's announcement is an important step in the right direction." 
   Earlier this summer, Tennessee petitioned the EPA to designate the Memphis area as "Marginal" under the Clean Air Act. Marginal nonattainment areas must implement pollution control measures to achieve clean air sooner than Moderate areas. 
   Working with local, state, and private industry leaders, Memphis earned new classification by demonstrating its ability to implement stringent pollution control measures that will bring air quality levels into the approved range over the next three years. Moderate areas must attain national 8-hour ozone air quality standards no later than June 2010. Marginal areas must attain by June 2007. 
   Shelby County has implemented several measures to improve air quality. Some of these include: returning to a 55 mph speed limit in all developed areas of the county; cooperating with Crittenden County (Arkansas) on a study of the air quality monitor in Marion, AR; and launching a county-wide public outreach and education program through the recently formed Mid-South Clean Air Coalition.
