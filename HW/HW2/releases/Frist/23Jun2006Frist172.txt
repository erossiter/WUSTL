SEN. FRIST'S OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST FINANCE TRACKING PROGRAM
  Amy Call, Communications Director for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), made the following statement today regarding the terrorist finance tracking program: 
   "Senator Frist has been briefed on the terrorist finance tracking program. He has full confidence in the effectiveness of, and the legal authority for, this vital anti-terrorism tool. Protecting America from terrorists is our first responsibility, and this program is vital to helping keep America safe. Senator Frist applauds the President's efforts. A greater concern for all right now should be the continued leaks of classified information which compromise these programs that are important to our homeland security."
