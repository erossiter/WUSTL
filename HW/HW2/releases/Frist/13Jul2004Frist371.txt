SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON AFRICAN TRADE BILL SIGNING
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after President Bush signed the African Trade and Opportunity Acceleration Act of 2004 (AGOA III) into law:  
   "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has brought hope, jobs and a future to hundreds of thousands of Africans, and I commend the President for signing this important extension of that legislation into law. The AGOA Acceleration Act (AGOA III) builds upon and furthers that much-needed and valued policy.
   "This is a win-win situation for the United States, Africa and the world. Not only has AGOA created new investment and opportunity for U.S. businesses, it has helped create an estimated 150,000 African jobs, pump more than $340 million into African economies, and forge a place for Africa in the global trade market. I hope other countries will look to the success of this program and reexamine their trade preferences toward Africa and the benefits of trade relations in the region."
