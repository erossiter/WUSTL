SEN. FRIST ENCOURAGES BIPARTISANSHIP FROM SEN. REID
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement in response to Senator Reid's floor statement on the president's State of the Union address:  
   "Unfortunately, the Minority Leader this afternoon made no proposals to move America forward. Real leadership involves putting forward ideas and solutions not just criticizing. I again renew my call to Senator Reid to work with me on meaningful solutions for the American people. 
   "The president tomorrow night will put forward bold ideas to keep every American safe, grow our economy and see more jobs created, ensure access to affordable health care and improve education. Republicans in Congress will work to pass them. What remains to be seen is whether Democrats will have the courage to work on solutions instead of obstructing and complaining. 
   "Democrats can do better."
