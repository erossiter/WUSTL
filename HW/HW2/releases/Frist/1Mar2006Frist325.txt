SEN. FRIST PRAISES STEP FORWARD FOR PATRIOT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "It is now crystal clear that the Patriot Act is on its way to becoming law. Today's bipartisan vote of 84 Senators to end debate on the Patriot Act conference report brings us one step closer to ending the obstruction of America's #1 antiterrorism tool. Senate Democrats should not waste any more of the Senate's time trying to block final passage of a bill with the overwhelming bipartisan support of Senators and the American people."
