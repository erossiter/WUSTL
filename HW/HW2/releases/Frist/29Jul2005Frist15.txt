SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING SENATE PASSAGE OF PATRIOT ACT RENEWAL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist this evening made the following statement after the Senate passed a renewal of the Patriot Act by unanimous consent:  
   "Tonight we took another major step to strengthen our defenses in the War on Terror. The Patriot Act is an essential tool in our fight against terror. Its provisions allow us to track, monitor and stop terrorists before they are able to kill innocent people. The legislation has enabled our law enforcement and intelligence communities to collaborate and work more closely together in keeping America safe. The Patriot Act is a uniquely valuable piece of legislation for this unparalleled time in America's history, and its provisions will help keep us safe and defeat the hidden terrorist cells operating here in America."
