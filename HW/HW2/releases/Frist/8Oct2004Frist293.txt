SEN. FRIST HAILS HOUSE PASSAGE OF STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTIBILITY, TOBACCO BUYOUT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement in support of House passage of the state sales tax deductibility and tobacco buyout provisions, which were included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Conference Report (also known as the FSC/ETI).  
 The conference report passed the House late Thursday and is awaiting Senate action. 
   "I applaud House passage of this legislation that contains two very significant provisions for Tennesseans - sales tax deductibility and the tobacco buyout. 
   "State sales tax deductibility is something I've fought for since coming to the Senate, and, finally, it will become the law of the land. When Tennesseans file their taxes for 2004, almost one-quarter of them will save $470 on their taxes. That money can be better used to buy school supplies, pay credit card bills or save for the future. After almost 20 years of inequity, I'm pleased to have been part of the effort to restore fairness to the tax code. 
   "I've also been concerned about our outdated tobacco quota system and its impact on tobacco communities, and I'm thrilled to see a buyout included in this bill. The inclusion of the tobacco buyout in the JOBS bill is critical to Tennessee's desperate tobacco farmers, the communities they support and the entire state. This represents a unique opportunity to end the antiquated tobacco quota system by providing a fair payment to both quota holders and growers. Notably, it will mean $767 million for our Tennessee tobacco communities over the next 10 years. Now that the House has passed the bill, I plan to move quickly to bring this conference report to the Senate floor."
