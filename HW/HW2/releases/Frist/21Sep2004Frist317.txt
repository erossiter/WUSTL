SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER HAIL SENATE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE NATIONAL GUARD, FORT CAMPBELL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today hailed Senate passage of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which includes more than $150 million for Tennessee military construction projects. The bill unanimously passed the Senate late Monday.  
   "Tennessee's military and reserve forces are vital to the war on terrorism," said Frist. "Projects to expand housing and soldier readiness facilities at Fort Campbell, to better utilize the space of the Nashville Readiness Center, and to improve infrastructure at Tullahoma's Arnold Air Force Base will further equip our soldiers protecting freedom at home and abroad. This funding is a critical investment in our troops and nation."
   "The Senate is making critical investments to give our military men and women the resources and facilities they need," said Alexander. "Senator Frist and I will continue to do all we can to support our troops at Fort Campbell, members of the Tennessee National Guard and our reservists who are protecting America and our values."
   Overall, funding for Tennessee's military construction priorities was more than $22 million above the Administration's budget request. Tennessee projects included in Senate version of the FY05 Military Construction Appropriations bill include:
   * $70.6 million for Fort Campbell to fund the construction of an airfield vehicle support facility, a standard design barracks and operations complex (phase I), a command and control facility, a shoot house, and aquatic training facility. The barracks will hold all of the soldiers in the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, while the command and control facility will house the Division staff and include administrative space, a conference room, intelligence centers, and an emergency operations center. 
   * $22 million for the Tennessee National Guard and the US Army Reserve, including $9.1 million for the Nashville Army National Guard Readiness Center (phase I), and $13.5 million for the Smyrna Joint Armed Forces Reserve Center. The renovation of the Readiness Center will provide over 75,000 square feet for administrative offices and logistical and training space. The Smyrna Reserve Center will serve the peacetime missions of the assigned unit. 
   * $41.5 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard at the Memphis International Airport to finance a C-5 Aircraft Parking Apron and Hydrant Refueling System as well as a Corrosion Control Hangar. Both projects are vital to accommodate the first of the C-5 aircraft arriving in 2004. 
   * $22 million for an Upgrade Jet Engine Air Induction System (Phase V) at the Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, Tennessee. The completion of this project will enable infrastructure reductions and increase facility test capabilities. These facilities are used to simulate high altitude flight conditions for testing, evaluation, and development of advanced turbine engines for JSF, F-22, F-16, F-15, and F-18 fighter aircraft. Accurate test data on jet engine turbines could potentially increase the reliability of aircraft engines. 
   This bill will now go before a House and Senate Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of Military Construction Appropriations bills.
