SEN. FRIST HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today applauded Senate passage of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005. The legislation authorizes funds for highways, highway safety programs and transit programs.  
   "Today's bill passage is the result of a long, bipartisan process that will build and improve the roads, ports and public transportation that drive Tennessee's economy. Our state's economy relies heavily upon its transportation infrastructure, and by increasing federal highway and transit spending, this legislation will support economic development throughout the state. Specifically, Tennessee will receive nearly $4 billion over the next five years to invest in its highway infrastructure. The bill will also provide more than $296 million over the next five years to improve transit for rural and urban commuters; an increase of 166 percent over the previous highway reauthorization bill. 
   "This legislation dramatically increases federal highway spending in Tennessee with an average of 27.7 percent more in highway funding each year than the level enacted under the previous bill. Tennessee's highways have consistently been ranked among the safest in the nation, and this increased spending will help reduce congestion, heighten safety and promote economic development. 
   "America's transportation system is the backbone of our thriving economy, and we must support this critical infrastructure. This investment will be a boost to our economy, our safety and our quality of life. I look forward to resolving our differences with the House of Representatives swiftly, so we can send the president a bill he can sign into law as quickly as possible." 
   The "Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005" will now be sent to conference where members of both chambers will finalize the provisions of the bill.
