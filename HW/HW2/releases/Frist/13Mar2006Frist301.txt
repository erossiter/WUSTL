SEN. FRIST BLASTS SEN. FEINGOLD'S POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement in response to Democratic calls to censure President Bush:  
   "Senator Feingold should be ashamed of this political ploy. This is another example of the Democrats' failure to establish an agenda that meets the needs of the American people. Senator Feingold's time would be better spent putting forth constructive ideas rather than using cheap political tricks that compromise America's national security by sending a dangerous signal of disunity around the globe. 
   "The American people are squarely behind the president in fighting the War on Terror. This stunt sends a dangerously wrongheaded message, and the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ought to reject the Feingold resolution."
