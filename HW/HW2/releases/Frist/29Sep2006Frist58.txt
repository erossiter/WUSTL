SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF SECURE FENCE ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006: 
   "The Secure Fence Act puts us on the path to achieving total operational control of our borders, which is essential for national security. With this legislation, every inch of our border with Mexico will be defended - either by fence or electronic surveillance. I commend my colleagues for putting the safety and security of the American people first and passing this major component of comprehensive immigration reform."
