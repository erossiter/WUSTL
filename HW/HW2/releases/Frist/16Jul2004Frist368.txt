SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR MARTIN
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA) is awarding $353,066 to Martin and the Industrial Board of Martin to support improvements to the City's local industrial park.  
   "This is great news for Martin and Weakley County," Frist said. "EDA's investment in this community, which is being leveraged with local and private dollars, shows the Administration's commitment to helping rural communities keep the jobs they have and build the infrastructure needed for future growth. City and county leaders are to be commended for their hard work and cooperation in securing this much needed economic assistance." 
   "Senator Frist and I appreciate this important investment in West Tennessee," said Alexander. "This grant will not only mean that valuable jobs will stay in Martin, but it will also mean good, new jobs for the community." 
   The funds, which are part of a $506,000 project to rehabilitate a rail spur to Martin's industrial park in Weakley County, will help to save 900 jobs, create more than 1,800 new jobs and generate private investments in excess of $7 million. 
   The Economic Development Administration provides grants to economically-distressed communities to generate new employment, help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth. It has invested over $80 million in Tennessee, creating 30,000 jobs and attracting $2.4 billion in private investment over the past 10 years.
