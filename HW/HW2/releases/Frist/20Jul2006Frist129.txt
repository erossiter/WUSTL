SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO REDUCE U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN ENERGY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the introduction of the bipartisan Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. This legislation would expand domestic production of oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico:  
   "Moving toward energy independence is an important step to reducing high energy prices, but it can only be achieved if we work to bring more of America's energy to American consumers. 
   "This legislation will help to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and natural gas by opening up over 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to environmentally sensitive exploration. This area is estimated to contain 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - enough to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years. 
   "Producing more energy at home so that we don't need to buy as much energy overseas means we can enhance our national security by not sending our money to those who might fund efforts to do us harm. I look forward to considering this bill in the Senate next week." 
   The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act is the result of a bipartisan agreement that builds on legislation reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in April. It will allow leasing in the so-called Lease Area 181 and an additional area just south of the 181 Area in the Gulf of Mexico. It does not alter any existing moratoria on leasing anywhere outside of the Gulf of Mexico. 
   The legislation provides historic protections for the State of Florida by establishing a 125-mile buffer in Florida waters through the year 2022 and by protecting military training activities in the Gulf. 
   In addition, it also includes a fiscally responsible revenue-sharing system for revenues generated by new leases in certain areas in the Gulf.
