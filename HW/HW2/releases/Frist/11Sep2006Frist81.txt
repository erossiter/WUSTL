SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  Sen. Bill Frist made the following statement regarding the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001:  
   "Five years ago, nearly 3,000 fellow Americans lost their lives to a vicious act of terror. The attack shattered longstanding illusions of safety and security, yet out of the rubble and grief we arose with new resolve."
   "We have worked tirelessly to ease the burden of that memory. We're safer than we were five years ago - that we have not had another successful terrorist attack against the homeland is evidence of this fact. But we cannot let our resolve to strengthen our security waver or diminish. That's why we're tackling an aggressive security agenda in the Senate this month. By replenishing critical supplies for troops on the ground, bolstering port security, and strengthening the terrorist surveillance program, we can help bring the terrorists to justice and ensure the events of September 11th are never repeated."
