SEN. FRIST SECURES PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION BENEFITING CHILDREN AFFECTED BY METH ABUSE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the Improving Outcomes for Children Affected by Meth Act, which passed the Senate unanimously. The legislation provides $40 million in grant funding over five years to improve the well-being and safety of children affected by a parent or caregiver's abuse of methamphetamine: 
   "Meth abuse has devastating consequences for Tennessee's children. With the funding this legislation provides, our overwhelmed child welfare services will be much better equipped to protect children from the abuse and neglect they often suffer as a result of this poisonous drug."
   In the last two years, over 1,000 children have been removed from homes in Tennessee due to meth-related investigations.
   Earlier this year, the majority leader worked closely with House and Senate colleagues to ensure passage of the Combat Meth Epidemic Act, which establishes restrictions on the sale of medicines containing ingredients used to manufacture methamphetamine. 
   Last year Frist, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Congressman Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) worked together to secure $3 million to establish a statewide methamphetamine task force and $1 million for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) to develop a statewide crime tracking system. The $4 million in total anti-methamphetamine funding will help ensure that all regions of Tennessee have the training and equipment they need to address the state's methamphetamine crisis.
