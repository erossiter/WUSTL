SEN. FRIST URGES SUPPORT TO ADDRESS RISING NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., today made the following statement after the release of new estimates of the number of Americans without health insurance:  
   "While I'm disappointed, I'm not surprised by today's new estimates of the number of Americans without health insurance. Drawn from the 2003 current population survey, the numbers not only reflect the economic transition of the last year, but a decade long downward trend in the proportion of Americans who receive health coverage through their employers. 
   "We all must work together to make affordable health coverage available to all Americans. Under the leadership of President Bush and a Republican Congress we've taken significant steps to make health care more affordable and available. The landmark Medicare law, to be fully implemented in 2006, and other legislation passed last year created new affordable options for health coverage, helped speed lower cost generic drugs to consumers, provided needed financial relief to state Medicaid programs and will help retirees maintain health insurance coverage. Additionally, the President's plan to accelerate clinical applications of health information technology and to expand community health centers will help ensure more Americans have access to higher quality, more affordable care. 
   "Much more can and should be accomplished. Unfortunately, Senator Kerry and the Democratic Leadership in Washington have stood in the way of common sense reforms. They have opposed Association Health Plans, tax credits for low-income Americans, and medical liability reform. They voted against more affordable prescription drugs for seniors and all Americans. And now Senator Kerry is proposing a prescription for bigger government and higher taxes, rather than consumer-directed, patient-centered, provider-friendly, and affordable health care."
