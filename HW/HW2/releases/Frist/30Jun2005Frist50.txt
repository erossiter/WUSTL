SENS. FRIST, CLINTON ISSUE STATEMENT ON GROWING CONSENSUS ON HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) today made the following statement: 
   "We are pleased that Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Grassley and Baucus are joining with us to fight for legislation to promote health care IT and quality. As Chairman and Ranking Members of the two key committees of jurisdiction on this issue, these Senators are critical to our efforts to enact health IT and quality legislation.  
   "We were proud to lead the way, taking the first step toward creating a national health information technology infrastructure when we joined together last month to introduce comprehensive, bipartisan legislation. The legislation being introduced today mirrors many key aspects of our bill, the Health TEQ Act, providing another encouraging sign that we can pass a comprehensive health IT and quality bill this Congress. 
   "The need for comprehensive health IT legislation could not be more urgent. Our health care system faces an escalating crisis as health care costs continue to skyrocket. Americans are spending $1.7 trillion on health care every year, accounting for 15.3 percent of our gross domestic product, at an average cost of $5,670 per person. Our lagging health IT infrastructure compounds the problem, contributing to fragmentation, waste and inefficiency. 
   "We have the most advanced medical system in the world, yet patient safety is compromised every day due to medical errors, duplication and other inefficiencies. Harnessing the potential of information technology will help reduce errors and improve quality by making it more effective and efficient. 
   "We are at a pivotal moment. Pockets of innovation and investment in health care IT are developing all over the country, in places like Nashville, Tennessee and Buffalo, New York, where health care providers, employers and community groups are coming together to build a health IT network that brings the community to the table to meet local healthcare needs. This is a promising first step, but to truly achieve the potential of health IT, we need to create national interoperability standards that will give health care providers the confidence that an investment in health IT is an investment in the future. 
   "We look forward to continuing to lead the way toward passage of health IT and quality legislation and to working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While work remains, we hope that legislation can be approved in committee by the August recess and enacted this Congress. By marrying technology and quality, we can create a seamless, efficient health care system for the 21st century."
