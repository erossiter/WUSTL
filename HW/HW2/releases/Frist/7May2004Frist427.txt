SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW JOBS NUMBERS
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the newly released payroll report: 
   "The economic statistics released this week prove that the pro-growth policies we have put into place are taking hold.  
   "All evidence underscores that our economy has absorbed the twin blows of recession and the 9-11 terrorist attacks and is recovering at a rapid pace. This is due to the determination of the American worker and the economic incentives put in place by President Bush and a Republican Congress. 
   "Today's Labor Department report of 288,000 new jobs created in April means the American economy continues to strengthen. In fact, we have now created more than one million new jobs over the past eight months. When today's 288,000 job number is combined with March's 337,000 new jobs, it represents the strongest two month job gain in over four years.
   "But the good news continues. Construction spending is at the highest level ever recorded. The service sector is growing at its fastest pace in seven years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated yesterday that revenues are running $30 billion to $40 billion higher than anticipated for the year, thus reducing the federal deficit this year by a comparable amount. And initial jobless claims were down over 25,000 last week." 
   "But we cannot rest. We must continue moving aggressively to create new jobs for all who want to work and build on this surging economy. In the Senate, Republicans have offered a jobs agenda that will build on the progress we have made and create thousands of new jobs. I hope that our Democrat colleagues will join with us to grow the economy and create jobs by lowering the cost of doing business, assisting American manufacturers, and lessen the tax burden on American families."
