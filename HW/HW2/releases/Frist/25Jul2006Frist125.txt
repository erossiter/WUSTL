SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON HUTCHISON-PENCE IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on the Hutchison-Pence immigration reform plan:
   "I welcome the proposal put forth by Senator Hutchison and Congressman Pence as an idea that we ought to look at as we continue work on immigration reform. I believe that ideas like these will ultimately help us find a way to strengthen the border, have an effective workplace enforcement system, and tackle the problem of the 12 million immigrants who are here illegally."
