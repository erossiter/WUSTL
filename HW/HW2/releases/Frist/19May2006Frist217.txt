SEN. FRIST HAILS NEW TENNESSEE EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the U.S. Department of Labor released state and regional employment statistics for the month of April that show Tennessee enjoyed one of the nation's largest over-the-month percentage increases in employment:  
   "Today's announcement of the latest jobs numbers is just the most recent chapter in the ongoing success story of the Republican economic agenda. Tennessee continues to benefit from Republican policies that have stimulated economic growth and investment. 
   "After so many months of record low national unemployment and economic expansion, it's become almost commonplace to cite job creation statistics. But for the 12,500 Tennesseans who found work last month, the nation's booming economy has a very personal, positive impact. 
   "With the president's signing of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act earlier this week, Republicans have prevented a $70 billion tax increase that would have derailed the remarkable economic progress begun with the 2003 tax cuts. As we continue to exercise fiscal discipline and enact fair, commonsense tax policies, Tennesseans can look forward to even more good economic news." 
   Tennessee's increase in employment from March to April (0.5 percent) makes it one of the top five states in monthly employment increases.
   According to the Department of Labor, Tennessee's unemployment rate of 5.4 percent is down from last year's rate of 5.6 percent. The state has added 38,300 jobs since April 2005.
