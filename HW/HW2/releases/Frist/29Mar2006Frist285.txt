SEN. FRIST HIGHLIGHTS NEW ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS IN FRIST & SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BORDER SECURITY BILLS
  The office of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today released the attached document highlighting the new enforcement provisions included in both the Frist and Senate Judiciary Committee's border security bills. These are provisions that were not included in S.1033, the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  
   "It's critical that the Senate address comprehensive immigration legislation including both border security and economic provisions," said Frist. "The enforcement provisions included in both my bill and the Judiciary Committee's bill are a first step in that process. I fully expect that the final bill will be a comprehensive approach to border security and immigration reform."
