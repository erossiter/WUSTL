SEN. FRIST RESPONDS TO REID'S OBSTRUCTION OF PENSION REFORM BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-TN) made the following statement regarding Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's obstruction of the pension reform bill:  
   The Minority Leader continues to obstruct the overwhelmingly bipartisan pension reform bill by not allowing the legislation to move to conference committee. 
   In December of last year, we offered a 7-5 ratio. After a 2 month delay, this was refused. In rejecting this offer, the Minority Leader said he needed 6 conferees. There was never any demand for a specific ratio. 
   To accommodate the request of the Minority Leader, I made a second proposal of appointing 6 Democrat conferees and 9 Republican conferees, which would meet his need for a sixth conferee while allowing us to maintain equal representation of the two committees that have jurisdiction over this bill. 
   In the meantime, the clock is ticking. The first quarter of the fiscal year ends on March 31st and within two weeks of that happening, companies have to make contributions to their pension plans. 
   After months of obstruction and needless delay, the other side needs to decide if the work of the American people is their number one priority or if obstruction and partisanship remains the order of the day. This means either accepting the 7-5 offer and choosing amongst the Democrat senators who want to be conferees, or accepting the offer of a 9-6 ratio. 
   We've done our part. We have made the tough decisions. It's time for the other side to do the same.
