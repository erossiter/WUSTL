SEN. FRIST SPEAKS OUT ON SUDAN'S REQUEST THAT UN ENVOY LEAVE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist made the following statement in response to reports that Sudan's ruling government had asked United Nations envoy Jan Pronk to leave the country:  
   "Jan Pronk recognized the genocide going on in Sudan and spoke out against it. By asking him to leave and declaring him an enemy of Sudan, the regime in Khartoum has again shown it has no desire to change its ways or stop its support for the janjaweed militias. The international community must redouble its efforts to end the genocide in Darfur. I condemn the regime's actions and call on the United Nations to continue standing by Mr. Pronk."
