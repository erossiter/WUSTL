SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES FISCAL DISCIPLINE INITIATIVE TO DEFRAY COSTS OF HURRICANES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced a Senate Republican leadership initiative to identify and enact legislation that would help to defray emergency federal expenditures for the recent costs of hurricane relief.  
   "Helping victims of these hurricanes recover and rebuild is a massive undertaking for all levels of government. The federal government will meet its responsibilities in caring for the citizens whose lives have been devastated by these storms. To date the federal government has committed nearly $71 billion to this effort," Frist said. "We will help rebuild and restore the Gulf Coast communities and we must do so in a fiscally-responsible way to ensure not only that the communities and families needing assistance receive that assistance, but also to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, promptly, efficiently and effectively." 
   Senator Frist and his fellow Senate Republican leaders informed President Bush that all Senate Committees have been directed to review programs and policies in their jurisdiction that could be enacted to offset some of the unanticipated recent disaster spending. 
   The Leadership also encouraged the president to use authorities provided him under the Budget Act to reduce unnecessary and low priority spending, previously enacted into law. "A special rescission bill rescinding unnecessary spending is an important tool that the president and Congress should use to enact needed spending reductions," Frist said. 
   Frist and his colleagues also wrote to President Bush about the importance of establishing one centralized inspector general for oversight of the recent hurricane related expenditures.
