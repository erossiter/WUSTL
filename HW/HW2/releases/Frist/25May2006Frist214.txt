SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS END OF LONG-DISTANCE TELEPHONE EXCISE TAX, PLAN TO REFUND TAXPAYER DOLLARS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Treasury Department announced that it is conceding a court case over the legality of the long-distance telephone excise tax and will offer refunds to taxpayers for amounts paid from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2006, with interest:  
   "Today marks the long-overdue end of an obsolete tax that's incompatible with modern society. The long-distance telephone excise tax has morphed from a targeted luxury tax into a burden facing nearly every American with a phone. I'm confident the refunds issued by Treasury will reap benefits throughout the economy, for Tennesseans and taxpayers everywhere. I support Secretary Snow's call on Congress to repeal the remaining outdated excise tax on local telephone service." 
   Key facts regarding Long-Distance Telephone Excise Tax refunds:
   * No immediate action is required by taxpayers.
   * Refunds will be a part of 2006 tax returns (filed in 2007).
   * Refund claims will cover all excise tax paid on long-distance service over the last three years, from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2006 (time allowed given statute of limitations). Interest will be paid on refunds.
   * The IRS is working on a simplified method for individuals to use to claim a refund on their 2006 tax returns.
   * Refunds will not include tax paid on local telephone service, which was not involved in the litigation.
   * Originally established in 1898 as a "luxury" tax on wealthy Americans who owned telephones, the federal excise tax on telephone calls is not compatible with today's modern information-age society.
