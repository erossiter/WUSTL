SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $10.9 MILLION IN HUD DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR JACKSON
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the City of Jackson will receive $10.9 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help rebuild public housing units that were destroyed by the tornado that hit Jackson on May 4, 2003.  
   Frist and Alexander made the announcement by phone with Mayor Charles Farmer during the city's commemorative dinner marking the anniversary of last year's devastating storms. 
   "This funding will ensure that Mayor Farmer and the Jackson community can continue rebuilding from the tornadoes just one year ago," said Frist. "It's been a difficult road, but one that area residents have handled with tremendous spirit and unity. My thanks also go out to HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson for doing his best to provide the support the City of Jackson needs to continue the work ahead."
   "Mayor Farmer and his staff along with the residents of Jackson have worked tirelessly in the past year to get the city back on its feet," said Alexander. "Not long ago, I talked to HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson about the community's hard work and the need for this assistance. Senator Frist and I appreciate that he has acted quickly and done all he can to make this happen for the people of Jackson." 
   The funding will be used to repair and replace public housing units that were destroyed in the Merry Lane Courts and Parkview Courts public housing developments as a result of the tornado. The funds will be made available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Reserve for Emergencies and Natural Disasters.
