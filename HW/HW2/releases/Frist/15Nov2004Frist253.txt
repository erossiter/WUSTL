SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON POWELL RESIGNATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Colin Powell has served his Nation well, not just in his current position as Secretary of State, but also throughout his distinguished military career and during his time in the private sector. He has been an effective and articulate Secretary of State in both his management of the department and its personnel, but also as our Nation's top diplomat. He has served the President and the American people with distinction and will be missed by many, including myself."
