SEN. FRIST OBTAINS CLARIFICATION ON TIP CREDIT FROM DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) asked the Department of Labor to clarify how it would enforce the tip credit provision of the minimum wage legislation. The Labor Department responded by letter that they would read the legislation as "protecting the current minimum wages of the tipped employees in the seven states" that do not currently have a tip credit.
