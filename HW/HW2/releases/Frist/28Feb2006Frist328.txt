SEN. FRIST PRAISES PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING CORE TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Today's meeting produced great progress in unifying Senators around a core approach to terrorist surveillance legislation. As I have emphasized repeatedly, the terrorist surveillance program is Constitutional, lawful and critical to protecting the safety and security of all Americans. I understand the questions and concerns raised about the program, and I have organized this informal working group to address these concerns without weakening our national security or anti-terrorist protections. 
   "To buttress this Constitutional and lawful program, the legislative approach we have discussed would provide a statutory framework to strengthen the terrorist surveillance program, establish a role for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and enhance Congressional oversight. I appreciate the willingness of Senators McConnell, Specter, Roberts, DeWine, Graham, Snowe and Hagel to work together constructively on this issue and look forward to finalizing the legislation and broadening bipartisan support."
