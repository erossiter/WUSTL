SEN. FRIST SUPPORTS INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE APPROACH TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement this afternoon following the decision by the Senate Intelligence Committee to not conduct an investigation of the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program, and their subsequent decision to stand up a subcommittee to conduct oversight of this program:  
   "I am pleased by today's action by the Intelligence Committee. The NSA Terrorist Surveillance program is vital to protecting the American people from terrorist attack and keeping our homeland safe. It is important that the Congress, through the intelligence committee, conduct oversight to ensure the program is effective and properly run, rather than conducting politically-charged investigations into the programs origins. 
   "While I believe the president has the constitutional authority to conduct this program, I support the efforts by my colleagues to establish a statutory framework to conduct the program, ensure Congressional oversight, and safeguard the civil liberties of the American people. The working group I established to do just that has produced a draft bill that I am hopeful will garner bipartisan support in the coming weeks.
   "Today's action by the Intelligence Committee, and the legislative efforts by Senators Dewine, Graham, Hagel, Snowe, Roberts, and McConnell to draft a terrorist surveillance bill, will help ensure that the American people and our country will remain safe from terrorist attack."
