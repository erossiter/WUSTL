SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES SENATE TO CONSIDER TAX RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced that the next item on the Senate's agenda will be going to conference on the tax reconciliation bill.  
   "Keeping our economy strong and secure is a major priority for the Republican-led Senate and that's why it's critical to our sustained economic growth that the Senate moves ahead with tax reconciliation legislation on the Senate floor. Extending these sensible tax cuts is critical to fueling America's economic growth that has created more than 4.6 million new jobs over the last 31 months," said Frist. 
   Recent Economic Indicators: 
   Overall household wealth is at an all-time high, reaching $51.1 trillion in 2005 and the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.9 percent - well below the average of the last 40 years. 
   Almost 70 percent of Americans now own their homes - more than at any time in our nation's history, and minority homeownership has reached record levels. 
   Economic indicators show that the 2003 tax cuts were a success. Federal revenues grew by 14 percent in 2005, reaching $2.15 trillion, and with sustained tax relief, revenues are expected to grow another seven percent this year to a record high $2.3 trillion. 
   The capital gains and dividends tax cuts, which were the centerpiece of the 2003 bill, have actually more than paid for themselves. This month the Congressional Budget Office released a report indicating these pro-growth policies didn't reduce federal revenues at all and actually generated an additional and unanticipated $26 billion in 2004 and 2005.
