SEN. FRIST REJECTS SHORT-TERM EXTENSION, URGES SENATE DEMOCRATS TO JOIN HOUSE COUNTERPARTS IN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF PATRIOT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after House passage of the USA Patriot Act Conference Report:  
   "Today's overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House for the Patriot Act - with the support of 44 Democrats, including members of the House Democratic leadership - shows that we can all unite to make America safer from terrorism while safeguarding our civil rights and civil liberties. Senate Democrats should follow the lead of their House counterparts in bipartisan support of the Patriot Act when it comes before the Senate. This is an issue that should transcend partisan politics. 
   "On Friday, every Senator will have an opportunity to vote on the Patriot Act conference report. I am opposed to a short-term extension."
