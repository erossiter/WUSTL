SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING SENATE CONFIRMATION OF PRISCILLA OWEN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after Senate confirmation of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   "Today's vote marks a triumph of principle over politics and results over rhetoric. Justice Owen is a distinguished, mainstream jurist who has exhibited extraordinary patience and courage in the face of vicious and continuous criticism. This vote should mark a new beginning here in the Senate - a step forward for principle, fairness and the Constitution. However, we cannot stop with this single step. Though it remains my hope that the Constitutional option does not become necessary, we must give fair up or down votes to other previously blocked nominees. It is the only way to close this miserable and unprecedented chapter in Senate history."
