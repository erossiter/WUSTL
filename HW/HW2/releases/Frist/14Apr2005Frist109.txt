SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS HOUSE PASSAGE OF BANKRUPTCY BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following House passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005:  
   "Today's House passage of the bankruptcy reform bill is a victory for personal responsibility and fairness. The legislation is based on a simple principle: those who have the means should repay their debts. It will help rein in abuse of the bankruptcy system that is costing every American in the form of higher interest rates, higher down payments and higher costs of goods and services. I'm proud that Congress is working in a bipartisan way to deliver results for the American people. And I look forward to President Bush signing the bill into law."
