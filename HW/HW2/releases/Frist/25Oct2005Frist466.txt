SEN. FRIST HAILS APPROVAL OF IRAQI CONSTITUTION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the official announcement of the passage of the permanent Iraqi constitution:  
   "The approval of Iraq's permanent constitution in the October 15 referendum is a historic occasion for the people of Iraq. According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, more than 9.8 million voters turned out nationwide; more than three-quarters of the population voted to approve the constitution. In addition, close to 78% of voters from Baghdad province voted in favor of the constitution. These results indicate that the majority of the Iraqi people desire freedom and democracy, and view the democratic process as the way forward to a free and stable Iraq. 
   "Even though segments of Iraq's Sunni population largely opposed the constitution, their participation in the referendum demonstrates their increasing recognition of the importance of the political process. Only through peaceful democratic engagement can all of Iraq's diverse population ensure that its rights are secured and its interests protected. I am hopeful that Sunni concerns will be further addressed once a permanent Iraqi government is elected. 
   "It is crucial for Iraqis to continue to work together to prepare for the next step in the democratic transition. In December, Iraqis will return to the polls to elect a new government that will begin implementation of the constitution. 
   "I commend the Iraqi people on reaching another milestone on their path to democracy. The United States will continue to support the Iraqi people as they prepare for the December elections and continue to work toward our shared vision of a free, democratic and prosperous Iraq that is governed by the rule of law, protects the rights of all Iraqis, is not a threat to its neighbors, and is a responsible international citizen."
