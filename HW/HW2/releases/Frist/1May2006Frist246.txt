SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON STATUS OF ENERGY LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the "Gas Price Relief and Rebate Act," which Republican senators introduced last week to provide relief from rising gas prices and address long-term energy needs:  
   "The Republican plan will help people who are emptying their wallets at the pump with a $100 rebate check, which is equal to a 9-month federal gas tax holiday for the average consumer-but we'll do it the right way. 
   "Accordingly, I've spoken with Chairman Grassley, and we have agreed to withdraw the LIFO repeal proposal from the rebate package. He will hold hearings on the LIFO proposal later this year, so the pluses and minuses of the provision can become well-known. 
   "In the meantime, I'll continue working to find a way to bring our proposals to the Senate floor for a vote. We've got to help those who are feeling pain at the pump as quickly as possible. Families deserve relief, we must increase our domestic supply, our refinery bottleneck must end, and we must move to alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Our policies will help at the pump now while working toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil, which threatens our national security."
