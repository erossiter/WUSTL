SEN. FRIST PRAISES FINAL PASSAGE OF SECURITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERY PORT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Security And Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) conference report:  
   "Strengthening port security is another vital step in guarding against terrorist efforts to take innocent American lives. We have made great strides in securing our borders and providing the tools necessary to win the War on Terror in recent days, and our Nation's seaports will now be safer as a result of this legislation. Even as we mark these accomplishments, the security of our nation's citizens must remain our highest priority." 
   The U.S. maritime system includes more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3,700 cargo and passenger terminals. The SAFE Port Act strengthens cargo security programs, improves security training for port workers, and institutes protocols for reopening ports following a terrorist attack.
