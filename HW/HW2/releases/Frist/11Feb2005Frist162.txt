SEN. FRIST APPOINTS THOMAS DONNELLY TO U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced his appointment of American Enterprise Institute resident fellow Thomas Melvin Donnelly to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission:  
   "I'm pleased to announce my appointment of Thomas Donnelly to the U.S.-Economic and Security Review Commission," said Frist. "With a distinguished background in both defense and national security studies, country-specific expertise on China, and experience on Capitol Hill, Tom possesses the knowledge, skills, and wisdom to provide outstanding council to the United States Congress. I look forward to working with Thomas and the other members of the commission." 
   Charged with assessing the national security implications of our bilateral trade and economic agreements with China, the commission must submit an annual report, providing recommendations to Congress for legislative and administrative action. By law the commission is composed of 12 members, three of whom are selected by each of the Majority and Minority leaders of the Senate, and the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the House. Commissioners serve two-year terms.
