SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NEW REPORT WARNING OF IMPACT OF 'INEVITABLE' EPIDEMIC
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Trust for America's Health released a report entitled "A Killer Flu? 'Inevitable' Epidemic Could Kill Millions":  
   "Today's report highlights what has become a growing concern; the potential human and economic devastation posed by the unchecked spread of infectious diseases. Unfortunately the United States is woefully underprepared to respond in the event of a pandemic outbreak. We have a responsibility to focus much greater energy on preparing for avian influenza and similar public health threats, whether natural, accidental, or intentional in origin. While the risk is still uncertain, the impact of human transmission on a global scale would be unquestionably devastating. I encourage my Senate colleagues to renew our commitment to passing Senate bill S.3 which includes many critical provisions that would put the United States on the path to being prepared. 
   "We have been adequately warned about the potential devastation. We would do well to mind the adage that says, 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'" 
   Earlier this month, Senator Frist called for a "Manhattan Project for the 21st Century," which offered legislative initiatives to better prepare the United States and the world to respond to epidemics and outbreaks. 
   In previous speeches and in his call for a "Manhattan Project for the 21st Century," Senator Frist has proposed the following initiatives to build on landmark anti-bioterrorism legislation he helped pass during the 107th and 108th Congresses and better protect the United States: 
   * Provide pandemic liability protection. 
  Broaden Safety Act coverage to those who develop, distribute, prescribe, and administer countermeasures in the event of a pandemic or epidemic, as companies will not invest in the development of vaccines, antivirals, or future countermeasures without liability protection.
  * Encourage domestic production capacity with tax-based incentives. 
  Extend manufacturing and research tax credits to entities developing countermeasures in order to encourage a) interested companies to locate manufacturing facilities in the United States, b) develop new, better countermeasures, and c) pursue advanced, coordinated research and development such as animal cell culture vaccine production and biotechnology techniques such as reverse genetics.
  * Improve efficiency during a public health emergency. 
  Provide an antitrust exemption allowing companies, which are involved in the development of priority countermeasures, to better coordinate the development, manufacture, distribution, purchase, or sale of priority countermeasures.
  * Encourage the development of new detection technologies and research tools. 
  Expand the definition of "qualified countermeasures" included under the law.
  * Move advanced vaccines and countermeasures to market as quickly and safely as possible. 
  Ensure fast track review for second generation vaccines and countermeasures.
  * Improve global surveillance and detection. 
   Establish an effective, real-time foreign biological threat detection system.
