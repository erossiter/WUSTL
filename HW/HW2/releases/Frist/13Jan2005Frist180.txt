SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR
  Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN) today announced that Jim Hippe will serve as the new Legislative Director for his Senate office.  
 He replaces Andrea Becker who now serves as Chief of Staff in Frist's Senate office. A Nashville native, Hippe has been with Frist since July 2000. He most recently served as Legislative Counsel to Senator Frist on issues including tort reform, labor, telecommunications and commerce. 
   "Jim brings extensive legislative experience to his new position as Legislative Director," said Frist. "Over the past four years he has proven himself as an insightful, committed and trusted counsel. There is much we can do for Tennesseans in the next two years and with Jim's leadership and guidance, I'm confident that we'll continue serving in the best interests of all Tennesseans." 
   Prior to joining Frist, Hippe served as Legislative Counsel to the late Senator Strom Thurmond, for whom he managed telecommunications, commerce, small business and banking issues. He has also worked for the law firm of McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe in Richmond, Virginia. Hippe is a graduate of the University of Richmond and the Vanderbilt University School of Law.
