  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton announced her resignation:  
   "Throughout her career Gale Norton has been an outstanding public servant who's served her nation with honor and integrity. She's earned a reputation for being a molder of consensus and a fierce advocate for conservation, and has worked to fulfill the president's commitment to taking better care of our national park system. The first female to head the Department of the Interior, she has helped ensure that Americans better appreciate and remain responsible stewards of our nation's diverse landscape. I thank her for her lifetime of service, and wish her well as she enters this new stage in life."
