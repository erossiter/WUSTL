SEN. FRIST REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) tonight made the following statement:
   "Tonight's speech was an expression of compassion and principle - an optimistic vision of what makes America great and a challenge to all Americans to work together to fulfill our nation's highest ideals. 
   "In his speech the president reiterated the compelling case for taking the fight to the terrorists before they bring terror to our shores. A peaceful, democratic Iraq is vital to our success in the War on Terror, and I applaud his resolve in using the power of political freedom to defeat terror in the region and across the globe. 
   "As a doctor committed to transforming our health care system, I was especially pleased the president highlighted this fundamental issue. Health care will be a major priority in the coming year and together we'll address the rising cost of health care and guarantee affordable and accessible care is a reality for all Americans. 
   "Finally, I agree with the president that we must continue to sponsor initiatives that reduce the burden on taxpayers and small businesses, harness our nation's talent and creativity and enable us to remain not only competitors, but leaders in the global marketplace. Building upon programs like my SMART Grants initiative can help address tomorrow's challenges today. 
   "Looking ahead, I hope my colleagues from across the political spectrum will be willing to temper partisan rhetoric, summon civility and commit to genuinely addressing the issues that matter to the American people. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito's presence in the chamber was another stirring reminder of the momentum we've already generated this year in addressing the issues that matter most to Americans. Working together, we can and will secure for every American a freer, safer and healthier future."
