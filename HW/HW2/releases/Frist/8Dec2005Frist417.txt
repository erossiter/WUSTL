SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS INTERNATIONAL DECISION TO ALLOW ISRAEL TO JOIN RED CROSS, RED CRESCENT IN GLOBAL RELIEF EFFORTS
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the adoption of a new symbol that allows Israel to join the Red Cross and the Red Crescent in global humanitarian relief efforts:  
   "I applaud Thursday's vote in Geneva by an overwhelming majority of states-parties to the Geneva Conventions to approve the new emblem, thus setting the stage for Israel to join the Red Cross and the Red Crescent in global relief efforts. This action creates a third protective symbol so that Israeli relief agencies, such as Magen David Adom, can join the global relief movement after nearly sixty years of exclusion. 
   "I commend the International Committee of the Red Cross and the American Red Cross for its efforts to make this humanitarian movement universal and permit Israeli participation. This new emblem sends a strong message that all members of the international community are welcome to contribute to the humanitarian goal of providing relief and treatment to those threatened by violence and natural disasters."
