SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON LOBBY REFORM
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Yesterday's plea arrangement with Jack Abramoff indicates that our system of justice works and those who break the law for personal gain find no favor in Washington. 
   "I will be working with colleagues this session to examine and act on any necessary changes to improve transparency and accountability for our body when it comes to lobbying. 
   "Some members have already made recommendations to me, or introduced legislation. I look forward to working to secure the continued integrity of the Senate."
