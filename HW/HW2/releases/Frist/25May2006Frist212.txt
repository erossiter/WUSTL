SEN. FRIST PRAISES SUSTAINED GROWTH IN GDP
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew at a rate of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2006:  
   "Today's upward revision of GDP growth during the first quarter of 2006 reflects a healthy economy that has grown for the past 55 months, generating 5.3 million new jobs and maintaining record low unemployment levels. Republican-led policies have already proven to help strengthen our economy and provide an environment conducive to small business investment and growth. Last week President Bush ensured that these policies endure by signing into law a bill that prevents a $70 billion tax increase on the American people. I'm proud of the progress we've made. The Republican majority continues to ensure that America remains a great place to live and do business."
