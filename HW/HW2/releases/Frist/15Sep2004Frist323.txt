SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD NEARLY $10 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for awarding $9,699,934 to the Tennessee Department of Health to be used for the Bioterrorism-Hospital Preparedness Program.  
   "This funding is an investment in Tennessee and the continued safety and security of the American people," said Frist. "Bioterrorism is a threat we must be prepared to face, and I commend the Department of Health and Human Services for helping to provide the vital resources our first responders and emergency workers need to combat a potential threat." 
   "This is an important investment by HHS in the State of Tennessee," Alexander said. "I believe it's the government's responsibility to keep its citizens safe. Both Senator Frist and I applaud HHS's commitment to helping protect the nation and Tennesseans from the adverse effects of a biological, radiological, chemical, or nuclear attack." 
   The purpose of the Bioterrorism-Hospital Preparedness Program is to aid state, territory, and selected entities in improving the capacity of the health care system, including hospitals, emergency departments, outpatient facilities, EMS systems, and poison control centers to respond to incidents requiring mass immunization, isolation, decontamination, diagnosis and treatment in the aftermath of terrorism or other public health emergencies.
