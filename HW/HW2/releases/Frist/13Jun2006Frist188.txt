SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES NEW CHIEF OF STAFF, PROMOTES TWO OTHERS IN PERSONAL OFFICE
  Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today named Bart VerHulst to serve as his personal office chief of staff. VerHulst replaces Andrea Becker, who now serves as special assistant for legislative affairs at the White House. 
   "Andrea was a terrific asset to our state for six years," Frist said. "I am grateful for her dedication to Tennessee and for her impressive service. I know she will serve the President and our nation well, and I wish her all the best."
   VerHulst has served as a member of Frist's staff since the senator took office in January 1995. In 2001, VerHulst was promoted to state director after serving as Frist's Middle Tennessee field representative for six years. In that capacity, he has acted as the senator's principal advisor on issues of concern in Tennessee and will now oversee the daily operation of Frist's personal office. 
   Frist also named Jim Hippe as his deputy chief of staff. A Nashville native and a graduate of Vanderbilt University Law School, Hippe has been a member of the senator's staff since July 2000. He most recently served as Frist's legislative director and directly handled telecommunications and intellectual property issues. 
   In addition, Frist named David Weed to serve as his state director. A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Weed joined Frist's staff as the Middle Tennessee field director in the spring of 2003 and has served in that capacity since that time. 
   "We have a strong team in place to serve the people of Tennessee," Frist added. "Bart is a tremendous leader and a trusted advisor who will excel in his new tasks. These promotions will best address the Volunteer State's needs, and I am grateful all three have agreed to accept these new roles."
