SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NEW JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS SENT TO SENATE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the president's nomination of 10 new federal judges:  
   "Today, the president sent 10 judicial nominations to the Senate, including 6 district court nominees and 4 circuit court nominees. Over the past two years, the Senate has demonstrated its commitment to confirming qualified judicial nominees to the federal bench who practice judicial restraint and respect the rule of law. As Majority Leader, I am committed to ensuring that every qualified judicial nominee receives a fair up-or-down vote."
   "I expect that my colleagues will treat these nominees fairly by giving them a civil hearing and a dignified debate followed by an up-or-down vote on confirmation. I look forward to learning more about these nominees in the coming weeks and urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to expeditiously process these nominations."
