SEN. FRIST WELCOMES REID'S ENDORSEMENT OF JULY 27 DEADLINE FOR SEXUAL PREDATORS LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced his endorsement of Frist's call to send sexual predators legislation to the President for signature by July 27: 
   "I welcome Senator Reid's support. Protecting our children from sexual predators, either in our neighborhoods or online, is a cause that transcends partisanship. We must act now to create a national sex offender registry, and we should not allow issues unrelated to sexual predators to delay completion of this critical legislation."
   On Tuesday, Frist sent the attached letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) urging the two to meet the July 27 deadline and pledging to work with them to meet that goal. That date marks the 25th anniversary of the abduction and murder of Adam Walsh, the 6-year-old son of National Center for Missing and Exploited Children cofounders John and Revé Walsh. 
   The Senate unanimously passed S. 1086, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, May 4. The bill would create a national sex offender registry accessible on the internet and searchable by zip code, require convicted sex offenders to register (including child predators who use the internet to commit a crime against a minor), make failure to register a felony, and toughen criminal penalties for violent crimes against children under twelve.
