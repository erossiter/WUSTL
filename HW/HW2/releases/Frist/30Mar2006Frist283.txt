SEN. FRIST, GOV. BREDESEN ANNOUNCE $50 MILLION FEDERAL PAYMENT TO TENNESSEE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., and Gov. Phil Bredesen today announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved a $50 million increase in supplemental essential access payments (EAPs) to Tennessee's health care providers.  
   "The health and well-being of Tennesseans is my foremost priority, and this federal assistance strengthens every Tennessean's ability to access care," Frist said. "Last year, I pledged to monitor all changes made to TennCare and announced that I stood ready to assist the state. I thank Governor Bredesen for his leadership and appreciate the administration's support of Tennessee's request. By working together, Tennessee's health care community will be able to keep its doors open and provide care to thousands of patients. I will continue my efforts to secure quality, affordable health care for all Tennesseans." 
   "This is great news and will go a long way to helping us extend the reach of care even further in Tennessee," Bredesen said. "I want to thank Senator Frist and his staff for their hard work and support of our request for additional essential access funding. I also want to thank Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt for approving this request and for his ongoing support of our efforts to improve access to health care for all Tennesseans."
   The $50 million increase in supplemental EAPs is added to the existing $100 million available under TennCare's current waiver. This one-time increase follows a request by the State to CMS for assistance in serving Tennessee's uninsured, including those disenrolled from TennCare.
