SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD NEARLY $252,000 IN LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION GRANTS FOR MORGAN COUNTY
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the National Park Service for approving $251,780 in Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) grants for outdoor recreation projects in the Rugby State Natural Area, Little Creek Land Acquisition.  
   "Tennessee has some of America's most visited and appreciated natural wonders," said Frist. "Every American deserves the opportunity to visit these places, and we have a duty to conserve them for our children and grandchildren. Senator Alexander and I thank the National Park Service for their help to protect Tennessee's National Parks." 
   "I believe that there is nothing more central to the American character than the Great American Outdoors," said Alexander. "We must do all we can to preserve our national parks and wildlife refuges for future generations to enjoy. I am pleased to see the National Park Service's investment in East Tennessee. Senator Frist and I will continue working to preserve Tennessee's precious natural areas." 
   Congress enacted the LWCF in 1964 to provide conservation funds derived from receipts from oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. In addition to funding federal acquisition of authorized national parks and other conservation and recreation area, the LWCF also provides matching funds to state agencies and local communities known as state-side grants. State-side grants help state and local governments acquire, develop, improve and maintain high quality outdoor recreation areas and open space, assuring that the recreation opportunities provided will be available for all Americans to enjoy in perpetuity.
