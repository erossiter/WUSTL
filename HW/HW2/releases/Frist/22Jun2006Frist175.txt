SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS SUDAN'S STANCE ON UN PEACEKEEPERS FOR DARFUR
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir reaffirmed his rejection of a UN peacekeeping presence in Darfur:  
   "I condemn President Bashir and the Sudanese government for refusing to accept a UN peacekeeping presence to bring an end to the genocide in Darfur. President Bashir's remarks and Khartoum's continued rejection of UN peacekeepers in Darfur is yet another indicator of the Sudanese government's failure to take credible steps to comply with the demands of the international community and to stop the genocide that has killed nearly 200,000 innocent civilians and displaced more than 2 million others. 
   "The African Union peacekeeping force has performed admirably in its efforts to secure the region. However, a larger, more robust force with a stronger mandate is needed. The United States, the AU, the EU, and the UN Security Council have all been very clear that a transition from the current AU peacekeeping force to a UN mission is needed in Darfur. Sudan cannot be permitted to defy the will of the international community. 
   "As long as the genocide continues in Darfur, the Sudanese government in Khartoum must be held accountable. I urge our partners in the international community to continue to push for the transition from an AU to a UN mission, and I call once again on President Bashir and the Government of Sudan to accept a UN peacekeeping force in Darfur."
