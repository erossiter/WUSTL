SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AS DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte as the first Director of National Intelligence: 
   "President Bush's nomination of Ambassador Negroponte is a critical step toward revamping America's intelligence agencies and securing our Nation against terrorism. John Negroponte's distinctive and extensive set of skills and experience clearly qualify him to run our intelligence community. His character and qualifications befit the significance of this new position. As the United States' ambassador to Iraq and the United Nations, John Negroponte has proven himself capable of managing organizations and succeeding in challenging positions. He understands the needs of policymakers and how the executive branch works; he will do very well as the Director of National Intelligence.
   "We're living in uncertain times, and America needs dedicated public servants like John Negroponte who're capable and committed to protecting the American people. John Negroponte is an outstanding candidate for this new position as Director of National Intelligence, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through the Senate."
