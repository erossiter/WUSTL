SEN. FRIST COMMITS TO EXTENDING LOWER CAPITAL GAINS, DIVIDENDS TAX RATES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today:  
   "This Congress will pass, and this president will sign, an extension of economic growth policies, including lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Promoting policies that allow for new job creation is a hallmark of Congress on my watch. 
   "The Finance Committee reported out a package extending expiring tax provisions so that hardworking Americans don't experience an automatic stealth tax increase next year. That was good progress under Chairman Grassley's leadership, and I will bring the legislation to the Senate floor as soon as tomorrow. 
   "Unfortunately, the Committee did not include an extension of the lower tax rate on capital gains and dividends. This will not stop Congress from extending these provisions, and I believe that a majority of the Senate supports including them in the final package. 
   "When the House and Senate meet to work out the difference between their two bills, I will insist that negotiators include an extension of the capital gains and dividend tax relief. This issue is too important to our economy to be left on the cutting room floor and I will not bring a conference report to the Senate floor that does not include this extension. 
   "Keeping taxes low has resulted in much more revenue to the Treasury than forecast over the past year. Low taxes, plus restrained spending and a laser focus on pushing down the deficit, are some of the key elements of keeping our economy strong."
