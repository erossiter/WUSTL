SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR
  Bob Stevenson, Communications Director to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) made the following comments in response to Democratic criticism of the Senator's plans to discuss the Democrat's unprecedented filibuster of judges in a four-minute videotaped address to the Family Research Council on Sunday, April 24.  
   "Last October, the Washington Post reported that Senator John Kerry `used a Baptist pulpit to speak of eternal life and denounce President Bush' during a program at a Florida church sharply critical of the president's policies. 
   "Senate Democrats said nothing in response. 
   "Now, as they prepare to continue their unprecedented filibuster against the president's judicial nominations, they criticize the leader for agreeing to deliver a similar address pressing for fair treatment of the president's judicial nominees. 
   "That's a clear double standard."
