SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "I am committed to getting the work of the American people done in the Senate, which includes advice and consent on the President's judicial nominations as outlined in the Constitution. Never before in the history of the Senate has a nominee with clear majority support been denied an up or down vote on the Senate floor because of a filibuster. To shut down the Senate would be irresponsible and partisan. The solution is simple: return to 200 years of tradition and allow up or down votes on judges."
