SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO BORDER STATES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after receiving a letter regarding the efforts to strengthen our borders: 
   "A major component of comprehensive immigration reform is securing our border. The Administration is to be commended for taking this action. The National Guard and Border and Customs Protection Agencies have also done a superb job in meeting the August 1st deployment schedule."
   "To date 6,000 additional troops are now on our Southwest border, 315 Border Patrol agents have moved to the frontline of enforcement activities and Operation Jump Start has lowered the number of apprehensions along the border by 45 percent. A secure border is a key component of a secure homeland and this is a vital and important step."
