SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF WAR ON TERROR SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill:  
   "Today's bill passage is a reflection of America's commitment to our military servicemembers. This legislation guarantees support for our military and foreign operations by providing funding for equipment and military construction projects. This infrastructure will further our troops' efforts in the War on Terror. America will not relent in the fight to spread freedom in regions of the world long choked by tyranny and fear. I am confident that we will work with the House to reach swift agreement in conference and send the President a bill that he can sign into law."
