SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS U.N. VOTE TO SANCTION NORTH KOREA FOLLOWING NUCLEAR TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to impose sanctions on North Korea following the nation's claimed nuclear test:  
   "I'm pleased the U.N. has demonstrated that there are consequences to North Korea's reckless actions. The United States correctly insisted that North Korea be held responsible for its behavior - the solidarity of a united international community is critical to persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. is extremely fortunate to have an ambassador at the U.N. as skilled as John Bolton to forge the consensus necessary to win approval of this resolution." 
   Yesterday President Bush signed into law the North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006, legislation first introduced by Sen. Frist following North Korea's July 4 missile tests. The Act complements and reinforces the international sanctions put in place today by the UN by ensuring that the United States carefully reviews and imposes appropriate sanctions on all foreign entities involved in transfers of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missile-related items to and from North Korea. U.S. law already required such treatment of WMD and missile-related transfers to and from Iran and Syria.
