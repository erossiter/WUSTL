SEN. FRIST REACTS TO SEN. REID REJECTION OF BIPARTISAN TASK FORCE ON LOBBYING REFORM
 Bob Stevenson, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), made the following statement in reaction to Democratic Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) rejection of a Frist proposal to establish a bipartisan task force on lobbying reform:  
   "It is hard to understand why Senator Reid and the Senate Democratic Leadership would reject a cooperative effort in which both parties would evaluate and develop lobbying reform proposals. 
   "The American people expect us to work together to tackle the problems confronting us. But today, Senator Reid just said 'NO' to bipartisanship. 
   "While Senator Reid's rebuff of a bipartisan task force is disheartening and disappointing, Senate Republicans stand ready to work with their Democratic colleagues in fashioning reform proposals which will fortify rather than erode public confidence in our government. 
   "Lobbying and ethics reform should not be a partisan issue."
