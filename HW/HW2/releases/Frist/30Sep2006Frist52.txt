SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON DEMOCRATS BLOCKING U.S.-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Democrats blocked a unanimous consent proposal to pass the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation bill:  
   "For several weeks Senator Reid and I have been working the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation legislation. Tonight Republicans were prepared to pass the legislation without amendment or debate, and the Democrats objected. I am very disappointed that some Democratic members wish to defeat the bill by adding a large amount of unnecessary amendments. Since we have been unable to reach a unanimous consent agreement we will have to wait until the Senate reconvenes in November to take up this measure."
