SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS GROWTH IN 3RD QUARTER GDP
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the announcement that the gross domestic product rose at an annual pace of 3.8% in the third quarter:  
   "Today's report underscores the strength and stability of America's economy. In the face of two monumental natural disasters and their resulting impact on energy prices, our economy has remained strong and vibrant. Our nation's GDP continued expanding last quarter, weathering the demands caused by these storms and reflecting an economy that is strong, sustainable and thriving under the Republican-led Congress' pro-growth initiatives. I'm pleased by today's numbers and will continue working with my Republican colleagues to pass pro-growth legislation that stimulates the economy, drives down the deficit and ensures that America's consumers are receiving a fair shake in the marketplace."
