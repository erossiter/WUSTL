SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF SANDY MATTICE AS U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement after the White House announced that President Bush will nominate Sandy Mattice as the next U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  
   "I can say without any reservation that Sandy Mattice will be an outstanding federal judge. Sandy embodies the qualities we all look for in a judge - he's honest, he's fair, he's impartial and he has the perfect judicial temperament. He has a distinguished history of service to his community, to Tennessee and to his country. As Judge Edgar takes senior status, he leaves big shoes to fill, but Sandy is up to the job. I will work very hard to confirm him in the Senate as soon as possible." 
   Sandy Mattice has served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee since January 2001. In 1997, he served as senior counsel for the Senate Committee on Government Affairs during a special investigation of the 1996 federal election campaigns. He also practiced at the law firms of Baker, Donelson, Bearman and Caldwell (now named Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell and Berkowitz) and Miller & Martin. Mr. Mattice graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville and currently resides with his family in Signal Mountain, Tennessee.
