SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES SENATE TO CONSIDER ASBESTOS LEGISLATION NEXT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-TN) today announced the Senate will take up consideration of asbestos reform next:  
   "Eleven sitting Democrats have asked me to confront and control this growing problem, a problem so large and unruly that the Supreme Court has asked Congress to enact legislation to fix the problem on three separate occasions. This bipartisan legislation means that a patient will no longer have to risk his case in the jackpot justice system that rewards trial lawyers at the expense of victims. I hope Senator Reid will join me by calling off the obstructionist tactics and allowing debate to move forward on this common sense legislation. Tagging this legislation as a 'special interest' bill ignores the facts: this is a real problem that Congress should debate." 
   Nearly $74 billion has been lost on the inefficient and disastrous asbestos litigation system, with wealthy trial lawyers receiving almost $30 billion at the expense of asbestos victims. These costs have already bankrupted 77 companies, destroyed 150,000 American jobs and caused workers to lose $200 million in wages. Meanwhile, victims with real injuries are left with no recourse, spending years awaiting a trial without getting the justice they deserve. The bipartisan FAIR Act created by Senators Specter and Leahy will provide a victim with mesothelioma - who must go through painful rounds of radiation, chemotherapy, and, often times, extensive surgery - $1.1 million to help compensate him for his health costs, pain and suffering.
