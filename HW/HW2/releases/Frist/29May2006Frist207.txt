SEN. FRIST HAILS SIGNING OF RESPECT FOR AMERICA'S FALLEN HEROES ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after President Bush signed into law the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which would prevent protesters from disrupting military funerals: 
   "Americans across the country are pausing today to honor soldiers who have given their lives to secure our freedom. Unfortunately, some have recently used the occasion of military funerals to express hateful opinions in complete disregard of grieving families. I'm pleased the President has acted so quickly to sign this bill so that we can ensure families are able to honor their heroic loved ones in peace and with the dignity they deserve."
   The bill, which passed both the House and Senate with unanimous support last week, will ban disruptive demonstrations within 150 feet of any entrance or exit point to a national cemetery property unless the demonstration has received prior approval. It will also prohibit any demonstration, irrespective of its character, within 300 feet of national cemetery property that would impede access to the property. Violators will be subject to fines and up to a year in prison.
