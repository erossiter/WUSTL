SEN. FRIST COMMENTS AFTER MEETING WITH REFUGEES FROM DARFUR
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., today made the following statement after meeting with Sudanese refugees in Eastern Chad:  
   "What I've seen over the last several days - having met with refugees, relief workers and government officials from Chad - confirms in my opinion that this is genocide. The refugees' stories describe horrific acts of violence, rape and murder. I believe that there appears to be an organized campaign to eliminate a large segment of the civilian population of Darfur. 
   "We await an official report from the U.S. State Department as to whether these atrocities do indeed meet the legal threshold to be defined as genocide. Despite the outcome of the report, the facts remain clear, over 1.1 million Sudanese have been displaced and over 200,000 have sought refuge in camps in Chad. The humanitarian need is real. The United States has provided 85 percent of food aid. The people of Darfur need more involvement and support from the world community. For too many refugees, time is running out."
