SEN. FRIST MOVES FORWARD ON LOBBYING REFORM
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today sent the following letter[1] to Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) asking the committee to address lobbying reform legislation during the week of February 27, 2006.  
 Frist said: 
   "The American people expect us to work together on lobbying and ethics reform. It is not and should not be a partisan issue. Though Senator Reid (D-NV) has rejected my offer to form a Bipartisan Lobbying Reform Taskforce, it's our bipartisan responsibility as national leaders to ensure America's continued confidence in their elected officials. Once the committee has completed its work, I intend to bring lobbying reform legislation to the floor for fair and free debate as soon as possible."
