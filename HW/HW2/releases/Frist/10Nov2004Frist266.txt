SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AS ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General:  
   "I applaud President Bush for nominating White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General. He has lived the American Dream - from humble roots as the son of migrant workers who never finished elementary school to be nominated by the President of the United States as the first Hispanic American Attorney General. He is also a skilled lawyer who will continue to lead the fight on the war on terror and help make America safer and more secure. I look forward to swift action on his nomination by the Senate in the 109th Congress."
