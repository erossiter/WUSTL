SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SIGNING OF TERRORIST TRIBUNAL LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the President signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law:  
   "Today marks another victory for the U.S. in the global war against terrorism. With the signing of this legislation, terror leaders like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will face justice for their crimes and a vital intelligence program that has saved American lives will continue to protect our country. We must remain on the offensive against an enemy determined to destroy us, and this President and this Republican Congress will not waiver in that fight."
