  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after President Bush appointed Joshua Bolten to replace Andrew Card as White House chief of staff: 
   "Throughout his tenure as deputy White House chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, Josh Bolten has proven himself as a dynamic and creative policymaker and a committed public servant. He's a master of the budget and economic issues with a wealth of experience in government. Mr. Bolten has served the president and the American people well, and is an excellent choice to succeed Andrew Card as White House chief of staff. 
   "Andrew Card has provided strong and steady leadership at the White House during some of our nation's most turbulent times and he leaves behind a storied legacy. His presence will be missed but I look forward to working with Josh Bolten as the Senate continues working with the administration to implement policies that keep America strong, free and safe."
