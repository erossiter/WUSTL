SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR REVIEW OF BORDER SAFETY STATISTICS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today called for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) analysis of the Border Safety Initiative as well as a review of death statistics along America's southern and northern borders.  
   "Last year, several hundred people died in the deserts and mountains that divide the United States and Mexico," said Frist. "Many perished due to exposure to the elements and others died in accidents, however an alarming number were murdered. In 2004 alone, over 20 people died as a result of hanging, blunt-force trauma, gun shot wounds and other apparently deliberate means. We must protect our nation from those who seek to enter it illegally, but we also have a moral obligation to protect all who set foot on our soil from physical harm. 
   "This GAO assessment can improve the systematic collection of federal data related to border deaths, and ensure that the Border Safety Initiative is being properly implemented and evaluated. It is morally unacceptable to allow these losses of life to go unnoticed or ignored. " 
   In his letter, Senator Frist requests an assessment of the number of annual border-crossing deaths, the level of resources being devoted to the Border Safety Initiative and the government's data collection capabilities in documenting border deaths. Currently it does not appear that there is a systematic collection of federal data related to border deaths. Federal crime statistics collected by the FBI do not regularly publish border homicide statistics, while local level statistics often appear inconsistent with what national data is available. 
   Attached is a copy of the letter Senator Frist submitted to David Walker, Comptroller General of the GAO.
