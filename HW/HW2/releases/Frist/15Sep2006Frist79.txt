SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEDICARE QUALITY ENHANCEMENT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act:  
   "We have taken great strides with regard to Medicare but we must address issues that continue to plague the system. The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act - of which I am a proud cosponsor - improves health care by providing qualified private-sector organizations access to Medicare data so they may analyze and report on health care quality. Because these reports will be public, consumers will have access to quality information in order to make better-informed health care decisions. The Act promotes existing efforts to develop model quality standards and encourages continued work with providers, consumers and insurers to ensure quality measurement for all patients. I want to thank Senator Gregg for pushing this legislation." 
   The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act: 
   * Requires CMS to provide Medicare enrollment, claims, survey and assessment data to private sector Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations (MQROs) to develop reports to measure health care quality for the public; 
   * Mandates the protection of beneficiary privacy; 
   * Empowers consumer groups, providers, employers, insurance plans, labor unions and others to request reports from MQROs; and 
   * Provides for the public release of all reports.
