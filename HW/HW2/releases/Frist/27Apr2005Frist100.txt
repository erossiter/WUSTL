SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS APPROVAL OF ZIMBABWE AS MEMBER OF U.N. COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following the United Nation's (UN) reported approval of Zimbabwe as a member of the Commission on Human Rights:  
   "Today's selection of Zimbabwe as a member of the Commission on Human Rights is deeply troubling. The Government of Zimbabwe has consistently disregarded the rights of its people, repressed political dissent and quashed any and all opposition. Far from earning a role as a protector of human rights, their membership renders the commission illegitimate and irrelevant. A real and credible UN Human Rights Commission would be condemning the current regime and its activities. I deplore their selection as a commission member, and hope that this outrageous appointment will help inspire UN members to enact extensive and meaningful reform of the Commission." 
   Senator Frist has long been an advocate for democracy in Zimbabwe. In 2001, Frist authored the "Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001" to support the people of Zimbabwe in their struggles to bring about peaceful, democratic change and restore the rule of law. 
   Frist has also criticized the selection of other countries, such as Sudan, to the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). In the last Congress, Frist passed a Senate Resolution with the unanimous support of his colleagues that called for Sudan's suspension from the UNHRC while allegations of genocide against the people of Darfur were investigated.
