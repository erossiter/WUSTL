SEN. FRIST SECURES $2 MILLION FOR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU CONSERVATION
  Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today announced that the Fiscal Year 2007 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, includes $2 million for land acquisition on the Cumberland Plateau in addition to significant funding for Tennessee parks, forests and conservation programs. 
   "The natural beauty of the Cumberland Plateau is one Tennessee's most valuable environmental assets," Frist said. "I'm pleased federal, state and private interests are all coming together to assist conservation efforts on the plateau. We must work to preserve our environmental treasures, and I will continue pursuing that goal in the Senate."
   The plateau's largest private landowner recently announced its intention to sell 100,000 acres of timberland on the Cumberland Plateau. Many of these tracts are critical lands that connect to protected areas such as the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area and Fall Creek Falls State Park.
   According to biodiversity analyses derived from Tennessee's State Wildlife Action Plan, two particular tracts are of extreme conservation importance. The requested funding, in conjunction with funds from the State of Tennessee and private donors, will be used to acquire these tracts and ensure they are protected for future generations.
