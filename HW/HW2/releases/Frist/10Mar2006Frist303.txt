SEN. FRIST HAILS FEBRUARY JOB FIGURES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the announcement by the Department of Labor that the economy continued to grow last month and created over 240,000 new jobs in February:  
   "Today's figures reflect an economy that has grown for over 54 consecutive months and generated over 5 million new jobs since September 2003. More people are employed today than ever in the history of the country. The key to creating jobs and strengthening our economy is through fiscal discipline. Constraining the growth of entitlement spending and exercising fiscal restraint will keep America's economy resilient and adaptable to any challenges we may face. 
   "That's why the United States Senate will continue to lead on issues of fiscal responsibility. Next week I expect the full Senate to build off this momentum by passing the 2007 budget resolution. 
   "We must continue to take a fiscally-disciplined approach in government and our commonsense, conservative approach will help keep our economy strong, stable and growing."
