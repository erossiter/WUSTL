SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER COSPONSOR RESOLUTION CELEBRATING 80 YEARS OF GRAND OLE OPRY
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today introduced a Senate resolution celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Grand Ole Opry.  
 The resolution recognizes the tremendous contribution that the Opry has made to American popular music and the cultural history of the nation. The Senate passed the resolution unanimously this morning. 
   "If not for the Grand Ole Opry, my hometown of Nashville may never have become 'Music City, USA,'" Frist said. "Throughout its history, the Opry has embraced and celebrated the best in family entertainment, including musical performances and comedy sketches that have warmed the hearts of millions. I celebrate, along with Senator Alexander, the living history of a cultural landmark that projects the best of Tennessee to the nation and the world." 
   "There's nothing quite like the Grand Ole Opry. If you understand how important the Alamo is to Texans, you'll understand how important the Grand Ole Opry is to Tennesseans," Alexander said. "In the spirit of Minnie Pearl and the thousands of Americans who have created and enjoyed the Grand Ole Opry, I join Senator Frist in saying, 'Happy 80th Birthday, Grand Ole Opry.'" 
   Founded as WSM Barn Dance, a weekly radio broadcast on WSM radio in Nashville, The Grand Ole Opry now stands as the longest continuously running weekly radio broadcast, with over 4000 consecutive Saturday evening shows. The broadcast has featured the likes of Hank Williams, Elvis Pressley, Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton, Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, and Reba McEntire, as well as a roster of today's country music super stars.
