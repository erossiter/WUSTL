SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR TENNESSEE
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that President Bush has approved public assistance for counties that were severely impacted by heavy rains, severe storms and flooding that occurred beginning on September 16.  
   "Today's approval for disaster assistance will help ease the financial burden placed on 13 Tennessee counties impacted by last month's severe storms and flooding," said Frist. "I applaud President Bush's support for East Tennessee. The efforts being taken at the federal, state and local level will help ensure that recovery and rebuilding efforts can move forward." 
   "We appreciate President Bush's quick action to deliver these public assistance funds to Tennessee counties that are cleaning up," said Alexander. "This aid will be used to repair critical infrastructure, such as roads and bridges that were damaged by last month's severe weather." 
   In a letter on September 28, Frist and Alexander along with Congressmen Zach Wamp (R-TN), John Duncan (R-TN), William Jenkins (R-TN) and Lincoln Davis (D-TN) urged the Administration to act quickly on Governor Bredesen's request for federal disaster assistance.  
   The counties receiving public assistance in today's declaration include Campbell, Carter, Clay, Cocke, Cumberland, Grundy, Hamilton, Jackson, Johnson, Meigs, Polk, Rhea and Roane counties. 
   All Tennessee counties are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. After further evaluations, additional assistance designations may be made at a later date.
