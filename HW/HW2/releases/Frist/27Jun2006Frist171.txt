SEN. FRIST REMARKS ON DEFEAT OF FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate defeated the Flag Protection Amendment by a vote of 66-34, an increase of 3 supporters since the Senate last considered the issue in 2000. The amendment would give Congress the authority to establish laws prohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag: 
   "Old Glory lost today. At a time when our armed services are defending America's freedom in the War on Terror, it's unfortunate that a minority of my colleagues blocked this amendment. The amendment simply returns to Congress the right to protect the American flag, an authority that existed for 200 years prior to an activist Supreme Court decision in 1989. It's supported by all 50 state legislatures and countless veterans across the nation. Protecting the symbol of our nation's freedom is important, and I hope the amendment's support in the Senate will continue to grow. In the meantime, I hope America rededicates itself to respecting the flag, our symbol of national unity, especially when our troops are wearing that flag as they risk their lives for this great country every day."
