SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF FINAL TVA BOARD MEMBER
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the president's announcement that he intends to nominate Bishop William H. Graves of Memphis to serve as the ninth and final board member of the newly restructured and modernized Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:  
   "Bishop Graves' nomination ensures that West Tennessee's interests are fully represented on the board, and his distinction as the first African-American board member in TVA's history makes this nomination truly momentous."
   "This nomination completes the job of reforming the TVA board that I first undertook nine years ago and that culminated in passage of my legislation a year and a half ago."
   "The six new board members the Senate confirmed in March are doing an excellent job. Bishop Graves will complete the strongest board in TVA's history, and I look forward to swift Senate consideration of his nomination." 
   With revenues of nearly $8 billion last year, TVA is the nation's largest public power company. Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that restructured the board to meet 21st century challenges and reflect the management organization of similar corporations. That legislation expanded the board from three full-time members to nine part-time members and required the agency to hire a chief executive officer to oversee day-to-day operations. 
   Sitting TVA directors Bill Baxter and Skila Harris were joined in March by new directors Susan Richardson Williams, William B. Sansom, Dennis Bottorff, Howard A. Thrailkill, Robert M. Duncan and Donald DePriest. Once Bishop Graves is confirmed by the Senate, the new board will be at full strength.
