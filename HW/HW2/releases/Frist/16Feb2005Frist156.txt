SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. SPECTER
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. made the following statement today:  
   "As you know, Senator Arlen Specter will undergo treatment for Hodgkin's disease. I have spoken with Arlen repeatedly during the past few days and I know he is fully prepared to face the challenge ahead. I expect Arlen will continue to carry out his duties in the Senate as he undergoes care. One thing Arlen Specter has demonstrated throughout his career is that he is one tough individual. Anyone who knows Arlen knows he is a fighter. He will meet this ordeal with the same indomitable courage and determination that has been the hallmark of his life. Karyn and I will be there to support him and his family as he goes forward."
