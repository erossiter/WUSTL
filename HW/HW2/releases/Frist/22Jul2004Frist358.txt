SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF PATIENT SAFETY LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today applauded Senate passage of S. 720, the "Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act."  
 The legislation enhances patient safety by providing incentives to encourage voluntary reporting of information and raises standards and expectations for continuous quality improvements. The bill is based on legislation Frist cosponsored with Sens. Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Judd Gregg (R-NH), John Breaux (D-LA) and others earlier this Congress. The bill passed the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously last year, and it will now go to conference with a similar House bill. 
   "More Americans die each year from medical errors than breast cancer, AIDS or motor vehicle accidents. As a physician who has taken the Hippocratic Oath, this is unacceptable. I know we can do better and passage of today's bill is a major step in the right direction. Fear of unnecessary lawsuits has had a chilling effect on the sharing and analyzing of information that could reduce errors and save lives. This legislation will encourage doctors, nurses and other providers to report and fix system errors. Patients should not be harmed by the health care system that is intended to heal. I look forward to continuing to work with the House and my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to pass this legislation this year."
