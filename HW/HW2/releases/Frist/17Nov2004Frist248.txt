SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON MARGARET SPELLINGS NOMINATION TO BE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Margaret Spellings as the next Secretary of Education:  
   "By nominating Margaret Spellings as the next Secretary of Education, President Bush signals to all Americans how critical education is for the future success of our nation. As Domestic Policy Advisor to the President, she was a key engineer of the 'No Child Left Behind' Act and should be recognized for her efforts to transform America's education system. Her passion and dedication to improving the education of all students cannot be questioned. She will make sure that the legacy of 'No Child Left Behind' is strengthened. I'm pleased that the President has nominated Margaret Spellings to carry on the charge of ensuring all American's children have the best chance at a quality education, and I hope to see her confirmed swiftly."
