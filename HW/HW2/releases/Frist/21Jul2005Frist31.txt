SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES SENATE TO BEGIN ACTION ON GUN LIABILITY LEGISLATION BEFORE AUGUST RECESS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today delivered the following floor statement announcing the Senate will begin consideration of gun liability legislation before August recess:  
   "We will consider gun liability legislation before we leave. Given the profusion of litigation, the Department of Defense faces the very real prospect of outsourcing sidearms for our soldiers to foreign manufacturers. 
   "The Beretta Corporation, for instance, makes the standard sidearm for the U.S. Armed Forces. They have the long term contracts to supply these pistols to our forces in Iraq. Recently, the company had this to say: "The decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals . . . has the likelihood of bankrupting, not only Beretta U.S.A., but every maker of semiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991. 
   "Without this legislation it is probable the American manufacturers of legal firearms will be faced with a real prospect of going out of business, ending a critical source of supply for our armed forces, our police and our citizens. 
   "The legislation prohibits one narrow category of lawsuits: suits against the firearms industry for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition by a third party. Over two dozen lawsuits have been filed on a variety of theories all seeking the same politically motivated goal: putting the industry out of business. 
   "These frivolous suits threaten a domestic industry that is critical to our national defense, jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs, and puts at risk that law abiding citizens have access to guns for recreational use. Many support this legislation and I am hopeful that with the cooperation of members, we can complete all action on this legislation before the recess."
