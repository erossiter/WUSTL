SEN. FRIST HAILS RATIFICATION OF CONVENTION ON CYBERCRIME
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime:  
   "Ratification of this treaty will strengthen law enforcement's ability to fight terrorism, organized crime, and the sexual exploitation of children around the world. 
   "Terrorists use computers to plan and carry out bombings and murder, and child predators use computers to commit a variety of crimes against children from kidnapping and murder to sex trafficking and child pornography. While balancing civil liberty and privacy concerns, this treaty encourages the sharing of critical electronic evidence among foreign countries so that law enforcement can more effectively investigate and combat these crimes. 
   "Through the Convention on Cybercrime, we will make our citizens safer, strengthen the ability of our law enforcement and intelligence community to prevent acts of terrorism on our soil, and protect children around the world from child predators."
