SEN. FRIST SMART INITIATIVE BECOMES LAW
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the president signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which includes the Frist-authored SMART Grant program, into law:  
   "With the president's signature today, SMART grants have opened the doors to new opportunities for students from underserved populations. This legislation empowers students with the resources they need to pursue degrees in math, science, engineering, technology and critical foreign languages and moves America closer to our goal of doubling the number of scientists and engineers in the United States by 2015. I look forward to observing the impact as SMART grants promote new opportunities for America's college students, renew our nation's commitment to math and science education, and help sustain its legacy as a land of creation and innovation."
