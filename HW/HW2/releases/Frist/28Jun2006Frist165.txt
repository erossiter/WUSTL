SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER RESOLUTION HONORING BRISTOL UNANIMOUSLY PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senators Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today announced that the Senate has unanimously approved a Senate resolution celebrating the 150th anniversary of the cities of Bristol, Tenn., and Bristol, Va. Frist and Alexander coauthored the legislation with Senators John Warner (R-Va.) and George Allen (R-Va.). 
   "On my many visits to Bristol, I've always been impressed by the area's rich history and cultural heritage. Bristol truly represents the best of both Tennessee and Virginia," Frist said. "I'm pleased to congratulate the twin cities on 150 years of cooperation and achievement."
   "I am pleased to join my Senate colleagues in celebrating the Bristol Sesquicentennial," Alexander said. "From the music of the Carter Family to the roar of the 'World's Fastest Half-Mile,' the twin cities of Bristol have been a source of pride for two great states." 
   The twin cities were officially chartered in 1856 and celebrated the Bristol Centennial in 1956. The cities have organized to celebrate the Bristol Sesquicentennial in 2006 with the theme "Celebrating 150 Years of Heritage and Harmony."
