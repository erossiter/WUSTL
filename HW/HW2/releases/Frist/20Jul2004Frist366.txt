SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which has passed the Senate Appropriations Committee, includes more than $148 million for Tennessee military construction projects around the state.  
   "Our military men and women have done a tremendous job to defend freedom here at home and around the world," said Frist. "This legislation will help ensure Tennessee's active duty, reserve and National Guard forces have the equipment, infrastructure and state-of-the-art tools they need to do their job safely and effectively."
   "This bill funds Tennessee's priorities for our active duty troops, reservists and the National Guard," said Alexander. "As our military men and women are fighting to protect our freedom, we must do all we can to give them the resources they need at home." 
   Some of the key Tennessee projects included in the Senate version of the FY 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Bill include: 
   * $9.14 million for the Tennessee Army National Guard Headquarters to construct a readiness center. This project will provide much needed additional administrative, storage, and training space, and to complete a total renovation of selected areas of the current facility.
   * $41.5 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard to complete two projects at the Memphis International Airport. Of the funding, $15.5 million will go to expand the C-5 Aircraft parking apron and update the hydrant refueling system to accommodate the first of the C-5 aircraft arriving in 2004. The remaining $26 million will be used to expand a corrosion control hanger to better accommodate the corrosion control activities required for C-5 aircraft. 
   * $22 million for Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, TN, to upgrade the jet engine air induction system. This upgrade to the jet engine air induction system is required to enable infrastructure reductions and increase facility test capabilities. These facilities are used to simulate high altitude flight conditions for testing, evaluation, and development of advanced turbine engines for JSF, F-22, F-16, F-15, and F-18 fighter aircraft. 
   * $11.7 million for the Joint Armed Forces Reserve Center in Smyrna, TN. This center will serve the peacetime missions of area reservists and national guardsmen and provide space for all personnel to perform the necessary tasks that will improve the unit's readiness posture. 
   * $64.6 million for Fort Campbell to complete three military construction projects. Of the funding, $30 million would be used to build new barracks to house the 5th Special Forces Group; $33 million to construct a Division Command and Control Facility to house the Division staff and needed administrative space, a conference room, and an emergency operations center; and $1.6 million to build a 900 square foot live-fire shoot house with multiple entry points and a free-standing roof for the 5th Special Forces Group. 
   The House is scheduled to vote on its version of the legislation as early as Wednesday. The Senate is expected to debate the bill in early September.
