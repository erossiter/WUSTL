SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S FISCAL YEAR 2007 BUDGET
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the president sent Congress his FY07 budget proposal: 
   "The president's budget today begins the process for producing next year's economic blueprint for the government. The budget presented to the Congress today challenges us to control spending, eliminate unnecessary and duplicative programs, and scale back the rate of growth in entitlement programs which pose the greatest risk to our economic future. 
   "It's a budget that correctly emphasizes national and homeland security, and promotes our future security and competitiveness by increasing investments in science, math, and technology."
