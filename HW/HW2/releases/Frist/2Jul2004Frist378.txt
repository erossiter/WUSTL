SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NEW JOB GROWTH IN JUNE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the newly released report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics stating that 112,000 new American jobs were created in June: 
   "Today's report reflects our economy's steady and continued growth," said Frist. "Since last August, American workers have seen the creation of over 1.5 million new jobs. These healthy numbers reflect strong economic growth which was jumpstarted by lowering taxes on America's families. 
   "I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to craft policies that ensure these trends continue. We must continue to pass pro-growth measures that reduce needless regulation and ease the burden on America's families and small-businesses. Today's new numbers show that the economic initiatives enacted by President Bush and the Republican Congress continue to spur development, and that we must continue our work to allow America's economy to thrive."
   The economy has continued to grow steadily over the past 10 months. Since August, America's economy has added over 1.5 million new jobs. Additional growth statistics for this year include: 
   * National manufacturing employment is up by 64,000 jobs since its low in January.
   * Economic growth since last summer has been the fastest in nearly 20 years. 
   * America's standard of living is rising and consumer confidence is at its highest level in 2 years. 
   * Over the past year, our nation's unemployment levels have fallen amongst people of all levels of education, race and age.
