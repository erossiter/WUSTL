SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL RESOLUTION AGAINST ISRAEL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the United Nations Human Rights Council's recent resolution singling out Israel for criticism: 
   "In its inaugural session in Geneva, the newly created UN Human Rights Council demonstrated its failure to improve on the shortcomings of the discredited Commission it replaced and that it cannot be taken seriously as a true protector of human rights. During this session, the Council passed only one country-specific resolution, which condemned the State of Israel for human rights violations. The Council also decided to hold its first special session, which again singled out Israel for criticism."
   "The Council's resolution fails to mention the daily barrage of Qassam rockets fired into Israel from Gaza, Palestinian terrorist groups' kidnappings of three Israelis, the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority's refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce terror, and to abide by the Palestinian Authority's previous agreements with Israel. Meanwhile, the Council also overlooked serious cases of human rights abuse perpetrated by other governments in the region."
   "I condemn the Human Rights Council for singling out Israel for criticism. Through its history, Israel has demonstrated its commitment to the rule of law, democracy, and the protection of human rights. The Council wasted little time in illustrating the deep flaws within the new body and showed that we cannot expect any serious improvement over the former Commission."
