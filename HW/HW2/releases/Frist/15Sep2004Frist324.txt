SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR ST. JUDE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that St.  
 Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis will receive $483,000 from the Department of Energy to purchase new equipment critical to the continued research efforts of the hospital. The funding was supported by both Senators in the FY04 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill.
   "St. Jude's reputation for quality care and research is world renowned," said Frist. "This funding supports the state-of-the-art equipment St. Jude needs to maintain its commitment to finding a cure for childhood cancers and other catastrophic diseases. Senator Alexander and I will continue to do what we can to support St. Jude's valuable research."
   "St. Jude's is a crucial resource for this nation," said Alexander. "This funding will mean further research and treatment options for children who suffer from cancer and other catastrophic diseases." 
   This funding will support the purchase and installation of a T3 Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) for St. Jude Children's Hospital. Many researchers are focusing on the need to define and treat after-effects of childhood cancer and other catastrophic diseases. This requires specialized methods for identifying and monitoring such effects. T3 MRI capabilities will enhance research techniques to detect subtle brain abnormalities in patients with sickle cell disease, detect the characteristics of radiation therapy on the brain, and the detection of diffusion and perfusion in patients with brain tumors and stroke complications.
   Frist and Alexander requested that the funding for St. Jude be added to the FY04 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, which passed last year.
