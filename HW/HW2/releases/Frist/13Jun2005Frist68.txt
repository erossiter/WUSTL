SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE INTERIOR PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee last Thursday, includes significant funding for Tennessee parks, forests, and conservation programs. Funding for a number of critical water infrastructure projects was also included in the bill.  
   "This bill helps preserve and protect many of the cherished natural resources that shape Tennessee's distinctive character," said Frist. "And I'm proud that at a time when funding is limited, the committee regarded these projects as worthy of inclusion in this bill. This bill increases funding for the operation of the National Park System and provides specific monies for several projects in Tennessee's national parks, wildlife refuges, and forests. Support is also provided for several water infrastructure projects that will have a major impact on local communities and their efforts to improve clean drinking water and wastewater services." 
   "I believe that there is nothing more central to the American character than the Great American Outdoors," said Alexander. "We must do all we can to preserve our national parks and wildlife refuges for future generations to enjoy. This bill makes those investments while also investing in valuable water treatment centers and water conservation projects that will ensure cleaner drinking water for thousands of Tennesseans. Senator Frist and I will continue working to conserve Tennessee's natural resources." 
   Funding for specific Tennessee initiatives include: 
   EAST TENNESSEE 
   * $1.8 million to acquire the Wauhatchie tract at the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Acquisition of this property will consolidate land in a historically important and popular visitor spot, and ensure the continued integrity of the Civil War battlefield experience. 
   * $500,000 for the University of Tennessee at Knoxville Natural Resources Policy Center to address natural and water resource management issues in the Southeast. 
   * $1 million for the Watauga River Regional Water Authority in Carter County to provide new clean drinking water services. 
   * $1 million for the City of Oak Ridge to support the West End Water and Wastewater Infrastructure project which will enhance wastewater treatment and drinking water facilities. 
   MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
   * $1.4 million for acquisition of the Walls of Jericho, which is located on the south Cumberland Plateau along the Tennessee and Alabama border. It is considered one of the most unique and biologically diverse areas in the Southeast United States. Preservation of the Walls of Jericho will ensure that the public can enjoy this remarkably scenic and fragile area for generations to come. 
   * $1 million for the Lake Tansi Sewer project in Cumberland County, which will support new wastewater infrastructure for approximately 1,600 homes. 
   * $400,000 for the Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area. The Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area is a statewide partnership between the National Park Service and Middle Tennessee State University. It is the only statewide National Heritage Area, as well as the only National Heritage Area administered by a public university in the nation. 
   WEST TENNESSEE 
   * $500,000 to support the Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee Regional Aquifer Study (MATRAS) through the U.S. Geological Survey and $500,000 to support the Groundwater Institute at the University of Memphis through the Environmental Protection Agency. Funding will support ongoing efforts to help determine how to manage the region's unique groundwater aquifer as a sustainable resource. 
   * $500,000 for the Chickasaw National Wildlife Refuge to acquire land within the existing boundary of the refuge that contain significant amounts of mature bald cypress. Preservation of these lands is essential to protecting naturally occurring habitats of the Lower Mississippi River Valley ecosystem. 
   * $7 million for the U.S. Forest Service International Program, an increase of $500,000 over last year's funding level, which supports a number of conservation programs at the Memphis Zoo. 
   The bill recommends a $64.9 million increase over last year's enacted level to continue to meet the Administration's commitment to maintaining our National Park System. 
   The legislation must now be considered and approved by the full United States Senate.
