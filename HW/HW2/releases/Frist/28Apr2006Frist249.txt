SEN. FRIST HAILS SUSTAINED GROWTH IN GDP
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew at a rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2006:  
   "Today's report of healthy growth in GDP during the first quarter of 2006 reflects an economy that has grown for the past 54 months, is strong, generating over 5 million new jobs and maintaining record low unemployment levels. Sustained economic growth has now exceeded the average of all previous economic expansions. We're proud of the progress we've made, and the American people must know that the Republican majority continues to work hard to ease pain at the pump and prevent tax increases pushed by Democrats, which would choke off growth and job creation."
