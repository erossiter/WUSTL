SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS POLITICAL ATTACKS IN CAMBODIA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the recent series of arrests of opposition political leaders and human rights activists in Cambodia: 
   "In the past year, the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has engaged in a widespread campaign silence his critics, stifle dissent, and enfeeble his political opposition. In particular, the Cambodian government has arrested and detained leading opposition political figures, human rights activists, and other members of Cambodian civil society on reportedly falsified and arbitrary charges. 
   "I am deeply troubled by this string of events and can only draw the conclusion that the Cambodian government lacks a clear and steadfast commitment to the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights.
   "The United States condemns the Cambodian government's attack on democracy and the rule of law. While the government has recently released four of the high profile political prisoners and human rights activists on bail, it must release all political prisoners and drop the spurious charges being levied against them. I strongly urge the Cambodian Prime Minister and his government to reverse this assault on freedom and to allow the Cambodian people to freely express their political views without intimidation."
