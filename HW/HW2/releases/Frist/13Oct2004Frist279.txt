SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE NATIONAL GUARD, FORT CAMPBELL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, now awaiting President Bush's signature, includes more than $150 million for Tennessee military construction projects. The conference report passed the Senate on Monday. 
   "Providing the tools and resources our Tennessee soldiers need to protect freedom at home and abroad is the most important thing we can do," said Frist. "This funding is an investment in our soldiers, and will help ensure that our military and reserve forces remain fully equipped and prepared. Projects for Fort Campbell, Arnold Air Force Base and the Tennessee National Guard will promote combat readiness while improving training and soldier morale."
   "This funding helps guarantee that our service men and women have the best possible housing, training, and conditions," said Alexander. "I'll continue to work with Senator Frist to ensure that our Tennessee troops have the tools they need as they fight to keep us safe." 
   Overall, funding for Tennessee's military construction priorities was more than $22 million above the Administration's budget request. Tennessee projects included in FY05 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report include:
   * $70.6 million for Fort Campbell to fund the construction of an airfield vehicle support facility, a standard design barracks and operations complex (phase I), a command and control facility, a shoot house, and aquatic training facility. The barracks will hold all of the soldiers in the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, while the command and control facility will house the Division staff and include administrative space, a conference room, intelligence centers, and an emergency operations center. 
   * $22 million for the Tennessee National Guard and the US Army Reserve, including $9.1 million for the Nashville Army National Guard Readiness Center (phase I), and $13.5 million for the Smyrna Joint Armed Forces Reserve Center. The renovation of the Readiness Center will provide over 75,000 square feet for administrative offices and logistical and training space. The Smyrna Reserve Center will serve the peacetime missions of the assigned unit. 
   * $41.5 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard at the Memphis International Airport to finance a C-5 Aircraft Parking Apron and Hydrant Refueling System as well as a Corrosion Control Hangar. Both projects are vital to accommodate the first of the C-5 aircraft arriving in 2004. 
   * $22 million for an Upgrade Jet Engine Air Induction System (Phase V) at the Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, Tennessee. The completion of this project will enable infrastructure reductions and increase facility test capabilities. These facilities are used to simulate high altitude flight conditions for testing, evaluation, and development of advanced turbine engines for JSF, F-22, F-16, F-15, and F-18 fighter aircraft. Accurate test data on jet engine turbines could potentially increase the reliability of aircraft engines.
