SEN. FRIST PRAISES SEN. LOTT'S DECISION TO RUN FOR REELECTION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Throughout his career Trent's been true to his Mississippi roots as an outspoken voice for the public interest, and I'm pleased he's chosen to extend his storied legacy. 
   "On a personal level, Trent's been a valued friend and mentor. He's a resident Senate expert - independent and credible - who has always put the institution and his constituents first. In my mind, his strength, passion and relentless work ethic have never been more evident than this past summer when, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Trent rushed home and was an anchor of strength in a region still reeling from that devastating storm. 
   "The Senate benefits immeasurably from his leadership, his common-sense approach to public service and his incomparable personality. I look forward to seeing him launch a vigorous campaign and stand ready to help in any way I can."
