SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS EGYPT BOMBINGS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the terrorist attacks on Egypt's resort city of Dahab:  
   "Today's terrorist attacks on Egypt's resort city of Dahab were senseless, barbaric, and cowardly acts against civilians. On behalf of my Senate colleagues and the American people, I express my deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and to the people of Egypt. 
   "These heinous attacks are yet another grim reminder of the indiscriminate brutality of our terrorist enemy. Egypt has been a friend and ally of the United States in the Global War on Terrorism, and we will stand in solidarity with the people of Egypt to confront and defeat this terrorist enemy." 
   On the night of April 24, the resort city of Dahab, Egypt, located on the Gulf of Aqaba, was struck by three explosions near a market and a hotel that reportedly killed a dozen civilians and injured approximately 100 others.
