SEN. FRIST PRAISES NEW PARTNERSHIPS TO EDUCATE SENIORS ABOUT MEDICARE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement applauding a new initiative supported by the Department of Health and Human Services which partners with senior advocate groups to help educate seniors about new Medicare benefits: 
   "I am pleased these critical organizations have put aside political and policy differences to come together and do what is in the best interest of America's seniors. Too many people have made it their mission to confuse and scare seniors. The National Council on Aging, AARP and the entire ABCRx Coalition are true advocates for seniors and individuals with disabilities."
