SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE EDUCATION FUNDING FOR LEMOYNE-OWEN COLLEGE IN MEMPHIS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today hailed the U.S. Department of Education for awarding $300,000 to LeMoyne-Owen College, located in Memphis, to support long-range improvements in its math and science programs. 
   "In order to remain competitive in this global economy, our nation must graduate greater numbers of science, math and engineering majors," said Frist. "This funding will help to achieve that goal and also help LeMoyne-Owen students obtain the comprehensive math and science skills they need to succeed in this increasingly competitive workforce environment. I commend Secretary Rod Paige for supporting the long-range goals of schools like LeMoyne-Owen College."
   "This important investment in education is also an important investment in jobs," said Alexander. "By producing well-educated students in the fields of science and engineering, we are creating a stronger partnership between institutions of higher education and the needs of the 21st century workforce. Senator Frist and I applaud the Department of Education for supporting long-term improvements in math and science programs at LeMoyne-Owen."
   The funding is part of a three-year grant being awarded to LeMoyne-Owen College through the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement program. This program was established to support long-range improvements in science and engineering education at predominantly minority institutions, and to increase the number of qualified minorities, especially women, in science and engineering careers.
   The program includes institutional, cooperative, design and special project grants. This year, nearly 40 grants worth $4.5 million will be awarded.
