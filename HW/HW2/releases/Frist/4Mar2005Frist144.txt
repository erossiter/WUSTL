SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF SAFE WATER: CURRENCY FOR PEACE ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding Senate Foreign Relations Committee passage of the "Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act:"  
   "I'm pleased by the committee's passage on Thursday of the Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act. Clean water and effective sanitation are vital to fostering stability in developing and war-torn regions of the world. Too many children across the globe die needlessly from unsafe or lack of water. This legislation confronts the human truth that the need for clean water knows no borders, and proper management and intervention can be a currency for peace and international cooperation. I'm hopeful this legislation will soon be enacted so we can confront the growing global emergency of unclean water." 
   The Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act was included in the committee's markup of the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act included in that legislation authorizes funding for a pilot program to assist countries with high rates of water-borne illnesses and requires federal agencies to coordinate in developing a strategic plan to focus the United States' commitment to global water issues. The legislation also directs the president along with the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to create a national strategy for implementing U.S. foreign policy objectives that expand access to safe water and sanitation, sound water management, and improve hygiene for people around the world. 
   Senator Frist and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) are co-sponsoring this legislation along with Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN).
