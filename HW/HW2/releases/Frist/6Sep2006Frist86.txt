SENS. FRIST, MCCONNELL TO INTRODUCE PRESIDENT'S BILL ON TERRORIST DETAINEES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the president presented his bill on terrorist detainees: 
   "I share the president's commitment to bringing terrorists to justice and welcome the legislation he is sending to Congress. For this reason, Senator McConnell and I will introduce the president's bill in the Senate so that our colleagues can review it."
   "This legislation is another tool in the war on terror and we must use it to help keep America safe. We must establish military commissions to prosecute dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield. The procedures should be fair but tough and recognize that we should prosecute barbaric al Qaeda terrorists differently than our uniformed military or civilian criminals."
   "We need to move forward on this issue expeditiously, and I will continue discussing with my colleagues how best to proceed."
