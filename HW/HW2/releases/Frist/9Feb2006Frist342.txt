SEN. FRIST HIGHLIGHTS EFFORTS BY AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) released a report indicating that many commonly used noninvasive tests for breast cancer are not accurate enough to replace routine biopsies:  
   "Today's report by the AHRQ is sobering news for patients, families and medical professionals alike. This study underscores the importance of the AHRQ's Comparative Effectiveness Review which is delivering on its mission to improve the quality of health care through research and quality improvement studies. These unique findings alert caregivers and patients to unrealized breast cancer detection problems and empower medical professionals with valuable new information that will save lives. Though the results of this study are disheartening, it's evidence that the AHRQ is fulfilling its mission to conduct research that improves patient safety and health care." 
   The Comparative Effectiveness program within AHRQ was established by Section 1013 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Majority Leader Frist included the program in the legislation to ensure that patients, providers, and payers have tangible information they need to ensure effective care is received. Under the program, AHRQ is required to make the findings of supported research widely available. 
   The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is to support research designed to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. The research sponsored, conducted, and disseminated by the AHRQ provides information that helps people make better decisions about health care.
