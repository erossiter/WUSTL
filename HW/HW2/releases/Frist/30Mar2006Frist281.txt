SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO BORDER SECURITY BILL TO COLLECT STATISTICS ON BORDER DEATHS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today introduced this amendment instructing the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to collect statistics relating to deaths occuring at the border between the United States and Mexico.
   Last June Frist sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office requesting an assessment of the number of annual border-crossing deaths, the level of resources being devoted to the Border Safety Initiative and the government's data collection capabilities in documenting border deaths.
