SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES SECURING AMERICA'S BORDERS ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) yesterday introduced S.2454, the Securing America's Borders Act (SABA). SABA focuses on border security and interior law enforcement and will also enable the Senate to pursue comprehensive immigration reform. The legislation ensures that the Senate can consider a border security bill during the week of March 27 in case the Judiciary Committee does not report a bill that meets these objectives.  
   The foundation of the Securing America's Borders Act is Chairman Specter's mark-up of the border security bill and includes Republican-sponsored amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee's hearings. The bill does not include the guest worker titles included in the current version of the committee bill but does include provisions regarding highly skilled immigrants. 
   Attached is a section-by-section analysis of SABA as well as the complete bill text as introduced by Senator Frist last night on the Senate floor.
