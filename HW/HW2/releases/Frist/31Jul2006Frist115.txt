SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PROVISIONS TO EXTEND STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTION, PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TAX RELIEF FOR TENNESSEANS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today praised the tax relief delivered to Tennessee by the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006 (H.R. 5970). The bill extends the states sales tax deduction for two years, provides extensions for several other tax provisions benefiting taxpayers across Tennessee, and makes permanent a provision to protect songwriters from unfair taxes. The House has passed the legislation, and the Senate will take up the measure this week. 
   "The sales tax deduction is a simple issue of fairness for all Tennesseans," Frist said. "For nearly 20 years, our state suffered from an inequity in the tax code. I fought hard to restore equality for Tennessee and believe the tax relief policies adopted by the Republican Congress will continue to fuel our nation's economic growth." 
   The state sales tax deduction provides nearly $500 in tax relief for more than 640,000 families across Tennessee. Frist secured the deduction in 2004, but the provision expired last year and must be extended by Congress. 
   The legislation also extends three other tax provisions important to Tennessee. Nearly 141,000 taxpayers in the Volunteer State benefit from the $500 low-income savers tax credit; almost 56,000 teachers in Tennessee benefit from the deduction for out-of-pocket expenditures; and more than 51,500 families benefit from the $5,000 deduction of college tuition. 
   In addition, the bill makes permanent a Frist-authored provision recently signed into law by President Bush allowing songwriters to claim the capital gains tax rate on music sales, the same rate paid by their corporate partners. This change in the tax code reduces songwriters' tax burden by up to 35 percent.
