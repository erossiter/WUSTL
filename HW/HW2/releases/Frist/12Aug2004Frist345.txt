SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD FUNDING TO BOLSTER SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, SERVICES
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for awarding $17.8 million to Tennessee through the Access to Recovery Program.  
 The funding will be distributed to the state over three years to enhance substance abuse clinical treatment and recovery support services. 
   "Substance abuse can be a long, often uphill battle that requires significant treatment and recovery support," said Frist. "This funding will help Tennessee increase the treatment and recovery options available to Tennesseans, allowing those who need help and their families to choose high quality, effective and appropriate care."
   "This is important funding that will provide quality support for countless Tennesseans who are overcoming substance abuse problems. Keeping our state drug-free means healthier children, stronger families and safer communities," said Alexander. "Senator Frist and I appreciate the Department of Health and Human Services' investment in Tennessee." 
   The Access to Recovery Program is part of HHS' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Tennessee will be awarded $5.9 million per year for three years for a total of approximately $17.8 million. 
   The goal of the Tennessee program is to lower substance abuse cases by supplying vouchers for assessment, substance abuse clinical treatment and/or recovery services. The program will provide client choice among substance abuse clinical treatment and recovery support providers while expanding access to service options, including faith-based options, and increasing the number of state-authorized substance abuse providers.
