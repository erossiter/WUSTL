SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON USA PATRIOT ACT REAUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the USA Patriot Act reauthorization conference report:  
   "The Patriot Act expires on December 31, but the terrorist threat does not. 
   "By giving law enforcement the tools needed to track suspected terrorists and break up terrorist cells, the Patriot Act has helped keep Americans safe while also protecting their civil liberties and privacy. 
   "Those opposing reauthorization of the Patriot Act are forcing our law enforcement officers to take a dangerous step backwards. 
   "We need to remember that it's the terrorists, not our law enforcement officers, who are our enemy in the War on Terror."
