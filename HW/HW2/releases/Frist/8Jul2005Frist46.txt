SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS JUNE EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the Department of Labor's monthly economic report: 
   "The president's pro-growth policies empower small-businesses and consumers by raising incomes, expanding economic growth and reducing the burdens of government. Today's job figures prove that meaningful tax relief and government policies driven by economics and not politics are the fuel that powers America's economic engine. I'm proud of our past successes, and expect the Senate will remain focused on implementing pro-job legislation like CAFTA, the energy bill, the transportation bill and driving down the deficit to keep unemployment rates low and America's economy growing."
