SEN. FRIST REITERATES STRONG SUPPORT FOR LINE-ITEM VETO
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after meeting with President Bush regarding the line-item veto: 
   "The line-item veto is one of the best, most direct ways to eliminate wasteful Washington spending. This tool is an important piece of the comprehensive budget reform package recently approved by the Senate Budget Committee, and I thank Chairman Gregg for his leadership on this issue. The American people rightly expect the government to be responsible with their tax dollars, and I fully support using the line-item veto to strengthen fiscal discipline."
