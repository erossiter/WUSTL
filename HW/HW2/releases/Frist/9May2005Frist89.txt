SEN. FRIST AFFIRMS THAT ALL NOMINEES DESERVE UP OR DOWN VOTES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today following the Sen.  
 Harry Reid's floor statement. 
   "I appreciate Senator Reid's willingness to give Mr. Griffith a fair up or down vote. Mr. Griffith has been waiting for almost a year for this basic courtesy. In fact today marks four years since the first of these highly qualified nominees began waiting for the civility of a vote.
   "This is a first step but there are seven other highly qualified nominees who have been filibustered in the 108th Congress who deserve an up or down vote as well. I remain committed to this fundamental principle and the return to 214 years of Senate tradition. I urge Senator Reid and the Democrats to take another look at my fair offer and to come to the table to work with me for a solution."
