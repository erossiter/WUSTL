SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Defense Appropriations bill: 
   "With the passage of the Homeland Security and Defense appropriations bills, Congress has made it clear that the safety and security of the American people are our highest priority. The two bills will provide nearly $550 billion to support our military and protect our homeland, including key readiness programs critical to the Global War on Terrorism." 
   The Defense appropriations bill provides a 2.2 percent pay raise for all military personnel along with medical benefits for manpower of 512,400 Army and 180,000 Marine personnel. The bill also provides $63 billion directly for our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
