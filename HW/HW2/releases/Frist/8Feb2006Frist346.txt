SEN. FRIST PRAISES TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY NOMINEES
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding today's Environment and Public Works Committee confirmation hearing on President Bush's six nominees to serve as members of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:  
   "These highly qualified nominees possess the strong business skills and management expertise necessary to lead TVA into the 21st century. They have accomplished records of leadership in the business world and in their communities. Each understands the importance of TVA to the people of the Valley, and I am confident they will serve with distinction. 
   "I worked hard to pass legislation to modernize TVA's Board of Directors because I believed TVA needed leaders with more business and management experience. These nominees have the entrepreneurial backgrounds that will ensure the success of the new, part-time Board. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these nominees confirmed as quickly as possible." 
   Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that reformed TVA's management structure to bring it in line with other corporations of similar size and scope. As part of that legislation, the TVA Board of Directors was expanded from three full-time members to nine part-time members. 
   The Board nominees are: Susan Richardson Williams of Tennessee, William B. Sansom of Tennessee, Dennis Bottorff of Tennessee, Howard A. Thrailkill of Alabama, Robert M. Duncan of Kentucky and Donald DePriest of Mississippi.
