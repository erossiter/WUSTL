SEN. FRIST PRAISES ADMINISTRATION'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MEDICARE PART D PREMIUMS REMAIN LOW
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Administration responded to a letter he and colleagues sent to Secretary Leavitt and Dr. McClellan in June regarding Medicare Part D benchmark premiums. Both the senators' letter and the Administration's response are attached: 
   "I'm pleased that so many seniors are taking advantage of the Medicare Part D program. More than 90 percent of all beneficiaries now have some sort of drug coverage. 
   "Based on the Secretary's response and Dr. McClellan's announcement today, seniors won't see their 2007 premiums rise on average. As a result, the cost of the program will continue to go down, and beneficiaries will continue to have quality, low-premium plan options available to them."
   "My colleagues and I will continue working to ensure that every senior continues to have ample affordable options."
