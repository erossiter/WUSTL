SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL AGREEMENT ON TAX RELIEF AND HEALTH CARE ACT, TRADE PREFERENCE, NORMALIZATION LEGISLATION
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn) made the following statement after the House and Senate leadership reached a bipartisan agreement over H.R. 6408, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and H.R. 6406, The Extension of Preferences for Africa, Haiti, Andean Countries, and the Generalized System of Preferences; PNTR for Vietnam; and Miscellaneous Trade Bills.  
 "After lengthy bipartisan negotiations, I'm pleased to announce the House and Senate have reached agreement on a broad package of energy, tax, trade and health care measures, addressing many necessary priorities here at home and abroad. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act will help to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, promote technological innovation through the R&D tax credit, assist middle income families with sales tax deductibility, and help physicians working under Medicare. Passage of the trade legislation will establish mutually beneficial and long overdue trade normalization between the U.S. and Vietnam and extend trade benefits to a variety of developing countries. 
 "This package could face obstacles to passage in the Senate, and I will be working with Senators to find the smoothest path for the Senate to decide to take final action."
