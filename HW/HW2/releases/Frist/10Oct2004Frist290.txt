SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF SENATE INTELLIGENCE REFORM
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today hailed passage of the Senate Intelligence Reform Resolution. Frist released the following statement: 
   "Passage of this Resolution, combined with the Senate's work earlier this week on Collins-Lieberman National Intelligence Reform, represents an important step forward in the country's fight against terrorism. This is a significant achievement, the first major overhaul of our intelligence system since the 1970s.
   "I am confident that over the next weeks we can work with the House to reach agreement on an overall Intelligence Reform and pass a conference report that the President can sign into law."
