SEN. FRIST COMMENDS PRESIDENT, CMS FOR DRAFT E-PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding today's announcement by President Bush of new draft regulations for electronic prescribing under the Medicare program: 
   "I'm pleased by today's announcement by CMS of draft e-prescribing regulations," said Frist. "E-prescribing was enacted in the landmark Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, and is a significant step towards modernizing America's health care system. These regulations will help reduce medication errors, improve patient safety and ease the burden on patients and providers. I applaud President Bush and Dr. Mark McClellan for today's bold action and will continue to work with the Administration and my colleagues to harness the power of information technology in strengthening our nation's health care system."
