SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIDEL CASTRO, CUBA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on the handover of power by Fidel Castro to his brother and what the Cuban people deserve in a leader: 
   "For the first time since he seized power almost 50 years ago, Fidel Castro has temporarily relinquished authority to his brother, Raul Castro. Nonetheless, U.S. policy remains clear in its commitment to a full transition to democracy, not from one dictator to another. The time has come for the Cuban people to decide their own future, and be allowed to establish the democracy they deserve. The United States should support all legitimate efforts to bring an end to this dictatorship in Cuba, and to provide the Cuban people with the tools necessary to choose their own destiny. I plan to work with Senators Ensign and others to ensure that Congress passes appropriate legislation to assist the Cuban people."
