SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF SYRIAN FORCES FROM LEBANON
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today reiterated his call for Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon.  
   "I second President Bush's call for the quick withdrawal of Syrian troops and intelligence services from Lebanon and for an end to Syrian interference in Lebanon's affairs," said Frist. "The United States must work closely with our European and Arab allies to end Syria's three-decades-long domination of Lebanon. 
   "Syria has failed to take the necessary steps to address the concerns that led to the enactment of the Syria Accountability Act in 2003 and U.N. Security Council Resolution in 2004. I call on the Syrian government to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 by withdrawing all forces from Lebanon, freeing the Lebanese people of foreign occupation, and allowing for free and fair democratic elections to be held. 
   "I've witnessed the transformative effects of elections in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere; it's truly inspiring. The international community must now support the Lebanese people's desire to reclaim their sovereignty and independence, and to determine their own path towards freedom and democracy. I'll continue to stand by the Lebanese people in their efforts to secure a free and prosperous Lebanon." 
   In November 2003, Senator Frist ushered through the Senate the "Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act," which requires the President to impose economic and diplomatic penalties on Syria unless it meets its international obligations and, among other things, ends its occupation of Lebanon. In September 2004 the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1559 calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.
