SEN. FRIST TO JOIN BUSH TO HONOR 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORMANDY INVASION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) will attend bi-national and multi-national ceremonies in Normandy, France on Sunday, June 6, to mark the 60th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion.  
 Over the course of the day, President George Bush, world leaders and World War II veterans will gather on the beaches to pay homage to the millions of soldiers who fought in the battles against the Axis powers.  
   "I'm humbled to have this opportunity to honor the more than 16,000,000 American men and women who served their country during the Second World War," Frist said. "On the hallowed grounds of Normandy, the brave young men and women of the United States Armed Forces fought together with 32 allies to vanquish tyranny and oppression. 
   "These soldiers are not only true Americans; they are true heroes," said Frist. "Their efforts helped create the image of the American soldier as a symbol of hope for the liberated peoples of the world. Our nation can never fully express its gratitude to all the members of the United States Armed Services." 
   The ceremonies will honor the sacrifice made by all the brave men and women who served their country during World War II. Over the course of World War II 671,000 American troops were wounded in battle, 105,000 were held as prisoners of war, and more than 400,000 men and women lost their lives. 
   In addition to attending the ceremonies, Frist will visit with Armed Forces veterans from Tennessee.
