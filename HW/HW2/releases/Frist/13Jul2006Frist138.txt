SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the Homeland Security spending bill:  
   "This bill helps confront the challenges facing America's borders, ports, and transit systems. By providing more than $14 billion to strengthen our nation's borders, we are taking another important step to bolster our frontline defenses against illegal border crossings. Under this legislation, the Republican Congress will add 2,000 new border patrol agents, bringing the total to 14,320 agents, and increase new detention beds by 5,000, bringing the total to 25,300 beds - all done in an effort to combat illegal immigration."
   "The bill also supports emergency preparedness by ensuring our first responders have the training they need should disaster strike. In addition, it funds grants enabling high-threat, high-density urban areas to strengthen their infrastructure and provides the Coast Guard with the resources necessary to protect our 95,000 miles of shoreline border."
   "I'm proud of this legislation. It represents a genuine commitment to meeting America's border, transit, port and homeland security needs. I look forward to a swift conference so that the President can quickly sign into a law a bill funding America's vital homeland security needs."
