SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR FIRM RESPONSE TO NORTH KOREA'S CLAIMED NUCLEAR TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after President Bush signed the North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006, which Sen. Frist authored earlier this summer:  
   "I applaud President Bush for signing this important piece of legislation into law. North Korea's nuclear test and missile launches are a grave threat to international peace and security, and demonstrate the regime's absolute contempt for its neighbors and the international community. 
   "We need a firm, multifaceted approach to North Korea's claimed nuclear test, which threatens peace and stability in the Pacific. As a part of this effort the President signed the North Korea Sanctions Act today. I urge the President to vigorously implement the sanctions provided for under this legislation, and I call on other concerned governments to apply similar measures to weapons-related trade with North Korea. 
   "There is much more that can, and should, be done to build on the President's diplomatic efforts, so that North Korea will be left with no choice but to give up its nuclear ambitions." 
   The legislation passed both the House and Senate earlier this summer and has been awaiting the president's signature. The act ensures that the United States will carefully review and impose appropriate sanctions on all foreign entities involved in transfers to or from North Korea of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, missiles, other advanced conventional weapons, and related items. U.S. law already provides for such treatment of these types of transfers to and from Iran and Syria, and this legislation ensures that the United States will extend the same treatment to North Korea.
