SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES SENATE TO TAKE UP SECURE FENCE ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after filing cloture on the motion to proceed to the Secure Fence Act of 2006:  
   "Border security is the essential first step of any effort to enact immigration reform. Only when we have convinced the American people of our commitment to securing our borders will we be able reach a consensus on comprehensive immigration reform. Tonight, I filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the Secure Fence Act of 2006 which will authorize the construction of physical barriers and deploy state-of-the-art technology to secure our border." 
   The Secure Fence Act of 2006: 
   * Authorizes over 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border with prioritized placement at critical, highly populated areas and requiring an evaluation of infrastructure needs along the northern border; 
   * Mandates that DHS achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a "virtual fence" that deploys cameras, ground sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and integrated surveillance technology; 
   * Requires DHS to provide all necessary authority to border personnel to disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority held by the United States Coast Guard for maritime vessels; and 
   * Requires DHS to assess the vulnerability of the northern border.
