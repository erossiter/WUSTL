SEN. FRIST HAILS INCLUSION OF TOBACCO BUYOUT PROVISION IN SENATE JOBS BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today hailed the inclusion of a tobacco buyout provision in the Senate version of the "Jumpstart Our Business Strength" or JOBS Bill.  
 Frist successfully negotiated an agreement with Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday to have a vote on an amendment that includes the buyout. The amendment passed today by a vote of 78 to 15. 
   "Tobacco and family farms have a long and rich history in Tennessee. The crop has contributed greatly to the economic vitality of numerous communities and towns, and tobacco has long been a critical part of the entire State's agricultural economy. 
   "In recent years, however, many of our tobacco communities have been devastated by shrinking demand and overseas competition. Compounding the negative effects of these market forces is the current tobacco quota system. Essentially, this system is making it harder and harder for tobacco farmers to survive. 
   "Today's tobacco farmers did not create nor do they control the quota system. Yet, they have been forced to farm under its outdated rules for far too long. The buyout passed today will end the quota program and provide much needed assistance to our farmers as many make the likely transition to other crops. This vote represents a victory for our tobacco farmers and all of Tennessee."
