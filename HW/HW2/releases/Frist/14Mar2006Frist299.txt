SEN. FRIST DISMISSES SEN. FEINGOLD'S STUNT, CALLS ON DEMOCRATS TO CONFRONT GENUINE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement in response to Democratic calls to censure President Bush:  
   "With no cosponsors and fellow Democrats refusing to vote on Senator Feingold's fringe issue, I urge the minority to either allow us to vote or move on to addressing the real threats facing our national security. 
   "If the Democrats continue to say no to voting on their own censure resolution, then they ought to drop it and focus on our foreign policy in a positive way: supporting our troops in a year of transition in Iraq, confronting Iran's runaway regime, and supporting positive change on the UN Human Rights Commission this week. Delay and distraction are a disservice to the American people."
