SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING SENATE'S SECOND REJECTION OF CLOTURE MOTION ON BOLTON NOMINATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after the Senate denied the second cloture motion on the nomination of John Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations:  
   "America needs a firm and reasoned voice at the UN, and President Bush believes that John Bolton provides the clearest voice for his foreign policy. But for several months now a minority of Senators have forced this critical nomination to languish without so much as a yes-or-no vote. Despite hours and hours of relentless hearings, questioning, deliberation and debate, the minority has still resorted to parliamentary maneuvers to thwart the president's choice for UN ambassador-a post that has remained vacant now for over five months. 
   "With sensible reform, the UN can play a central role in supporting peace and democracy across the globe. However, to reach that goal the US needs to have a strong UN ambassador in place to help this mismanaged and troubled organization realize its potential as a credible world body. Today's vote was another setback for all who believe that nominees deserve an up or down vote, and that the UN can be an effective instrument of change in the world. These votes against John Bolton were votes against cleaning up the UN."
