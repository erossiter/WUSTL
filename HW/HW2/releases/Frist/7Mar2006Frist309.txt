SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES TIMING FOR DEBATE ON FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced that the Senate will debate the "Flag Protection Amendment" in the end of June:  
   "The American flag is a proud and sacred reminder of the principles of freedom and opportunity that form the foundation of our Republic. Our flag reminds us that there is more that unites us as Americans than divides us, and a constitutional amendment will give one of our Nation's proudest and most treasured symbols the protection it deserves. It honors the sacrifice of countless brave men and women who died defending our flag and the ideals it represents. I look forward to bringing the Flag Protection Amendment to the floor at the end of June so we can debate legislation that respects one of the principal symbols of our nation, and appropriately honors the sacrifice and commitment of all those who've acted to protect it."
