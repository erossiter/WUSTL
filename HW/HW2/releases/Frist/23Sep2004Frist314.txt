SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF FAMILY TAX BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) made the following statement today in response to the Senate passage of the conference report, H.R. 1308, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004:  
   "This bill will ensure that working families continue to keep more of their money. The Family Tax Act extends the marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit as well as ensuring that the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will not affect more middle-income families. 
   "The legislation passed by the House and Senate will benefit 6.8 million low-income families by increasing their tax refunds in 2004. 
   "If we had not acted on this legislation, millions of hardworking families would have suffered an automatic tax increase. 70 million women would have see their taxes increase, on average, over $660. 46 million married couples would have paid, on average, a whopping $900 more in taxes. 38 million families with children would have paid an average of $900 more. 8 million single women with children would have seen their taxes increase by nearly $370. 11 million elderly taxpayers would each have had to pay $383 more. 23 million small business owners would have incurred tax increases averaging $784. And nearly 2 million individuals and families who currently have no income tax liability would have once again become subject to the income tax. 
   "This Republican Congress, and President Bush with his signature, will have fulfilled their promise to hard working American families by passing this legislation."
