SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD GRANT FUNDING TO EXPAND COLLEGE ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEAF
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today applauded the U.S. Department of Education for awarding a $1,000,000 grant to the University of Tennessee to expand access to college for individuals who are deaf. The funding is for a period of one year and may be supplemented with additional grant funding for up to four more years.  
   "All students deserve equal access to Tennessee's higher education system. This grant provides critical assistance by expanding the academic and economic opportunities of deaf students throughout our state," Frist said. "I thank Secretary Spellings and the Administration for their continued support of higher education in Tennessee." 
   "Students with disabilities face unique challenges in pursing higher education, and we must work to better understand and help address those challenges," said Alexander. "I am pleased that this grant will help identify promising practices and assist Tennessee students who are deaf in successfully transitioning to college and to the workforce." 
   The grant funding is provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's "Technical Assistance and Dissemination to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities Program." The University of Tennessee will use the funding to help secondary and postsecondary institutions address the postsecondary, vocational, technical and adult education needs of students who are deaf. Funded activities will include improving training opportunities so that educators can provide appropriate accommodations and services for students who are deaf, and increasing collaboration among state, regional, and national groups serving students who are deaf.
