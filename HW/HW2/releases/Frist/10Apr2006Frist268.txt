SEN. FRIST'S CHIEF OF STAFF CALLS FOR FAIR PROCESS IN IMMIGRATION DEBATE
  Eric Ueland, Chief of Staff to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), made the following statement today regarding border security and immigration reform:  
   "In the Senate, a fair process will yield a fair bill to make our borders safer and America more secure. Senate Republicans agree that as long as Senator Reid stands in the way of senators getting votes, there can't be a fair process, and every day we delay America is less safe and less secure. 
   "When the minority leader stands aside, the Senate can work its will and then send a strong and comprehensive bill to the House to bring the border under control with fences and other technologies, tackle illegal behavior, reflect our values, and by identifying and dealing with those illegally here, put our law enforcement and homeland security focus where it belongs, on protecting the American people."
