 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding Senate confirmation of Judge Alberto Gonzales as attorney general: 
   "I'm pleased by today's Senate confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general - America's first Hispanic-American attorney general. His life story is inspiring, and another shining example of how the American dream can be reality for all who are willing to work for it. But more importantly, I'm pleased by today's confirmation because Judge Gonzales is the right man for the job. He's a brilliant legal mind who has proven his ability to thoughtfully and thoroughly wrestle with complex and unprecedented legal challenges. His first-rate qualifications, superior intellect and devotion to the law have earned him this position as America's chief legal officer. I'm certain he'll serve President Bush and our country well, and congratulate him on his new appointment."
