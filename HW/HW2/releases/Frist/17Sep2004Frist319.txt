SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $5 MILLION FOR TENNESSEE LAW ENFORCEMENT, OZONE STUDY
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, includes more than $5 million to support Tennessee initiatives.  
   "This funding is an investment in the safety and security of Tennessee neighborhoods," said Frist. "I commend the Senate Appropriations Committee for taking steps to support the equipment, training and communications needs of law enforcement throughout the state. I'm also pleased that this legislation included vital funding to evaluate air pollution in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park." 
   "This legislation funds important priorities that will make Tennessee communities safer and stronger," said Alexander. "It provides for critical law enforcement equipment and technologies, resources to stamp out methamphetamine labs, and continues the study to evaluate polluted air in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. I intend to work with Senator Frist and our Senate colleagues to ensure these subjects continue to receive federal attention." 
   Some of the key Tennessee initiatives in the Senate version of the FY05 Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Bill include: 
   * $2.25 million for Memphis to install a regional law enforcement communications system to improve emergency communications. 
   * $2 million for the Methamphetamine Task Force in East Tennessee. Tennessee is one of the top five methamphetamine producing states in the nation, and additional resources will be used to support law enforcement efforts to identify and eradicate methamphetamine labs. 
    * $400,000 for the Leadership Institute in Judicial Education at the University of Memphis to support intensive training programs for judges, judicial educators and court administrators. During its 13-year history, over 400 judges, judicial educators, and court administrators from 44 states have participated in the program. 
   * $100,000 for the Martin Police Department to install in car video cameras. This equipment will enhance enforcement capabilities and improve officer safety. 
   * $300,000 for the East Tennessee Ozone Study (ETOS) which is conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to monitor ground-level ozone and other air pollutants in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
   The Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2005 Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate.
