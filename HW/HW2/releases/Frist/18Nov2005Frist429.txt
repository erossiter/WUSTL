SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUCCESSFUL MISSILE DEFENSE TEST
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the successful Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense intercept flight test conducted by the Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Navy:  
   "I applaud yesterday's completion of the successful Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense 'hit to kill' intercept flight test. This was the sixth successful intercept test since 2002, and the first time the testing involved a 'separating' target. 
   "Today, many of the countries pursuing WMD capabilities also seek the capacity to arm long-range missiles with WMD warheads. The combination of ballistic missile technology and weapons of mass destruction pose a direct threat to our armed forces deployed abroad, our interests overseas, the security of our friends and allies, and to the American homeland. 
   "For these reasons, it is vital that the United States continue to pursue a national ballistic missile defense system capable of deterring and defeating these threats. Our most important responsibility is to protect the American people and defend our homeland against all forms of attack. 
   "Yesterday's successful intercept demonstrates that we are continuing to make progress in building a capable, comprehensive, and layered ballistic missile defense system. I am confident that additional research, development, and testing will result in a stronger system so that we can successfully confront all potential threats to our security."
