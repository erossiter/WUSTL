SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IN SUDAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the formation of a Government of National Unity in Sudan:  
   "The creation of a National Unity Government in Sudan represents a major step toward the goal of achieving peace in southern Sudan after decades of civil war. This is a victory for the Sudanese people in their efforts to bring peace and stability to their war-torn country. 
   "I urge the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement to fulfill their obligations to the people of Sudan and fully implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in a timely manner. And, I call on the international community to actively support and monitor the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, to include maintaining pressure on Khartoum to fully honor this agreement. 
   "The Government of Sudan and the new Government of National Unity should also use the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the basis for a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict still raging in Sudan's western region of Darfur. The genocide in Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement are linked, and all parties must immediately end the use of violence and resolve the conflict through peaceful means." 
   The formation of the Government of National Unity in Sudan will mark the end of Africa's longest civil war that killed more that two million people and displaced four million others. In June, Senator Frist met with Dr. John Garang, the leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement to discuss the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the situation in Sudan. Dr. Garang was sworn in on Saturday as the First Vice President of Sudan's Government of National Unity, making him the first Southerner to hold this post since Sudan gained its independence from Great Britain in 1956.
