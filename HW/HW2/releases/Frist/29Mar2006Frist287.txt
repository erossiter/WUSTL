SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER INTRODUCE RESOLUTION CELEBRATING COUNTRY MUSIC
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today announced that they have coauthored a Senate resolution recognizing the musical and cultural heritage of country music.  
   The resolution coincides with the "Country: A Celebration of America's Music" festival at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. 
   Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is partnering with the Kennedy Center to present the festival, which honors country music's contributions to American culture. 
   The senators' resolution praises country music for embodying the spirit and the lives of Americans of diverse backgrounds and recognizes its contribution to the commercial development of Nashville. 
   "As a native Nashvillian, I'm proud my hometown is known around the world as 'Music City, U.S.A.,'" Frist said. "Country music is a uniquely American sound and plays a special role in our nation's cultural heritage. As a member of the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees, I'm pleased that our nation's performing arts center is showcasing this great American musical tradition." 
   "From the Carter family in East Tennessee, to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, to Sun Records in Memphis and everywhere in between - country music is an essential part of Tennessee's character," said Alexander, adding, "I'm delighted that the Kennedy Center is recognizing country music's contributions to American culture, and I look forward to being there Friday as the country salutes country." 
   The festival commenced March 20 at the Kennedy Center with events and exhibitions running until April 16.
