   "I commend the secretary for his commitment to ensuring an open, honest, and overdue discussion of the challenges and problems facing the Medicaid program. The individuals who have agreed to serve in this important capacity are of the highest caliber and are doing a great service. I also want to particularly note that Tennessee's own Don Sundquist has been named as a co-chair. He will bring a unique perspective to the challenges facing the Medicaid program broadly."
