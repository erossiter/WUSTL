SEN. FRIST COMMENDS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen: 
   "I commend the Senate Judiciary Committee for approving the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen. 
   "In the last Congress, these highly qualified women were blocked by a partisan filibuster when Democrats refused to give them an up or down vote. 
   "Soon, all 100 Senators will have to decide if these highly qualified candidates will get a fair up or down vote on the Senate floor."
