SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF BEN BERNANKE AS FED CHAIRMAN
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Ben Bernanke as Fed Chairman:  
   "Ben Bernanke is a gifted economist with the experience and skills necessary to guide the Federal Reserve. As Fed Governor, he earned a reputation as a trusted and reasoned voice on economic policy, and his measured approach to fiscal policy will serve him well as chairman. Most recently, the Senate recognized Mr. Bernanke's qualifications and accomplishments by confirming him as Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). I recently met with Chairman Bernanke and am impressed with his knowledge on a broad range of economic issues confronting this country. As Fed Chairman I believe he will monitor and implement U.S. monetary policy that will insure a strong domestic economy and maintain America's global competitiveness. I look forward to working with my colleagues to confirm Ben Bernanke so he can assume his post when Chairman Greenspan retires in January."
