SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS TVA BOARD NOMINATIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today applauded the President's announcement of five nominees to serve as members of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors.  
 Last year, Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that reformed TVA's management structure to bring it in line with other corporations of similar size and scope. As part of that legislation, the TVA Board of Directors was expanded from three full-time members to nine part-time members. The nominees announced today will fill five of the seven Board vacancies if confirmed by the Senate; the President will make two additional nominations in the near future. 
   "The President has chosen five strong nominees, including three outstanding Tennesseans, to help lead TVA in the 21st century," Frist said. "These nominees bring with them the business skills and management expertise needed to run one of the nation's largest electric utilities, which was the primary goal of my legislation. I look forward to Senate confirmation of these excellent nominees." 
   The President's nominees are: 
   Susan Richardson Williams of Tennessee 
  Howard A. Thrailkill of Alabama 
  William B. Sansom of Tennessee 
  Dennis Bottorff of Tennessee 
  Robert M. Duncan of Kentucky.
