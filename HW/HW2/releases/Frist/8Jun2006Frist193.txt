SEN. FRIST HAILS CONTINUED PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate confirmation of four new District Court judges: 
  "Today the Senate continued its progress on confirming qualified judicial nominees to the federal bench with the confirmations of Noel Lawrence Hillman and Peter G. Sheridan for the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and Thomas L. Ludington and Sean F. Cox for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
   "While these confirmations mark another step forward in restoring fairness to the judicial nominations process, we have more work to do. We must continue to stand on the simple and fair principle that every qualified judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote."
   Currently 94.8 percent of all judgeships are filled, including 91.1 percent of all circuit court judgeships and 95.8 percent of all district court judgeships. Since Senator Frist became Majority Leader, the Senate has made considerable progress on President Bush's judicial nominees, including confirming two Supreme Court Justices, 28 circuit court judges, and 116 district court judges, and decreasing the number of circuit court vacancies by 36 percent.
