SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE FUNDING IN INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today announced that the Fiscal Year 2007 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, includes significant funding for Tennessee parks, forests and conservation programs. Funding for a number of critical water infrastructure projects was also included in the bill.  
   "Remaining conscientious caretakers of our environment is crucial to allowing future generations of Tennesseans to enjoy our state's natural beauty," Frist said. "This legislation makes an important investment in our state's parks and forests. In addition to preserving our natural resources, the bill also provides critical funding for Tennessee's water infrastructure. I'm proud to have worked with Senator Alexander to secure support for these efforts." 
   "Having places to enjoy the outdoors is an important part of what makes Tennessee a great place to live and to visit," Alexander said.
   "This bill invests in preserving our parks, forests, and heritage and recreation areas. From the mountains in East Tennessee to the Cumberland Plateau to the Mississippi River, this legislation supports important local efforts throughout the state. Senator Frist and I will continue to work to ensure these critical Tennessee needs receive appropriate federal assistance."
