SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPING OF ISRAELI SOLDIERS BY HEZBOLLAH
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the killing and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by the terrorist group Hezbollah:  
   "I condemn Hezbollah's killing and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid earlier today. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, which has obstructed implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559. Among other things, that resolution calls for the disbanding and disarmament of militias in Lebanon, including Hezbollah's."
   "Hezbollah's actions demonstrate yet again that it is a threat to peace and security in the Middle East. Hezbollah must immediately return the captured Israeli soldiers to Israel and end its attempts to escalate violence and further derail the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians."
   "The international community must make clear to the Government of Lebanon that we expect it to exercise its responsibility under Resolution 1559 to ensure that Lebanese territory is not used as a safe haven for terrorist groups like Hezbollah, and we must hold the governments of Syria and Iran accountable for their continued support to Hezbollah. So long as these governments are failing to live up to their responsibilities, no one should question the right of the Government of Israel to act in self-defense against terrorists operating from Lebanon."
