SENS. FRIST APPLAUDS AVAILABILITY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCOUNT CARDS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement applauding the availability of Medicare prescription drug discount cards starting today:  
   "Starting today, a new component of last year's landmark Medicare legislation takes effect. The prescription drug discount cards are a product of last December's legislation, which helps America's seniors who are being forced to choose between paying for their food and rent, or paying for their prescription drugs.  
   "Although the more comprehensive approach to affordable access to prescription drugs for seniors does not begin for about a year and a half, I am delighted that just several months after passage of this bill that these new discount cards are available to help ease the burden on our seniors. 
   "Cards are available to all Medicare enrollees who lack prescription drug coverage. The card gives an immediate discount on average of about 17 percent. This is a major discount that starts today. 
   "With this card, those seniors who need help the most - who simply cannot afford their drugs - will get an additional $600 towards their drugs for the remainder of this year and another $600 for next year. Thus, over the next 18 months, they will get an additional $1,200 to purchase prescription drugs. This is a huge help for the approximately 7 million seniors who qualify for this low-income benefit. 
   "I am very excited that these cards are available today. I encourage all of our eligible seniors to enroll, either by calling 1-800-MEDICARE or going to the Medicare website (http://www.medicare.gov). Help is on the way to America's seniors, and I look forward to seeing the tremendously positive effects that this new law will have on our country's quality of life."
