SEN. FRIST LAUDS SCHEDULING OF JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING TO EXAMINE HIGH ENERGY PRICES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate Commerce and Energy committees announced they will be holding a joint hearing on Tuesday, November 8 at 9:30 a.m. on energy pricing and profits. Yesterday, Frist asked the two committees to hold such a hearing:  
   "Skyrocketing energy costs are of concern to all Americans. Sharp rises and disturbing disparities in energy costs are pinching families and have the potential to snarl economic growth at the expense of innocent consumers. This hearing will shine a spotlight on this growing concern, so we can ensure that businesses are behaving responsibly and consumers are being protected appropriately. I applaud Chairman Stevens (R-AK) and Chairman Domenici (R-NM) for their swift action, and look forward to a thoughtful and thorough review of these disturbing trends in America's energy costs."
