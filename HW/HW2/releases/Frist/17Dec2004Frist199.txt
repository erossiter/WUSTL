SEN. FRIST HAILS INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL SIGNING
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after President Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 into law:  
   "By signing today's intelligence reform bill into law, President Bush has helped the United States take substantive and unprecedented steps to maintain the safety and security of the American people and to help us win the global war on terror. By establishing a Director of National Intelligence and a National Counter Terrorism Center, this new law will break down barriers to information sharing within our intelligence community, while guaranteeing our military forces in combat have the information they need to do their jobs. 
   "Today's signing codifies many of the improvements that we have made to our intelligence community over the past three years. I am also pleased this new law will give us new tools to keep America safer. In particular, this legislation includes a provision I sponsored that establishes a National Counter Proliferation Center, which will fight to make sure that weapons of mass destruction never find their way into the hands of terrorists. 
    "I am proud of the way that the President and Congress united around this historic and important legislation. These bipartisan and comprehensive reforms will ensure that the United States remains on the offensive in the War on Terror. I applaud President Bush and all my House and Senate colleagues who supported the monumental step forward we take today. America is safer today than ever before, and while more must be done, I am deeply proud of what we've accomplished."
