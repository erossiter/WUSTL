  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.), today made the following statement regarding the House passage of Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act: 
   "After too much delay, we have finally taken a step forward to protect children and families from offensive images broadcast directly into their living rooms.
