SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON CEREMONY TO HONOR ROSA PARKS IN CAPITOL ROTUNDA
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding this evening's ceremony honoring the life and legacy of Rosa Parks in the Capitol Rotunda:  
   "Rosa Parks' bold and principled refusal to give up her seat was not an intentional attempt to change a nation, but a singular act aimed at restoring the dignity of the individual. Yet Mrs. Parks' life defined a generation and redefined a nation. Her individual act sparked a revolution that marched America closer to becoming the society grounded in freedom and individual liberty envisioned by our nation's founders. I'm humbled to represent my colleagues in this ceremony honoring Rosa Parks. While our nation must say goodbye to this inspiring leader, her life and legacy will live on in all who continue to share her passion for freedom and justice." 
   Senator Frist will join with his colleagues Senator Reid (D-NV) and Senator Stevens (R-AK) to lay a wreath as part of the ceremony honoring Mrs. Parks in the Capitol Rotunda this evening. 
   Frist and Reid sponsored a Senate resolution earlier this week allowing the remains of Rosa Parks to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol.
