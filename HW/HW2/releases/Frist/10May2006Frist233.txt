SEN. FRIST ENCOURAGES TENNESSEE'S SENIORS TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE DRUG PLAN BEFORE MONDAY DEADLINE
  Sen. Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today urged eligible senior citizens across Tennessee to enroll in the Medicare prescription drug program before Monday, which is the last day to sign up for the benefit without penalty. Those enrolling after Monday will pay a 1 percent surcharge on their premium for each month they delay. 
   "More than 700,000 Tennesseans have signed up for Medicare drug coverage and are saving money on their prescriptions today," Frist said. "Tennessee's seniors should not miss this opportunity to save hundreds of dollars each year on medications they need.
   "With Medicare counselors available to help beneficiaries choose a plan to meet their needs, enrollment is not difficult," Frist added. "The Medicare prescription drug plan has been a great success in providing American seniors with the health security they need and deserve. I hope all eligible Tennesseans will take advantage of this chance to save on prescription costs before Monday." 
   More than 31 million seniors have enrolled nationwide and are saving an average of $1,100 annually as a result of the prescription drug benefit. To obtain information or begin the enrollment process, eligible Medicare beneficiaries can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or visit www.medicare.gov.
