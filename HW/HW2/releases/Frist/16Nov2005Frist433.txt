SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS GAZA BORDER DEAL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Israel and the Palestinian Authority reached an agreement on the opening of Gaza's borders and more freedom of movement for the Palestinians:  
   "I welcome the news of the agreement reached by Israel and the Palestinian Authority to open the borders of the Gaza Strip and provide greater freedom of movement for the Palestinian people. This arrangement is a positive step forward and I urge both parties to continue to work together to implement the agreement. 
   "Through the establishment of an international crossing at Rafah, the deal provides the Palestinians with control over entry and exit from their territory for the first time since 1967. The Palestinian people will also be able to travel and trade more freely between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank through a second crossing. This is an important step in providing Palestinians with greater economic opportunities and a chance to see tangible improvements in their daily lives. 
   "I commend Secretary Rice for her tireless efforts to help negotiate this deal. This agreement balances the Palestinians' need to improve their economy with Israel's legitimate security concerns. However, additional progress in the peace process and the implementation of this agreement will require a sustained Palestinian commitment to end violence, and disarm and dismantle terrorist groups. 
   "I applaud the outcome of these difficult negotiations and urge the Israelis and the Palestinians to renew their efforts to work together and fulfill their obligations under the Roadmap."
