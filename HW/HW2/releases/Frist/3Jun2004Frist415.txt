SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON TORTURE OF IRAQI BUSINESSMEN DURING SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REGIME
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) made the following statement after his meeting late Wednesday with seven Iraqi businessmen who were tortured in 1995 under the Saddam Hussein regime.  
 The seven men, who each had their right hand surgically removed as punishment in Iraq, received reconstructive surgery in Houston, Texas, before coming to Washington, D.C. to meet with the President and members of Congress.  
   "These seven men are a stirring example of the cruel torture inflicted on Iraqis under the stifling dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. They were made scapegoats for Saddam's mismanagement of the Iraqi economy. They were unfairly charged with the crime of handling U.S. currency. They were jailed for seven months in Abu Ghraib prison. As a final humiliating punishment, Saddam's regime ordered the surgical removal of their right hand and scarred their foreheads. Their lives were forever changed by the brutal actions of a madman.  
   "The personal stories epitomize why a free Iraq, absent from the tyrannical Saddam regime, is necessary and just. I thank each of them for their bravery in sharing their personal experiences, and remain committed to staying the course to bring peace and democracy to Iraq."
