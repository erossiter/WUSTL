SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING SENATE'S DENIAL OF CLOTURE MOTION ON BOLTON NOMINATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after the Senate denied the cloture motion on the nomination of John Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations:  
   "Earlier today the Democratic Leader gave a speech denouncing the 'crossfire of partisan sniping' in Congress and pressed for comity and cooperation. But tonight, after the Democrats have launched into yet another filibuster of a presidential nomination - this time on John Bolton to serve as UN Ambassador - those words seem empty and hollow. 
   "Some 72 hours after hailing an agreement that sought to end partisan filibusters, the Democrats have launched yet another partisan filibuster. 
   "Actions speak volumes, and so does inaction. Given the chance to advance the cause of comity in the Senate, the Democrats have chosen partisan confrontation over cooperation. And rather than working to advance America's agenda and act by voting on the floor, the Democrats keep stepping on the brake. 
   "This is a critical time for the United States and for the world. Because of the President's vision and commitment, democracy is on the march around the globe. And with sensible reform, the United Nations can and should be vital in advancing these developments. But we need to get a UN ambassador in place. 
   "The cause of peace and international cooperation should not be held hostage to partisan sniping. I would urge my colleagues to end this partisan filibuster of John Bolton."
