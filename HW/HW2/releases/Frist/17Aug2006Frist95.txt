SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM DECISION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the decision on the terrorist surveillance program:
   "Terrorists are the real threat to our Constitutional and democratic freedoms, not the law enforcement and intelligence tools used to keep America safe. We need to strengthen, not weaken, our ability to foil terrorist plots before they can do us harm. I encourage swift appeal by the government and quick reversal of this unfortunate decision."
