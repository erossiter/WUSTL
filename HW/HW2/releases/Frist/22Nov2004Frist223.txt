SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE LABOR/HHS/EDUCATION PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Omnibus Conference Report, which the Senate passed late Saturday, includes nearly $13 million for Tennessee health and education projects. The conference report will now go to the President for his signature.   
   "The projects included in this bill support valuable research, enhance our children's educational opportunities, and drive economic growth throughout the state," said Frist. "In addition, these projects will promote job creation and give Tennesseans the resources they need to live, work and raise a family." 
   "This bill invests in vital health care and cultural programs across the state as well as K-12 and Higher Education institutions," said Alexander. "From funding for the Museum of Appalachia and East Tennessee Historical Society, to the Schools of Nursing at Tennessee Tech and MTSU, to the Benjamin Hooks Institute at the University of Memphis, I am proud that Congress voted to support Tennessee priorities."
