SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON EGYPTIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the presidential election which was held in Egypt yesterday:  
   "Yesterday's presidential elections in Egypt demonstrate that the spread of democracy is gathering momentum throughout the broader Middle East. I commend President Mubarak on opening the door and taking this important first step toward greater political reform in his country. While I am concerned about initial reports of irregularities, manipulation, and a lack of access for independent observers, it is important to recognize these elections as a step in the right direction. 
   "I encourage President Mubarak to work toward providing the Egyptian people with greater opportunities for political expression and organization. It is important for opposition candidates and parties to have equal access to media coverage and to freely interact with the public so that all candidates for public office can compete in a free and fair political atmosphere. In order to foster a more open political environment and allow for greater political expression, I urge President Mubarak to lift the emergency laws that have remained in place since 1981. 
   "I also commend President Mubarak for the progress toward broad economic reform that is already leading to greater economic opportunities for the Egyptian people. In the long-term, both free markets and free political expression are necessary to continue on the path of economic and political progress. The people of the region will watch as the political reform process unfolds in Egypt and will look to it as an example as their own democratization efforts move forward. I am hopeful that Egypt can use its traditional leadership position in the region to demonstrate that the spread of democracy and free markets is in the best interest of the people of the Middle East."
