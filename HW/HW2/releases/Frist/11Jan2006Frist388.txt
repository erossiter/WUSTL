SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO, CONCERNED ALUMNI OF PRINCETON
  "As a Princeton alumnus, I had concerns about CAP, but I have no concerns about Judge Alito's credibility, integrity and his commitment to protecting the equal rights of all Americans.  
 Judge Alito has condemned discrimination, and his record of more than 15 years demonstrates his commitment to equal rights for women and minorities. Old documents of a now defunct organization will not tell us more than Alito's statements and record already have. Further, the views the Democrats attribute to Alito through CAP were the views expressed by an individual member in a magazine who was not speaking for the organization - and certainly not for Judge Alito. This is another transparent attempt by the Democrats to wage an unfair smear campaign against an exceptionally qualified nominee."
