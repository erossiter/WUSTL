SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON INTELLIGENCE REFORM
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after an agreement was announced on the Intelligence Reform legislation:  
   "I'm very encouraged by today's developments. I want to thank Senators Collins and Lieberman for their hard work and commitment to such an important issue. I also want to thank Senator Warner for playing a constructive role in helping move this matter forward. While the House must still take action, the Senate stands ready to consider legislation as soon as Wednesday of this week. It's my hope that we will be able to complete action and send the President a bill that will help ensure all Americans are safer and more secure."
