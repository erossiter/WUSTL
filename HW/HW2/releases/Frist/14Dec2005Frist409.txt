SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SUCCESSFUL MISSILE DEFENSE FLIGHT TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the successful test involving the launch of a Ground-Based Interceptor missile conducted by the Missile Defense Agency:  
   "I applaud yesterday's successful test of the Missile Defense Agency's operationally-configured Ground-Based Interceptor missile. This system is designed to protect the American homeland against a limited long-range ballistic missile attack. 
   "This test aimed to assess the launch capability of a Ground-Based Interceptor missile, the separation of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), and the delivery of the EKV to a target point in space and time. Initial results show that these systems performed well. 
   "Following last month's successful Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense 'hit to kill' intercept flight test, yesterday's test demonstrates yet again that the MDA is continuing to make significant progress in building a capable, comprehensive, and layered ballistic missile defense system for the American homeland. The continued proliferation of ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction technology poses a direct threat to the United States homeland, our military personnel and interests overseas, and the security of our friends and allies. I am confident that continued research, development, and testing will result in a stronger missile defense system so that we can successfully confront this real threat to America's security."
