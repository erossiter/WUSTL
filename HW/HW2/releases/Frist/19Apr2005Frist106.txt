SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATION PROCESS
  Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-TN, today released the following statement:  
   "As more and more attention has focused in recent weeks on a partisan minority unfairly blocking simple up or down votes on judicial nominees in the Senate, some have claimed that any effort to restore precedent for up or down votes on judicial nominees would affect the rights of Senators when it comes to legislation. 
   "If I must act to bring fairness back to the judicial nomination process, I will not act in any way to impact the rights of colleagues when it comes to legislation. Senate rules and practices now provide many tools for members, and leaders, to see legislative ideas brought to an up or down vote on the Senate floor and there is no need for change in relation to legislative matters. 
   "It is unfortunate that Democrats continue to block up or down votes on President Bush's judicial nominees, thereby keeping the Senate from doing its constitutional duty. I urge the minority to put aside its partisan blockade, which interferes with our constitutional responsibilities, and join with me to bring fairness back to the process of voting for or against judicial nominees."
