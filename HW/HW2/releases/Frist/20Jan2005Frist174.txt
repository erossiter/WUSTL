SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON DEPARTURE OF DEPUTY DOE SECRETARY MCSLARROW
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the resignation of Deputy Secretary of Energy Kyle McSlarrow:  
   "Kyle has served this country and the President with great distinction at the Department of Energy, first as Chief of Staff to Secretary Abraham and then as Deputy Secretary. Over the years, he has worked closely with me and many others on Capitol Hill to advance a comprehensive national energy policy, which I hope we will pass in the 109th Congress. He also brought a clear vision to all of the agency's domestic and international activities. Kyle's dedicated leadership will be sorely missed. 
   "I wish him and his family the very best in the years to come."
