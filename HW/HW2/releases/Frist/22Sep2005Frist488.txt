SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR FY06 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which was passed by the Senate today, includes over $288 million to support Tennessee military construction projects across the state.  
   "These funds will help construct and maintain many of the facilities and infrastructure vital to the continued success and wellbeing of our armed forces," said Frist. "This federal support will help ensure our troops have the resources they need to defend our country and win the War on Terror, and I'm proud that Tennessee plays such a vital role in protecting our homeland." 
   "Our soldiers and veterans are the finest in the world," said Alexander. "They make great sacrifices each and every day to protect our freedom, and it is our duty to provide them and their families with the best, most efficient services, housing and health care. I'll continue to work with Senator Frist to ensure that our soldiers, Reserve and Guard forces and veterans have the support they deserve." 
   Some of the key Tennessee projects funded in the Senate version of the FY 2006 Military Construction Appropriations Bill include: 
   * $23.19 million for the Tennessee Army National Guard Headquarters to continue construction of a readiness center. This project will provide much needed additional administrative, storage, and training space, and to complete a total renovation of selected areas of the current facility. 
   * $62 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard to complete two projects at the Memphis International Airport. Of the funding, $23 million will go to expand the C-5 aircraft parking apron and update the hydrant refueling system and continue upgrades to accommodate the C-5 aircraft. The remaining $39 million will be used to expand hanger and maintenance facilities required for C-5 aircraft. 
   * $28 million for privatized base housing, which will improve the quality of life for the military personnel and families at Fort Campbell. These funds will increase the efficiency of base housing construction and maintenance which will result in cost savings for the Department of Defense. 
   * $1.9 million for Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, TN, to upgrade family housing facilities. 
   * $8.3 million for Fort Campbell's main gate access point which will provide greater force protection and meet the Department of Defense's new anti-terrorism force protection standards. Funding will be used to replace the existing main gate access control point, and improve access for soldiers and civilians arriving or exiting the installation. 
   * $203 million for Fort Campbell to complete eight military construction projects. Of the funding, $30 million will be used to build new group operations complex for the 5th Special Forces Group; $117 million to construct new barracks facilities; and $10.3 million to continue construction on a combined arms collective training facility. 
   The FY2006 Military Construction Appropriations bill must now be considered by a House and Senate conference committee.
