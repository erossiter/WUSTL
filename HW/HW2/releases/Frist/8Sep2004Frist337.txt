SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM
  Yesterday, Mr. President, US military deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom surpassed 1,000. These brave men and women in uniform sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom and for the security of their fellow Americans. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude for their courage, valor, strength, and commitment to our country.  
   As President Bush has reiterated time and again, our cause is to fight the enemy on his soil, before he can strike us here at home. 
   Because of our bold action, terrorists will no longer find safe harbor in Iraq. Because of our determination, Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison where his only plotting and planning is to defend himself before a war crimes tribunal. Because of our resolve, Saddam's two sadistic sons, Uday and Qusay, are dead, and many of his top lieutenants are dead or in custody. Because of America and her allies, no longer will the civilized world be threatened by Saddam and his murderous ambitions. 
   From the very beginning since President Bush launched Operation Iraqi Freedom roughly a year and a half ago, our armed forces have performed valiantly - from the three week campaign that led to the fall of Baghdad, to the fighting now in specific regions where insurgents are attempting to thwart Iraq's path to self government. The enemies of freedom will not prevail. The people of Iraq want democracy. Polls show over and over that the majority of Iraqis are optimistic about their future. Now, they are finally free to realize their dreams. 
   My heart goes out to the families who have lost loved ones in this battle, as well as the thousands of men and women who have been injured. The valor and the courage of our young men and women in the armed services are a shining example to all of the world and we owe them our deepest respect. They now belong to America's pantheon of heroes who have given their lives for the cause of liberty.
