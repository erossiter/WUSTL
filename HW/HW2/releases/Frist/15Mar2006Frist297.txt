SEN. FRIST PRAISES SHUTDOWN OF INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY RING, CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF CHILD PREDATORS LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement on the Justice Department's announcement of criminal charges in an international, internet-based child pornography investigation:  
   "Shutting down this internet child pornography ring is a step forward in keeping our innocent children safe from child predators. I was saddened to learn that the alleged primary host of one of these chat rooms that preyed upon children was a Tennessean, but I am pleased that he is now in law enforcement custody where he is unable to cause further harm. We should do more to combat child predators by passing the Children's Safety Act, which would enhance criminal penalties for child pornography and prostitution, create a national sex offender registry searchable by zip code, and expand the use of DNA fingerprinting to identify and prosecute offenders." 
   Today the Department of Justice announced charges against 27 defendants in an international, internet-based child pornography investigation. The defendants allegedly used a private Internet chat room to facilitate worldwide trading of thousands of images of child pornography. The alleged primary host of the chat room was identified as a resident of Tennessee.
