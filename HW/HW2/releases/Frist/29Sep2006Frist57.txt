SEN. FRIST DENOUNCES DEMOCRATS' OBSTRUCTION OF CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate Democrats obstructed the Child Custody Protection Act (S. 403) for the second time this year:  
   "A vast majority of Americans support parental notification laws. These laws were designed to protect young women from coerced or forced abortions, and we should enforce them. Despite widespread support within their caucus, the Senate Democratic leadership once again blocked bipartisan legislation that would keep our nation's children safe from exploitation." 
   The Child Custody Protection Act, sponsored by Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), ensures that state laws requiring parental notification or consent in a child's abortion are honored. State law exceptions for cases of abuse or incest will be protected. 
   S.403 passed overwhelmingly in the Senate on July 25 by a bipartisan vote of 65 to 34. Following the bill's passage, Senate Democrats objected to a unanimous consent request by Senator Frist to appoint conferees who would marry the House and Senate language. As a result, the House of Representatives passed an amended version of S.403 on Tuesday, but now Senate Democrats have imperiled final passage of this bill in the 109th Congress.
