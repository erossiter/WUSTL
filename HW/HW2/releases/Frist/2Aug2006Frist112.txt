SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON BORDER FENCE VOTE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Senate passage of amendments offered by Sens. Sessions and Kyl :  
    "The Senate acted today to fund a border fence, fulfilling its commitment made in the comprehensive immigration reform bill that authorized the funding. This appropriation of money is another step forward in securing our borders by building on previously provided funds. With the current National Guard deployment dramatically driving down illegal border crossings by 45 percent, we need to continue to improve our work to protect the border. Getting border security right, including building fences, is a key component to securing our homeland-which also helps open the door to comprehensive immigration reform."
