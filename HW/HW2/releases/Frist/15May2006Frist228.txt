SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement in response to this evening's presidential address regarding border security and immigration reform:  
   "Tonight, President Bush has once again demonstrated his commitment to securing our borders. 
   "Utilizing the National Guard is an effective, short-term stopgap to immediately strengthen border security as long-range reforms begin to take effect. 
   "As I've maintained from the beginning of this debate, secure borders must be the cornerstone of any comprehensive immigration reform plan. In the last eight months, the Senate has approved nearly $12 billion to bolster security along our borders, hire additional border patrol agents and increase the number of detention beds. 
   "I thank the President for his strong leadership on this issue and look forward to a thoughtful debate in the Senate this week."
