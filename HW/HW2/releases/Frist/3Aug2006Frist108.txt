SEN. FRIST BLASTS DEFEAT OF FAMILY PROSPERITY ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate failed to reach cloture on the motion to proceed to the Family Prosperity Act (H.R. 5970):  
   "Today, we had the chance to bring three very important issues to the floor for debate: permanent death tax relief, extension of expiring tax provisions, and a minimum wage increase of more than 40 percent. Each measure enjoys majority support here in the Senate."
   "But more importantly, these are issues that matter in the day-to-day lives of our constituents - issues that actually mean something to hardworking Americans. Quite simply, they're vital to the economic security of every day Americans, and they must be addressed here on the Senate floor. And as I've said before, these issues must be addressed as a package - all or nothing."
   "Not bringing this package - the Family Prosperity Act - to the floor - that's tantamount to saying, 'We don't care about America's economic security.' And I'm deeply ashamed that we, the United States Senate, would ever dare send such a message to the American people."
