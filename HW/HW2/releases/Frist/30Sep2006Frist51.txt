SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS CONFIRMATION OF FINAL TVA BOARD MEMBER
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the Senate confirmation of Bishop William H. Graves of Memphis to serve as the ninth and final board member of the newly restructured and modernized Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:  
   "Bishop Graves' confirmation completes the long-overdue restructuring of TVA's board. He is an outstanding individual who will ably represent the ratepayers' interests. With a new, stronger board of directors and a modernized management structure, I'm confident TVA is now fully prepared to address the challenges of the 21st century." 
   With revenues of nearly $8 billion last year, TVA is the nation's largest public power company. Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that restructured the board to meet 21st century challenges and reflect the management organization of similar corporations. That legislation expanded the board from three full-time members to nine part-time members and required the agency to hire a chief executive officer to oversee day-to-day operations. 
   Sitting TVA directors Bill Baxter and Skila Harris were joined in March by new directors Susan Richardson Williams, William B. Sansom, Dennis Bottorff, Howard A. Thrailkill, Robert M. Duncan and Donald DePriest. Once Bishop Graves is confirmed by the Senate, the new board will be at full strength.
