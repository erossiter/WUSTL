SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS OPENING OF EU MEMBERSHIP TALKS WITH TURKEY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the formal opening of the European Union's accession talks with Turkey: 
  "Today's formal opening of the European Union's membership talks with Turkey marks a historic moment for the Turkish people. The United States has long been a staunch supporter of Turkey's aspirations to join the EU. I welcome the commencement of these negotiations as a positive step forward that can enhance Turkey's role as a vital and strategic ally of the United States.
  "An EU that includes Turkey can have a profound impact on other Muslim countries. It would be a triumph of universal values and further demonstrate that democratic governance and respect for the rule of law are not unique to one religion or one culture. Turkey's membership in the EU would provide additional inspiration and hope for those throughout the entire Muslim world who yearn for freedom and opportunity.
  "A Turkey that is firmly integrated with our European allies, as it has been as a member of NATO for decades, will be an even more reliable partner for the United States in the effort to spread peace, stability, and democracy to the Middle East. The opening of EU membership talks is an encouraging development for the people of Turkey in their quest to secure a more prosperous future. The United States will continue to be a steady supporter of Turkey's European Union ambitions."
