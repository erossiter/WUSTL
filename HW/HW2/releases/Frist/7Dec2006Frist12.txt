SEN. FRIST SECURES REINSTATEMENT OF MEDICAID DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE PAYMENTS FOR TENNESSEE
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement when announcing that Tennessee would receive Medicaid Disproportionate Share (DSH) payments in 2007 under a provision included in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (H.R. 6408):  
 "This is a huge victory as we work to improve health care quality for all Tennesseans," Frist said. "DSH payments will help provide financial to relief to both the state government and the hospitals serving low-income and uninsured patients. I've dedicated tremendous time and energy to strengthening our state's health care safety net throughout my service in the Senate. This is a gratifying success in that effort. " 
 Medicaid DSH payments strengthen states' health care safety nets by providing additional financial support to those hospitals treating disproportionately high numbers of low-income Medicaid and uninsured patients.
