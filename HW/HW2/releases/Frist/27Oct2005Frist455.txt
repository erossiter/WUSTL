SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD GRANT FUNDING TO AID TENNESSEE FIRE DEPARTMENTS; SOUTH FULTON FIRE DEPARTMENT AMONG GRANT RECIPIENTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for awarding a $56,117 grant for operations and fire safety to the South Fulton Fire Department under the 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). 
  The AFGP provides grants to help local fire departments purchase new firefighting equipment, fund firefighter health and safety programs, enhance emergency medical services programs and conduct fire prevention and safety programs. Operations and fire safety grants fund training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness programs, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "Tennessee's firefighters serve their communities bravely and are vital to saving lives and protecting property in an emergency," Frist said. "This grant will help provide the department with the equipment necessary to respond quickly and efficiently to emergencies in the South Fulton area. Senator Alexander and I thank the Department of Homeland Security for supporting Tennessee's firefighters and the services they deliver."
   "Senator Frist and I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security's investment in South Fulton for emergency preparedness," Alexander said. "This grant will help give firefighters the vital resources they need to save lives. We will continue to work together to ensure that fire departments in Tennessee are ready and able to keep our citizens safe."
   The AFGP awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
