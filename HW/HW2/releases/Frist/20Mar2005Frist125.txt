  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the United States Senate floor: 
   "There have been reports of a memo suggesting a political nature to Congress' efforts on behalf of Mrs. Schiavo. I have never seen the memo, I did not authorize the memo, and I condemn the content of the memo and reaffirm that the interest in this case by myself, and the many members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, is to assure that Mrs. Schiavo has another chance at life."
