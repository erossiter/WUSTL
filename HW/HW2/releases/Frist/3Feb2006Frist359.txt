SEN. FRIST HAILS NEW JOB FIGURES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced the creation of 193,000 new jobs in January and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent:  
   "Today's figures reinforce the fact that the Republican-led Congress' pro-growth policies are creating an environment for our nation's economy to thrive. These sensible policies have helped create more than 4.7 million new jobs since August 2003, but we understand that we can and must do more to keep our economy growing. 
   "That's why this week we've focused on extending sensible tax relief to all Americans. By keeping taxes low we keep the economy growing and tax revenues high, generating jobs and opportunities that sustain America's strong, stable and robust economy."
