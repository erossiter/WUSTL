SEN. FRIST HAILS IRAQI ELECTIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the successful conduct of Iraq's national election to form a permanent Council of Representatives and government:  
   "Today's elections to form Iraq's first fully constitutional national parliament since the fall of Saddam Hussein marked another historic milestone for the Iraqi people and their new democracy. Yet again, millions of Iraqis demonstrated courage and resolve in defying the threats of terrorists and turning out to vote in the election. Early reports indicate that turnout was strong and that Sunni Arabs participated in large numbers. 
   "The permanent Iraqi Council of Representatives and the new government in Iraq will be charged with implementing the permanent constitution that Iraqis overwhelmingly approved in the October 15 referendum. I am confident that Iraq's new leaders will continue to reach out to all segments of Iraqi society in the next steps of the democratic transition. 
   "I applaud the Iraqi people for their bravery and their steadfast commitment to securing a free and democratic future. The American people will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Iraq as they move forward to rebuild and renew their country."
