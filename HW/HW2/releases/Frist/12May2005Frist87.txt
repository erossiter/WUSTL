SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the nomination of John R. Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations (UN) to the Senate floor for consideration:  
   "These are critical times for the United States and the world. The United Nations can play an important role, but is in need of serious reform. America needs public servants like John Bolton who are committed to representing our nation's interests at home and abroad, and is capable of pushing the UN to implement much needed reforms. John Bolton is a highly qualified candidate for this post, and I'm confident the Senate will soon move to consider and confirm him as America's next UN ambassador. 
   "I'd also like to commend Sen. Lugar for his efforts as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in supporting and guiding this nomination through the Committee process."
