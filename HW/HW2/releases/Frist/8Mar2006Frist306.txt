SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS IAEA ACTION ON IRAN
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency sent forward his latest report on Iran's nuclear activities to the United Nations Security Council:  
   "I applaud today's action by the Director General of the IAEA. For years, the Iranian regime has misled the international community regarding its nuclear ambitions and has failed to meet its non-proliferation obligations. This action sends a clear message to Iran that the international community is determined to address this important issue and is united in the belief that Iran should not have the means to develop nuclear weapons. 
   "I also commend President Bush, Secretary Rice, and our European allies for their patient diplomacy throughout this process. The United States and the international community have offered Iran every opportunity to come clean about its nuclear program and fully comply with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
   "An Iran armed with nuclear weapons poses a dire threat to peace and stability in the Middle East and to American national security. It is clear that Iran cannot be trusted to negotiate in good faith or abide by its commitments. While this action is long overdue, today's decision is a positive development, and I urge the Security Council to take action immediately to convince Teheran to set aside its nuclear ambitions."
