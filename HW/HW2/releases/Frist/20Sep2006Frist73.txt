SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS CLOTURE VOTE ON SECURE FENCE ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate invoked cloture on the Motion to Proceed to The Secure Fence Act of 2006:  
   "The vote today was not about Republicans or Democrats, it was about what's right for the American people. Securing our borders is a major step forward in addressing comprehensive immigration reform, by respecting the rule of law and our country's immigrant heritage. When it comes to the final vote next week, I hope my colleagues will not block this bill and will vote to help make America safer and more secure."
