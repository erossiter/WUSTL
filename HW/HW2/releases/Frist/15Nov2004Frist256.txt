SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PAIGE RESIGNATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Dr. Paige has been a tremendous leader during the past four years, overseeing the most historic federal education reform initiative in history, the No Child Left Behind Act. From day one, he knew what needed to be done: set high standards for all children and then hold schools accountable for results. He tirelessly fought for that principle and exhibited bold leadership while implementing No Child Left Behind, a law that has produced impressive results. More schools than ever are working harder to raise academic achievement. I commend him for his great success and hope he continues in the field of education so that our nation may benefit from his knowledge and experience."
