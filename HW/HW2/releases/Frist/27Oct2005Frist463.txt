SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON HARRIET MIERS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement: 
   "Harriet Miers has asked the President to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court. I respect her decision and appreciate her service to our country.
   "I look forward with anticipation to the President naming the next nominee quickly. 
   "We remain ready to fulfill our duty to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees. And the Supreme Court still awaits its next justice-a highly qualified nominee who is committed to upholding the Constitution and who believes in the limited role of a judge to interpret the law and not legislate from the bench."
