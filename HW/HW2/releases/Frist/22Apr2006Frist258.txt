SEN. FRIST TOURS AREAS DAMAGED BY TORNADO
  This morning U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) joined local officials to tour regions of the Gallatin area devastated by an April 7 tornado. Frist received a briefing regarding damage resulting from the severe weather and the recovery plans being implemented by FEMA, TEMA and local governments.  
   "As the devastation I witnessed today demonstrates, Middle Tennessee has suffered tremendously as a result of recent tornadoes and severe weather," Frist said. "In the true spirit of the Volunteer State, countless citizens have come forward to assist their friends and neighbors with recovery efforts in this trying time. I appreciate the hard work and dedication displayed by local officials and emergency management personnel in the affected areas. I am also grateful for the president's quick response to Tennessee's needs. Senator Alexander and I will continue our efforts to ensure federal assistance reaches these communities in a quick and efficient manner." 
   In the aftermath of two separate severe storm systems earlier this month, President Bush has declared 15 Middle and West Tennessee counties eligible for federal disaster assistance: Benton, Cannon, Carroll, Cheatham, Cumberland, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Haywood, Maury, Sumner, Warren and Weakley. 
   Frist and U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) wrote to the president in support of the disaster assistance prior to his declaration.
