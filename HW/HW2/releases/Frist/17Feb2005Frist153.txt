SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding Senate passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act:  
   "Today's vote is a resounding victory for patients, workers, and consumers across America. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is forward-thinking legislation that will ensure that people have access to affordable health coverage and are not discriminated against in the workplace because of their genetic makeup or the illness of a family member. 
   "With the mapping of the human genome completed within the past two years, we are now on the verge of dramatic breakthroughs in science and medicine. Knowledge of genetic risks should save lives, not scare patients away from seeking needed care. This legislation will help ensure that genetic information is used in the right way. 
   "As an original co-sponsor of this legislation, I'm particularly pleased by today's Senate passage of the bill. And I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to address this issue quickly so we can send the President a bill he can sign soon." 
   Senator Frist has co-authored similar measures in the past. The "Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act" is a result of more than seven years of work by Frist, Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and others to prohibit health insurers from requiring patients to disclose genetic test results and prevent them from using genetic information to make hiring or firing decisions, deny health coverage or set insurance rates. 
   Frist is a member of the HELP committee, which has jurisdiction over health legislation. He is also a physician.
