SEN. FRIST HAILS FINAL SENATE PASSAGE OF COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL CONFERENCE REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement after final Senate passage of the energy conference report: 
   For nearly a decade, America has lacked a comprehensive energy policy. This has led to higher prices and threatened our ability to maintain a secure and reliable supply of energy. Much of our economy is affected by high energy prices at the pump and growing electricity and gas bills. That's why Congress acted swiftly to pass meaningful legislation that will help lower energy costs and ease demand.
   This legislation blends measures that enhance energy efficiency, promote development of new technologies and increase production of energy resources here at home. By confronting our nation's energy challenges head-on, we can keep America safe by reducing dependence on foreign oil and ensuring our economy is fueled by reliable, affordable, secure and clean sources of energy. This legislation is another example of how Congress is delivering meaningful solutions on the issues that matter most to Americans. I'm proud of today's passage of the energy conference report and look forward to the president signing the bill into law.
