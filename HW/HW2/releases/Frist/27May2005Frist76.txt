SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO DARFUR
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after international donors pledged an additional $200 million to fund the African Union's peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, Sudan.  
   "Today's news reflects the international community's resolve in restoring stability to the Darfur region. Combining international financial aid and military transport, training and planning support will help honor the African Union's request for assistance while ensuring they lead the peacekeeping effort. Having personally visited the refugee camps and met with Sudanese civilians fleeing persecution in Darfur, I'm heartened by today's development, and remain hopeful that renewed commitment from the international community can restore order and stop this genocide. I look forward to closely monitoring the United States' involvement in these efforts."
