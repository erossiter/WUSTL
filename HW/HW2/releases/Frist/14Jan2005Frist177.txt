SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS ANNOUNCEMENT OF FUNDING TO ENHANCE DETECTION, MONITORING OF TSUNAMIS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the Administration's announcement of $37.5 million to expand US tsunami detection and monitoring capabilities:  
   "Today's announcement by the Administration to expand the tsunami warning and detection system is a bold step towards ensuring America's readiness for natural disasters. The recent catastrophe in Asia proves that effective detection, monitoring and communication systems are vital to minimizing the destruction caused by tsunamis. This past week I visited some of the region's most devastated communities, and it is painfully clear to me that had people been given even five or 10 minutes of warning, more lives would have been saved. I applaud President Bush for his aggressive and forward-thinking response to protecting America and the world community against tsunamis. We must honor this tremendous loss of human life by ensuring our world is better prepared for future natural disasters."
