  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today made the following statements after President Bush approved the state's request for federal disaster assistance to aid 13 additional Middle and West Tennessee counties in the aftermath of two devastating storm series:  
   "For the second time in recent days, the president has responded to the needs of Tennesseans impacted by deadly storms," Frist said. "I've spoken to state and local officials in the affected areas and assured them that Senator Alexander and I will continue working to see that federal assistance is dispensed quickly and effectively." 
   "We're very pleased that the federal government has again responded quickly to Tennessee's request for disaster assistance," Alexander said. "Today's announcement is good news for Middle and West Tennessee communities working to rebuild following a week of devastating storms. Senator Frist and I will continue to work with state and local officials to assist in those efforts." 
   Federal disaster assistance was approved for Dyer and Gibson counties following a series of storms affecting West Tennessee on April 2-3. Frist and Alexander sent a letter to the president April 10 urging the expansion of the federal disaster declaration to include additional counties affected by the second series of storms on April 7-8. Affected residents of the following counties are now eligible for federal assistance following the president's declaration: Benton, Cannon, Carroll, Cheatham, Cumberland, Davidson, Dickson, Fayette, Haywood, Maury, Sumner, Warren and Weakley.
