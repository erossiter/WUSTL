SEN. FRIST PRAISES COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF COMBATING AUTISM ACT OF 2006
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the Combating Autism through Research, Screening, Intervention and Education Act, of which he was an original cosponsor:  
   "Autism is a heartbreaking disorder that afflicts thousands of children and their families. However, despite achieving great progress in autism research and treatment, we still do not know the cause, nor have we discovered a cure. This legislation expands and intensifies autism-related research, increases awareness, and reduces barriers to screening and diagnosis. Additionally, it authorizes over $1 billion in funding for autism related-activities over five years."
   "Research is the key to finding a cure. This is important legislation, and I look forward to its consideration by the full Senate."
   The Combating Autism Through Research, Screening, Intervention, and Education Act reauthorizes provisions in the Children's Health Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-310), which was authored by Sens. Frist, Kennedy, and Dodd. The Children's Health Act of 2000 expanded, intensified, and coordinated NIH autism-related activities. It also established Centers of Excellence on autism research and improved education and awareness.
