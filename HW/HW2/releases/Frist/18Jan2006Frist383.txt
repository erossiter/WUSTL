SEN. FRIST WELCOMES SEN. REID'S IDEAS ON LOBBYING REFORM, CALLS FOR BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN PARTISAN POLITICS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "I'm pleased that Senator Reid has followed the lead of Republican Leaders in the Senate and House to propose lobbying reforms. Unfortunately, we heard more partisan rhetoric than reform today. Senator Reid and Senate Democrats should work with us to develop meaningful bipartisan solutions - rather than engaging in divisive partisan politics that will further erode, rather than strengthen, public confidence and trust in America's elected officials." 
   Senator Frist has named Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) to spearhead Senate efforts on lobby reform, and has asked him to ready legislation for Senate action by late February.
