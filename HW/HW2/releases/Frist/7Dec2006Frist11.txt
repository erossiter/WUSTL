SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF COMBATING AUTISM ACT OF 2006
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed a house modified version of the Combating Autism Act of 2006:  
 "I am pleased that both the House and Senate have now passed the Combating Autism Act of 2006 which reauthorizes provisions of the Children's Health Act of 2000. Progress has been made in researching autism but challenges remain, which is why this legislation is important to everyone affected by autism." 
 The Combating Autism Through Research, Screening, Intervention, and Education Act reauthorizes provisions in the Children's Health Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-310), which was authored by Senators Frist, Kennedy, and Dodd. The Children's Health Act of 2000 expanded, intensified, and coordinated NIH autism-related activities. It also established Centers of Excellence on autism research and improved education and awareness.
