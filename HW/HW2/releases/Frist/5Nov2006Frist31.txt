SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON SADDAM VERDICT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement following the verdict in the trial of Saddam Hussein: 
   "Today a brutal dictator who paralyzed his country in fear has been brought to justice. He terrorized his own countrymen and neighboring countries - this verdict is a victory for Iraqis and a message that democracy can come to countries around the world. Clearly there is more work to do but we should commend the Iraqi people and our armed forces for this step forward."
