SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD GRANT FUNDING TO AID TENNESSEE FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $31,725 grant to the town of Trimble, under the 2004 Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. 
   The program provides grants to help local fire departments purchase new firefighting equipment, fund firefighter health and safety programs, enhance emergency medical services programs and conduct fire prevention and safety programs. 
   "Our first responders must be equipped to do their job and this funding will help ensure they have the necessary resources to keep the citizens of Trimble safe," said Frist. "This funding is an investment in Tennessee, and I applaud the Department of Homeland Security for supporting the critical work of our firefighters." 
   "Senator Frist and I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security's investment in the Trimble community for emergency preparedness," Alexander said. "This grant will help give firefighters the vital resources they need to save lives. We will continue to work together to ensure that they have the necessary resources to keep our citizens safe." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
