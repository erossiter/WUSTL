SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON ENERGY SECRETARY ABRAHAM'S RESIGNATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Spence Abraham has served this country with distinction, both as Secretary of Energy and as a member of the United States Senate. As Secretary, he has been a tireless advocate for a comprehensive national energy policy, which is vital to strengthening both our national and economic security. He has worked aggressively to stem the spread of nuclear weapons and materials around the world, and to expand the frontiers of science and technology here at home. I appreciate his partnership in supporting groundbreaking research at the Department of Energy facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. I wish him and his family the very best."
