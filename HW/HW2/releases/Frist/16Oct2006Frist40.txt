SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE'S CONFIRMATION OF NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) confirmed North Korea did test a nuclear device last week:  
   "Today's confirmation of North Korea's nuclear test by the U.S. intelligence community underscores the seriousness of the threat posed by Kim Jong-Il and his radical regime. It also demonstrates the folly on not taking the North Korean regime at its word when it claims it has nuclear weapons, as it claimed in February 2005, when it says it is going to test them, as it said on October 3, 2006, or when it threatens to transfer such weapons to terrorists, as it reportedly did in April 2005. 
   "It is now up to all members of the U.N. Security Council to fully enforce the sanctions approved unanimously over the weekend. By speaking with one voice, the Security Council sent a strong message to North Korea's leadership that last week's nuclear test required stiff consequences and any further aggressive acts would not be tolerated by the international community."
