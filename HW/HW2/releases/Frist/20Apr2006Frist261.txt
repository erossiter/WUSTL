SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS NEW MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE NUMBERS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt announced that more than 30 million beneficiaries, including 688,095 Tennesseans, are now enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug program:  
   "Our goal in passing the Medicare Prescription Drug plan was to ensure that all seniors have access to affordable prescription drug coverage," Frist said. "Today's announcement that nearly 700,000 Tennesseans are now covered demonstrates that the plan is helping more seniors afford the drugs they need. It clearly pays to enroll. I encourage all Tennesseans to make sure they or their loved ones have taken advantage of this important new benefit." 
   The Medicare prescription drug program now provides an average of 3 million prescriptions per day for beneficiaries.
