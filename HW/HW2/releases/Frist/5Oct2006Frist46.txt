SEN. FRIST COMMENTS SUPPORTING SPEAKER HASTERT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and the ongoing investigation of former Rep. Mark Foley:  
   "I have tremendous respect for the exceptional leadership of the Speaker of the House. Denny Hastert is good man, a capable leader and he has my confidence and support. Former Congressman Foley's conduct was a disgrace, and the expectation of House leadership that he resign immediately was appropriate. Speaker Hastert's announcement today is a positive step forward to ensure that the facts are fully identified and any future transgressions are prevented."
