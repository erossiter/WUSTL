SEN. FRIST PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate unanimously passed S. 193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increases the maximum fines the FCC may impose for indecency violations:  
   "The Senate took a great step forward tonight to protect children and families from offensive images broadcast directly into their living rooms. Parents should be able to watch television with their children without worrying about exposing them to unsuitable content. 
   "Faced with only minimal penalties, some broadcasters for too long have flouted these standards with no regard for the negative impact on impressionable children. This bill seeks to change that by establishing greater consequences for broadcasters' bottom line through increased fines for violations. 
   "This is simple, straightforward legislation that provides greater enforcement of decency standards and holds broadcasters accountable without infringing on their freedom of speech. 
   "I'm pleased the Senate has taken action to protect American families from indecency on the public airwaves." 
   Currently, the FCC may impose a fine of $32,500 for violating indecency standards. The bill increases the maximum FCC fines for indecency violations to $325,000 with a $3 million cap.
