SEN. FRIST COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR COMMENTS ON LATEST POLITICAL STUNT FROM MINORITY
  Amy Call, Communications Director for U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after this morning's press conference by Senate Democrats introducing their "security package": 
   "Senate Democrats again display the lack of commitment to finish real work in the Senate this month. While they flail about on partisan political stunts, Senate Republicans will act today so that our troops are the best-equipped in the world. Then, the Senate will turn to Republican efforts to strengthen security at our ports."
