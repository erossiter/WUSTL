SEN. FRIST CHEERS SENATE PASSAGE OF TERRORIST TRIBUNAL LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006:  
   "We are a nation at war with an enemy that will stop at nothing to kill innocent Americans. This bill will help keep Americans safe by creating military commissions to prosecute terrorists for war crimes and by preserving an intelligence program that has disrupted terrorist plots and saved lives. I look forward to the President signing this critical legislation into law as soon as possible so that we can start bringing these terrorists to justice."
