SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $3.5 MILLION FOR TENNESSEE IN AMERICAN HISTORY GRANTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced over $3.5 million in "Teaching American History" grants for Tennessee through the U.S. Department of Education to support programs that raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of American history. 
   "This funding will help strengthen American history education in Tennessee and provide schools with the resources and teaching strategies they need in the classroom," said Frist. 
   "I applaud the Department of Education for recognizing the need for these grants, and I am proud of the Tennessee schools that are receiving them," Alexander said. "My first bill in the Senate, the American History and Civics Act, creates summer academies for teachers and students to help ensure the teaching of the key events, persons and ideas that have shaped the United States, so our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American." 
   The goal of the program is to demonstrate how school districts and institutions with expertise in American history can collaborate over a three-year period to ensure that teachers develop the knowledge and skills necessary to teach traditional American history in an exciting and engaging way. 
   In order to receive a grant, a local educational agency must agree to carry out the proposed activities in partnership with one or more of the following: institutions of higher education, nonprofit history or humanities organizations, libraries, or museums. 
   Recipients of grant money in Tennessee include: Cheatham County Schools ($634,946), Dyersburg City Schools ($981,949), Metro Nashville Public Schools ($995,200) and the White County Board of Education ($942,191). 
   The Teaching American History Grant program is a discretionary grant program funded under Title II-C, Subpart 4 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
