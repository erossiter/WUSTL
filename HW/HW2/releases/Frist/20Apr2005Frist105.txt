SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SIGNING OF BANKRUPTCY BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after President Bush signed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 into law:  
   "Today's signing of the bankruptcy reform bill marks a major step towards eliminating abuses in our court system, and ensures that those who have the means repay their debts. These reforms will lower the burden on all Americans who are currently paying the price for these abuses in the form of higher interest rates, higher down payments and higher costs of goods and services. I'm proud of this victory for personal responsibility and fairness. And I look forward to continue passing legislation that makes a difference in the lives of the American people, and moves our country forward."
