SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR FAIR UP OR DOWN VOTE ON JUDGE ALITO NOMINATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today released the following statement calling upon Senate Democrats to move toward a fair up or down vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court:  
   "Senate Democrats should stop their foot-dragging on the vote for Judge Alito to become Justice Alito. While the hallmark of the Senate is full debate, debate should not continue forever. 
   "Judge Alito has waited 87 days since the President announced his nomination for an up or down vote, longer than nearly every current Supreme Court justice. During that time, he held over 80 courtesy meetings with Senators, answered more than 650 questions during more than 18 hours in Judiciary Committee hearings and submitted hundreds more pages of written answers to the committee questionnaire and individual questions. 
   "The time has come to move to a vote."
