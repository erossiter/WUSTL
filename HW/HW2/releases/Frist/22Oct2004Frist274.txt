SEN. FRIST HAILS BILL SIGNING FOR TOBACCO BUYOUT, STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTIBILITY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today hailed President George Bush for signing the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Conference Report into law.  
 The conference report included the state sales tax deductibility and tobacco buyout provisions.
   "This law will help America compete in today's aggressive global economy by cutting taxes and creating incentives to invest in the United States. And, with the President's signature, the European Union sanctions on American exports will finally come to an end. It also provides specific benefits to Tennesseans - state sales tax deductibility and the tobacco buyout.
   "State sales tax deductibility has been something I've aggressively pursued since coming to the Senate. I'm pleased we've finally brought fairness to the federal tax code for states like Tennessee which do not impose a state income tax. This will mean an additional $470 in tax savings for almost one-quarter of Tennesseans filing their taxes for 2004.
   "The tobacco buyout will mean $767 million for Tennessee farm communities over the next 10 years. This buyout is welcome news for our desperate tobacco farmers. It will finally end the outdated quota system while providing fair compensation for quota holders and growers. In addition, farmers who continue to grow tobacco will do so in a free market without government intervention.
   "I applaud President Bush and my colleagues in the House and Senate for their commitment to passing this legislation. This law restores equality to an unfair portion of America's tax code and eases the burden on some of America's hard working farmers who help form the backbone of our nation's economy."
