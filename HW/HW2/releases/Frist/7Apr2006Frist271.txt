SEN. FRIST HAILS MARCH JOB FIGURES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced that the economy continued to grow last month, creating over 211,000 new jobs in March:  
   "Today's figures highlight the continued effectiveness of fiscally conservative, pro-growth policies. Republican-led initiatives have fostered 31 consecutive months of job growth creating 5.2 million jobs, but we can and must do more. 
   "I call on my colleagues to build off today's momentum by implementing commonsense, pro-growth initiatives like a responsible budget and the tax reconciliation bill. With tax season looming, it's critical that the tax reconciliation conference complete its work swiftly so we can ease tax rates on capital gains and dividends and sustain strong economic growth and healthy job creation for years to come."
