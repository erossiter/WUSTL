SEN. FRIST HONORS MEMORY OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) made the following statement today following the announcement of Pope John Paul II's passing: 
   "Pope John Paul was a man driven by faith, and his bold and impassioned leadership revolutionized the papacy. Guided by the truths of eternal tradition, he was a man of great conscience who was vigorous and engaged with many issues affecting the church and the world community. Though his body may have declined in recent years, his mind and spirit remained active. He led the church with dignity, grace and purpose. 
   "Karyn and I are saddened by today's loss. The Catholic Church has lost a great Pope, and the world community has lost a great leader and friend. May God bless his memory."
