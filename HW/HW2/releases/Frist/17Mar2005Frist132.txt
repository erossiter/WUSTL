SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF TERRI SCHIAVO BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following Senate passage of the Terri Schiavo Bill:  
   "I'm proud of today's Senate passage of the Terry Schiavo Bill. As a doctor and a Senator, I believe that Congress must do everything in its power to ensure that any life and death decision is based on a sound medical diagnosis of Terri's condition. There is no more sacred virtue in our society than the need to preserve and protect human life. To knowingly and purposely starve Ms. Schiavo to death would be callous, cruel and immoral. 
   "I am hopeful that the House will consider and pass this legislation quickly."
