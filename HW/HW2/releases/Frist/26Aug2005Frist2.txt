SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON 118TH BRAC COMMISSION DECISION
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after the BRAC commission made its decision regarding the future of the 118th: 
   "I'm deeply disappointed in tonight's decision by the BRAC commission. The 118th has a proud history serving our country and national security. In my opinion, our national security would have been bolstered by keeping the C-130s in Nashville. However, I'm committed to continue working with my colleagues in the Tennessee delegation to secure the best flying follow-on mission for the men and women of the 118th."
