SEN. FRIST CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR U.S.-INDIA PASSAGE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Democrats blocked a unanimous consent proposal for consideration of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation bill:  
   "Last night, I offered a unanimous consent agreement to ensure that the Senate could complete consideration of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation legislation in a reasonable period of time. However, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle objected. 
   "The enactment of this legislation is critical to advancing U.S.-India relations and will help create export opportunities for American businesses. 
   "We need time to work out the differences with the companion legislation passed by the House. Therefore, the Senate cannot afford to wait until November to pass this critical piece of legislation. 
   "I call on my Democratic colleagues to work with us to develop a unanimous consent agreement to enable the Senate to consider this important measure on the floor this week."
