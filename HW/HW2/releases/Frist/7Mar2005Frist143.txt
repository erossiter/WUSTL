SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF BOLTON AS AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of John R. Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations (UN):  
   "I applaud President Bush's nomination of John Bolton to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. John Bolton's distinguished career of public service and his commitment to advancing America's interests abroad make him an outstanding candidate for this position. His skills, experience, and expertise clearly qualify him to represent the United States at the United Nations. 
   "Throughout his career, Mr. Bolton has proven to be an effective, successful diplomat, and a tough negotiator. As the United States confronts the challenges of the 21st century, I'm confident he'll serve America well in this new role. 
   "This is a critical time for the United Nations and the world. America needs public servants like John Bolton who are capable, experienced, and dedicated to protecting the American people. John Bolton is an excellent candidate for this post, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through the Senate." 
   John R. Bolton has served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security since May 2001. He worked for the United Nations as the Secretary General's Personal Envoy for the Western Sahara from 1997-2000, and worked closely with the UN on key diplomatic initiatives and matters relating to UN reform during his time as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations from 1989-1993. Mr. Bolton has also played a key role in America's efforts to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction by leading negotiations on the Moscow Treaty, the Proliferation Security Initiative, and on the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Proliferation of WMD. He will replace John Danforth who retired in January.
