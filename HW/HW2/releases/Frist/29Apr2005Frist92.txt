SEN. FRIST HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF 2006 BUDGET RESOLUTION CONFERENCE REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following Senate passage of the 2006 budget resolution conference report:  
   "I'm pleased that the Senate was able to pass the 2006 budget resolution so quickly. I'm proud we put a budget back in place. I applaud Senator Gregg (R-NH) for his outstanding leadership and all the hard work that went into this conference report. This budget makes inroads in addressing the growth of entitlement spending - including Medicaid - so we can institute needed reform while still supporting America's most vulnerable citizens. It's a responsible budget that thoughtfully anticipates the current and future needs of our country. It required us to make tough choices, and reflects the truth that the best way to serve the needs of our great country is with a strong and vibrant economy."
