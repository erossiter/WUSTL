SEN. FRIST PRAISES BUDGET PASSAGE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-TN) made the following statement this evening after the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 83, the FY2007 Budget Resolution:  
   "This budget contains critical new enforcement tools that will help curb new entitlement spending in the future. The resolution also builds on last year's budget by constraining non-security, non-emergency spending by nearly one percent. This blue print for fiscal responsibility also includes sorely needed tax relief provisions that will help keep America's economy resilient and adaptable. While the bill does not go as far as I would like to control growth in mandatory spending programs, it is a responsible budget plan that meets the needs of the American people. 
   "A fiscal plan that restrains unnecessary spending, controls growth in entitlement spending and reduces the tax burden is integral to future economic growth. I'm proud of tonight's progress and will continue to work with my colleagues to implement sound, pro-growth policies that drive down the deficit and promote an environment that will enable our economy to thrive and new jobs to be created every day."
