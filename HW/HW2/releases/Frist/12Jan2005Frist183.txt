SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF CHERTOFF AS HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Michael Chertoff as the next Secretary of Homeland Security:  
   "Michael Chertoff brings the experience and expertise necessary to effectively lead the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Chertoff helped guide the Justice Department in the early days following the September 11 attacks. He played a central role in shaping America's legal approach to the war on terror, and has been relentless in ensuring that our nation's basic rights and freedoms are protected while still keeping America safe and secure. Mr. Chertoff's experience will be invaluable in strengthening coordination and organization within this still young department, so it can fulfill its mandate to keep America safe and free. Michael Chertoff is an outstanding candidate for Secretary of Homeland Security, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through the Senate."
