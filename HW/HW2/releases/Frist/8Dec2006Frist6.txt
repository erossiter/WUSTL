SEN. FRIST HAILS CONFIRMATION OF ANOTHER JUDICIAL NOMINEE
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Senate confirmed Kent Jordan to serve as a Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit:  
 "I am pleased that we confirmed Kent Jordan to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals before ending the 109th Congress and added to Republican-led success in confirming judges throughout our federal courts who understand their limited constitutional role to tell us what the law is, not what it should be." 
 Under Senator Frist's leadership, 94 percent of all judgeships currently are filled, including 91.6 percent of all circuit court judgeships and 94.7 percent of all district court judgeships. 
 Since Senator Frist became Majority Leader, the Senate has made considerable progress on President Bush's judicial nominees, including confirming 2 Supreme Court Justices, 34 circuit court judges, and 122 district court judges, and decreasing the number of circuit court vacancies by 40 percent. Overall, the Senate has the highest confirmation rate of federal judges since President Reagan.
