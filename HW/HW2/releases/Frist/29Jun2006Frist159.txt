SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER PRAISE EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR TENNESSEE FARMERS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today praised the announcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that more than $2 million in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding is being made available for Tennessee to help producers rehabilitate land damaged by the recent tornados. 
   "This assistance arrives at a time of great need. As rural communities across Middle and West Tennessee recover from April's tornados, Senator Alexander and I will continue working with federal, state and local officials to ensure these areas have access to the vital resources they require," Frist said. "I thank Secretary Johanns and the Bush administration for their ongoing support for our state in the aftermath of these devastating storms."
   "I commend Secretary Johanns for responding to the tragic storms and tornadoes in early April," said Alexander. "Farmers and rural communities in West and Middle Tennessee were devastated early in the season, and as they work to put their lives and local economies back together, this assistance will help them get back on their feet. Tennessee communities have pulled together to help their neighbors, and this federal assistance will aid those local efforts."
   The following counties will be approved for ECP funding in Tennessee:
   * Tornado ($2,128,800): Benton, Carroll, Cheatham, Cumberland, Decatur, Dickson, Dyer, Gibson, Henderson, Montgomery, Roane, Sumner, Warren and Weakley. 
   * Drought ($200,000): Clay and Jackson.
   ECP funding gives producers additional resources to remove debris from farmland, restore fences and conservation structures, provide water for stock in drought situations and grade and shape farmland damaged by a natural disaster.
