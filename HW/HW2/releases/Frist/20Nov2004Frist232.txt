 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on passage of S. Res. 477, Sense of the Senate supporting a reinvigorated Middle East peace process:  
   "I authored and passed this resolution because I believe securing Middle East peace is critical for the future of the region. I am pleased the Senate has supported this Resolution that supports a reinvigoration of the Middle East Peace Process. 
   "I am committed to a vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. I endorse the steps presented by President Bush and Prime Minister Blair earlier this week that expressed a vision of freedom, peace and democracy in the broader Middle East. President Bush also re-stated his commitment to the Road Map, which has been endorsed by the United States, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations as a realistic and widely recognized plan for progress towards peace. 
   "It is appropriate that the Senate has shown its support and endorsement of these goals as a safe and peaceful Middle East is imperative to the safety and security of all Americans and indeed the world community."
