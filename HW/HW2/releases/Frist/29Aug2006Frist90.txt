SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON KATRINA ANNIVERSARY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina:  
   "Today we remember those who lost their lives during the worst natural disaster in our nation's history. We realized too late that our disaster response capability, which was tested at an unprecedented magnitude, was clearly riddled with major deficiencies at all levels of government. 
   "When I visited the area the utter devastation and profound heroism of emergency personnel and average citizens struck me the most. The American people opened their hearts, homes, schools and communities to those whose lives had been changed. 
   "Since the first emergency spending bill passed on September 1, 2005, we've appropriated over $122 billion to provide shelter, rebuild schools, restore vital services and jump start economic recovery. We must monitor how these critical dollars are spent, and Congress must continue to support the Gulf Coast rebuilding effort."
