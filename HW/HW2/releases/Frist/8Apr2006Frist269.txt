SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER RESPOND TO SECOND SERIES OF DEADLY STORMS IN TENNESSEE
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) released the following statements today in response to the series of devastating tornadoes and thunderstorms that moved through Middle Tennessee yesterday:  
   "As a native Nashvillian, this series of deadly storms strikes particularly close to home. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone impacted by this tragedy, especially those who have lost loved ones," Frist said. "Senator Alexander and I will continue working to ensure state and local officials have access to the necessary federal resources as our communities rebuild." 
   "For the second time in a week, devastating storms have caused extensive loss of life and property damage in Tennessee. I've spoken with Governor Bredesen, and my staff and I will continue working with Senator Frist and federal, state and local officials in Middle Tennessee to provide any assistance," Alexander said. "My thoughts and prayers are with the families who have suffered great losses." 
   Officials from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and Tennessee National Guard are currently completing an aerial assessment of the damage in Middle Tennessee. The storms affected 18 counties in Tennessee, and at last report, officials had confirmed 12 deaths, nine in Sumner County and three in Warren County.
