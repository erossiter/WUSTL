SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD $1.4 MILLION GRANT FOR TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for providing a $1.4 million grant for Tennessee State University to support Early Head Start programs in Gibson, Henry and Weakley Counties.  
   "Head Start programs have improved the lives of thousands of disadvantaged children by giving them a jump start on their education. This funding will ensure that Tennessee State University can continue helping children in Tennessee," said Frist. "I applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for taking significant steps to ensure that more than 100 children in Gibson, Henry and Weakley Counties will receive the benefits of this proven learning program." 
   "This funding is important for Tennessee's most precious resource, our children," Alexander said. "I will continue to work with Senator Frist and my colleagues in the Senate to strengthen this valuable program." 
   The funding will include $1,456,450 for Tennessee State University to support Early Head Start programs in Gibson, Henry and Weakley Counties. Tennessee State University will collaborate with local schools and educational organizations to help more than 100 children and families living in West Tennessee.
   The Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs which serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
