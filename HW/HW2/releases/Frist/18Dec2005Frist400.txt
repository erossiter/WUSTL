SEN. FRIST-AUTHORED SMART LEGISLATION INCLUDED IN BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today praised the inclusion of legislation he authored to promote math and science education in the budget reconciliation bill.  
   "China and India are generating scientists and engineers at a furious pace while America lags dangerously behind," said Frist. "These SMART Grants and Academic Competitiveness Grants help close America's competitiveness gap and prepare American students for the high-paying, high-skill jobs that drive the 21st century economy. I fought hard to pass this worthy program, and I'm proud we were able to boost funding levels to provide low-income students real incentives to pursue time-intensive math and science degrees. This legislation is a critical national security tool that will also sustain America's global legacy as a land of innovation, imagination, and initiative." 
   SMART Grants provide eligible low-income students: 
   * $4,000 grants per year to students who major in math, science, engineering, technology or foreign languages critical to national security during their third and fourth years of study at a higher education institution. 
   Academic Competitiveness Grants provide eligible low-income students: 
   * $750 grants to first year students who complete a rigorous high school program; and 
   * $1,300 grants to second year students who completed a rigorous high school program and maintain a 3.0 GPA in college. 
   To be eligible for a SMART Grant, a student must qualify for a federal Pell Grant and enroll in an eligible postsecondary academic program as determined by the Secretary of Education. The SMART Grant program and Academic Competitiveness programs together are authorized at $3.75 billion over five years and are paid for with program savings included in the budget deficit reduction bill.
