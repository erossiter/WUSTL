SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD NEW AIR SERVICE INTO NASHVILLE, KNOXVILLE
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded Independence Air's decision to begin air service from Nashville and Knoxville, TN, into the Washington D.C. Dulles Airport.  
 Knox County Mayor Mike Ragsdale and Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam announced the additional service for Knoxville at a press conference in Washington, DC earlier today. 
   "Independence Air's decision to provide service into two of Tennessee's fastest growing cities is good news for the state," said Frist. "Increased air travel means more opportunities to recruit and retain businesses, encourage tourism and economic growth, and improve air travel options for both Knoxville and Nashville. Additional low-fare service will provide more choices for air travelers going to our nation's Capitol and elsewhere." 
   "I appreciate Independence Air's investment in the Knoxville and Nashville communities and the entire state," Alexander said. "Increased airways mean better access to and from Tennessee and the rest of the world. These additional flights will give consumers more options and increase Nashville and Knoxville's visibility in the commuter marketplace." 
   Independence Air, formerly Atlantic Coast Airlines, was established on November 19, 2003. The low-fare airline will begin service to 35 destinations, with service start dates staggered over the next several months.
   Service to Nashville will begin on July 1, with six non-stop flights daily. After July 23, one additional non-stop flight will be added for Nashville, bringing it up to seven daily. Connections to 20 cities will be added later this summer. Knoxville service will begin on July 23, with six non-stop flights daily into Washington Dulles. Additionally, connections to 19 cities will be available later this summer.
