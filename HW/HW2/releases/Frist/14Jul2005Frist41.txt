SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON DEMOCRATS' BLATANT PARTISANSHIP
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after the Democratic leadership offered an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill:  
   "I'm offended by my colleagues' willingness to stage this partisan stunt in an effort to draw attention away from the issues that matter most to Americans. The Homeland Security Appropriations bill includes critical provisions that will keep America safe and our nation's borders secure. It is difficult to believe that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would prefer to waste taxpayers' time and money on a non-issue in an effort to score cheap political points. This amendment is frivolous, groundless and reflects the Democrats' willingness to value partisan politics over sound public policy. I urge my colleagues to reconsider their amendment, silence their partisan war chants and strike a tone of civility as we continue to address issues that truly matter to America's border, transit and homeland security."
