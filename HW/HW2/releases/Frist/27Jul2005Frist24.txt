SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPEALING DEATH TAX
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement regarding H.R. 8:  
   "Before the Senate adjourns for the August recess, I will file cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 8, The Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005. I expect the vote on cloture to occur when we return in September. As many of my colleagues know, this bill passed the House of Representatives in April by an overwhelming vote of 272-162. I hope this bill will find a similar level of support here in the Senate. 
   "The death tax is a vicious tax imposed on America's small businesses and families during a time of grieving and pain. It forces families to give up things their loved ones worked an entire lifetime to build. Eliminating this tax is a matter of principle. We must care for America's hardworking families by enabling them to retain their family's assets without paying a price."
