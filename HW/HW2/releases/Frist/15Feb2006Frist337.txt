SEN. FRIST HAILS UNANIMOUS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY NOMINEES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved President Bush's six nominees for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) also announced during today's hearing that he has lifted his hold on the TVA nominations:  
   "The committee's unanimous approval of these nominees is a testament to their outstanding qualifications. Each possesses the strong business skills, management expertise and record of accomplished leadership I envisioned when writing legislation to modernize TVA's Board of Directors. 
   "I'm pleased that I was able to work with Sen. Isakson and the nominees to alleviate his concerns. The establishment of a process that ensures the views of each state's residents are considered by the Board will strengthen TVA. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure the confirmation of these nominees by the full Senate as quickly as possible."
   Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that reformed TVA's management structure to bring it in line with other corporations of similar size and scope. As part of that legislation, the TVA Board of Directors was expanded from three full-time members to nine part-time members. 
   The Board nominees are: Susan Richardson Williams of Tennessee, William B. Sansom of Tennessee, Dennis Bottorff of Tennessee, Howard A. Thrailkill of Alabama, Robert M. Duncan of Kentucky and Donald DePriest of Mississippi.
