SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE HEARING ON FRANKLIN BATTLEFIELD LEGISLATION
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today regarding the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources National Parks Subcommittee hearing regarding the "Franklin National Battlefield Study Act," S. 955, which would initiate a feasibility study by the National Park Service to determine whether sites related to the Battle of Franklin should be included in the National Park System:  
   "Today's hearing highlighted the significance of the Franklin Battlefield in Tennessee's history," said Frist. "Preserving the Franklin Battlefield will allow us to teach future generations of Tennesseans about our storied past, and inspire us to create an even brighter future. Today's hearing was a step in the right direction towards preserving this central element of state history." 
   The legislation directs the National Park Service to conduct a study to determine the national significance of several sites connected to the Battle of Franklin, as well as the feasibility of including the sites within the National Park System. The study, which will take place over several years, will include input from state, local, and community organizations. The findings of the study will be reported back to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Resources. 
   Senator Frist is sponsoring this legislation along with Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and identical legislation, H.R. 1972, has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Reps. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Lincoln Davis (D-TN).
