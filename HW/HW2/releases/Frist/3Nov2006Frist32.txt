SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON JOB GROWTH
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the U.S. Department of Labor announced the latest job numbers: 
   "The United States is currently experiencing one of the longest periods of sustained economic expansion and job creation in our nation's history. While Democrats will work to roll back the Bush tax cuts causing a 58% tax increase for the average American family, Republican economic policies are encouraging investment and new employment by putting valuable dollars back into the hands of hardworking Americans."
