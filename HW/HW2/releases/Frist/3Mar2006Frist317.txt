SEN. FRIST PRAISES UNANIMOUS SENATE CONFIRMATION OF TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY NOMINEES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Senate unanimously confirmed President Bush's six nominees to serve as members of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:  
   "Given the strong entrepreneurial skills and management background of these new Board members, I am confident they will serve TVA's ratepayers well. 
   Their business experience and expertise will allow TVA to achieve the tremendous success I envisioned when designing the new Board structure. My work on this issue has traveled a long road over the last nine years, and I am extremely gratified by the confirmation of these highly qualified individuals."
   With revenues of over $7 billion a year, TVA is the nation's largest public power company. Frist authored and secured passage of legislation that restructured the Board to meet 21st century challenges and reflect the management organization of similar corporations. That legislation expanded the Board from three full-time members to nine part-time members. 
   The new Board members are Susan Richardson Williams of Tennessee, William B. Sansom of Tennessee, Dennis Bottorff of Tennessee, Howard A. Thrailkill of Alabama, Robert M. Duncan of Kentucky and Donald DePriest of Mississippi. 
   Once sworn in, they will establish a quorum on the restructured Board, elect a new Board chairman and hire a Chief Executive Officer.
