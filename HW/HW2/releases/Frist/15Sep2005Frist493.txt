SEN. FRIST DENOUNCES DEMOCRATS' REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Government has no graver responsibility than protecting the lives of American citizens. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we saw government, at all levels, fail her citizens. It is the duty and responsibility of Congress to investigate what went wrong, in order to know what changes need to be made and to keep this from ever happening again.  
   "This Congress will step up to this important responsibility. Under the proposal I gave Senator Reid, we would appoint a select committee with the members of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. The powers and rules of the committee would be the very same as those adopted on a bipartisan basis by the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. 
   "And while Senator Reid says he prefers to let the Homeland Security Committee lead the investigation, and will continue to support the committee's efforts, he somehow feels a Select Committee made up of the Homeland Security members will somehow fail the American people. 
   "My proposal was modeled on some of the most serious investigations that Congress has ever undertaken: the 1973 Watergate Committee, the 1987 Iran Contra Committee, the 1994 and 1995 Whitewater Committees and the 1997 Campaign Finance investigation. Republicans in both the House and the Senate are prepared to fulfill our Constitutional obligations. 
   "The Democrats' boycott is irresponsible; it places partisan politics over finding answers for the American people. And we can't wait three years for those answers. We need them immediately so we can quickly make the changes and protect all Americans. 
   "In challenging times our country expects its leaders to work together, and not to engage in petty bickering. The American people deserve better."
