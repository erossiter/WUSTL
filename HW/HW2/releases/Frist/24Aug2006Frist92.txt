SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON IRAN'S REFUSAL TO HALT NUCLEAR PROGRAM
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding Iran's refusal to halt their nuclear enrichment program:  
   "Once again, Iran has proven its intransigence by rejecting the demands of the international community. We cannot reward Iran's defiance by acquiescing in its attempt to water down the demands of the UN Security Council. 
   "When Iran says it will only negotiate the future of its nuclear program 'without preconditions,' what it means is it will negotiate only if it is allowed to continue enrichment of weapons grade uranium. Negotiating with Iran on this basis would be pure folly. With no incentive to abandon its nuclear program, Iran would make every effort to prolong negotiations until it succeeds in developing a nuclear bomb." 
   Tehran was offered a generous package of inducements including trade and direct dialogue with the United States. The lynch pin of that offer was verifiable suspension of Iran's aggressive drive toward weapons grade uranium through an ever more sophisticated enrichment program. This was not an American demand, but a demand made in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1696. 
   Iran has left the Security Council with no choice but to follow through on its commitment in operative paragraph 8 of Resolution 1696 "to adopt appropriate measures under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to persuade Iran to comply" with the resolution.
