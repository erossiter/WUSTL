SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER PRAISE $5.2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR SMALLER LEARNING COMMUNITIES PROGRAM IN NASHVILLE HIGH SCHOOLS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today applauded the U.S. Department of Education for awarding a $5.2 million grant to Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools to create and expand smaller learning communities within large high schools. The funding is for a period of five years.  
   "The benefits Nashville's high school students can derive from this grant are limitless," Frist said. "We must constantly seek to improve the education resources available to our young people, and I'm proud that Middle Tennessee will enjoy the advantages of the Smaller Learning Communities Program." 
   "We should always be looking for ways to improve our nation's high schools," Alexander said. "I am pleased that this grant will help Nashville schools lead the way in further exploring the idea of smaller learning communities." 
   The Smaller Learning Communities Program, part of the No Child Left Behind Act, promotes academic achievement through the creation or expansion of small, safe, and successful learning environments in large public high schools. 
   Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools will direct the funding to eight of its largest high schools, which will create targeted "Freshman Academies" for 9th graders and "Career/Thematic Academies" for 10th and 12th graders
