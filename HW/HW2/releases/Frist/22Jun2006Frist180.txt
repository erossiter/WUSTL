SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION PASSAGE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the FY2007 Defense Authorization bill: 
   "Today the Senate passed legislation critical to ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform have the vital resources they need to fight the Global War on Terror and protect our homeland. We're supporting our troops, who put their lives on the line for our nation and its freedom. By passing this legislation, We have voted to stay the course in Iraq, follow through on our commitments and reject the bad policy of early withdrawal of American troops."
   The Senate bill provides more than $517 billion for defense programs and emphasizes the priorities of combating terrorism, bolstering homeland defense, enhancing protection for deployed forces and improving quality of life for members of the armed forces and their families.
