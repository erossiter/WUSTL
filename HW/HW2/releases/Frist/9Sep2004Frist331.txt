SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $1 MILLION FOR MCMINNVILLE ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOURCE RESEARCH
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced $982,000 in grant funding for the McMinnville Electric System through the U.S. Dept. of Energy to research alternative fuel sources for electricity generation.  
   "I'm pleased that the Department of Energy has recognized the valuable work McMinnville is doing to explore alternative fuel sources," said Frist. "Alternative fuel sources could hold the key to cleaner air, improved health, and a lower dependency on foreign oil. This funding is a necessary and vital component to the further development and research of new fuel technologies, particularly McMinnville's work to reduce exhaust emissions." 
   "I appreciate the Department of Energy's commitment to researching and developing alternative means of fuel production," Alexander said. "I am especially pleased with this project because of its potential to reduce exhaust emissions. Knoxville, Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga are on the American Lung Association's list of Top 25 cities with the dirtiest air. Pollution damages our health, hurts economic growth and ruins the scenic beauty of our state. I applaud McMinnville for exploring this new technology." 
   The McMinnville Electric System will be researching the use of bio-diesel as an alternative fuel to petroleum-based diesel for electricity generation. The project will also evaluate the feasibility of using bio-diesel electrical generation and integrating a two-chamber catalytic reduction system that reduces exhaust such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide.
