SEN. FRIST LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF PATIENT SAFETY LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) this evening made the following statement after the Senate passed patient safety legislation.  
 The legislation enhances patient safety by providing incentives to encourage voluntary reporting of information and raises standards and expectations for continuous quality improvements. 
   "With nearly 100,000 deaths a year, medical errors needlessly take too many American lives. Approving meaningful patient safety legislation is long overdue. This bill will encourage doctors and nurses to report errors so that we can take the appropriate steps to avoid the same mistakes in the future. Unfortunately, the fear of unnecessary lawsuits has had a chilling effect on information sharing that could reduce errors and save lives. The House is expected to take up identical legislation next week and it's my hope we will then be able to send this critical legislation to the president."
