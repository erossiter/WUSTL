SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON IMPLEMENTING MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today submitted the following statement for the committee record at the Senate Finance Committee's hearing on "Implementing the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit:"  
   "For most of the 24 million Americans and 560,000 Tennesseans receiving coverage, the Medicare prescription drug program is working and providing real relief. Premiums are lower than expected and coverage is better than expected. As with any significant addition to a program of the magnitude of Medicare, there are real problems that will be fixed. By working together with the chairman, concerned colleagues and the Administration, we will ensure every Medicare beneficiary is well served by their coverage. However, I will fight any action that jeopardizes the program and the health care security seniors and Americans with disabilities need and deserve."
