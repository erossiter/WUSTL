REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE 'GAS PRICE RELIEF AND REBATE ACT' TO ADDRESS NATION'S ENERGY NEEDS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today joined members of the Senate Republican Conference in announcing new legislation to address rising gas prices and America's long-term energy needs. 
   The "Gas Price Relief and Rebate Act," which includes a $100 gas tax holiday rebate, will be introduced today. A fact sheet regarding the legislation is attached.
   "Consumers are feeling pain at the pump, and Republicans are moving aggressively to address their concerns," Frist said. "We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic exploration, improving our energy infrastructure and continuing to encourage conservation. I call on Senate Democrats to work with us to relieve the pain drivers feel at the pump. Democratic obstruction has stifled domestic energy production, and current Democratic finger pointing not only obscures their record, but does nothing to help consumers now. Our plan, however, does."
