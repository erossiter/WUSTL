SEN. FRIST PRAISES DEFEAT OF FILIBUSTER
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Today, a bipartisan majority of Senators embraced the principle of a fair, up-or-down vote for judicial nominees and rejected partisan obstruction. This vote marks another step forward in restoring fairness to the judicial nominations process. 
   "Without question Judge Alito has the professional qualifications, judicial temperament and integrity that America expects in a Supreme Court Justice. And tomorrow a majority of my colleagues will confirm what the majority of Americans already know: that Judge Alito deserves to be Justice Alito."
