SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON AGRICULTURE SECRETARY VENEMAN'S RESIGNATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, the first ever woman to head the Department of Agriculture, departs her job at a time of record farm income. Under her leadership, agriculture exports are at a record high and our food supply remains the safest in the world. Even despite personal challenges, she has managed the Department through the mad cow episode, implementation of a new farm bill, and a major new initiative - the Healthy Forests Initiative - designed to protect our forests against devastating wildfires. She has earned our nation's respect, and will be missed by the Administration and everyone who has had the opportunity to work with her."
