SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S SPEECH
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today regarding President Bush's speech outlining his strategy for success in Iraq:  
   "Some Democrats have been playing politics with the war in Iraq for partisan political gain. Today we saw real leadership. In his speech the president clearly and concisely laid out a plan for success in Iraq. He also highlighted the steady progress we are making in concert with the Iraqi people. By engaging all Iraqi citizens in the democratic process, securing areas now in enemy control and installing new economic infrastructure we are empowering the Iraqi people and allowing for a safe and successful transition to a peaceful, stable and permanent government. By looking past the rhetoric and examining the results on the ground, it's clear that we continue to make progress on the political, security and economic fronts, and that as Iraq progresses, so does our strategy. Creating a secure and sustainable democracy in Iraq is a challenge we will meet, and a goal we must achieve for us to win the global War on Terror."
