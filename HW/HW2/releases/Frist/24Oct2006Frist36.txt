SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER PRAISE DOE FUNDING FOR OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today made the following statements after the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) will receive $4.5 million for hydrogen fuel cell research and development:  
   "I'm proud that ORNL continues to be at the forefront of groundbreaking research into alternative energy sources," Frist said. "Clean and efficient hydrogen fuel cells hold the promise of helping to move America towards energy independence. For the sake of our national security, the United States must pursue a long term energy policy that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil from dangerous and unstable parts of the world. Finding alternative ways to fuel our cars and trucks is key to the success of that strategy." 
   "As renewable energy research and development evolves, I am pleased that Tennesseans are leading the way and congratulate the researchers at Oak Ridge who developed this proposal," Alexander said. "Today's announcement further highlights the important work that is taking place at ORNL to meet our nation's energy needs in a responsible and forward thinking manner." 
   DOE announced today that it will fund 25 cost-shared hydrogen research and development projects for an approximate total of $127 million ($100 million DOE cost; $27 million applicant cost) over four years (Fiscal Years 2007 - 2010). These projects support the President's Advanced Energy Initiative, which seeks to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy through the research, development and deployment of transformational new clean energy technologies.
