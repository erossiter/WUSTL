SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF WAR ON TERROR SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill conference report:  
   "I'm proud of today's passage of the War on Terror supplemental conference report. We must do everything we can to support our armed forces in their efforts to protect our country, defeat terrorism and bring the light of freedom to dark corners of the world. 
   "This legislation guarantees that our military personnel will have the equipment and resources they need to get the job done, and that our State Department personnel are able to conduct our foreign policy effectively. It also includes valuable provisions that will ensure our homeland remains safe and secured against outside threats. 
   "In particular, I'm pleased by the inclusion of guaranteed funding for prevention and response measures against biological threats, including a potential outbreak of avian flu. These forward-thinking provisions will help prepare and protect our nation from the dangerous threats posed by avian flu and other forms of biohazards and infectious diseases. 
   "Our brave men and women in uniform will not relent in their fight against terror, and we must not relent in our support of them. I'm glad that the House and Senate were able to move so swiftly on this legislation, and look forward to President Bush signing this bill into law."
