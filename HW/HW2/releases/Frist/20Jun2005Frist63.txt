SEN. FRIST CALLS ON SEN. DURBIN TO APOLOGIZE FOR COMMENTS, URGES DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP TO JOIN CALL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today called on Sen.  
 Dick Durbin (D-IL) to apologize and withdraw his comments made on the Senate floor comparing U.S. soldiers' handling of prisoners at Guantanamo to the actions taken years ago by 'Nazis, and Soviets in their Gulags'. 
   "In captivity at Guantanamo are murderers ... many dangerous murderers. They are in jail cells - where they belong ... and NOT on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan ... or on the streets of Nashville, Boston, Miami or New York. 
   "I'm extremely disappointed by Senator Durbin's comments comparing U.S. soldiers' handling of prisoners to the actions taken by Nazis and Soviets in their Gulags. Not one prisoner has been murdered while in custody at Guantanamo. 
   "I call upon Senator Durbin to withdraw his comments and provide an appropriate apology. I would hope that Senate Minority Leader Reid, House Minority Leader Pelosi, Howard Dean and the rest of the Democratic leadership call on Senator Durbin to formally apologize. 
   "Shameful does not begin to describe this heinous slander against our country ... and the brave men and women risking their lives every day to defend it."
