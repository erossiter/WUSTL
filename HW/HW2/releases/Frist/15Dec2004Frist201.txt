SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF LEAVITT AS HHS SECRETARY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Michael O. Leavitt as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services: 
   "Michael Leavitt is an outstanding candidate for Secretary of Health and Human Services. As governor of Utah for over a decade, he developed a reputation as a thoughtful, technology-savvy leader who was able to cut costs while expanding access to government services. During his tenure, he authored the Healthprint program and worked in a bipartisan way to ensure it passed into law. This landmark initiative created a system with greater flexibility, lower costs and expanded coverage for all Utahans; including an overall increase of 400,000 citizens with health insurance. 
   "Mr. Leavitt has consistently proven himself as a thoughtful, visionary public servant who is focused on results and enacting sustainable solutions. As Chief Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he implemented tougher, more comprehensive regulations for clean air, ozone protection and mercury standards. Mr. Leavitt also has experience protecting the homeland, including helping to oversee the safety and security of the Olympic Winter Games in Utah in 2002, and serving as a member of the Homeland Security Policy Council. 
   "Michael Leavitt's experiences as Governor and with the EPA uniquely qualify him for the responsibilities and obligations of serving as President Bush's top health care administrator. He is an outstanding candidate for Secretary of Health & Human Services, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through Congress."
