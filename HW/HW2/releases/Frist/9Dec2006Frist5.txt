SEN. FRIST HAILS FINAL APPROVAL OF MEDICAID DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE PAYMENTS FOR TENNESSEE
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate approved final passage of the Tax Extenders Act (H.R. 6111), a bill that ensures Tennessee will receive Medicaid Disproportionate Share (DSH) payments in 2007: 
 "This funding greatly benefits our continuing battle to improve all Tennesseans' health care quality," Frist said. "I've dedicated significant attention to bolstering Tennessee's health care safety net throughout the last 12 years. Restoration of our state's DSH payments marks an important milestone in that effort." 
 Medicaid DSH payments strengthen states' health care safety nets by providing additional financial support to those hospitals treating disproportionately high numbers of low-income Medicaid and uninsured patients. 
 The House has already passed the legislation, which now goes to the President for his signature.
