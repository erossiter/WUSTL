SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $1.6 MILLION GRANT FOR ANDERSON COUNTY HEAD START PROGRAMS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Anderson County Board of Education has received a $1.6 million grant through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support Head Start programs in Anderson County. 
   "I applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for providing this critical funding for Anderson County's Head Start program," said Frist. "Head Start has proven itself as a catalyst for educational development of young children. This funding will support services that greatly improve the quality of life for children in Anderson County." 
   "This is important funding for Anderson County's most precious resource, our children," Alexander said. "I look forward to working with Senator Frist to continue strengthening this valuable program." 
   The funding will include $1,696,155 for the Anderson County Board of Education for Head Start programs throughout the community. 
   The Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs which serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
