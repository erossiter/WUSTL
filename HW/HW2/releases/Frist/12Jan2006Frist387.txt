SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER MEMPHIS POST OFFICE FRONT STREET STATION TO UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS SCHOOL OF LAW
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today announced that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has agreed to sell the Memphis Post Office Front Street Station so that the University of Memphis School of Law can establish its new campus at the facility.  
 The announcement took place during a meeting between Sen. Frist; John E. Potter, Postmaster General and CEO of the USPS; Shirley Raines, President of the University of Memphis; John Stokes, Chairman of the Memphis Riverfront Development Corporation; and Sara Hall, City Attorney for Memphis.
   "This is a great day for the city of Memphis and the students who will benefit from this exciting new project now and in the future," Frist said. "The University of Memphis School of Law is one of the finest law schools in the mid-South, and its graduates have achieved outstanding bar exam success rates.
   "The historic Front Street Station is a beautiful building with great prominence on the Memphis riverfront, and given its proximity to the courthouses and law offices downtown, it's a natural location for the University's law school. 
   "I appreciate the tremendous leadership of Postmaster General Jack Potter, who has personally worked with me, the city of Memphis, and University officials to broker an agreement on the building transfer. I also commend the University of Memphis President Shirley Raines, John Stokes and the Riverfront Development Commission, and Mayor Herenton for their foresight and persistence during these negotiations." 
   The University of Memphis has been involved in negotiations with the USPS since March 2005 in an effort to acquire the old downtown Post Office building for the law school. Senator Frist has been a close partner to the negotiations and helped broker the final agreement.
