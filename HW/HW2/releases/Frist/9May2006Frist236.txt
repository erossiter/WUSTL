SEN. FRIST URGES FAIR, UP-OR-DOWN VOTE ON KAVANAUGH
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate Judiciary Committee held its second hearing on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals: 
   "We need more qualified nominees on the bench who practice judicial restraint and respect the rule of law, and Brett Kavanaugh fits that description. His forthcoming and candid responses before the Senate Judiciary Committee today further confirm that he will be the kind of fair and independent judge America expects in its courtrooms. I look forward to the Committee reporting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate on Thursday so that we can give him the fair, up-or-down vote he's been waiting on for three years."
