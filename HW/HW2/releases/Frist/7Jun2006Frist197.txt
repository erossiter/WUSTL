SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR REPUDIATION OF U.N. OFFICIAL'S REMARKS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on UN Deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown's remarks about the United States:  
   "I was deeply disappointed to hear of Mr. Malloch Brown's remarks today. His statements about the United States Government and the American people were unfairly critical and completely inaccurate. For a senior official at the United Nation to criticize the United States and cast aspersions on the intelligence of the American people is unacceptable. I call on Mr. Malloch Brown and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to publicly repudiate these condescending remarks."
