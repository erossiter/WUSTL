SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON TRIA EXTENSION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today:  
   "This extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is a targeted and narrow measure that will have minimized impact on our markets. The federal government cannot be a long-term substitute for market-based solutions. The bill the Senate passed today takes another step towards reducing taxpayers' risk and minimizing the government's interference with the private market. I'm proud of all the hard work that went into crafting this extension, and am confident that this last and final extension will allow the private insurance market to stabilize so they can fully regain their footing in the marketplace."
