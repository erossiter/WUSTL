SEN. FRIST URGES CALM IN WAKE OF SAVAGE BOMBING OF GOLDEN MOSQUE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the unrest in Iraq after the bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of the holiest sites of Shi'a Islam: 
   "I strongly condemn the savage bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, and extend my deepest sympathies to the Iraqi people for this terrible tragedy. 
   "It is clear that this is the brutal work of terrorists who aim to drive Iraq into sectarian strife and civil war. These terrorists offer no hopeful future for the Iraqi people and have proven once again that they only seek to deny freedom, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Iraq. 
   "I urge the Iraqi people to remain calm and exercise restraint in the wake of this barbaric act, and call for the Iraqi government to unify all Iraqis against the terrorist enemy by quickly reaching consensus on a new government and considering improvements to the constitution. Violence and unrest will only serve the interests of the terrorists. 
   "I share President Bush's sentiment to work with the Iraqi people to rebuild the Golden Mosque of Samarra, and the United States will continue to support the Iraqi people and their new democracy in their fight for freedom and prosperity."
