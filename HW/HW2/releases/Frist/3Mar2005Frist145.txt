SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on a resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday which is expected to pass by unanimous consent later tonight:  
   "For 40 years, the events surrounding Bloody Sunday have reminded Americans of our nation's shameful past and burned in our psyche a vision for a brighter future. The Civil Rights marchers who stood in the face of bigotry and hate at the Edmund Pettus Bridge are an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere. I'm humbled by the bravery and commitment of those men and women who literally sacrificed their lives to stand up for what they knew to be right. 
   "We must not only remember this historic event, but also commemorate its role in the creation of a more just society, and appreciate the ways in which it has inspired other movements around the world. I'm proud of today's Senate resolution, and confident that by commemorating the sacrifices made by our Civil Rights leaders, we can work to ensure our nation will forever cherish equality, hope and freedom for all its citizens." 
   On Sunday, March 6, Senator Frist will join Congressional colleagues on a Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama where he will participate in a commemorative march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Frist was honored to join Congressman John Lewis (D-GA) last year in leading a delegation of Senators on the pilgrimage.
