SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF TAX RELIEF AND HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2006
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006:  
 "Just when everyone bet against us, Republicans put together a broad package of energy, tax, trade and health care measures. 
 "I thank Congress for working so diligently to pass this crucial piece of legislation so that taxes stay low, trade remains free, and doctors keep healing. I am also pleased that this package will open more than 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to energy production, which will help to make America more energy independent and will lower energy costs for consumers." 
 The bill includes measures that would promote technological innovation through the R&D tax credit, assist middle income families with sales tax deductibility, and help physicians working under Medicare, among other things. 
 One of the most significant components of the package is the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which will increase domestic energy production by more than 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas leasing. This measure will lower oil and natural gas prices for American consumers, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and preserve jobs here in America. The area opened under this bill is estimated to contain 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
