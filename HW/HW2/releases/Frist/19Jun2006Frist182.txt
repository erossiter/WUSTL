SEN. FRIST PRAISES CONTINUED PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate confirmed Sandra Ikuta to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals: 
   "Today, the Senate confirmed another qualified judicial nominee to the federal bench. Sandra Ikuta's confirmation to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals demonstrates that the United States Senate is committed to ensuring that qualified judicial nominees get a fair up-or-down vote. By standing on principle, the Senate is moving forward to fill the vacancies on our nation's federal courts."
   Currently 94.7% of all judgeships are filled, including 91.1% of all circuit court judgeships and 95.7% of all district court judgeships.

Overall, the Senate has confirmed 88% of President Bush's judicial nominees, giving him the highest confirmation rate of federal judges since President Reagan.
