SEN. FRIST HAILS JUNE JOB FIGURES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced that the economy continued to grow last month: 
   "Today's figures highlight our economy's continued growth and expansion, but we need to do more to help average Americans with the cost of living. That's why Senate Republicans want to continue to move forward on issues like health care, energy, tax relief and keeping America safe."
