SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON RELEASE OF AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S 'WELL-QUALIFIED' RATING OF JUDGE SAM ALITO
  U.S Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Judge Alito is right on track to become Justice Alito, and today's announcement of the ABA rating demonstrates what an overwhelming majority of Americans already believe, that Judge Sam Alito is unquestionably well-qualified to serve on our nation's highest court. Judge Alito has the professional qualifications, integrity, and judicial temperament that America's judiciary deserves. I expect the Senate to join together to ensure that Judge Alito receives a fair and civil confirmation process, and I'm committed to bringing his nomination to the floor of the United States Senate for a fair up-or-down vote on January 20th."
