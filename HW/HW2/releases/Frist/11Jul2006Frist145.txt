   "I condemn the bomb attacks that occurred earlier today in the Indian city of Mumbai. The bombings of the city's transit system during the evening rush hour were cowardly and barbaric acts against innocent civilians. On behalf of my Senate colleagues and the American people, I express my deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and to the people of India. We will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian people and India's government in order to bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice."
