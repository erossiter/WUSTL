SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON JOINT HEARING BEFORE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEES ON ENERGY PRICES, PROFITS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the Senate Commerce and Energy committees' joint hearing on energy pricing and profits: 
   "I asked the Energy and Commerce Committees to hold this joint hearing in order to answer the question that is on the minds of Americans across the country: why are we paying more than ever to fill up our cars and heat our homes at the same time that the oil companies are posting record profits? 
   "The executives who testified today discussed many of the challenges that we face as a nation in terms of tight energy supplies, increasing demand around the world, and the devastating impact of the recent Gulf Coast hurricanes on our energy infrastructure. 
   "They did not, however, adequately answer the question of whether the sky-high gas prices we saw earlier this fall were entirely justified, and whether their companies' profit margins are appropriate given the hardships energy consumers are facing and will continue to face this winter. 
   "I will continue to work with Chairman Domenici and Chairman Stevens, as well as all of my colleagues, to determine what steps Congress can take to increase our energy security and bring prices down. 
   "In addition, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN), will continue to investigate whether any price gouging occurred in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. If they find that any business took advantage of those disasters to enrich themselves at the expense of American consumers, we will act swiftly to respond."
