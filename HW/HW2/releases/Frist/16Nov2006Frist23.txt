SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER PRAISE PASSAGE OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which the Senate passed this week, includes nearly $200 million to support military construction projects across Tennessee. 
  "Improving the wellbeing of the brave men and women who serve in our armed forces is of the utmost importance," Frist said. "As we continue to wage the War on Terror, I'm pleased the Senate has acted to provide this strong support to military installations across Tennessee."
  "The needs of our nation's military must be met and this bill improves the training, support and quality of life for our troops," Alexander said. "They make great sacrifices each and every day to protect our freedom, and it is our duty to provide them and their families with the best, most efficient services, housing and health care. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that our soldiers, Reserve and Guard forces, and veterans have the support they deserve."
  Key Tennessee projects funded in the Senate version of the FY07 Military Construction Appropriations bill include: 
  * $1.1 million for the Tennessee Army National Guard Headquarters to begin planning and design of the new property and fiscal office. This project will add much needed facility space to adequately house the property, fiscal functions and administrative needs of the Tennessee Army National Guard.
  * $23.7 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard for projects at the Memphis International Airport. Of this, $4.3 million will go to replace the C-5 fire/crash rescue station, and $10 million will go to replace the C-5 squadron operations and simulator facility. 
  * $11.2 million for the McGhee Tyson Air National Guard main gate access point, which will provide greater force protection and meet the Department of Defense's anti-terrorism force protection standards. Funding will be used to relocate the existing main gate access control point and improve access for soldiers and civilians arriving or exiting the installation, 
  * $148 million for Fort Campbell to complete eight construction projects. Of the funding, $24.5 million will be used to continue construction of a new group operations complex for the 5th Special Forces Group, $76 million will help construct new barracks facilities, and $24.4 million assist in the construction of a new battle command training center 
  * $11.8 million for construction of a new warrior rehabilitation and fitness center at Fort Campbell. The facility will improve the quality of life for the military personnel returning from combat operations.
  The bill must now be considered by a joint House and Senate conference committee.
