SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS ASSASSINATION OF RAFIK HARIRI
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in an attack in Beirut on Monday:  
   "I was shocked to hear of this brutal attack on Prime Minister Hariri and mourn his loss. Rafik Hariri fought long and hard for Lebanon's sovereignty and independenceHe worked tirelessly to achieve freedom and prosperity for the Lebanese people and served his country with distinction. 
   "This tragedy is a consequence of the instability in Lebanon caused by the presence of Syrian troops. I call on the Syrian government to comply with its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its forces from Lebanese territory, free the Lebanese people of foreign occupation, and allow forthcoming elections to take place without undue outside influence or interference. 
   "The Lebanese people deserve the freedom to determine their own future free of violence, intimidation and foreign occupation. I stand by them in their continued efforts to realize Prime Minister Hariri's dream of a free and prosperous Lebanon." 
   In September 2004 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1559 calling for a withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. This resolution reaffirmed the international community's call for the respect of Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.
