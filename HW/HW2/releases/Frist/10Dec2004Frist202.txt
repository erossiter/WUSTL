  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Samuel Wright Bodman as the next Secretary of Energy:  
   "Samuel Bodman is an ideal candidate for Secretary of Energy. In his capacity as a Deputy Secretary in both the Treasury and Commerce Departments, Mr. Bodman has proven himself as a committed public servant who understands the importance of crafting responsible and fiscally sound public policy. His work in the public and private sectors, as well as academia, has given him the skills necessary for actualizing the President's vision for a secure and affordable energy supply. Mr. Bodman is an outstanding candidate for Secretary of Energy, and I look forward to seeing his nomination move quickly through Congress."
