SEN. FRIST PRAISES JUDGE ALITO ON THOROUGH, RESPONSIVE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONNAIRE, DISMISSES DESPERATION TACTICS OF ALITO OPPONENTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today:  
   "Judge Alito's nomination took another step forward today. His thorough, responsive answers to the Judiciary Committee questionnaire further confirm that Judge Alito deserves to serve on the Supreme Court. His answers highlight his extensive legal career devoted to public service and his philosophy of 'judicial self-discipline' grounded in respect for precedent and a thoughtful appreciation of the limited role of a judge under our Constitution. 
   "Judge Alito's questionnaire and his 15 years and more than 300 cases on the bench reveal a lot more about this brilliant jurist than any individual memo, including the Thornburgh memo released today. The American people see through the alarmist, desperation tactics that have been employed unsuccessfully to distort Judge Alito's record. 
   "As majority leader, I am pleased that Judge Alito's nomination remains on track for a fair up or down vote in January."
