SEN. FRIST URGES COMPLETION OF TAX RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement urging completion of the tax reconciliation conference report:  
   "Members have been hard at work on the tax reconciliation conference report. Both Chairman Grassley and Chairman Thomas share my passion to extend lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends so that we can continue to see strong economic growth and healthy job creation in years to come. As April 15 comes near and we are all reminded of the tax burdens Americans face, I urge the conference to quickly conclude its work and send the Speaker and me legislation to pass and send to the President."
