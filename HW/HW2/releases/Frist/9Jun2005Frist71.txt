SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS CONFIRMATION OF WILLIAM PRYOR TO 11TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today made the following statement after Senate confirmation of William Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit:  
   "William Pryor's record consistently proves his unwavering dedication to the protection of individual liberties and his commitment to treating all people equally. I applaud his confirmation to the federal bench; he's an outstanding jurist who will interpret and not write the law. 
   "As the debate on judicial nominees this week has shown, we can disagree on whether individual nominees deserve confirmation while agreeing on the principle that each nominee deserves an up or down vote. And I call upon my colleagues to harness the momentum generated this week to ensure the Senate continues to function on the principle of fair up or down votes for all judicial nominees."
