SEN. FRIST MOURNS PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "Coretta Scott King inspired generations of Americans to realize the American dream of freedom and equality for all. Meeting with her, I felt her warmth and genuineness - she was a trailblazer and true messenger of peace.
   "Coretta Scott King and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. inspired a nation to reach for its highest ideals. And while we say goodbye to Mrs. King today, we must honor her life by working toward the shared vision of an American society that values individual freedom, equality and content of character above all else. Though her presence will be missed, her message will stay with us forever."
