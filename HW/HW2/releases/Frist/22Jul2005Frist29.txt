SEN. FRIST'S COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR STEVENSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPEALING DEATH TAX
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's Communication Director Bob Stevenson today made the following statement regarding H.R. 8:  
   "After consultation with colleagues, and based on the current situation, the majority leader currently intends to begin the process of bringing the Senate to a final vote on death tax repeal next week. 
   "The death tax is a cruel and unfair burden inflicted on America's small businesses and families during a time of grieving and pain. At its core, the death tax punishes families by forcing them to give up things that deceased loved ones worked their entire lifetimes to build. Wiping this tax from the books is a matter of principle. We should protect - not punish - hardworking families by enabling them to retain their loved ones' assets without paying a price."
