SEN. FRIST RELEASES SOCIAL SECURITY STAFF STUDY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today released a staff study comparing the rates of return in the current Social Security program with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) that has been a core component of the Federal Government's retirement program for almost two decades.  
   "Voluntary personal savings accounts would enable future retirees to harness the power of the marketplace when saving for their retirements," said Frist. "The success of the TSP program proves that personal accounts merit consideration as we discuss strengthening Social Security. As the study's results reflect, federal workers who participate in their voluntary savings program have more than double a rate of return on their investments compared to the returns from money paid directly into Social Security. The information in this study underscores the compelling case for integration of personal savings accounts into any Social Security modernization plan." 
   The results of the staff study are available at http://frist.senate.gov/_files/SocialSecurity1.pdf.
