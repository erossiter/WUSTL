SENS. FRIST, LUGAR, BIDEN INTRODUCE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION ENLARGEMENT LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after joining with Sens. Lugar (R-Ind.), Biden (D-Del.), Smith (R-Ore.) and McCain (R-Ariz.) to introduce legislation supporting the admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia and Macedonia to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO): 
   "For more than 50 years, the NATO has served as a force for stability, security, and peace in Europe. It remains the foundation of security on the Continent and the cornerstone of U.S. engagement in Europe. Today it is the key institution helping to secure a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.
   "NATO has contributed to the democratic transition of our former adversaries in Central and Eastern Europe by fostering the development of new, strong, and democratic allies capable of contributing to our common security goals. NATO's enlargement over the past decade has strengthened the strongest alliance in history and helped spread democracy and liberty. For this reason, we must keep the door to NATO accession open for others.
   "Today, I'm proud to introduce legislation along with Senators Lugar, Biden, Smith, and McCain expressing the Senate's support for the accession of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia to NATO. I welcome the progress made by these countries in implementing the political, economic, and military reforms needed to qualify for NATO membership. Each of these countries has made substantive contributions to peace and stability in the region and has demonstrated a desire for closer integration into this institution.
   "The United States will continue to work with these countries as they institute the necessary reforms to join the Alliance. And, I look forward to the day when Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia become America's NATO allies, and the most successful alliance in history becomes even stronger."
