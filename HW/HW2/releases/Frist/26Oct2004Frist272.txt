SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD NEARLY $2.8 MILLION HEAD START GRANT FOR FAYETTEVILLE
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded a $2,799,463 grant through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the South Central Human Resource Agency Head Start program in Fayetteville, TN.  
   "Meaningful educational experiences early in life can inspire children to be passionate about learning and developing new skills," said Frist. "This funding will help Head Start programs in Fayetteville ensure that Tennessee's children are given every opportunity to lead successful, productive lives." 
   "Head Start programs have been beneficial to both communities and participants across Tennessee," Alexander said. "I'm very happy to see this investment in Fayetteville's children by the Department of Health and Human Services, and I look forward to working with Senator Frist and my colleagues in the Senate to strengthen this valuable program." 
   The Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
