SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S RETIREMENT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her decision to retire from the Supreme Court bench:  
   "For over twenty-three years, Justice O'Connor has been one of the Supreme Court's finest justices. As the first female Justice, this simple 'cowgirl from Arizona' has been a trailblazer for women and rightfully earned her place in history. She has served with distinction and dignity. 
   "During her confirmation hearing, she emphasized that the court's role was to interpret the law and not to make public policy. Her record demonstrates that she has lived up to that commitment - respecting the rule of law and judiciously interpreting the Constitution. 
   "I have nothing but respect for Sandra Day O'Connor and her tenure on the court. As we consider her replacement, it's important that we remember her legacy. America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to equal justice under the law. I'm confident that the president will select a qualified replacement justice who embodies these qualities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure a fair confirmation process in the Senate that will ensure the Supreme Court is at full strength to start its next term in October."
