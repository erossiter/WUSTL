SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF PATRIOT ACT, HIGHLIGHTS INCLUSION OF ANTI-METH LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the Patriot Act conference report:  
   "The Patriot Act conference report provides us with a measured and effective tool that appropriately balances the constitutional rights of all Americans against our need to effectively investigate and halt potential terrorist attacks. Our actions today will help dismantle terror organizations and stop our enemies in their tracks. This legislation includes sensible, measured provisions that tear down antiquated walls to promote information-sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and levels the playing field so we can effectively harness all our resources to defeat terror. 
   "I also want to highlight the inclusion of the Combat Meth Act in this legislation. This initiative has been a personal priority of mine, and I'm proud that we've been able to secure its passage. Meth use is devastating communities in my home state of Tennessee and throughout the country. This vicious poison shreds communities, destroys families and is overwhelming law enforcement. That's why we've acted to pass this commonsense legislation that will make it harder for meth cooks to get the ingredients they need to make this highly addictive and destructive drug. 
   "I'm pleased today that the Senate has been able to broker and pass a meaningful compromise on the Patriot Act conference report. I hope my colleagues will opt to build off this momentum by burying their obstructionist ways and allowing the Senate to continue generating meaningful solutions to the issues that matter most to all Americans."
