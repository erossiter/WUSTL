SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF GUN LIABILITY LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate passed S. 397, the "Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act": 
   "This legislation brings meaningful reform to an industry that needs protection from frivolous lawsuits. Gun manufacturers employ thousands of Americans and provide critical supplies to our nation's police officers and military servicemembers. This narrow, commonsense and bipartisan measure will help end frivolous lawsuits that harm manufacturers and their employees while still protecting the rights of all Americans to sue for legitimate reasons - such as a gun manufacturer who knowingly breaks the law. America's crime problems will be solved not by unjustly targeting the gun industry for the criminal actions of others, but by targeting the unjust criminals. I'm proud the Senate has finally acted on this measured legislation that preserves and protects every American's constitutional rights by weeding out frivolous lawsuits by trial lawyers aimed at bankrupting an industry. Along with the class action and bankruptcy reform bills passed earlier this year, this legislation is another reflection of the Republican Congress' serious commitment to sensible tort reform."
