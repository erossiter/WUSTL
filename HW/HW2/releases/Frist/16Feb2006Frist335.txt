SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE TO IRAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the president's request, as articulated yesterday by Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, of $75 million to support democracy in Iran: 
   "I applaud President Bush for requesting additional significant assistance to aid the democratic reform movement in Iran. 
   "While the regime in Tehran continues to isolate itself and flout the will of the international community, the Iranian people have consistently voiced their desire for freedom and democracy. The United States adamantly opposes the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian government, but wholeheartedly supports the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people. 
   "In previous statements and articles, I have called for increased assistance to help encourage democracy in Iran, and today I am pleased that these funds are included in the president's request. The Iranian people have demonstrated their wish to rejoin the global community and end the isolation brought upon them by the regime. The United States Senate will continue to support the Iranian people's aspirations for freedom and democracy."
