SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY FUNDING FOR TENNESSEE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today applauded $580,000 in grant funding for community development projects in West Tennessee under the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) Federal Grant Program.  
   The DRA is a federal-state partnership serving a 240-county/parish area in an eight-state region. Led by a federal co-chairman and the governors of each participating state, the DRA is designed to remedy severe and chronic economic distress by stimulating economic development and fostering partnerships that will have a positive impact on the region's economy. 
   "This assistance represents valuable funding for projects that will promote commerce and industrial production, enhance infrastructure, and improve the health and well-being of local residents," Frist said. "I join Senator Alexander in appreciation of DRA's continued contribution to communities in Tennessee and throughout the Delta region." 
   "These are important investments in infrastructure and healthcare projects in Tennessee," said Alexander. "I am pleased to see the Delta Regional Authority's continued investment in Tennessee efforts to enhance transportation, assist growth and recruitment in the health care industry, and ensure clean water. Senator Frist and I applaud the hard work and support provided by the Delta Regional Authority to enhance the lives of Tennesseans and others throughout the Delta."
