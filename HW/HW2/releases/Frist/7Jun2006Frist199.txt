SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFEAT OF MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Marriage Protection Amendment was defeated by a cloture vote: 
   "For thousands of years, marriage - the union between a man and a woman -- has been recognized as an essential cornerstone of society. Forty-five states across the country, both red and blue, have acted to protect traditional marriage, but that hasn't stopped same-sex marriage activists from taking their campaigns to the courts, where overreaching liberal judges have consistently set aside the will of the people. We must continue fighting to ensure the Constitution is amended by the will of the people rather than by judicial activism."
