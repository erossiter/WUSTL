  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Chattanooga Human Services Department has received a $4.4 million grant through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support Early Head Start programs in Chattanooga schools.  
   "I applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for providing this critical funding for Chattanooga's Early Head Start program," said Frist. "Early Head Start has proven itself as a catalyst for educational development of young children. This funding will support services that greatly improve the quality of life for children in Chattanooga." 
   "This is important funding for Chattanooga's most precious resource, our children," Alexander said. "I look forward to working with Senator Frist to continue strengthening this valuable program." 
   The funding will include $4,406,343 for the Chattanooga Human Services Department for Early Head Start programs throughout the community.  
   The Early Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children.

They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
