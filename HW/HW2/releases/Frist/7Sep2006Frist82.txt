SEN. FRIST COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR COMMENTS ON YET ANOTHER DEMOCRAT POLITICAL STUNT
  Amy Call, Communications Director for U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after Democrat Judiciary Committee members blocked the mark up of Senator Specter's terrorist surveillance bill: 
   "The same day that the Democrats release their security agenda they pull a political stunt in the Judiciary Committee forcing a delay on Senator Specter's terrorist surveillance bill."
   "How can they claim they are for a security agenda while obstructing legislation that would make sure we can intercept terrorist communications before they can carry out their plots?"
