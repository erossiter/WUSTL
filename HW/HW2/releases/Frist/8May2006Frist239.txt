SEN. FRIST DENOUNCES DEMOCRAT OBSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the Medical Care Access Protection Act and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act:  
   "Five times in the last four years, Senate Democrats have obstructed meaningful medical liability reform that would have ensured access to quality, affordable health care. 
   "Frivolous lawsuits and excessive payouts force doctors out of business, drive up medical costs and ultimately jeopardize the health of all Americans. 
   "It's unfortunate that Democrats have chosen to help line the pockets of trial lawyers rather than to help meet the health care needs of this nation." 
   In February, Tennessee was officially designated one of 21 crisis states by the American Medical Association. Defensive medicine costs patients in Tennessee alone $2 billion annually, and 69 percent of Tennessee's doctors say they are considering early retirement in the face of malpractice insurance premiums that have skyrocketed 90 percent since 1999.
