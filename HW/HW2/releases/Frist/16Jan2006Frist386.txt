SEN. FRIST PREDICTS ALITO CONFIRMATION, LAYS OUT SENATE SCHEDULE AFTER LATEST DEMOCRATIC DELAY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "The Democrats' decision to delay Tuesday's Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Alito is unjustified and desperate partisan obstructionism. After answering 700 questions for over 18 hours before the Committee last week and enduring relentless personal attacks, Judge Alito deserves better. He has the exceptional qualifications, judicial temperament and integrity that America expects in a Supreme Court justice. Despite these tactics, Judge Alito remains on track to be confirmed as Justice Alito. A Justice delayed will not be a Justice denied. As I stated last week, as soon as the Judiciary Committee reports the nomination, the full Senate will begin debate on Judge Alito the next day and move swiftly to a fair up-or-down vote."
