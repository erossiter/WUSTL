SEN. FRIST CONGRATULATES NEW HONDURAN PRESIDENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the inauguration of Manuel Zelaya, who was elected President of Honduras in November 2005: 
   "I congratulate Manuel Zelaya on his recent election victory and inauguration as President of Honduras. I am hopeful that President Zelaya and the people of Honduras will continue to make progress in addressing pressing issues such as consolidating democratic norms and institutions, strengthening the rule of law and protection of human rights, and alleviating the economic distress faced by many in Honduras.
   "The United States and Honduras have a history of cooperative and friendly bilateral relations, and our two countries work closely together on numerous issues of mutual interest and concern. In particular, the DR-CAFTA bill, which President Bush signed into law last August, provides an opportunity to bolster the economic linkages between our two countries and increase opportunities for the Honduran people.
   "My colleagues and I in the United States Senate will support President Zalaya in his efforts to confront the challenges his country is facing. I congratulate him again on his election and on today's inauguration. I look forward to working with him to find ways to strengthen the US-Honduras bilateral relationship and to secure a bright and prosperous future for the people of Honduras."
