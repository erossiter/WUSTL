  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Africa Union (AU) requested logistical support from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for its mission in the Darfur region of Sudan:  
   "Today's news is a significant step in the right direction. I welcome the African Union's request for assistance. While we need to consider what that assistance might be, I'm hopeful that these discussions can generate meaningful action. I'm also hopeful that a partnership between NATO and the AU will help bring stability and restore order to this troubled region. Having personally visited Darfur refugees in the region, I realize how critical it is that the genocide be stopped. I'm encouraged by today's developments and look forward to the United States being deeply engaged in these talks."
