SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PROVISION TO EXTEND STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTION
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today praised the tax relief delivered to Tennessee by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (H.R. 6408). The bill extends the states sales tax deduction for two years and makes permanent a provision to protect songwriters from unfair taxes. House consideration of the legislation is scheduled to conclude today, and the Senate is scheduled to begin debate on the measure as soon as tomorrow.  
 "The sales tax deduction is a simple issue of fairness for Tennessee's taxpayers," Frist said. "I've battled this issue for Tennesseans throughout my two terms in the Senate. Between 1986 and 2004, we endured an injustice in the federal tax code - an inequality Congress correctly acted to right. I'm pleased this legislation ensures that our state will continue to receive fair treatment, and I look forward to sending it to the President for his signature soon." 
 The state sales tax deduction provides nearly $400 in tax relief for more than 530,000 families across Tennessee. Frist secured the deduction in 2004, but the provision expired last year and must be extended by Congress. 
 In addition, the bill makes permanent a Frist-authored provision recently signed into law by President Bush allowing songwriters to claim the capital gains tax rate on music sales, the same rate paid by their corporate partners. This change in the tax code reduces songwriters' tax burden by up to 35 percent.
