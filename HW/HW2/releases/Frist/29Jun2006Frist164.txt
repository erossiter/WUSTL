   "There's tremendous promise in stem cell research -- the promise of healing power. Whether it's diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, or spinal cord injuries, stem cells offer hope for treatment that other lines of research cannot. However, this research presents serious ethical questions that deserve discussion and deliberation. I'm pleased we can now move forward with a thoughtful debate on this issue."
