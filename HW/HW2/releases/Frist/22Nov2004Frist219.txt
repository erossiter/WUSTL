SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE ENERGY, WATER PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced Senate passage of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Omnibus Conference Report, which includes significant funding for Tennessee energy and water priorities.  
   "These projects will strengthen Tennessee's energy and water infrastructure and drive economic development throughout the state," said Frist. "This is an investment in Tennessee that will create jobs, inspire innovation and improve the quality of life for Tennessee families. It also supports Oak Ridge National Laboratory's ongoing commitment to scientific research. I'm pleased that so many Tennessee priorities were included in this conference report." 
   "This bill invests in the cutting-edge science happening at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory," said Alexander. "In addition to significant increases in energy programs at Oak Ridge, it makes critical investments in local flood control and water projects across the state. I am proud Congress could work together to fund these priorities for Tennessee."
