SEN. FRIST ENCOURAGED BY SEN. REID'S SUPPORT FOR ASBESTOS CLOTURE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Sen.  
 Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced his support for cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005: 
   "Obstruction is not the way to help asbestos victims get the justice they deserve. That is why I was so surprised that the Democrat Leader had insisted upon opposing the motion to proceed to the FAIR Act. He said '[t]he only proper course at this time is to defeat the motion to proceed.' His dramatic reversal is a positive first step. But I know the Democrat Leader has also said 'there are a lot of other ways we can fight this very bad piece of legislation.' I hope the Democrat Leadership continues to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resolve this problem and pass meaningful asbestos reform. It's long past time to resolve the asbestos crisis so that victims can get fair and fast compensation."
