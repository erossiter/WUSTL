SEN. FRIST PRAISES 101ST AIRBORNE'S ROLE IN HANDOVER OF CONTROL TO IRAQI ARMY DIVISION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the announcement that the 101st Airborne Division successfully transferred control of its area of responsibility to the 4th Iraqi Army Division: 
   "This is an important day for the Iraqi people and a proud day for the 101st."
  "The continued transition of control from Coalition forces to Iraqi forces is further indication that Iraqis are standing up and making impressive progress in assuming responsibility for their own security."
   "I commend the men and women of the 101st - and their families - for the hard work and sacrifice that made this important transition possible."
   The 4th Iraqi Army Division is the fifth of 10 Iraqi Army Divisions to assume control of its area of responsibility.
   Iraqi security forces currently taking the lead in security responsibility include five Iraqi Army Divisions, 25 Iraqi Army Brigades, 85 Iraqi Army Battalions, and two Iraqi National Police Battalions.
   The 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, is conducting its second tour in Iraq.
