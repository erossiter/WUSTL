SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON MEDICARE REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the Social Security and Medicare trustees' annual report, which indicates costs of the prescription drug benefit are "significantly lower" than in previous reports:  
   "Today's report confirms that competition in Medicare works. 
   "By letting seniors choose from a variety of coverage options, the Medicare drug benefit not only gives seniors more control over their health care decisions but also keeps costs low. 
   "In both the Medicare Modernization Act and the Deficit Reduction Act, Congress made important progress to address the financial solvency of the Medicare program to ensure it will continue to serve future generations. 
   "However, the trustees also make it clear that much work remains to be done to address the growth of Medicare spending. Earlier this year I laid out six improvements that must be made to address the inevitable demographic pressure on the program, including: robust chronic disease management, improved prevention, information transparency, greater choice, requiring those who can afford it to carry more of the cost, and encouraging providers to provide the highest quality care possible."
