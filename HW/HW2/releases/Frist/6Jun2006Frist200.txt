SEN. FRIST HIGHLIGHTS PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate voted to confirm the nomination of Renee Marie Bumb to be District Judge for the District of New Jersey:  
   "Today's confirmation of yet another federal judge marks another step forward in restoring fairness to the judicial nominations process and confirming judges who will practice judicial restraint and interpret the law strictly and impartially. With 94.4 percent of all federal judgeships filled, including the two new Justices on the Supreme Court, we are continuing to make progress, but we have more work to do. We must continue to stand against judicial obstruction and for the principle that qualified judicial nominees deserve a fair up-or-down vote." 
   Currently 94.4% of all judgeships are filled, including 91.1% of all circuit court judgeships and 95.3% of all district court judgeships. Under Senator Frist's leadership the Senate has made considerable progress on President Bush's judicial nominees, including confirming two Supreme Court Justices, 28 circuit court judges, and 112 district court judges and decreasing the number of circuit court vacancies by 36%.
