SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS STRONG ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN 3RD QUARTER
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Today's jobs figures and low unemployment levels reflect an economy that is vibrant, strong and continuing to surpass expectations. In recent months America has weathered the devastating impact of unprecedented natural disasters that tore apart families, shredded communities and decimated an entire region. And in the face of these overwhelming challenges and the resulting spike in energy costs, our economy has stood strong, growing steadily and continuing to create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. 
   "Despite the partisan distortions of liberal lawmakers, today's report reflects long-term stability in the American marketplace, and I'm proud that the Republican-led Congress is delivering on America's priorities. Future generations are depending on us to be fiscally responsible, reduce the deficit and promote conditions that keep our economy strong and ready to confront future challenges. And I'll continue to work with my colleagues to pass common sense economic policies that drive down the deficit and guarantee sustained tax relief so America's families and small businesses keep more of the money they earn, and keep our economy growing."
