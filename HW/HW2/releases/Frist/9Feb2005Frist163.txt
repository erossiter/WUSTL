SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON ISRAELI, PALESTINIAN CEASEFIRE
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the evolving talks in Egypt between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership: 
   "I'm encouraged by the recent developments at the summit in Egypt. If the Palestinian Authority can halt attacks and provide a secure environment, and if the Israeli government reciprocates with actions that demonstrate its longstanding commitment to peace, the two sides will have achieved a long hoped-for break through.
   "The United States stands ready to help the two sides secure such a lasting peace. We stand ready to work with them to achieve, through the Road Map, President Bush's vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.
   "Since the Palestinian elections on January 9th, there has been a momentum towards peace not seen in years. The election of President Abbas sent a message from the majority of Palestinians to reject violence and pursue peace with Israel. It is inspiring to now see the new Palestinian leadership and the Israeli government press forward with talks."
