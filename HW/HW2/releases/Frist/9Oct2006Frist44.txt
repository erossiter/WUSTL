SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding reports that North Korea had conducted an underground nuclear test:  
   "Yesterday's claimed nuclear test by North Korea was a dangerous provocation that demands a strong response from the United States and the international community. North Korea's test threatens to destabilize all of Northeast Asia and must not be repeated by other rogue nations." 
   Following North Korea's missile tests on July 4th, Senator Frist introduced the "North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006" for consideration. The legislation passed the Senate on July 25th and the House on September 30th, and is now awaiting signature by the President. 
   The act ensures that the United States will carefully review and impose appropriate sanctions on all foreign entities involved in transfers of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missile-related items to and from North Korea. U.S. law already requires such treatment of WMD and missile-related transfers to and from Iran and Syria, and this legislation ensures that hence forward we will extend the same treatment to North Korea.
