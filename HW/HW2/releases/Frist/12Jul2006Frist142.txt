SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULING AGAINST MICROSOFT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the European Commission's announcement of additional fines against Microsoft for its alleged noncompliance with a 2004 ruling requiring the company to provide competitors with information about the Windows operating system: 
   "The European Commission's latest decision against Microsoft smacks of anti-Americanism and comes before the deadline has even passed for Microsoft to comply with the Commission's 2004 ruling."
   "Microsoft has attempted to comply with the Commission's requirements, and imposing such a fine at this juncture simply compounds the already unreasonable demands the Commission has made in this case. The Commission's conduct regarding Microsoft suggests a broader pattern of anti-competitive, anti-American behavior that will harm American workers and businesses and jeopardize our trading relationship."
   "The Commission's ruling demonstrates a protectionist attitude toward American businesses, and I hope this situation can be resolved fairly before trade relations are severely damaged."
