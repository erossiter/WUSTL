SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON IRAN
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on the Bush Administration's offer to join international negotiations aimed at ending Iran's illegal nuclear weapons program:  
   "I support the Bush Administration's offer to join in international negotiations aimed at terminating Iran's illegal nuclear weapons program, provided Iran verifiably restores the suspension of enrichment and reprocessing-related activity that it broke last August. Our European allies and Russia have in the past tried very hard to negotiate an end to Iran's nuclear weapons program, and Iran has rejected their efforts, so we will all be pleasantly surprised if Iran gives a different answer to the U.S. offer. Nevertheless, I do not oppose the Bush Administration's decision to go the extra mile to determine whether a diplomatic solution can be found."
   "We need to be clear, however, about the consequences if Iran rejects the Bush Administration's offer: the United States and our allies must immediately press the Iran matter to a decision within the UN Security Council. Our goal within the Security Council must be to require Iran to satisfy the international community that it has ended its nuclear weapons program, and to impose meaningful sanctions on the Iranian regime if it fails to do so. If the Security Council fails to fulfill its responsibilities, then we will need to work with like-minded governments to respond to the Iranian nuclear threat outside the United Nations framework. I am hopeful that today's announcement will help lay the groundwork for meeting the difficult challenges that lie ahead."
