  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) announced his intention to resign from his post in the U.S. House of Representatives:  
   "I was sorry to learn of Tom DeLay's decision to end his public service career. I know this was a difficult decision for him and his family. While his career in the House has ended, his contributions to our nation will endure. Tom DeLay's incomparable efforts helped enact a broad range of legislation that will improve the lives of Americans for years to come. He was focused on the issues that mattered most to Americans like energy and national security, while at the same time serving as a fierce advocate for children and other voiceless members of society. 
   "Tom DeLay was one of the most effective and persuasive Majority Leaders in history and his presence will be missed. I thank him for his unyielding and dutiful service, and wish him well in his future endeavors."
