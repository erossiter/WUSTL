SEN. FRIST PRAISES PRESERVATION OF MT. SOLEDAD WAR MEMORIAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on legislation to protect the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial Cross in San Diego, California, which passed today by unanimous consent:  
   "I'm proud the Senate chose to protect an important memorial honoring our nation's fallen veterans. With the passage of this legislation, the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial will be controlled by the federal government, which will ensure that the men and women it memorializes continue to be honored." 
   Since 1954, a 29-foot cross has stood atop Mt. Soledad in San Diego, California memorializing the American war dead of World War I, World War II and the Korean conflict. Over the years, the Memorial has grown and now includes six large, concentric walls covered with granite plaques commemorating individual servicemen and women, bollards, pavers and a flagpole proudly flying the American flag. The Mt. Soledad Memorial, in its entirety, is a world class war memorial. 
   In 1989, a plaintiff who claimed to be offended by the memorial sued the city for its removal. The City of San Diego went to great lengths to divest themselves of the property by selling it to a private party who could choose to keep the Memorial cross. That sale was blocked, however, by the 9th circuit court of appeals. 
   Last year, the voters of San Diego passed a ballot measure providing for the donation of the memorial to the federal government, but again that transfer was blocked by the courts. 
   H.R. 5683 directs the federal government to acquire the property and enables the Mt. Soleded memorial to be federally owned and continue to memorialize Americans who have fallen in service to their country.
