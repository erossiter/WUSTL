SEN. FRIST HAILS APRIL JOB FIGURES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced that the economy continued to grow last month, creating over 138,000 new jobs in April: 
   "Today's figures reflect a resilient economy that has expanded for over 32 consecutive months and generated 5.3 million new jobs since August 2003. We must continue to implement fiscally conservative, pro-growth policies to ensure that we sustain this strong economic growth and healthy job creation for years to come. 
   "I urge my colleagues in the tax reconciliation conference to swiftly reach an agreement so we can continue to build off today's momentum. We must extend those Republican-led initiatives -- alternative minimum tax and capital gains and dividend tax relief -- that have proven to strengthen our economy and create jobs."
