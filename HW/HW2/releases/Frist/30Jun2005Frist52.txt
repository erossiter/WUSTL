SEN. FRIST LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today regarding Senate passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement: 
   "By raising the level of marketplace competition and lowering barriers to trade, today's agreement benefits economies both at home and abroad. CAFTA empowers American businesses to contend in the global marketplace, and ensures commerce flows fairly and freely between member nations. Increased trade cements ties between countries, and in turn will bolster the budding democracies throughout Central America.
   "Furthermore, this legislation ensures that America's small businesses and families are able to buy, sell and shop without being at a competitive disadvantage. The benefits of free trade have been particularly positive for my home state of Tennessee. Over 156,000 employees and 4,000 businesses and countless farmers in my state already benefit from past trade agreements, and this new agreement will continue that trend by ultimately generating over 2,000 new Tennessee jobs.
   "This agreement holds great promise for our future, and is another element of the 109th Congress' commitment to governing on the issues that matter most to Americans. In addition to sending the president meaningful class action and bankruptcy reform legislation, the Senate has passed comprehensive energy legislation that will lower energy prices and strengthen our nation's energy security, and a transportation bill that will boost our economy and encourages economic development in America's communities.
   "Clearly, we've made tremendous progress so far in the first session of the 109th Congress, and I look forward to continuing to pass legislation on critical issues like CAFTA that will keep America prosperous and competitive in the global marketplace."
