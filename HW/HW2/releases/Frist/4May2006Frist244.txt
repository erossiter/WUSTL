SEN. FRIST COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR STATEMENT ON AVIAN FLU PROVISION
  Amy Call, Communications Director for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), made the following statement today regarding a limited liability provision included in legislation to prepare the United States for a large scale avian flu pandemic:  
   "Senator Frist fought hard to pass the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (Prep) Act. Leaving the nation vulnerable to a bioterrorism attack or natural outbreak is inexcusable, irresponsible, and precarious. 
   "H5N1 continues to spread around the world and the number of fatal human cases continues to rise. Yet, the United States lacks its best defense: an effective vaccine. In 1967, 26 companies produced vaccines for the US market. Today, only 5 companies produce vaccines for the US market. And of those, only 1 domestically produces a potential avian flu vaccine. 
   "Over the past 12 months, Republican and Democratic Senators introduced six different bills that included liability provisions. Clearly, bipartisan consensus existed: incentives must be extended to manufacturers, distributors, and first responders, so that life-saving countermeasures will be developed, deployed, and administered. 
   "Senator Frist advocated strongly and publicly on the need for this provision, and stated that he would seek to include it in the omnibus appropriations bill. 
   "The real story here is that this provision could save the lives of millions of Americans should Avian Flu hit the United States. 
   "The Public Citizen Foundation board includes prominent trial lawyers like Lisa Blue (wife of former ATLA President Fred Baron) and Joseph Cotchett, ultra-liberal commentator Jim Hightower and Morris Dees--who was the finance director for George McGovern in 1972, the national finance director for Jimmy Carter in 1976, and the national finance chairman for Ted Kennedy in 1980. Trial lawyers oppose these provisions because it will strip them of the ability to line their pockets at the expense of the American public."
   Facts about the Provision
   * TARGETED. DOES NOT APPLY TO ROUTINE VACCINATIONS. The liability provisions are targeted, only extending to bio-defense and pandemic and epidemic products recommended for use by the Secretary of HHS.
   * SUBJECT TO A SECRETARIAL DECLARATION. The targeted liability provisions apply only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services issues a declaration, stating that a disease or threat to health constitutes a public health emergency (or may constitute an emergency in the future) 
   * UPHOLDS FDA GOLD STANDARD. The targeted liability provisions maintain and uphold current FDA safety and efficacy standards. 
   * FAST, FAIR, EQUITABLE COMPENSATION. The targeted liability provisions provide compensation for first responders and others, who receive a covered countermeasure and experience serious physical injury or death. (Note: Based on the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003). 
   Important Observations: What does the legislation not permit or require? 
   * NOT A FREE PASS FOR INDUSTRY TO ACT IRRESPONSIBLY. The targeted liability provisions hold bad actors accountable. The provisions do not confer immunity protection to bad actors who willfully engage in misconduct that causes serious injury or death. 
   * NO FORCED VACCINATIONS. The targeted liability provisions do not require mandatory inoculation. 
   * PRESERVES THE VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM. The liability provisions include specific language that states "Nothing in this section, or any amendment made by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, shall be construed to affect the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program."
