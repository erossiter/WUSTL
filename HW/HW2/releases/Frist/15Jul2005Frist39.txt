WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. FRIST
  It was another productive week in the United States Senate as we successfully passed the Homeland Security spending bill late last night. This bill afforded an opportunity to confront the challenges facing America's borders, ports and transit systems. I was particularly pleased that the bill targeted many of our nation's border security needs. In total, the bill increased total spending on border security alone by almost $10 billion. 
   In other news this week, the National Assessment of Educational Progress was released, also known as the "Nation's Report Card." The report contained very encouraging news about how the "No Child Left Behind Act" is beginning to show meaningful results in our schools - particularly among minority populations.

   No major news regarding the Supreme Court this week. However, when the president names his nominee, I believe that members of both sides of the aisle will be able to work together to ensure that the nominations process is fair, dignified and respectful. And I remain confident that a new justice will be confirmed before the Supreme Court begins its new term on October 3rd.
   Looking ahead, next week the Senate will begin consideration of the Foreign Operations spending bill.
   As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office for information, or any questions and concerns you may have. Have a good week.

With the prospect of a Supreme Court nomination looming, some people are predicting that the Senate will get tied up in partisan conflict, and that we will not be able to simultaneously advise and consent on the President's nominee, and address the people's business. But I believe that if we reflect on the past six months, we ... more at http://frist.senate.gov/?Fuseaction=Speeches.Detail&Speech_id=247.
