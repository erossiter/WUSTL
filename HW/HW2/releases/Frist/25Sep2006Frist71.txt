SEN. FRIST HAILS CONFIRMATION OF YET ANOTHER JUDICIAL NOMINEE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Senate confirmed Francisco Besosa to serve as U.S. District Judge for the District of Puerto Rico:  
   "The Republican-led Senate continues its tremendous progress on judicial nominations by confirming yet another well qualified judge who respects the rule of law and exercises judicial restraint." 
   President Bush's judicial nominees have an overall confirmation rate of 88, the highest since President Reagan. Currently, 95 percent of all judgeships are filled, including more than 92 percent of all circuit court judgeships and more than 95 percent of all district court judgeships. 
   The Senate has made great strides in confirming the president's judicial nominees under Frist's leadership. Nearly 160 nominees have been confirmed, including two Supreme Court justices, 33 circuit court judges and 122 district court judges. The circuit court vacancy rate alone has decline by 44 percent since Frist became majority leader.
