SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF AFRICAN TRADE BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act late Thursday.  
 The legislation will now be sent to the President for his signature.   
   "Passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) will make a real difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Africans, and I thank my colleagues for supporting this critical bill.   
   "In the four years since its enactment, AGOA has helped create an estimated 150,000 Africans jobs. Investors have poured $340 million in new private investment into Africa. And new investments in Africa have led to new opportunities for U.S. businesses. 
   "The program has been a huge success in U.S. policy toward sub-Saharan Africa. U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa increased 13 percent from 2002 to 2003. Today the United States is sub-Saharan Africa's largest single export market accounting for 26 percent of the regional total exports in 2001 alone. And U.S. imports from AGOA have almost doubled between 2001 and 2003, to over $13 billion last year. The program has in fact been so well received and effective in Africa that the European Union is now reexamining its preference program for Africa in light of AGOA's success. 
   "This program has brought much-needed jobs, investment and hope for many in Africa. Passage of this legislation will allow for the continued support of the program, and I congratulate my colleagues for working together to ensure that this continued economic investment is sustained in the region."
