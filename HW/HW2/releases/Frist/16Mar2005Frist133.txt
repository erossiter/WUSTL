SEN. FRIST JOINS BUSH'S CALL FOR HEZBOLLAH TO DISARM, DISAVOW TERROR
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terrorist organization:  
   "I call on Hezbollah to fully comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 by disarming and disbanding its militias in Lebanon and also to end terrorist attacks against Israel. Today, Hezbollah continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East. It is a destabilizing force in the peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians and in the Lebanese people's movement toward freedom and democracy. 
   "I reiterate the United States' view that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. It has been involved in several attacks against United States citizens over the years, including the 1983 bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut. I urge the European Union and our European partners to also classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. It's crucial for the peace and security of the region that the international community pressure Hezbollah to disarm, disband its militias, end its support to other terrorist groups, and disavow terrorism. 
   "Hezbollah also needs to disarm and disband its militia so that the Lebanese people can participate in fair, democratic elections free from violence and intimidation. The Lebanese people should be allowed to decide their own future and freely choose their leaders without facing the threat of violence perpetrated by Hezbollah." 
   U.N. Security Council 1559 was passed in September 2004 and calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon and for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias. This latter group includes, principally, Hezbollah, which reportedly receives its support, funding, and strategic guidance from Syria and Iran.
