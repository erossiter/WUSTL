SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR PROGRESS ON CHILD PREDATORS LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) sent a letter urging Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) to set a deadline of July 27 for having sexual predators legislation ready for signature by the president. Excerpts from the letter include:  
   "While I am pleased with the progress made so far, I remain concerned that time may be running short in this legislative session."
   "I urge you to join me in setting a clear goal to have sexual predators legislation ready for signature by the President no later than July 27, 2006."
   "I know we share a commitment to strengthen laws that protect our children from sexual predators lurking in our neighborhoods or enticing our children online. Currently, there are more than 550,000 registered sex offenders in the United States and at least 100,000 are missing from the system."
   "The loopholes in the current system allow some sexual predators to evade law enforcement and put our children at risk."
   "[W]e must do more to address an emerging global crisis in child pornography, an estimated $20 billion commercial industry fueled by the Internet. The Internet has become an anonymous gateway for sexual predators to initiate contact with children, win their confidence, and attempt to victimize them."
   "By passing legislation that establishes a national sex offender registry, toughens criminal penalties for sexual predators, and cracks down on child pornography, we can take another step forward in making America safer."
   "The Senate and the House have both passed bills addressing these issues. It is time to bridge any remaining differences and finish the job. We should not allow extraneous issues to delay the bill."
