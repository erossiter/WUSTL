SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON RESULTS OF PALESTINIAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement given news reports that Hamas has won a majority of seats in Palestinian parliamentary elections yesterday:  
   "While I laud the peaceful exercise of democracy by the Palestinian people, the results trouble me. Hamas is a terrorist organization that calls for Israel's destruction. I do understand the widespread dissatisfaction of the Palestinian people with Fatah, but the strong possibility that Hamas will form the next Palestinian government casts a serious shadow over the prospects for peace. 
   "We must achieve the vision of two democratic states--Israel and Palestine--living side by side in peace and security. In order to keep the Road Map alive, Hamas must immediately renounce and end all violence, disarm all militias, and recognize Israel's right to exist, among other things. Otherwise, I fear the peace process will end and continued United States financial assistance will be in serious jeopardy. 
   "The Israeli people want peace and are committed to achieving it. The Palestinian people, likewise, accepted President Abbas' platform of peace and his commitment to the Road Map. My hope is that the Palestinian people will recognize these facts and press Hamas to make dramatic reforms and take the significant steps required to become a credible partner in peace for Israel."
