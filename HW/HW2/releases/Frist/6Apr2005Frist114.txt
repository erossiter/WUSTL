SEN. FRIST RECEIVES NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS LEGISLATIVE EXCELLENCE AWARD
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today was honored to receive the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence at a ceremony held during his weekly constituent breakfast.  
 Representatives from NAM and Eastman Chemical Company based in Kingsport were on hand to present the award to Sen. Frist. 
   "I am honored to be recognized by NAM for supporting manufacturers in Tennessee and around the nation," said Frist. "There are more than 400,000 manufacturing employees in Tennessee that help contribute to our nation's economic growth. Working with the President and my colleagues in Congress, we will continue to make the United States the best place to do business. In the 109th Congress we have passed meaningful class action reform and we are working on broader tort reform legislation and an energy bill. These important initiatives will help diminish the cost of doing business, encourage investment and trigger job growth. I thank NAM and its members for continuing to inform citizens, the Congress, and the President about issues facing this vital sector of the American economy." 
   The NAM is the nation's largest industrial trade association, representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. Its mission is to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturers by shaping a legislative and regulatory environment conducive to U.S. economic growth and to increase understanding among policymakers, the media and the general public about the vital role of manufacturing to America's economic future and living standards. 
   NAM presents the award to members of Congress who support the organization's pro-growth, pro-manufacturing, and pro-worker agenda.
