SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON WORLD AIDS DAY
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on World AIDS Day:  
 "Today reminds us of the millions of lives already lost to HIV/AIDS. As a doctor I have seen this devastating disease firsthand and the suffering it causes. We must continue to search for a cure. 
 "I also want today to remind my colleagues of the importance of reauthorizing the Ryan White Act. This bill funds programs that ensure HIV/AIDS patients get the care they need, even if they lack insurance or have exhausted their policies. I ask my colleagues from New York and New Jersey to stop blocking this crucial, lifesaving piece of legislation."
