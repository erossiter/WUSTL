SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PASSING OF DEDICATED AIDE HOWARD LIEBENGOOD
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "I'm saddened to have lost a great friend who has meant so much to me and to our Senate family. Howard's passing comes as a shock to us all. He is probably best remembered by his jovial manner and long repertoire of Senate anecdotes. When I came to my current position, I needed the counsel of wise, experienced leaders to help me meet the challenges of my new role. Without question, Howard Liebengood was indispensable. His long service to the people of Tennessee and the United States is remarkable. He was a distinguished veteran and personified what it means to be a public servant. His wife Deanna and his three children are in our thoughts and prayers. Karyn and I are deeply grateful for his dedication to us, and we will sorely miss him."  
   Howard was born and raised in Indiana. He was a graduate of the Vanderbilt University Law School. He served in Vietnam as a Captain in the U.S. Army Military Police Corps and received the Bronze Star and Army Commendation Medal in 1970. In 1973, he served as Minority Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. He was a founding partner of a law firm with former Senator Fred Thompson before returning to Washington to serve as Minority Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He went on to serve as Legislative Counsel to Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker and was later named by Baker as Senate Sergeant-At-Arms. After going back into private practice for several years, Howard came back to Capitol Hill to serve as Senator Fred Thompson's Chief of Staff. After Thompson's retirement, Howard joined Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist as his Chief of Staff for his Tennessee office.
