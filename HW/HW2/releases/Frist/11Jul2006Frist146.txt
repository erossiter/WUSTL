SEN. FRIST PRAISES OMB DEFICIT REDUCTION ANNOUNCEMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Office of Management and Budget released its Mid-Session Review announcing a reduction in the expected deficit: 
   "Today's announcement is a testament to a dynamic and growing U.S. economy. The grit and spine of the American worker, and an indefatigable entrepreneurial spirit, have kept our economy resilient despite corporate scandals, September 11, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita."
   "My Republican colleagues and I have worked hard to bolster our economy's natural resilience with explicit policies designed to lower tax burdens, reduce costly regulations, and limit unnecessary federal spending. We're making progress to bring our spending and revenue into line, but we cannot rest on the progress made to date. As we strive to achieve fiscal balance, more needs to be done to help hard working families meet the cost of living."
