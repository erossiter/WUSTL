SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS AUTOMAKERS' COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLE FUELS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the CEOs of DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors announced their intention to voluntarily double their companies' production of flexible fuel vehicles by 2010. Frist and other members of the Senate Republican leadership met with the three executives last month to discuss the need for additional flexible fuel vehicles and greater access to ethanol fuels:  
   "Reducing America's dependence on foreign oil is a vital task that will require increased domestic energy exploration, new conservation efforts and private sector innovation. I commend the leadership of DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors for their commitment to making flexible vehicles more widely available to American drivers. Republicans remain dedicated to pursuing policies that will bring gas prices down and put America on the road to energy independence."
