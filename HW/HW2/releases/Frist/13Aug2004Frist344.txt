SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD MORE THAN $6.7 MILLION IN DOT GRANTS FOR MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  The U.S. Department of Transportation today announced more than $6.7 million to build the Memphis International Airport Intermodal Complex, a series of improvements designed to facilitate improved public transit, relieve congestion, and improve passenger flow.  
   Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) praised DOT on the grant announcement: 
   "This funding is a welcome step to increasing public transportation to and from the Memphis International Airport," said Frist. "Increased public transit alleviates traffic congestion, pollution and gives travelers more options for getting to one of the fastest growing airports in the Southeast. I applaud Memphis' commitment to fostering transportation alternatives." 
   "Memphis has made great strides in public transportation, and this funding will help facilitate improvements in bus transportation to and from the airport," said Alexander. "It will increase passenger satisfaction, decrease congestion and reduce air pollution. Senator Frist and I appreciate the Department of Transportation's investment in the Memphis community." 
   In addition to improvements to bus transportation, the funding will also prepare the airport for the extension of a light rail system.
