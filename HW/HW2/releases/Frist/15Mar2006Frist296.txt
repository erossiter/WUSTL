SEN. FRIST PRAISES HELP COMMITTEE ACTION TO PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES' ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act of 2005:  
   "Under the leadership of Chairman Enzi, the Senate has taken a vital step towards making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. This landmark bipartisan bill will allow small businesses to band together and use their collective purchasing power to ensure affordable health insurance coverage for their employees. This bill will strengthen coverage for the over one million Tennesseans employed by small businesses. I look forward to bringing this legislation to the Senate floor for a vote in the near future."
