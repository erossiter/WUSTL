SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF PENSIONS BILL BENEFITING MEMPHIS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate passed the Pensions Protection Act (H.R. 4):  
   "The Pensions Protection Act includes an important provision for employees of Northwest Airlines, including the over 2,000 workers based at the Memphis hub. 
   "This legislation gives airlines like Northwest who have frozen their plans up to 17 years to fully fund their pension plans, as opposed to the 10 years required of other airlines who have not agreed to a hard freeze. 
   "I fought hard for this provision to protect the retirement security of Northwest workers in Memphis and am pleased that it will allow the airline to avoid terminating its pension plan as it continues to restructure and strengthen its operations."
