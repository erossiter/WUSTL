SEN. FRIST PRAISES PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP ON BORDER SECURITY, RENEWS CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Administration released a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) document that called for increased border security and interior security provisions as well as comprehensive immigration reform:  
   "Finally, a consensus on immigration can emerge here in the Senate, and the president's SAP today demonstrates that. Together, we agree our borders must be secure first, to make America safer. Together, we agree that interior enforcement must be enhanced, so that businesses can know with certainty those they hire actually belong here. 
   "And so now, I hope members will agree that we must all work together here in the Senate so that we can strike an appropriate balance between our workplace needs and the rule of law, knowing that all 12 million here illegally are not a homogenous group. We cannot reward breaking the law, but we cannot put aside our heritage as a nation of immigrants. 
   "As Congress continues to work on this issue, I will be encouraging members to find that appropriate balance to solve the problems that have built up over the past 20 years responsibly and make America safer and more secure."
