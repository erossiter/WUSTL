SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR HAMAS RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's call for the Hamas-led government to recognize Israel:  
   "I applaud President Abbas's call for the Hamas-led government in the Palestinian territories to recognize Israel and accept a two-state solution. In order to fulfill the expectations of the international community, Hamas must not only accept Israel's right to exist, but also renounce violence and terrorism, disarm its militias and abide by all of the Palestinian Authority's previous agreements with Israel, including those with regard to the Roadmap. 
   "Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Olmert demonstrated once again his desire and willingness to work with a credible Palestinian partner to negotiate a solution to this conflict. Today, President Abbas made a bold move, and I commend him for his leadership. It's now time for Hamas to take the substantial steps necessary to become a true partner for peace. 
   "I urge President Abbas to continue working toward getting the peace process back on track. President Abbas needs and deserves America's continued support, and we remain committed to President Bush's vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security."
