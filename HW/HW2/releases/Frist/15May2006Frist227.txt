SEN. FRIST COMMEMORATES PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the 25th anniversary of Peace Officers Memorial Day after participating in the National Fraternal Order of Police's memorial service for fallen officers on the Capitol steps: 
   "Each year, tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country gather in the nation's capital to honor comrades lost in the line of duty. I count myself honored to join them in offering solemn tribute to the memory of their fallen comrades. It's a humbling experience - realizing the debt of gratitude we owe these fallen heroes for their sacrifice and recognizing it can never truly be repaid. America has a responsibility to protect the memory of these heroes. We must ensure that these officers have not died in vain - that the America they died protecting is the America we preserve today and in the future."
   In a floor statement delivered today, Frist took the opportunity to honor Tennesseans who have lost their lives in the line of duty over the past year. These individuals include: Decherd Police Department Officer Michael Keith Buckner; Tennessee Highway Patrol Trooper Todd Michael Larkins; Tennessee Department of Corrections Officer Wayne Thomas "Cotton" Morgan and Murfreesboro Police Department Officer Kay Frances Rogers.
   There are more than 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers now serving communities across America - the highest number ever. The names of 466 law enforcement officers were added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Saturday during the 18th Annual Candlelight Vigil; included among these were the names of 155 law enforcement officers who were killed in 2005. Each year, an average of 56,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted, resulting in more than 16,000 injuries.
