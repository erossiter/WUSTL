SEN. FRIST HAILS MAY JOB FIGURES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Department of Labor announced that the economy continued to grow during the month of May: 
   "Today's figures indicate that the economy continues to create jobs for the 33rd consecutive month, despite increasing pressures being placed upon consumers with rising energy prices. This speaks to the strength of our economy. We must continue Republican policies of low taxes as we expand policies for domestic production and alternative sources of energy to ensure jobs continue to grow." 
   "Implementing fiscally conservative, pro-growth policies will help ensure that we sustain this strong economic growth and healthy job creation for years to come. That's why we enacted the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 last month."
