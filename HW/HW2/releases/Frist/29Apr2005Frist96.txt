SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today regarding Social Security:  
   "Last night, the president again presented the facts about the looming crisis facing Social Security. He made a sobering case for why we must act now in order to preserve this beloved social program. I'm pleased that Chairman Grassley began holding hearings this week, and remain confident that with his steady leadership, we can act on legislation this summer. I call on all of my colleagues to put sound public policy ahead of partisan politics so we can thoughtfully consider the challenges ahead. 
   "I applaud President Bush for clearly tackling this tough issue, and look forward to working with my colleagues to enact legislation that is responsible, fair and guarantees that Social Security is here today and secure for generations of tomorrow."
