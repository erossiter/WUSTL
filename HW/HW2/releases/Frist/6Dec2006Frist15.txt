SEN. FRIST PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF RYAN WHITE CARE ACT REAUTHORIZATION
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn) made the following statement after the Senate passed the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act:  
 "I'm proud of the Senate for reauthorizing legislation that will continue to provide life sustaining medical assistance to millions of people suffering from HIV and AIDS across the country. The AIDS epidemic continues to devastate families, communities and entire nations throughout the world as medical researchers strive for a cure. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to move swiftly in approving this bill, giving hope to those most in need." 
 The Ryan White CARE Act (PL 101-381) became law in 1990 and governs $2 billion in federal assistance for AIDS drugs and services for indigent HIV/AIDS patients. Services are distributed through state and local AIDS relief programs. 
 The law is named after a young AIDS suffer and activist who succumbed to the disease the year the law was enacted. The compromise reauthorization passed today in the Senate will extend the measure for three more years, setting minimum state funding benchmarks at 95% of FY2006 levels. 
 This is the third reauthorization that has been passed during Majority Leader Frist's tenure in the Senate. He has made it a priority to provide research, promote prevention and ensure treatment to individuals living with HIV and AIDS.
