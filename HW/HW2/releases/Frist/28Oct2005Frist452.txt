SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON VOLCKER REPORT ON U.N. OIL FOR FOOD PROGRAM
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the release of the Supplemental Report of the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil for Food Program:  
   "The Volcker report on the United Nations Oil for Food Program illustrates the full extent of Saddam Hussein's exploitation and manipulation of a program intended to benefit the Iraqi people. It shows that for years Saddam Hussein diverted billions of dollars belonging to the people of Iraq to fund his own personal ambitions. 
   "In addition, this report demonstrates that Saddam's malfeasance was made possible by the assistance and acquiescence of a number of UN officials, member states, and private companies and individuals. 
   "These revelations highlight once again the need for serious reform at the UN. Not only must action be taken to assure that those guilty of corruption are held accountable, but also to guarantee that the institution as a whole is more responsible, more accountable, and more transparent. 
   "The Oil for Food Program has deeply affected the UN's credibility. In order to regain its standing and fulfill its important role in the world, the UN first needs to make substantial and immediate changes in its management systems, oversight, and transparency."
