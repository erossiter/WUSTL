SEN. FRIST DISAPPOINTED BY SENATE'S INABILITY TO PASS CORD BLOOD LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement: 
   "I'm deeply disappointed by the Senate's inability to pass cord blood legislation this evening. This simple, non-controversial legislation is vitally important to providing for the health and welfare of patients now and in the future. There has been virtually no opposition to this legislation, but it is being blocked for political purposes. 
   "Cord blood technology has already begun producing cures and saving lives, and has the potential to improve the health and even save the lives of millions, particularly members of minority groups who suffer disproportionately from such diseases as sickle-cell anemia. And it is wrong to deny them hope, especially when it is within our power to act. 
   "We have a responsibility to provide patients with proven, safe and ethically sound treatments that save lives, and I will continue to push my colleagues to pass this bill. It is truly a matter of life and death."
