SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF IRAN FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on the Senate's passage of H.R. 6198, the Iran Freedom Support Act:  
   "I applaud my Senate colleagues for passing this vital piece of legislation. The Iran Freedom Support Act will extend for another five years the provisions of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). ILSA has been an important element of the U.S. sanctions regime against Iran for the last 10 years, and enactment of this legislation ensures that ILSA will continue to impede Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. 
   "This Act also provides important new authority for the Administration to block financial transactions related to Iran's weapons of mass destruction programs, and encourages the Administration to use all available leverage over Russia to gain Russian support for multilateral sanctions against Iran. 
   "In addition, this Act authorizes U.S. assistance to support the emergence of democracy in Iran. The United States must continue to reach out to the Iranian people and make clear that we support them, that we believe democracy is the way out of oppression, and that we are eager for a better relationship with them. The assistance included in this measure is a positive step forward. 
   "The regime in Tehran continues to defy the demands of the United Nations Security Council by refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program. Today, the Senate acted and strengthened one of our most important tools in the fight to keep nuclear weapons out of the mullahs' hands."
