SEN. FRIST TO INTRODUCE BORDER SECURITY LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced his intention to introduce a border security bill before the recess to ensure the Senate has a border security bill ready for debate during the week of March 27:  
   "Our country needs security at our borders in order to slow the flow of illegal immigration and make America safer from foreign criminals and terrorists. That's why today I will introduce a border security bill, to guarantee the Senate will have legislation available for consideration the week of March 27. 
   "This bill will be based on the consensus enforcement, visa reform and immigration litigation reform titles of Chairman Specter's mark-up of border security legislation and focus on ensuring strict enforcement of our nation's immigration laws. I look forward to bringing a border security bill to the floor during the week of March 27 and allowing the full Senate to start work on border security and interior law enforcement, as well as comprehensive immigration reform, so that America is more secure and our constituents are safer. It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee will be able to report a bill we can bring to the floor that meets these objectives. As a country of immigrants who respect the rule of law, I expect us to honor those heritages as this debate unfolds."
