   "Today the Senate acted to help Americans feeling pain at the pump and reeling from massive utility bills. 
   "This legislation strengthens our national security by substantially reducing our dependence on foreign oil and natural gas. 
   "By opening these 8 million acres to environmentally sensitive exploration, we tap domestic resources that will provide 1.26 billion barrels of oil and enough natural gas to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years. 
   "Bringing more American energy to American consumers will have a direct impact on power bills and prices at the pump while helping farmers who face skyrocketing fertilizer prices."
