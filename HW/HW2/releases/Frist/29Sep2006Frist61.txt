SEN. FRIST REBUKES DEMOCRATIC SENATORS BLOCKING RYAN WHITE CARE ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the continuing efforts of four Democratic senators to block reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act:  
   "It's shameful that four Democratic senators are standing in the way of a bill that will do so much for those Americans living with HIV and AIDS simply because their states would no longer be grossly overpaid per patient. Preventing the reauthorization of this legislation endangers lives. With well over 60 votes in support of the Ryan White CARE Act, I ask my colleagues who are currently obstructing this legislation to stand aside and allow this important humanitarian funding to flow to those in need." 
   Since 1990, the Ryan White CARE Act has funded programs that help HIV/AIDS patients get the care they need, even if they lack insurance or have exhausted their policies. As a member of the HELP Committee, Frist has played a key role in previous reauthorizations of the legislation. 
   This reauthorization recognizes that HIV/AIDS has a growing and significant presence beyond our nation's biggest cities. Under the funding formula changes, areas facing the greatest growth in HIV/AIDS caseloads will receive more funding than previously. 
   New York would gain more than $5 million under the new funding formula, yet the state's senators are among those obstructing the bill. 
   This reauthorization also ensures increased funding for communities across the state of Tennessee. Under the legislation's funding formula, the Volunteer State would receive more than $4.8 million in 2007. 
   Senator Frist published an op-ed discussing the Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization in "The Buffalo News" September 15.
