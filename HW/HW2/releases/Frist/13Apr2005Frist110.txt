SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS INTERNATIONAL AID TO SUDAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the aid pledged by the international community to help the southern region of Sudan recover from Africa's longest civil war:  
   "I am encouraged by yesterday's decision by our friends in the international community to donate aid to the southern region of Sudan as it begins to rebuild following a tragic civil war. Participants at the donors' conference in Oslo pledged $4.5 billion for 2005-2007 to aid the reconstruction efforts in Sudan's southern region. 
   "These contributions are necessary to help the people of Sudan in their efforts to stave off hunger and disease, assist refugees returning home after years of displacement, and build vital infrastructure such as roads, schools, and hospitals. 
   "I applaud President Bush's pledge to contribute American $1.7 billion in aid-the largest contribution of all donor countries-to the reconstruction process in southern Sudan. However, the Sudanese government in Khartoum must take credible, assertive steps to end the genocide occurring in Darfur, meet its obligations under the peace agreement recently signed with the south, and ensure access for humanitarian aid personnel working in Darfur and trying to save lives. 
   "These donations to southern Sudan's reconstruction efforts demonstrate the international community's commitment to the people of Sudan and their desire for peace and security following decades of war. I commend this generous expression of solidarity with the Sudanese people and urge the international community to redouble its efforts to help bring an end to violence in Sudan." 
   A peace accord signed in January 2005 ended 21 years of civil war between the Sudanese government in the north and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in the south. During the war, more than two million people were killed and four million displaced from their homes.
