SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NEWLY RELEASED CBO REPORT REGARDING HIGH-COST MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement regarding a report released on High-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries by the Congressional Budget Office today in response to a request by Sen.  
 Frist: 
   "Medicare faces daunting long-term challenges that will grow over time if additional strategies are not implemented to constrain rising costs while providing services to growing numbers of retirees. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) took a series of long overdue steps toward strengthening and improving the Medicare program by providing prescription drug coverage to seniors, establishing chronic care and disease management programs, improving preventive benefits, and expanding choice and competition. Today's report contains information that can help us build on these reforms and shape future strategies to improve care and reduce costs. The report confirms that Medicare beneficiaries with high medical costs can be identified using fairly straightforward criteria. The challenge we face is designing and deploying effective interventions to reduce overall program costs while continuing to improve the quality and availability of care for all seniors." 
   The report was released in response to a request by Senator Frist asking that the Congressional Budget Office prepare an analysis to assess the impact of high-cost Medicare beneficiaries on costs and spending under the Medicare program.
