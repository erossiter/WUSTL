SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON ELECTION RESULTS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-TN, issued the following reaction to Tuesday's historic election results in which President Bush was reelected and the Republicans picked up four Senate seats.  
   "The 2004 election is over and the American people have spoken. They have reelected our Republican President and have expanded Republican control in the Senate and House. 
   "President Bush won because he has worked hard to provide strong, consistent, and effective leadership during some of the most difficult times our nation has faced. 
   "I want to congratulate John Kerry and John Edwards on waging a vigorous campaign. They have been forceful and energetic advocates for the Democrat party. They are to be congratulated for their dedication and effort. 
   "In the Senate where Republicans have gained four seats, I hope our expanded Republican majority will allow us to build working coalitions and put an end to the partisan roadblocks that have marred the past two years. 
   "Today the campaign is over. We need to get back to work. We must once again turn to carrying out the peoples' business - to combat terrorism, protect the homeland, lower taxes, create jobs, improve education, and lower costs and increase access to health care. These are not partisan issues and I look forward to working with President Bush and Speaker Hastert on them. 
   "It is time to heal the partisan divide and begin the process of reconciliation. Beginning last night, I spoke with many of my colleagues - Republican and Democrat - to begin that process. Now is the time for all citizens to lay partisan squabbling aside and work for a safer, healthier, more prosperous America. 
   "This election is over. Our nation is at war. It's time to overcome our differences, lay aside the rancor and get to work. The American people expect and deserve no less."
