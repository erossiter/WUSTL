SEN. FRIST RESPONDS TO SNOW'S COMMENTS ON COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES REFORM
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today after Treasury Secretary John Snow's comments on reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS):  
   "I welcome Secretary Snow's comments this morning regarding the need to reform the CFIUS review process. The current interagency process needs transformation to reflect today's challenges while providing more transparency and a greater role for Congress. 
   "Congress has an important oversight role in these and other foreign commerce issues, but we must strike a balance that allows appropriate Congressional review while preserving the integrity and independence of the CFIUS process. 
   "We must balance the need to maintain an open and welcome environment for foreign direct investment with the duty to protect the American people and our nation's security. I look forward to working with Chairman Shelby and other interested members in the coming weeks as the Senate devises bipartisan legislation that will strike an appropriate balance." 
   The CFIUS is responsible for reviewing proposed mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions under United States law.
