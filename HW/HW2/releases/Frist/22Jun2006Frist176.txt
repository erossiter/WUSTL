SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON MAGEN DAVID ADOM'S ACCEPTANCE BY INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) accepted the memberships of Magen David Adom (MDA) and the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) at the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in Geneva, Switzerland:  
   "After nearly 60 years, the International Committee of the Red Cross has done the right thing and admitted the Magen David Adom as a full member. While I personally would have preferred straightforward recognition of both the MDA and its traditional protective emblem, this outcome demonstrates, once again, that the Israeli people will compromise for the sake of peace and understanding. I am grateful to International Red Cross President Kellenberger and all International Red Cross members for their work." 
   "I also welcome the Palestinian Red Crescent Society to the International Committee of the Red Cross." 
   Formed in 1930 in Tel Aviv, the MDA is Israel's national emergency relief service. On a yearly basis, the MDA serves some 600,000 Israelis with its fleet of ambulances while providing 98 percent of all blood needs for the society. The MDA has served in crisis spots around the world for 50 years bringing aid to victims of hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.
   After Hurricane Katrina, MDA helped collect donations, clothing and equipment in Israel to help meet the needs of hurricane victims along the Gulf Coast of the United States. In the aftermath of the Southeast Asian tsunamis, MDA operated two emergency clinics in Sri Lanka to assist in the relief and recovery efforts. The ICRC made the PRC's acceptance contingent upon the MDA's approval.
