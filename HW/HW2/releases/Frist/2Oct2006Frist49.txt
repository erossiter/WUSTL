SENS. FRIST, MARTINEZ VISIT AFGHANISTAN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.) spent the day in Kabul and Qalat, Afghanistan, where they had the opportunity to meet with President Hamid Karzai, visit a local hospital, spend some time with home state troops and receive briefings from military personnel.  
   In Qalat, a small town two hours south of Kabul, they were able to meet with troops who are working side-by-side with Romanian troops, the Afghan National Army and Police as well as USAID, the State Department and USDA to rebuild infrastructure and train local Afghans to maintain and sustain what is being built. 
   Senator Frist had the distinct honor of awarding the Purple Heart to Captain Lydia King of New Jersey, who sustained injuries from an IED. Senator Martinez also had the honor of awarding an increase in rank to Thomas C. Williams of Tampa, Florida, from major to lieutenant colonel.
