SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF SENATE RESOLUTION ON INTERNET TAX BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today hailed passage of a Senate resolution to the S. 150, "The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act." S. 150 will extend for four years the ban on state taxation of internet access. 
   "Today's vote paves the way for the House to pass and send S. 150 to the President. This bill will make certain that Tennessee's internet users continue to be protected from multiple and discriminatory internet access taxes. I applaud the Senate's passage of this bill, and look forward to making sure that internet access is a reality for citizens throughout Tennessee and across America."
   The "Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act" amends the "Internet Tax Freedom Act" to extend for four years the ban on state taxation of internet access. Today's resolution instructs the enrolling clerk to make two technical changes to the "Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act" which will preclude the need for a formal conference before the bill is signed by the President.
