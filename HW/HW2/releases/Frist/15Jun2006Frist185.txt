SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS NISSAN GROUNDBREAKING
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding today's groundbreaking ceremony in Franklin for Nissan's North American headquarters: 
   "Today's groundbreaking further cements Tennessee's status as a prime place to do business. I congratulate the many community leaders who have worked so hard to bring this event to fruition. Creating more than 1,000 new high-quality jobs in Middle Tennessee will only further strengthen our state's competitiveness in the 21st century's global economy. Nissan's wise decision to relocate to the Nashville area makes it the latest in a series of companies to discover that Tennessee is a great place to live and work. I join my fellow Tennesseans in welcoming Nissan's North American headquarters to our state."
