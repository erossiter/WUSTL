SEN. FRIST LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following Senate passage of the Foreign Operations Appropriations conference report:  
   "This critical funding will help ensure America's government agencies have the resources they need to effectively coordinate and promote our diplomatic, intelligence, economic and military interests abroad. Our nation's security depends upon our ability to integrate and coordinate these efforts to promote our nation's values and national interests. Supporting developing democracies creates stability and promotes peace, and this funding is a critical investment in our national security. 
   "I also want to highlight the inclusion of a provision I sponsored that will provide $200 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote safe water programs in poor and developing counties. In particular, this bill allocates $50 million for programs in Africa where clean water is absolutely critical in leading to improved hygiene and health outcomes. This unprecedented provision is a down-payment in our efforts to promote access to clean water around the globe. I'm proud of its inclusion in the bill, and look forward to the Senate addressing my larger bill, "Safe Water: A Currency for Peace" (S. 492) so that we can continue advancing our foreign policy objectives by saving lives and promoting peace." 
   The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations conference report, which has already passed the House, must now be signed by the president before it becomes law.
