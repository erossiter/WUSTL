SEN. FRIST REELECTED AS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today was unanimously approved by his Senate Republican colleagues to serve as Senate Majority Leader for the 109th Congress.  
 Republican Senators met earlier today to vote on leadership positions. Sen. Frist was unopposed for Majority Leader. 
   "I'm honored to once again be part of the Senate leadership team and want to thank my Republican colleagues for their support," said Frist. "Our mission over the next Congress is really very clear. We must move America forward toward a safer, healthier and more prosperous nation. Improving America's health care, education, and highways as well as creating jobs, promoting energy independence and further securing our homeland are all on our agenda for the American people. I'm confident that in the days and months ahead, we will work together, across party lines, to fulfill our duty to the Congress and to the American people."     
   The Senate Republican Caucus met earlier today for a closed-door session to vote on Senate leadership and the organizational conference for the 109th Congress.
