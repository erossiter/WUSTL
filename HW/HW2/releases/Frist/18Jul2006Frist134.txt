SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING U.S. SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on the Senate resolution reaffirming U.S. support for Israel in the wake of unprovoked Hezbollah and Hamas attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians: 
   "I applaud my Senate colleagues for their overwhelming support of this resolution, which reaffirms America's support for the State of Israel in its fight against Hezbollah and Hamas terrorists who continue to target Israeli soldiers and civilians. This resolution also makes clear that the governments of Syria and Iran must be held accountable for these acts against Israel. The Senate has spoken loud and clear: Israel has the right to defend itself against aggression. While I urge the Israeli government to act carefully, there should be no doubt as to where we stand in this conflict."
