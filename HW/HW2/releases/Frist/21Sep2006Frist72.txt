SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS AGREEMENT ON TERRORIST DETAINEE LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding an agreement reached between Republican Senators and the White House on terrorist detainee legislation: 
  "Throughout this debate, my goal has been to ensure that the C.I.A. detainment and interrogation program can continue and the prosecution of terrorist combatants held in Guantanamo can begin with adequate protections for classified intelligence information. Today's agreement achieves my objectives and is a huge breakthrough in the war on terror.
  "Senate Republicans stand united with the President in our commitment to bringing terrorists to justice. I look forward to taking this bill to the Senate floor next week."
