  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following President Bush's nomination of Rep.  
 Rob Portman (R-OH) as U.S. trade representative: 
   "Congressman Portman is an outstanding candidate to serve as America's trade representative. Our nation's economic strength at home depends on the quality and accessibility of American products abroad. Furthermore, free trade leads to freedom and equality throughout the world. Throughout his career, Mr. Portman has consistently worked in a bipartisan way to craft fair trade policy. I'm confident that he has the skills and experience necessary to negotiate sound policies that will create jobs, promote growth and spread economic prosperity. I applaud President Bush for this nomination, and look forward to seeing Mr. Portman's swift confirmation by the Senate."
