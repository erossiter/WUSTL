SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS BOLTON RESIGNATION
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn) made the following statement on the resignation of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton:  
 "Throughout his career, Ambassador Bolton has proven to be a successful, effective diplomat, a tough negotiator, and an outstanding advocate of America's interests abroad. During his tenure as America's Ambassador to the United Nations, he has worked tirelessly to forge consensus at the Security Council on the most important issues facing the United States and the international community. He successfully negotiated strong Security Council resolutions on Iran, North Korea, Darfur, and Lebanon. And, he was a leading advocate of reform of the world body. 
 "Despite Ambassador Bolton's exceptional record, some in the Senate refused to grant him the courtesy of an up-or-down vote. While Ambassador Bolton was vigorously advancing America's interests at the United Nations, the Democrats were playing politics with his nomination. Ambassador Bolton and the American people deserve better. 
 "We all owe a great debt of gratitude to John Bolton for his exemplary performance as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and for a remarkable career of public service. I commend him for his extraordinary efforts on behalf of the United States and thank him for his unwavering defense of America's interests at the United Nations."
