SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH TAX
  The following statement was placed in the record today from U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) upon the filing of his amendment to immediately and permanently repeal death tax:  
   "I rise today in opposition to the cruelest and most unfair tax our government imposes. . . the death tax. 
   "The death tax destroys small businesses, it damages families, and it prevents job creation. 
   "The death tax forbids hardworking people from passing on their assets to spouses, children, friends, and loved ones. 
   "It damages farms, newspapers, shops, and factories. 
   "Let me make my principles clear: Americans spend their lives paying taxes, death should not be a taxable event. 
   "A typical family spends between $30,000 and $150,000 simply planning to avoid this tax. 
   "$150,000. . . . Enough to start a business and create dozens of jobs. . . .all of it wasted simply trying to avoid this unjust tax. 
   "The death tax is immoral. 
   "It needs to go. 
   "We have already begun to cut the death tax and current law will complete its phase-out in 2010. 
   "But, on January 1st, 2011, the death tax will spring back to life. 
   "And, Mr. President, it will rise to confiscatory levels. 
   "That's why I have filed an amendment today that will abolish the death tax, immediately and forever, effective January 1st, 2006. 
   "If we do not act, the death tax will come back to haunt our children's' futures. 
   "I urge all of my colleagues to join me in ending the sway of this terrible tax once and for all."
