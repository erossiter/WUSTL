SEN. FRIST HIGHLIGHTS POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN CARS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today attended a demonstration of the potential of hydrogen-powered cars on Capitol Hill.  
 Frist also applauded the provisions in the comprehensive energy bill that encourage development of clean and affordable energy alternatives. 
   "Today's demonstration reflects the limitless potential of alternative fuel sources to keep our economy humming, fueled by independent, clean, reliable and affordable energy," said Frist. "These innovative alternative energy technologies are hardly pipedreams for the future, but real possibilities that now rest just beyond our grasp. I'm particularly proud that just this past week, Nissan announced its first hybrid vehicle will be built at the Smyrna plant in Tennessee. 
   "Today's demonstration and last week's announcement prove that with a thoughtful and serious commitment to exploring the potential of these revolutionary technologies, we can identify safe, reliable, clean and secure sources of energy and usher in a new era of national prosperity and security. I call on all of my colleagues to pass this common-sense energy legislation that will keep America's families safe, strong and secure."
   Senator Frist joined with his colleague Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to see first-hand how hydrogen-fueled vehicles are cleaner and more affordable energy alternatives. The Senate continues to debate the comprehensive energy bill this week.
