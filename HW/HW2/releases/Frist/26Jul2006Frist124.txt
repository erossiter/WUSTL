SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF CFIUS REFORM
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2006, a bill making changes to the review process conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS):  
   "Today the Senate took an important step by passing CFIUS reform legislation. This bill strengthens the CFIUS review process in a number of ways, including by explicitly establishing a system of Congressional notification that had previously been lacking. The United States benefits tremendously from foreign investment and the high-paying jobs and economic growth it creates. This bill strikes a careful balance between continuing to welcome this investment and ensuring that Congress has an appropriate role in reviewing transactions that impact our nation's homeland security."
   CFIUS has the primary responsibility within the Executive Branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the United States and for coordinating the implementation of United States policy on such investment. Congress initiated the CFIUS review process following the proposed acquisition of commercial operations at six U.S. ports by Dubai Ports World, an established port operator owned by the government of the Emirate of Dubai.
