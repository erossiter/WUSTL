SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES FOOD ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2006
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and he introduced the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2006:  
   "Most Americans have been touched directly or indirectly by food allergies. For too many children, simple food in the cupboard can be deadly. Planning and rapid response can make the difference between life and death. The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2006 would help to establish uniform management guidelines in schools that would assure a prompt response when a child suffers a potentially fatal reaction." 
   The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2006 would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to develop uniform, voluntary food allergy management guidelines, that schools should be encouraged to adopt and implement. It also provides for school-based food allergy management incentive grants to local educational agencies to assist such agencies with adoption and implementation of food allergy management guidelines in public k-12 schools.
