SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO NATION
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) this evening made the following statement following President Bush's address to the nation regarding Hurricane Katrina:  
   "In tonight's speech the president outlined a bold and optimistic vision for restoring communities throughout the gulf region. The awesome scale of this rebuilding effort is surpassed only by the inspiring talents and generosity of the millions of Americans who continue opening their arms to care for their fellow citizens. 
   "Though we cannot recreate the past, we can build a stronger and more prosperous future for our friends and neighbors throughout the region. We will rebuild New Orleans and other gulf coast cities in that battered region. We will make prudent use of federal resources using taxpayer money wisely and effectively. We will see this through and bring opportunity and vibrancy back to the region. 
   "I stand by President Bush in his pledge to aid all those affected by this violent storm, and will work with my colleagues to ensure Congress acts swiftly and decisively in helping rebuild this battered region. I applaud the president for his commitment, and remain truly inspired by all Americans who've selflessly shared their hearts, homes and resources with our neighbors in their time of great need."
