SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO COMBAT HEALTH DISPARITIES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after introducing the Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act:  
   "The disparities that plague our health care system are troubling and unacceptable. Regardless of race or economic background, every American should have access to quality, affordable health care. 
   "Through increased research, education and communication, this bill can help eradicate health disparities. I thank my cosponsors for their dedication to this issue and look forward to advancing this legislation through the same bipartisan spirit in which it was conceived." 
   The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act establishes new programs and amplifies existing efforts to address health disparities. It enhances the NIH National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and restructures the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparity Elimination, allowing for improved outreach and better interdepartmental and interagency communication. The bill also codifies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) grant program and directs resources toward strengthening the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP). 
   Frist has authored several pieces of legislation targeting health care disparities throughout his career. Among those are: the Closing the Health Care Gap Act of 2004, the Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2001, Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000 and the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. 
   Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) coauthored the legislation.
