SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECRETARY SNOW'S RESIGNATION, HENRY PAULSON JR.'S NOMINATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement: 
   "Over the past 3 years, Secretary Snow has ably led the Department of the Treasury and skillfully helped the President create remarkable economic growth. His tenure was a key part of the economic growth which produced 5.3 million jobs and unemployment at 4.7%- lower than the averages of the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s. Secretary Snow was also a strong advocate against protectionism. He had a keen understanding of the unique leading role the U.S. plays, and will continue to play, in an ever changing and enlarging global economy. I commend Secretary Snow for his service and dedication to the American people and wish him well in his future endeavors" 
   "I commend the President for nominating Hank Paulson. I know Mr. Paulson well and believe he is an excellent choice to take the helm of the Treasury Department. The President and the economy will benefit greatly from his hands on experience in financial markets and understanding of business, investing and economic growth. I have confidence in the President's choice and hope that the Senate will be able to confirm his nomination as quickly as possible."
