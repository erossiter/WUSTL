SEN. FRIST HAILS PASSAGE OF DISCIPLINED EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after Senate passage of the emergency supplemental conference report: 
   "Republicans are cracking down on excessive Washington spending, and this supplemental proves we're on the right track. Republican-led efforts ensured the bill didn't exceed the President's emergency request while focusing our resources on the critical priorities of border security, the War on Terror, hurricane recovery, and pandemic flu preparedness. It also caps next year's discretionary spending at the fiscally responsible level requested by the President - another important aspect of maintaining fiscal discipline."
   "We've made considerable progress toward limiting unnecessary and wasteful spending while debating this supplemental. But more can be done. That's why I'm a proud co-sponsor of Chairman Gregg's Stop Over-Spending legislation. It reestablishes statutory spending caps, institutes a legislative line item veto, and establishes a two-year budget and appropriation cycle. These and the chairman's other proposed changes to the budget process are long overdue, and they go a long way toward strengthening fiscal discipline. Families must live within their means and so should Washington."
