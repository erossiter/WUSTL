SPEAKER HASTERT, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST ISSUE JOINT STATEMENT ON TERRI SCHIAVO LEGISLATION
  Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist released the following statement today:  
   "We're pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement on legislation which provides an opportunity to save Mrs. Schiavo's life. This legislation will allow a federal district judge to consider a claim by or on behalf of Mrs. Schiavo for alleged violations of Constitutional rights or federal laws relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life. We want to thank Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid for working with us towards a legislative solution. The House and Senate will act as quickly as possible to send this legislation to the President for his signature." 
   The Senate will meet today at 5:00 p.m. to pass an adjournment. Passing an adjournment resolution will enable the Speaker and me to bring both the House and Senate back into session under our emergency powers. The House will meet at 1:00pm on Sunday, March 20th in the hope of receiving unanimous consent to take up the measure. If unanimous consent cannot be attained, the measure will be considered on the House Suspension Calendar as early as 12:01 a.m. Monday, March 21. The Senate will continue to work through the weekend to ensure the bill can be passed shortly after the House has acted.
