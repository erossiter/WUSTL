SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE KATRINA
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the devastation left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina: 
   "My heart goes out to the victims and their families," said Frist. "As the rescue and recovery efforts continue throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, we are witnessing the incredible courage and fortitude of the first responders, who have already saved hundreds of people. The scope of this storm is unimaginable as it has moved into Tennessee endangering our communities with heavy rains and high winds. I will watch closely for damage in our state and I know that my fellow Tennesseans will respond with care and compassion to those at home and in the Gulf Coast region.
   "With many homes destroyed and hundreds of thousands without power, it is critical that rescue workers deliver vital food, water, and shelter to citizens in the worst hit areas. I will closely monitor the relief effort, working with the administration and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee to see what federal aid is needed and how best to deliver it. I encourage all Americans to keep the hurricane victims in their thoughts and prayers."
