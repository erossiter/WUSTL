SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON FINDINGS OF HURRICANE KATRINA INVESTIGATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released its report on the government response to Hurricane Katrina: 
   "Today's report on Hurricane Katrina is a very valuable tool for improving the nation's emergency preparedness. I commend Senator Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman for working together on this bipartisan investigation. This project was launched at my request last fall after the Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid obstructed our efforts to create a bicameral select committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina.
   "As America faces another hurricane season and a possible avian flu epidemic, it is vital that all levels of government be prepared to respond promptly and effectively to citizens in need. I urge federal, state and local officials to closely review the report."
