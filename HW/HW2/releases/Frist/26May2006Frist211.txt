SEN. FRIST HAILS CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate voted to confirm the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   "Today the Senate fulfilled its constitutional duty of advice and consent by giving Brett Kavanaugh the fair up-or-down vote he has waited three years to receive. Mr. Kavanaugh is an eminently qualified nominee of considerable experience and distinction. He will make an excellent appellate judge. As Majority Leader, I am committed to confirming additional judicial nominees to the bench who will practice judicial restraint and interpret the law strictly and impartially." 
   Kavanaugh is the 45th circuit judge nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate. President Bush's nominees have the highest confirmation rate of any president since Ronald Reagan. 
   The overall vacancy rate for federal judges is now 5.7 percent, with a vacancy rate of 8.9 percent for circuit court judges. The vacancy rates for federal district and circuit courts have declined steadily since Frist became Majority Leader.
