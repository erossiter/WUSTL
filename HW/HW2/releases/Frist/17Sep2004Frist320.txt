SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE $10.6 MILLION FOR TENNESSEE PARK, FOREST PROJECTS
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Interior Appropriations Bill, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, includes more than $10 million to support Tennessee's forest, conservation, and park priorities. 
   "Tennessee parks and forests are a vital part of what makes this state exceptional," said Frist. "This bill supports our ability to preserve natural resources like our hardwood forests while maintaining the beauty and splendor of landmarks like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I commend my colleagues in the Senate for ensuring the best of Tennessee is preserved for future generations to enjoy."  
   "These are significant investments by the Senate Appropriations Committee to protect parks and wildlife in Tennessee and across the country," said Alexander. "Tennesseans value our precious natural resources. Senator Frist and I appreciate this funding and will work with our colleagues on full Senate passage." 
   Some of the key Tennessee projects in the Senate version of the FY05 Interior Appropriations Bill include: 
   * $500,000 for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Institute at Tremont to begin planning and design work on a new, more advanced educational center. Each year, more than 4,000 students and teachers from 13 states visit the Park through Tremont. 
   * $1.15 million for the Lower Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge to acquire more than 560 acres of bottomland hardwood forest in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Federal acquisition, restoration, and management will reduce sedimentation, other water-borne contaminations, and altered hydrology by restoring altered watercourses. 
   * $750,000 for the Chickasaw National Wildlife Refuge to purchase two tracts of land containing 788 acres near Ripley, TN, in the western part of the state. These tracts are two of the largest areas within the boundary of the Chickasaw National Wildlife Refuge that contain significant stands of mature bald cypress, and their acquisition is essential to the long term objective of conserving naturally occurring habitats of the Lower Mississippi River Valley ecosystem. 
   * $1.5 million for the Cherokee National Forest to purchase land in the Rocky Fork Tract located in the Tri-Cities area. This funding will be used to acquire key areas along the Appalachian Trail and protect critical natural resources, including wildlife habitat and fragile mountain watersheds. 
   * $4.1 million for the acquisition of the Walls of Jericho Tract, located on the south Cumberland Plateau on the Tennessee and Alabama border. The tract and surrounding lands offer some of the most biologically important regions for both aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal species in the Southeast United States. 
   * $1.5 million for the acquisition of the Scott's Gulf Tract, more than 2,800 acres located in east Tennessee. The preservation of this property will improve water quality and protect habitat for a listed endangered species, the Indiana bat. 
   * $400,000 for the Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area. The Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area is a statewide partnership with the National Park Service and it is the only statewide National Heritage Area, as well as the only National Heritage Area administered by a public university in the nation. 
   * $700,000 for the Memphis Port of Entry to establish Memphis as an entry point for wildlife and wildlife products to the United States. The establishment of this port of entry reinforces Memphis' role as one of our nation's most important cargo hubs. 
   * $44 million increase for National Park Service base operating budgets. This is double the amount of the budget request and will support critical needs in our national parks. 
   The FY05 Interior Appropriations Bill must now be considered by the full Senate.
