SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE COMMITTEE ACTION TO PROMOTE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after legislation promoting electronic health records was reported out of both the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Ways and Means. In November, the Senate unanimously passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act - bipartisan legislation coauthored by Frist that creates a secure, interoperable health information technology (IT) infrastructure that, in conjunction with the quality measurement system established in the legislation, will help reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and improve overall patient care: 
   "Electronic medical records can improve health care quality, protect patient privacy, promote the secure exchange of lifesaving information, and seamlessly integrate health care quality standards with information technology. At the same time, utilizing health information technology can reduce waste, inefficiency, medical errors, and costs. This is an essential advance to create a truly patient-centered health care system. The sooner the House moves, the sooner Congress can work out our differences and send the legislation to the President's desk."
   "Chairman Barton and Chairman Thomas are to be commended for bringing us one step closer toward transforming our health care system, truly bringing it into the 21st century through the use of health information technology. I appreciate the commitment of Speaker Hastert and Leader Boehner to quickly pass legislation promoting the secure electronic exchange of health information."
