SEN. FRIST PROMOTES THREE IN SENATE LEADERSHIP OFFICE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today announced staff changes in his leadership office.  
   He named Bob Stevenson as his senior communications counselor. Stevenson has worked on Capitol Hill for over 20 years, serving as the Majority Leader's communications director since 2003. Prior to that, Stevenson served as communications director to the Senate Budget Committee, and worked for former Senator Warren Rudman (R-NH). 
   Frist named Amy Call as his communications director. Call has served as his deputy communications director since 2005, and his press secretary from 2003-05. Previously she worked in the Bush administration in the Office of Management and Budget and prior to that, as press secretary to the Senate Budget Committee. 
   Frist named Rohit Kumar as director of policy and senior counsel. Kumar has served as counsel in the Majority Leader's office since 2003. Previous to his work for the Majority Leader, Kumar served in the office of former Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX). 
   "We've got a strong agenda this year, and a strong team to serve our conference," said Frist. "These promotions will best help to advance my agenda of keeping spending down and taxes low, of driving towards energy independence and job creation, of helping our kids be ready to learn and keep their jobs in the 21st century, of tackling high health care costs and ensuring that America is strong and safe. I am gratified all three have agreed to take on these new tasks."
