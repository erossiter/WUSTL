SEN. FRIST HAILS CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the Commerce Department announced the economy grew at a rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006, which is a revision of previous estimates of 5.3 percent GDP: 
   "The revised GDP rate shows our economy is growing at its fastest rate in two-and-a-half years and faster than any major industrialized nation. With record low unemployment levels and 56 consecutive months of economic expansion, the U.S. economy is undeniably healthy and strong. The Republican majority will continue to advance the commonsense policies that fueled this remarkable growth and generated 5.3 million new jobs."
