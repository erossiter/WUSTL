SEN. FRIST'S SMART LEGISLATION BRINGS NEW EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today praised passage of his SMART Grants legislation as part of the deficit reduction bill. SMART Grants, a new student aid initiative, represent a dramatic step toward promoting math and science education and ensuring America's economic competitiveness in the future.  
   "China and India are generating scientists and engineers at a furious pace while America lags dangerously behind," said Frist. "Study after study calls for the government to act to address this problem. Passage of this program represents real action. Often, students are deterred from studying time-intensive degrees in math and science. SMART Grants provide them the extra incentive they need to graduate with these degrees. SMART Grants will help sustain America's global legacy as a land of innovation, imagination, and initiative." 
   SMART Grants provide Pell Grant eligible students: 
   * $4000 grants per year to students who maintain a 3.0 GPA and major in math, science, engineering, technology or foreign languages critical to national security during their third and fourth years of study at a higher education institution. 
   Academic Competitiveness Grants provide Pell Grant eligible students: 
   * $750 grants to first year students who complete a rigorous high school program; and 
   * $1300 grants to second year students who completed a rigorous high school program and maintain a 3.0 GPA in college. 
   President Bush and Chairman Boehner (R-Ohio) deserve praise and credit for their leadership on these Academic Competitiveness grants. 
   To be eligible for a SMART Grant, a student must qualify for a Federal Pell Grant and enroll in an eligible postsecondary academic program, as determined by the Secretary of Education. The SMART Grant program and Academic Competitiveness programs together are authorized at $3.75 billion over five years and are paid for with program savings included in the budget deficit reduction bill.
