SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF COMBATING AUTISM ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the passage of the Combating Autism Act of 2006:  
   "Tonight the Senate passed the Combating Autism Act of 2006 which reauthorizes provisions of the Children's Health Act of 2000. I want to thank Sen. Santorum for taking the lead on bringing this important bill to the floor and for all my other colleagues who started this fight with the bill in 2000. 
   "Although progress has been made, challenges remain that highlight the importance of this legislation to all of us who are affected by Autism." 
   The Combating Autism Through Research, Screening, Intervention, and Education Act reauthorizes provisions in the Children's Health Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-310), which was authored by Senators Frist, Kennedy, and Dodd. The Children's Health Act of 2000 expanded, intensified, and coordinated NIH autism-related activities. It also established Centers of Excellence on autism research and improved education and awareness. 
   Sen. Frist requested a report by the General Accountability Office (GAO) in preparation to reauthorize the autism provisions of the Children's Health Act of 2000. It evaluates federal autism activities and highlights the many challenges that remain in federal autism efforts addressed by the Combating Autism Act.
