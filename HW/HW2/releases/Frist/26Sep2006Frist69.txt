SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after he and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) introduced the National Competitiveness Investment Act. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) is one of 12 additional bill sponsors:  
   "Today, in an act of true bipartisanship, Senator Reid and I introduced the National Competitiveness Investment Act. This bill will help to preserve America's competitive edge in the 21st century global economy and will enhance our economic security. 
   "I want to thank Senator Alexander for his tremendous leadership on the issue of economic competitiveness. He is a tireless advocate for education and other initiatives that will keep America's economy strong in the global marketplace. Working with him to develop this legislation has been a true pleasure." 
   The legislation would among other things: 
   * Authorize a doubling of the funding for basic federal research over the next five years at the National Science Foundation and significantly expand funding for basic research at National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy's Office of Science and NASA; 
   * Recruit and train needed new math and science teachers; 
   * Create a new Teachers Institute to improve the teaching techniques for math and science; 
   * Create a DARPA-modeled advanced research projects agency at the Department of Energy dedicated to the goal of increasing innovation and competitive breakthroughs in technology; 
   * Expand scholarship programs to recruit and train math and science teachers at the K-12 level; 
   * Encourage more students to take Advanced Placement courses and enter International Baccalaureate programs; and 
   * Increase funding for "early career" researchers. 
   Earlier this year, President Bush signed into law Frist's SMART grant program, which encourages students to pursue courses of study that will help keep America's economy competitive for future generations. The program provides $4,000 grants per year to eligible low-income students who major in math, science, engineering, technology or foreign languages critical to national security during their third and fourth years of study at a higher education institution and who hold at least a 3.0 grade point average. To be eligible for a SMART grant, a student must qualify for a federal Pell grant and enroll in an eligible postsecondary academic program as determined by the Secretary of Education.
