SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON MAUPIN'S NOMINATION TO SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after the White House announced its intention to nominate Dr.  
 John Maupin, Jr. to the Social Security Advisory Board. Dr. Maupin will serve the remainder of a six-year term expiring on September 30, 2010. 
   "Dr. Maupin is a true Tennessee leader. One doesn't have to look further than his leadership at the Meharry Medical School to see his dedication to positively shaping the future. I'm pleased the president has called upon John to serve our country in this way. He is a distinguished individual who will bring insight and intellect to the Social Security Advisory Board. Addressing the future of Social Security will take the best and brightest minds, and Dr. Maupin more than qualifies. I've been honored to work with John on many occasions and I believe the president couldn't have made a better choice."
