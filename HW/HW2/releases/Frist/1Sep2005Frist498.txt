  House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) will convene the Senate this evening, Thursday, September 1, 2005, and the House tomorrow, Friday, September 2, 2005.  
 Under the Adjournment Resolution passed on July 29, 2005, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader can reconvene Congress for matters of public interest. Speaker Hastert and Senator Frist made the following statement regarding the emergency session:
   "The Administration notified the leadership of the Congress earlier today that FEMA was running low on funds for immediate assistance and would need funds sooner than the next regularly scheduled session, September 6. Upon this notification, we immediately consulted with Leader Pelosi and Leader Reid and we all agreed to invoke our emergency powers and called the Congress to reconvene. 
   "We also agreed to pass the emergency supplemental by unanimous consent so we can move quickly, and time will not be spent waiting to reconvene our members. The House will pass an emergency supplemental bill tomorrow; the bill will be immediately sent to the Senate, passed and be available for the President's signature."
   "In the wake of this disaster, the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, should know that the United States Congress stands ready to help them in their time of need."
