SEN. FRIST PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF HURRICANE TAX RELIEF MEASURE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement praising Senate passage of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 that includes valuable tax relief to aid the victims of the devastating Gulf Coast hurricanes.  
   "This simple legislation will speed a second round of critical tax relief to our brothers and sisters in the Gulf Coast region who are continuing to rebuild their battered homes and communities. These provisions are another example of the Republican Congress acting swiftly to meet its responsibilities to the victims of one of the worst hurricane seasons on record. 
   "I thank President Bush for remaining steadfast in his commitment to the people of the Gulf Coast by proposing many of these much needed tax benefits for families and businesses devastated by these hurricanes and his support for the funding necessary to speed the massive rebuilding effort. 
   "In the aftermath of this season's deadly hurricanes, our nation faced unprecedented challenges, and through the principled and thoughtful leadership of President Bush and my colleagues in Congress we will continue to deliver meaningful relief to the Gulf region."
