SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON SECOND QUARTER GDP
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Commerce Department announced that the American economy continued to grow in the second quarter: 
   "Our economy's second quarter growth was balanced in all areas - consumption, investments and exports. This is a clear indication that the economic growth will continue into the future. Nearly three years of job creation and 19 consecutive quarters of GDP growth show that we are on the right track. Republicans will keep advancing our pro-growth policies while working to ease the burden placed on American families by issues such as energy prices and health care costs."
