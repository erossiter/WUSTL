SEN. FRIST LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the FY07 Defense authorization conference report:  
   "This defense authorization bill provides our armed forces with the vital resources they need to wage the War on Terror. The Republican Congress has demonstrated clear and consistent support for the brave men and women who are defending our freedom across the globe. We have defeated multiple short-sighted efforts by Democrats to cut and run in Iraq, and we will continue leading with the knowledge that surrender is not a solution." 
   The bill authorizes nearly $463 billion for defense programs in the next fiscal year and $70 billion for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan that support the War on Terror.
