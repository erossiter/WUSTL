LEADERS COMMENT ON HOUSE-SENATE LEADERSHIP RETREAT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) released the following statement at the conclusion of their joint leadership retreat:  
   "The Republican leadership for both the U.S. House and Senate are deeply committed to restraining spending, reforming government so that it is more effective and efficient, and accomplishing this task by the end of this year. This leadership retreat allowed us to look at ways to achieve these goals and look forward to the future. 
   "Creating better lives for American families is our highest priority, and we are preparing an agenda that reflects that goal. We are improving national security in a way that will strengthen our armed forces and continue to provide our soldiers the tools they need to fight terrorism. We are focusing on economic security by creating the conditions businesses need to succeed so they can hire more workers, create more jobs and put more money in the pockets of American families. And, we are focusing on homeland security by improving border security and protecting the citizens who live and work in America's cities and towns. We believe these efforts combined will protect our citizens and allow American workers and families to prosper."
