SEN. FRIST PRAISES ANNOUNCEMENT OF GAS PRICE INVESTIGATIONS
  Yesterday U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) sent a letter to President Bush urging him to initiate federal investigations into possible price gouging and other anti-competitive practices. Sen. Frist made the following statement in response to today's announcement by the President of federal investigations into possible illegal manipulation of gas prices:  
  "The president's announcement is an important first step in bringing relief to millions of Americans affected by rising gas prices. Free markets work best when everyone follows the rules.
  "Reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil is vital to decreasing prices, but Democrats have repeatedly obstructed efforts to increase domestic oil production and expand use of alternative energy sources. The nation's drivers are experiencing the fruits of this misguided policy more than ever. I hope my Democratic colleagues will cooperate in allowing exploration of America's untapped energy resources.
  "The U.S. Senate stands ready to debate any legislative solutions suggested by the investigations as we continue to implement long-term policies to increase domestic production, conservation and refining capacity."
