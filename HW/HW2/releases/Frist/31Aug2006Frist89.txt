SEN. FRIST CONDEMNS IRANIAN DEFIANCE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment as mandated by the United Nations Security Council:  
   "By refusing to halt its uranium enrichment program, Iran has once again demonstrated its intent to defy the demands of the international community and continue its nuclear weapons program. Iran's repeated defiance, deception, and failure to fulfill its international obligations regarding its nuclear program cannot be allowed to continue. The international community must now act swiftly and decisively to enforce the Security Council's resolution and prevent this dangerous regime from developing nuclear weapons."
