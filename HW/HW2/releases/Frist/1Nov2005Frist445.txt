  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today applauded a $4 million grant to the Douglas Cherokee Economic Authority in Morristown through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Head Start program.  
   "I'm pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services continues to support children and families in the Morristown area," Frist said. "We owe the gift of education to all of our children, and Head Start helps ensure that Tennessee's underserved students are given every opportunity to succeed. Senator Alexander and I appreciate the commitment of HHS to the growth and development of all America's children." 
   "The Head Start program helps ensure that all of our children are given the opportunity to succeed," said Alexander. "I appreciate this important funding from the Department of Health and Human Services for Morristown's most precious resource, its children. I look forward to continuing working with my colleagues in on strengthening this valuable program." 
   The grant is $4,013,129 for the Douglas Cherokee Economic Authority to support Head Start projects. 
   The Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs which serve children from birth to age five, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
