SEN. FRIST PRAISES CONFIRMATION OF ROB PORTMAN AS OMB DIRECTOR
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate confirmed the nomination of U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget:  
   "As the economy continues to expand, America needs a budget director who will uphold the Republican policies that have led to record low unemployment and 55 months of sustained economic growth. During his tenure as U.S. Trade Representative, Rob Portman has proven himself a skillful, dedicated promoter of sound economic policies. I'm confident the extensive experience and impressive qualifications he brings to the Office of Management and Budget will help keep the nation's economy growing while reinforcing the need for fiscal discipline."
