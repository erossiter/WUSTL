SEN. FRIST RESPONDS TO CHAIRMAN ROBERTS' LETTER ON TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today sent the following response to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.).  
   Dear Mr. Chairman: 
   I received your letter dated September 18, 2006, indicating your interest in having the Select Committee on Intelligence consider legislation relating to the Terrorist Surveillance Program - a sensitive and critical intelligence program that helps track and identify terrorists before they can harm Americans or others around the world. Given the Intelligence Committee's expertise in these matters, which would supplement the careful work of the Judiciary Committee, I agree that your Committee should have an opportunity to review and consider these bills with an eye towards reaching bipartisan resolution on items within your jurisdiction. Therefore, I will withhold any possible floor consideration of terrorist surveillance legislation until after the close of business on Friday, September 22, 2006. 
   Thank you for the careful attention you have taken with these matters. I am hopeful that you can bring together members of your committee in a bipartisan way to add to the work spearheaded by Senator Specter and Senator DeWine, so as to place strong legislative protections around a lawful, Constitutional program that protects our country every day. I appreciate your efforts to further clear the way for swift floor action this year before we break at month's end. 
   Sincerely, 
   William H. Frist, M.D. 
  Majority Leader
