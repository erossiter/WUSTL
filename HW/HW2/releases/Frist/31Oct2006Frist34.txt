SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NORTH KOREA'S RETURN TO SIX PARTY TALKS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding China's announcement that North Korea has agreed to return to six party talks:  
  "The announcement that North Korea will return to the six party talks, if confirmed, is a positive step toward peacefully eliminating Kim Jong Il's nuclear weapons threat. The President's strategy has effectively isolated North Korea from its neighbors in the region and now appears to have returned that rogue regime to the negotiating table. Should another round of talks take place, the burden will be on North Korea to step back from the nuclear standoff that it has created. This will require North Korea to verifiably abandon all of its nuclear programs. North Korea will find itself isolated in trying to defend its actions, which was precisely the multilateral dynamic that President Bush was seeking to create when he established the six-party framework. I hope there will be another round of six party talks that will yield progress toward peace and security in Northeast Asia."
