SEN. FRIST HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF CORD BLOOD LEGISLATION
  U.S Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "I'm pleased that the Senate has finally acted to pass this commonsense legislation. This important bill will open up critical new research opportunities that are safe, ethically sound and will save lives. Cord blood technology is a proven means for producing cures and has the potential to improve the lives of millions. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Burr, Ensign, Brownback, Dodd and Reed for spearheading the effort to produce a bipartisan bill with broad support. By passing legislation that harnesses the potential of this life saving technology, we have given hope to millions across America and around the world and opened new opportunities for cures both now and in the future."
