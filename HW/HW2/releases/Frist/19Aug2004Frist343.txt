SEN. FRIST HAILS SAVINGS FOR TENNESSEANS UNDER NEW MEDICARE DISCOUNT DRUG CARD
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today hailed a new study recently released by the Healthcare Leadership Council which found that the typical Tennessee Medicare beneficiary could save $1,466 with the new Medicare prescription drug discount card. 
   The study, "Assessment of Beneficiary Savings in the Medicare Drug Discount Card Program," examined the savings available to seniors who sign up for the drug discount card, comparing the discount card prices with average statewide retail prices for the 150 drugs most commonly prescribed to seniors.
   "This study shows that Tennessee seniors can benefit significantly - more than 40 percent savings off the typical Tennessee senior's entire drug costs - through the new Medicare prescription drug discount card," said Frist. "I encourage all Tennesseans to take advantage of the many new benefits under the new Medicare law. Lower drug costs are just part of the much-needed reforms aimed at bringing Medicare up to par with the quality health care available today."
   According to the study, the average Tennessee senior will save $1,466 off their prescription drug costs over 18 months by participating in the Medicare-approved drug discount card program. With data showing that roughly 173,000 Tennessee residents will sign up for the card, the estimated prescription drug savings Tennessee residents will receive reaches $204 million.
   On a national level, the report finds that the typical American senior without drug benefits pays $3,515 a year for prescription drugs. However, Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the drug discount card could save $1,247 or about 36 percent off their prescription drug bill.
   The Healthcare Leadership Council, which commissioned the report, is a nonpartisan coalition of chief executives of companies and institutions from all health care sectors.
