SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF PANDEMIC AND ALL-HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously approved the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, of which he was an original coauthor with Sens. Burr, Enzi, and Kennedy:  
   "Building on lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina and September 11th, this bill provides federal, state, and local governments with the authorities and tools necessary to respond to all threats, whether natural, accidental, or deliberate in origin. Specifically, the bill defines and ensures federal leadership for public health and medical preparedness and response. It strengthens our public health infrastructure, expands medical surge capacity, and requires accountability at all levels.
   "Last year, the Senate HELP Committee also approved the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2006. Together, these two proposals represent a comprehensive approach to bolster our nation's preparedness and response to all threats, including avian flu. I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of such critical legislation." 
   The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act reauthorizes and builds upon the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-188), which was authored by Sen. Frist and Sen. Kennedy to address existing gaps in our nation's biodefense capabilities, as well as our public health infrastructure. In 2000, Frist and Kennedy sponsored the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000, which became law in November 2000.
