SEN. FRIST INTRODUCES IMPACT LEGISLATION TO REDUCE OBESITY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today introduced legislation aimed at reducing obesity, particularly among children and adolescents. The "Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act" (IMPACT Act) acknowledges the significant problems associated with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer, and combats these challenges by encouraging better nutrition and physical activity. 
   "Obesity is one of the most debilitating, expensive and preventable health conditions affecting Americans," said Frist. "By taking concrete action now to improve lifestyle habits and raise public awareness about nutrition and exercise, we can halt the spread of this dangerous and avoidable disease. This balanced and comprehensive bill takes an innovative approach by training more health professionals, mobilizing community organizations and collecting more information about obesity's costs and consequences. In conjunction with the Childhood Obesity Reduction Act, the legislation brings more attention and resources to addressing a problem which affects the health of all Americans. We know the serious consequences of obesity, and simply cannot allow this problem to linger. I call on my colleagues to pass this legislation swiftly, so we give the looming obesity crisis the attention and resources it deserves."
   The IMPACT Act addresses the growing public health problem of increasing rates of obesity, being overweight, and eating disorders, as well as the related serious chronic conditions. Given the complex set of factors contributing to the obesity crisis, this bill takes a broad approach to avoid relying on a single solution to this complex problem. Specifically this legislation would:
   * Add obesity, being overweight, and eating disorders to the list of priority conditions to be addressed by health professions' Title VII training grants and train practicing health professionals about proper methods to diagnose, treat and prevent obesity and eating disorders.
   * Authorize funds to create a demonstration program that funds community organizations to conduct a variety of activities which have demonstrated some benefit for curbing obesity and eating disorders.
   * Provide additional authority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent (CDC) to collect information regarding fitness levels and energy expenditure among children.
   * Allow states to use their Preventive Services Block Grant money for community education on improved nutrition and increased physical activity if they so choose.
   * Instruct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report on research that has been conducted on obesity treatment and prevention, what has been learned, and what future research should be pursued.
   This legislation is co-sponsored by, Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK). It was originally introduced in June 2003.
