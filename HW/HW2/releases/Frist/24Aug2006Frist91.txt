SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY FUNDING
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding border security funding included in both the FY07 Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense Appropriations Bills:  
   "The administration has responded aggressively to the border security crisis providing the Border Patrol with the manpower and tools needed to close off our broken border with Mexico. 
   "Ever since the 6,000 National Guard troops were deployed on the southwest border, we've seen a significant drop in illegal crossings as part of a broader offensive to end the failed 'catch and release' policies of the past. 
   "This fall, Congress must continue the momentum by sending legislation to the President that funds additional Border Patrol agents and detention beds as well as the border fencing and vehicle barriers that passed the Senate overwhelmingly this year. 
   "I will not allow us to miss the window of opportunity to make sustained progress in securing the border." 
   The FY07 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill passed the Senate in July and contains more than $14 billion for sea and land border defenses. This legislation authorizes funding for 1,000 new border patrol agents and 2,000 new detention beds. Having passed both houses of Congress, the bill awaits final passage after a House and Senate conference committee. 
   An amendment sponsored by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to the FY07 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill passed the Senate by a vote of 94 to 3. The measure will provide the Army National Guard with $1,829,100,000 for the construction of 370 miles of triple-layered fencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border. According to the amendment as passed in the Senate, the Department of Homeland Security will determine the location of the fencing and vehicle barriers.
