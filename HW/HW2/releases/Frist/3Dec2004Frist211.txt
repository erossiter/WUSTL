SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON HHS SECRETARY THOMPSON'S RESIGNATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement:  
   "Tommy Thompson has made lasting contributions to the quality of health care available in America. Working under President Bush's leadership, Secretary Thompson has helped implement landmark health care legislation, including the first comprehensive reforms to America's Medicare program in nearly 40 years. His leadership has been vital in our efforts to broaden the health safety net and strengthen America's defenses against bioterrorism. 
   "I have truly enjoyed working with Secretary Thompson over the past four years. His common-sense approach to health care has strengthened the security and effectiveness of our system, while ensuring more accessible and affordable care for all Americans. He's been a great colleague and friend, and I wish him and his family the best in this next chapter of their lives."
