SEN. FRIST PRAISES U.N. STATEMENT BANNING HUMAN CLONING
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following the the United Nation's General Assembly passing a non-binding statement urging governments to ban all forms of human cloning:  
   "I'm pleased by today's U.N. ruling urging the world's governments to outlaw human cloning. This is a resounding statement by the world community recognizing that medical research must be conducted within a moral framework. Human life is sacred and must be treated as such. Today's vote reflects the international community's overwhelming commitment to respecting life, and is another step towards eliminating the disturbing practice of human cloning." 
   Throughout his career, Senator Frist has been an advocate for a ban on human cloning. In 1998, he cosponsored legislation seeking a ban on human cloning.
