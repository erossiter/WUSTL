SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATUS OF IMMIGRATION REFORM CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding plans to appoint conferees to consider comprehensive immigration reform: 
   "I look forward to working with the House to further strengthen the comprehensive immigration reform passed by the Senate, and I thank Senator Reid for agreeing to let the conference process move forward. After the House finishes its hearings, we will begin the vital work of crafting a final bill. That legislation should focus first and foremost on strengthening border security to ensure the safety of the American people, but it must also address the status of the 12 million people here illegally and improve enforcement of our immigration laws in the workplace."
