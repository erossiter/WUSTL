SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF PORT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after passage of the Port Security Improvement Act:  
   "Securing our ports is the next critical step to plugging the holes in our porous borders and ensuring that Americans are kept safe and secure from terrorist plots. A significant choke point for transportation and economic activity, the U.S. maritime system includes more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3,700 cargo and passenger terminals. The Port Security Improvement Act strengthens cargo security programs, improves security training for port workers, and institutes protocols for reopening ports following a terrorist attack. We must keep America safe from the unimaginable horror of a terrorist-detonated nuclear bomb coming in through one of our ports. This bipartisan bill is crucial to that endeavor."
