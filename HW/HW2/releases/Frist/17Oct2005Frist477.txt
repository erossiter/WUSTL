SEN. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD OVER $3.6 MILLION IN HEAD START FUNDING FOR FAYETTEVILLE
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded a grant of over $3.6 million through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the South Central Human Resource Agency in Fayetteville.  
   "I'm pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services continues to support Fayetteville's children and families," Frist said. "We owe the gift of education to all of our children, and Head Start helps ensure that Tennessee's underserved students are given every opportunity to succeed. Senator Alexander and I appreciate the commitment of HHS to the growth and development of all America's children." 
   "Head Start programs have been beneficial to both communities and participants across Tennessee," Alexander said. "I'm very happy to see this investment in Fayetteville's children by the Department of Health and Human Services." 
   The grant is $3,697,530 for the South Central Human Resource Agency to support Head Start programs. 
   The Head Start program delivers comprehensive and high-quality services to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs which serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
