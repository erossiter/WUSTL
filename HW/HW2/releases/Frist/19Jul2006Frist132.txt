SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL VETO OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH FUNDING BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after President Bush signed legislation prohibiting fetus farming, the implantation and gestation of a human embryo in a human or animal for the purpose of aborting for research. The president also vetoed a bill expanding federal funding for embryonic stem cell research: 
   "I'm pleased the president signed the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act into law. I'm also hopeful that the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Act will soon become law. We should promote promising research methods and technologies that may help us bridge differences raised by research that requires the destruction of human embryos."
   "I am pro-life, but I disagree with the president's decision to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Given the potential of this research and the limitations of the existing lines eligible for federally funded research, I think additional lines should be made available."
