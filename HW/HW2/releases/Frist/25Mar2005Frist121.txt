SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON NEW NURSING HOME REGULATIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today regarding a new announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that nursing homes without sprinkler systems or hard-wired smoke detectors will have to install battery operated ones in patient rooms and public areas.  
 In 2003, Sen. Frist and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) requested an analysis by and recommendations from the Government Accountability Office on fire safety standards in nursing homes following deadly nursing home fires in Connecticut and Tennessee. 
   "This is a common-sense step that should greatly improve fire safety in our nation's nursing homes. As Tennesseans who experienced first-hand the devastation from these fires, we're grateful that out of this tragedy there has been an opportunity to learn and enhance safety for those who live in nursing homes. I hope that these steps will lead to preventing future needless tragedies. My heart goes out to those families who continue to feel pain from their loss. This new regulation shows that their loss was not in vain." 
   Following the fires in Tennessee and Connecticut, Frist requested this GAO report and also requested that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services examine additional steps that could be taken to improve fire safety in nursing homes across the country.
