SEN. FRIST PRESSES SECRETARY OF STATE RICE TO WORK FOR ABDUL RAHMAN'S IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today sent this letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to use every diplomatic means necessary to ensure the immediate release of Abdul Rahman, an Afghan man standing trial in Afghanistan for converting to Christianity. In his letter, Frist emphasizes that while the development of a democratic system in Afghanistan should reflect the character and tradition of the Afghan people, it must also embrace basic human rights including the right to worship freely. 
   Frist also sent a similar letter to Afghanistan's Foreign Ambassador, Mr. Said Tayeb Jawad.
