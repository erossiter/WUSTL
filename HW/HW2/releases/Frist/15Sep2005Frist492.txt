SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL DAY OF PUBLIC COMMITTEE QUESTIONING OF JUDGE ROBERTS
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following statement today following the conclusion of public committee questioning of Judge John Roberts:  
   "With the close of the public committee questioning of Judge Roberts, I believe it is clear Judge Roberts has all the qualifications and qualities that will make him an outstanding chief justice. Judge Roberts thrived in these hearings, providing articulate answers to tough questioning that prove he deserves to lead the Supreme Court of the 21st century. His superior qualifications and judicial temperament reflect a sophisticated understanding of the law, and of a judge's limited role to interpret the law rather than legislate from the bench. I commend Judge Roberts for his civility and composure throughout these hearings. 
   "I plan to begin floor consideration of Judge Roberts' nomination as soon as possible once the committee reports him, and will move forward to confirm John Roberts before October 3, so the Supreme Court can begin its term at full strength with a new chief justice."
