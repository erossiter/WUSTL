SEN. FRIST CRITICIZES LEVIN-REED AMENDMENT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement regarding the Levin-Reed amendment to the FY07 Defense Authorization Bill: 
   "This amendment effectively calls on the United States to cut and run from Iraq. Let me be clear: retreat is not a solution. Our national security requires us to follow through on our commitments. Artificial deadlines are not the solution - and those calling for an early withdrawal of American troops from Iraq utterly fail to understand the potentially catastrophic implications of their proposal. Cutting and running is bad policy that threatens our national security and poses unacceptable risks to Americans."
