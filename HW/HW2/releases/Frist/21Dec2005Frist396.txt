SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON EXTENSION OF PATRIOT ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement following Senate passage of a six-month extension of the USA Patriot Act:  
   "By unanimously agreeing to a six-month extension, the Senate endorsed the Patriot Act as an effective tool to fight terrorism - both now and in the future. It is clear that there is broad bipartisan support that the Patriot Act never should expire. This is a win for America's safety and security, and I'm pleased the Senate was able to rise above the partisan politics being played by the minority to do the right thing. We should build on this effort to strengthen these anti-terrorism tools, safeguard our civil liberties and permanently extend the remaining provisions."
