SEN. FRIST SUPPORTS AMENDMENT REQUIRING PHOTO IDENTIFICATION TO VOTE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after voting in favor of Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) amendment to comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The amendment would protect against voter fraud and ensure only U.S. citizens cast ballots by requiring citizens to present photo identification at the voting booth:  
   "Voting is one of our most cherished rights as Americans, but that right is subject to abuse unless we can verify that voters are who they say they are at the polls. We currently require photo identification to board a plane and drive a car but not to vote. Presenting photo ID at the voting booth is a simple, commonsense way to safeguard the right to vote for all Americans and allow citizens to be confident in the fairness and accuracy of election results." 
   A recent commission chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker recommended requiring photo identification at polling stations to reduce the chance of voter fraud. The amendment also establishes a grant program to provide photo identification to those who cannot afford such documentation.
