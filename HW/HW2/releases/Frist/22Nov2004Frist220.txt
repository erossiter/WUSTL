Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Omnibus Conference Report, which the Senate passed late Saturday, includes more than $43 million for specific Tennessee transportation projects. The conference report will now go to the President for his signature.

"This bill tackles critical transportation challenges, and takes strides to improve Tennessee's highways and airports, while addressing the transit needs of communities throughout Tennessee.
