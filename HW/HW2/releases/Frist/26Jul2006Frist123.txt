SEN. FRIST PRAISES PASSAGE OF CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following comments after the Senate passed the Child Custody Protection Act (S. 403): 
  "Today the Senate took yet another step to protect our nation's children. The health and well-being of minors, as well as the integrity of state laws, were at risk. Passing this legislation sends a clear signal that parental notification laws play an important role in protecting young people and must be respected."
   The Child Custody Protection Act, sponsored by Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), changes no state laws but will ensure that statutes requiring parental notification or consent in a child's abortion are honored. State law exceptions in cases of abuse or incest will not be affected. 
   Last week, the Senate passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which creates a national sex offender registry to close loopholes in current law that allow some sex offenders to evade law enforcement and put our children at risk. The legislation also contains provisions that will protect our children from violent crime and sexual exploitation, toughen criminal penalties for crimes against children, prevent child abuse and child pornography and combat Internet predators.
