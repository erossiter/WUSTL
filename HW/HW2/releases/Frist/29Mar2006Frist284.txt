SEN. FRIST CONGRATULATES OLMERT ON REPORTED ISRAELI ELECTION VICTORY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the reported victory of acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his Kadima Party in yesterday's elections in Israel:  
   "I congratulate acting Prime Minister Olmert and the Kadima party on their reported victory in yesterday's national elections in Israel. While we need to wait for all votes to be counted, I look forward to working with the Prime Minister and his new government. 
   "Under acting Prime Minister Olmert, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before him, Israel has demonstrated the willingness to make the difficult decisions necessary for peace in the Middle East. I am confident that acting Prime Minister Olmert will form a government that will continue along this path and pursue the established road map for peace. 
   "Israel is America's closest ally in the Middle East, and the special relationship between our two countries has endured since Israel's independence in 1948. The United States Senate and I will continue to be strong supporters of Israel and look forward to working with Prime Minister Olmert to achieve the vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security."
