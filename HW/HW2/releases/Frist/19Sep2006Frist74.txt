SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON FISHER CONFIRMATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after the Senate confirmed Alice Fisher as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice:  
   "Today's confirmation vote for Alice Fisher as America's lead criminal prosecutor is long overdue. Her confirmation is another step forward in making America safer. As head of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, she will continue focusing on investigating and prosecuting terrorism, violent crime, drug trafficking, corporate fraud, public corruption and child exploitation. Alice is a proven leader and a talented criminal prosecutor, and we are proud that she is willing to serve in this important role. 
   "I call on my fellow colleagues to stop obstructing other national security nominees such as Ken Wainstein and John Bolton. Both deserve a vote on the Senate floor."
