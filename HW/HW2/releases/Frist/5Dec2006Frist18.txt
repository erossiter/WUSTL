SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON UPCOMING IRAQ STUDY GROUP MEETING
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on tomorrow's meeting with the Iraq Study Group:  
 "I want to thank the members of the Iraq Study Group for their diligence in working on a comprehensive, consensus report on the future of Iraq. Each of their recommendations should be carefully studied as the administration conducts its own internal review of U.S. policy in the region. 
 "It is clear the American people are anxious to see a way forward in Iraq. Therefore, I call upon my colleagues in Congress to work together with the administration in a bipartisan way to produce a plan for victory. Any change in policy, however, that would diminish the flexibility of our commanders on the ground or sends a message to the enemy that the U.S. is abandoning the mission could have devastating consequences for the stability of the Iraqi government and the long term security of the Middle East, our coalition partners, and the United States."
