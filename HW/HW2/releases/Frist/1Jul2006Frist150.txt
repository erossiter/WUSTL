SEN. FRIST-AUTHORED SMART GRANTS NOW AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS
  Pell grant-eligible students in their third or fourth years of study who are majoring in fields directly impacting America's economic competitiveness may now receive SMART grants, a financial assistance program created by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.).  
   The U.S. Department of Education began allowing colleges and universities to draw down SMART funds today. This grant program provides $4,000 grants per year to eligible students who major in math, science, engineering, technology or foreign languages critical to national security during their third and fourth years of study at a higher education institution and who hold at least a 3.0 grade point average.
   Students need only complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid in order to apply for SMART grant assistance. Financial aid officers will then determine those students who should receive grant funding. 
   In addition, the Department of Education has now created a web site allowing students to apply for new Academic Competitiveness grants. This program provides $750 grants to eligible low-income first year students who complete a rigorous high school program and $1,300 grants to eligible low-income second year students who completed a rigorous high school program and maintain a 3.0 GPA in college. 
   The SMART grant program and Academic Competitiveness programs together are authorized at $3.75 billion over five years and are paid for with federal savings included in the Budget Deficit Reduction Act signed by President Bush in February.
