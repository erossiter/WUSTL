SENS. FRIST, MCCONNELL APPLAUD CONFIRMATION OF TWO JUDGES TO SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell today applauded confirmation of two new judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  
 The Senators issued the following statement after confirmation of the nominations of Richard Griffin and David McKeague:
   "These two new judges will have an immediate and positive impact on the overburdened legal process in the Sixth Circuit, which includes our home states of Tennessee and Kentucky. For too long, unprecedented judicial obstruction has delayed and denied justice to the 30 million residents of the Sixth Circuit. In the last few years, the Sixth Circuit had the highest judicial vacancy rate and the slowest appeals process in the nation. This situation has been unfair to our constituents whose cases have been allowed to languish in our courts and unfair to the judges forced to manage even heavier caseloads. We're pleased that the Senate is now standing on principle to confirm judges with fair up or down votes."
   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals includes Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.
