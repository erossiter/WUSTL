SEN. FRIST HAILS MARCH JOB FIGURES
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the announcement by the Department of Labor that 5,500 new jobs were created in Tennessee in March, bringing the total of new jobs created since last year to 34,000:  
   "The good news about the economy just keeps coming. Month after month, our economy is generating new jobs. Tennessee's unemployment rate continues to decline, dropping from 5.6 percent to 5.1 percent in the past year. 
   "Republican-passed tax cuts have led to a national unemployment rate that is lower than the average of each of the past three decades. In the past 31 months, 5.2 million jobs have been created, resulting in an unemployment rate of just 4.7 percent. 
   "It is vital that we extend the tax cuts that have fueled such extraordinary economic growth. As the Senate debates budget issues in the coming weeks, I am committed to maintaining the commonsense, conservative policies that will keep the economy strong."
