SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST PLOT TARGETING U.K.-U.S. FLIGHTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding the disclosure of a terrorist plot targeting flights from the United Kingdom to the United States: 
   "I commend all those involved in foiling this latest terrorist plot. The news out of London today is disturbing and reminds us that the War on Terror is a global battlefield with many fronts. We must act decisively, aggressively, and innovatively, in a way that will protect Americans and our allies that have stood with us in this fight."
   "This investigation is ongoing and there is still much that we do not know. The increased security precautions being implemented around the country are appropriate and necessary. We must be on alert so that our nation does not suffer another attack like 9/11."
