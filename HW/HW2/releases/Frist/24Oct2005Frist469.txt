SEN. FRIST CALLS FOR SYRIAN COOPERATION IN HARIRI INVESTIGATION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the U.N.'s Mehlis report into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri:  
   "I commend the U.N.'s report on the politically motivated assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The Mehlis report strongly suggests that the assassination could not have happened without the knowledge of senior Syrian officials. And, it offers strong evidence that Syria failed to cooperate fully with the investigation. 
   "I urge the Syrian government to come forth with any and all information relating to Prime Minister Hariri's death. I also call on the United States and the international community to pressure the Syrian government to come clean, cooperate fully in the investigation, and bring those responsible to justice. 
   "I also renew my call on Syria to do what the international community has demanded for some time - to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559. This resolution demands the withdrawal of all foreign forces and intelligence personnel from Lebanon and the disarming of all militias. Syria must remove all of its intelligence personnel from Lebanon and end its support for the terrorist group Hezbollah. 
   "It is time for the United States and the international community to act to end Syrian interference in Lebanon's affairs and to bring to justice those responsible for Prime Minister Hariri's death."
