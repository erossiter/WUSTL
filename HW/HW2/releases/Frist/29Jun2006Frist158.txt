SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON HAMDAN SUPREME COURT DECISION
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement regarding future legislation in light of today's Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld: 
   "Following the July 4th recess, I will introduce legislation, in consultation with the Administration and my colleagues, that authorizes military commissions and appropriate due process procedures for trials of terrorist combatants. To keep America safe in the War on Terror, I believe we should try terrorists only before military commissions, not in our civilian courts. In response to today's Supreme Court decision, Congress should work with the President to update our laws on terrorist combatants to respond to the new threats of a post-9/11 world. Since this issue so directly impacts our national security, I will pursue the earliest possible action in the United States Senate."
