  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed legislation endorsing President Bush's plan for civil nuclear energy cooperation with India:  
   "I commend Chairman Lugar and the Foreign Relations Committee for approving the necessary legislation to advance President Bush's plan for civil nuclear energy cooperation with India. The historic agreement reached by President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Singh last July is a major step forward in the strategic relationship between the world's oldest and largest democracies."
   "In accordance with this agreement, a majority of India's nuclear reactors will, for the first time, be placed under international safeguards and India will take a number of additional steps to bring itself into the nonproliferation mainstream and improve nuclear safety."
   "The legislation enabling implementation of this agreement is critical to strengthening America's cooperative strategic partnership with India. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to move legislation to further cement our relationship with India through the Senate and onto the President's desk."
