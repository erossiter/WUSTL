SEN. FRIST HAILS NEW, EXPANDED DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIORS
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new, expanded drug coverage for seniors. Today's announcement creates a demonstration program to provide prescription drug coverage for prescriptions needed to combat chronic illnesses such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis among others.  
 Under this initiative, Medicare will pay for certain drugs that can be taken at home, replacing the need for expensive doctor visits to administer similar drugs. 
   "For the first time, the new Medicare law establishes a demonstration program providing coverage of newer, more effective oral anti-cancer drugs and self-injectible biological drugs. This common-sense approach improves access to quality health care and offers significant savings for seniors - as much as 90 percent. This is a big step forward. More than 50,000 Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from debilitating chronic disease such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis, but have no prescription drug coverage, will receive coverage for essential drugs beginning now. And all Medicare beneficiaries will receive guaranteed, comprehensive drug coverage beginning in 2006. This program along with the Medicare Prescription Drug Card Program provides real and immediate relief to seniors who need affordable life saving medicines. President Bush deserves credit for recognizing this need and acting." 
   This initiative was part of the Medicare Modernization Act that was introduced by Senator Frist last year. Seniors who are interested in enrolling in this demonstration project can download applications from the CMS web site at www.cms.hhs.gov/researchers/demos/drugcoveragedemo.asp or calling 1-800-MEDICARE. Applications will be accepted through September 30.
