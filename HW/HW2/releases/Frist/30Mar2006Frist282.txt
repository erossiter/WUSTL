SEN. FRIST OPPOSES U.S. PARTICIPATION IN NEW U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) sent this letter to President George W. Bush urging his Administration not to support or participate in the newly established United Nations Human Rights Council because this new body does not adequately address the failures and shortcomings of the discredited United Nations Human Rights Commission. In the letter, Frist calls for the creation of a council of democracies outside the U.N. system to monitor and expose human rights abuses around the world.
