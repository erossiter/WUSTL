SEN. FRIST PRAISES CONTINUED JOB GROWTH
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today after the U.S. Department of Labor announced November's employment figures:
 "Republican policies continue to fuel economic growth, generating more than 6 million new jobs over the last 39 months. Reducing taxes and keeping them low has played a vital role in this sustained economic expansion. We must act to ensure that hardworking Americans continue to benefit from the Republican tax cuts that have fostered job production."
