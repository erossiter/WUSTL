SEN. FRIST ANNOUNCES SENATE PASSAGE OF STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTIBILITY, TOBACCO BUYOUT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today applauded Senate passage of the state sales tax deductibility and tobacco buyout provisions, which were included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Conference Report (also known as the FSC/ETI).  
 The conference report will now go to the President for his signature. 
   "In addition to providing significant support for manufacturing jobs across the state, Senate passage of the JOBS bill means that state sales tax deductibility and the tobacco buyout will very soon become law. Both bills represent years of hard work to bring fairness to Tennessee taxpayers as well as much-needed relief for the state's tobacco farmers. 
   "We have finally righted a 15-year wrong in the federal tax code that will mean an additional $470 in tax savings for almost one-quarter of Tennesseans filing their taxes for 2004. This money can be used by Tennessee families as they see fit - for savings, pay down credit card bills or to put food on the table. I'm pleased to have played a part in finally getting this done for Tennesseans. 
   "I'm also pleased that the legislation includes a buyout that will end the outdated tobacco quota system and provide a fair payment to quota holders and growers. This hard-fought relief is welcome news to desperate tobacco farmers throughout the state, and I'm proud to have played a role in making it possible. The inclusion of a tobacco buyout will mean $767 million for Tennessee's farm communities over the next 10 years which will help the entire state's economy. In addition, farmers who continue to grow tobacco will do so in a free market without the heavy hand of government regulation."
