SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON PERMANENT DEATH TAX REPEAL VOTE
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate voted against proceeding to legislation that would permanently repeal the Death Tax:  
   "The Death Tax is an unfair burden inflicted upon America's small businesses, farmers, and families during a time of grieving and pain. Wiping this vicious tax from the books is a matter of principle. We should protect -- not punish -- hardworking families by burying the Death Tax forever. It's unfortunate that a minority of my Senate colleagues have blocked debate on permanent repeal of this wrongheaded tax. This won't be the last time this year the Senate votes on this important issue -- be it on the floor or in some other form. Getting rid of the Death Tax is just too important an issue to give up so easily."
