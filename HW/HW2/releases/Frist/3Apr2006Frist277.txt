SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON JURY FINDING MOUSSAOUI ELIGIBLE FOR DEATH PENALTY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after a jury found Zacarias Moussaoui eligible for the death penalty: 
   "Today's verdict is a small but important piece of justice. No penalty or verdict could reverse the pain and horror inflicted by the 9/11 hijackers and their collaborators. However, Mr. Moussaoui's punishment is proof that our society is grounded in the liberating power of justice and the rule of law, which are our most valuable weapons in the War on Terror."
