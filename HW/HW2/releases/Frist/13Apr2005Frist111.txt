SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON MISTAKEN SHIPMENT OF H2N2 FLU STRAIN
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the accidental shipment of the H2N2 flu virus to laboratories throughout the world:  
   "The accidental shipment of the deadly H2N2 flu virus is just another in a string of occurrences which underscores the need to bolster America's domestic and global public health infrastructure. As strains grow resistant and immunities expire, or viruses reassort becoming more lethal and transmissible, we are at greater risk for a potential pandemic outbreak, as these viruses are only a plane ride away. Meanwhile, unnecessary litigation continues to destabilize our vaccine supply by causing fewer vaccines to be developed and produced. Vaccine shortages threaten our children and the health of our nation. 
   "Last year's shortage of the flu vaccine exposed America's vulnerability to a potential outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. And the extensive and necessary precautionary measures taken to prevent the spread of the H2N2 virus highlight the need to move forward with legislative solutions. We must strengthen our domestic vaccine supply, expand legal protections, encourage collaboration between the public and private sectors, and advance research and development. These initiatives, while long overdue, enhance our public health infrastructure, stabilize the vaccine industry, and protect the public health. 
   "On Monday, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the polio vaccine. We must build off of that historic success to strengthen America's preparedness against diseases of the future - our lives and the lives of future generations depend upon it."
