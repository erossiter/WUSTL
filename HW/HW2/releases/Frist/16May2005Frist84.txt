SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  "Republicans believe in the regular order of fair up and down votes and letting the Senate decide yes or no on judicial confirmations free from procedural gimmicks like the filibuster, and I hope Sen. Reid and others knows our door is always open to reasonable proposals for fair up or down votes for judicial nominees."
