SEN. FRIST HAILS TRANSFER OF POWER TO IRAQ
 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the transfer of power to Iraq:  
   "Today's transfer of power to the Iraqi people fulfills America's promise to Iraq and reinforces our confidence in the ability of the interim Iraqi government. Prime Minister Allawi and the Iraqi ministries have worked hard to ensure a successful transfer of power, so hard in fact that the handing over of sovereignty falls two days ahead of schedule. The transfer date was changed at the recommendation of Prime Minister Allawi who is ready to begin improving the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The Prime Minister is also committed to dealing with the terrorist threat that plagues this new democracy and threatens the future of the Iraqi people. For too long, Iraqi families have lived in the face of fear, tyranny and despair. Today they begin the journey to freedom. My congratulations go out to all Iraqis as they begin this new chapter in their history - the support of the world is with them today and in the future."
