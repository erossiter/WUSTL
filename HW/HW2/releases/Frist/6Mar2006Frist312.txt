  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding his sponsorship of the president's "Line Item Rescission Act of 2006":  
   "Along with Senators McConnell and McCain I will introduce the president's 'Line Item Rescission Act of 2006.' This responsible legislation will authorize the president to propose expedited rescissions to spending and targeted tax benefits in a manner that preserves the constitutional responsibilities of both branches of government. We must continue to take a fiscally-disciplined approach in government, and I look forward to considering this legislation."
