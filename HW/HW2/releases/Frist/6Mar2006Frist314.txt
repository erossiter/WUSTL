SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SUPREME COURT DECISION ON SOLOMON AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement applauding the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling upholding the Solomon amendment, which allows the military to recruit on college campuses that accept federal funds:  
   "I am pleased with today's unanimous Supreme Court decision to uphold the Solomon amendment and to allow the military to recruit on university and college campuses that receive federal funds. I applaud the Supreme Court for sustaining the military's right to fair and equal access at our nation's institutions of higher learning. 
   "This decision is particularly important given that our nation is at war. This is a time when our country should be united behind our armed forces and stand in support of our military personnel. All students should have the opportunity to hear from military recruiters as they explore a possible career of public service to their nation in the Armed Forces of the United States.
   "Today's unanimous ruling leaves no doubt that the United States military will continue to have equal access to all segments of our population, will be welcome on campuses across the United States, and will be able to recruit the best and brightest that America has to offer."
