SEN. FRIST HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY SPENDING BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) made the following statement today following Senate passage of the Homeland Security spending bill:  
   "This Homeland Security bill helps confront the challenges facing America's borders, ports and transit systems. The bill provides over $31 billion to meet our nation's security needs by boosting support for emergency preparedness and empowering our frontline defenses to better track and intercept those who wish to cross our borders to do us harm. 
   "For too long, our nation has left its borders underprotected, and this legislation acknowledges the hard reality that we must regain control of the gateways in and out of our country. In total, the bill increases total spending on border security alone by nearly $10 billion. Specifically, it adds 2,000 more patrol agents, investigators and detention and deportation officers to bolster border security. It also adds needed detention space so we can be sure people caught entering the country illegally are not released before their cases can be processed. 
   "Furthermore, by providing $340 million for US Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology (US VISIT), it enhances our ability to verify the identity of visitors with visas. This forward thinking legislation is a major step towards strengthening our homeland security. I'm proud of today's bill passage and believe it represents a genuine bipartisan commitment to meeting America's border, transit and homeland security needs. I expect a swift conference so we can send the president a bill he can sign into law."
