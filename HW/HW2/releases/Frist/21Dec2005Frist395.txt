SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) made the following statement today: 
   "This important legislation helps ensure our armed services receive the resources and authorities they need to protect America. From delivering advanced technologies to improving personnel protection, this bill delivers crucial support for our brave men and women in uniform. 
   "I am particularly pleased with the steps this measure takes to enhance the quality of life of uniformed military personnel. An across the board pay raise, increased housing allowances, and additional child care and family assistance services are all critical improvements included in the defense authorization bill. 
   "The military deserves the full support of this Congress as America continues to make progress in the War on Terror. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to our military personnel abroad in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere - as well as their families - as our armed forces work daily to protect our nation, keep the American people safe, and advance U.S. interests abroad. 
   "In addition, this bill includes the 'Support Our Scouts Act of 2005,' legislation I introduced that preserves the longstanding relationship between the Defense Department and the Scouts, ensures that the Scouts have access to public facilities across the United States, and expresses strong Congressional support for the Boy Scouts of America. I sincerely hope the clear voice of Congress on this issue will quell the senseless legal and political attacks on the Boy Scouts - especially at a time when our nation needs the organization's emphasis on strong character and community service more than ever."
