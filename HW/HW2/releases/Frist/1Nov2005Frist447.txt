SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL TAX REFORM PANEL REPORT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the release of the final report of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform:  
   "The breadth and depth of this report outlines a compelling case for substantive reform and simplification of America's tax system. Billions of dollars are wasted each year as the result of a cumbersome and needlessly complex federal tax code. I agree with the panel that all Americans would benefit from a more transparent system that is fair, consistent and stable. I look forward to conferring with Senator Grassley and my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to review the panel's recommendations and determine the best way to simplify and restore fairness to our tax code." 
   The President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform was established by President Bush on January 7, 2005. President Bush had charged the bipartisan panel with recommending reforms that will make the U.S. tax system simpler, fairer and more growth oriented.
