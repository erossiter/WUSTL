SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SENATE PASSAGE OF FY 2005 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
 Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced Senate passage of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Defense Appropriations, which includes more than $135 million for many U.S. and Tennessee military and reservist priorities. The bill passed unanimously.    
   "A strong national defense begins with a well-equipped military force, and the projects in this bill will contribute greatly to this charge," said Frist. "In addition to ensuring our servicemen and women are well prepared, this legislation recognizes Tennessee's contribution to our military through the support of many state research, equipment and technology projects."  
   "This bill gives our military men and women the tools they need to succeed today and in the future," said Alexander. "The Senate has voted to invest in cutting edge technology to improve our nation's defense, to provide a well-deserved pay raise for military personnel, and to fund the priorities of Tennessee's Guard and Reserve." 
   Some of the key Tennessee projects included in the FY 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill include: 
   * $15 million for the SensorNet program, a nationwide system for the real-time detection and assessment of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. The technology is part of efforts at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  
   * $20 million for the Guardian Portable Radiation Search Tool (PRST), a neutron and gamma ray detector capable of protecting against radiological weapons of mass destruction. Nucsafe of Oak Ridge is the manufacturer of this technology.  
   * $9 million for the medical consortium conducting medical Mustard Gas Antidote Research for the Department of Defense. The consortium includes Meharry Medical School and East Tennessee State University. This research utilizes a new and promising technology to counter the deadly effects from weapons of mass destruction exposure. 
   * $15 million for research, development and testing of the Family of Integrated Rapid Response Equipment (FIRRE). Of the funding, $5 million will go toward night vision systems advanced development. Remotec of Oak Ridge is the principle developer of the technology.  
   * $10 million for the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS), modern personal equipment which is urgently needed by our active forces to improve both their military effectiveness and quality of life. Of the funding, $5 million will go to the Army National Guard, $3 million to the Army Reserve, and $2 million to the Air National Guard. 
   * $2.9 million for the Communicator-Automated Emergency/Notification System which provides instantaneous real-time emergency mobilization notification in the event of war or any other emergency. 
   * $10 million for the U.S. Marine Corps' Lightweight Maintenance Enclosure (LME). These are frame-supported lightweight tents designed to provide a covered facility to conduct tactical maintenance operations in difficult and varied climates. Camel Manufacturing in Campbell County, Tennessee, is expected to be the principle supplier.  
   * $25 million to provide brigade-level Bradley Fighting Vehicles with Reactive Armor, which enhances the survivability of the fighting vehicles. The reactive armor tiles are manufactured at the Army Ammunition Plant in Milan, Tennessee.  
   * $1 million for the Center for Optical Logic Devices (COLD), which is a cooperative research effort between Fisk University and Idaho State on encryption and decryption code and optical communications. 
   * $1.5 million for the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area for the Tennessee Army National Guard. Tennessee ranks among the top five marijuana-producing states in the nation. The Tennessee Army National Guard was successful in eradicating in excess of $600 million worth of this drug in recent years. These funds will expand eradication efforts and sustain maintenance capabilities. 
   * $9 million for Medical Free Electron Laser (MFEL) research at Vanderbilt University, among other universities within this consortium. The MFEL program was initiated by Congress in 1985 to explore the emerging technology of high-peak power, short-pulse lasers in application to medicine and materials sciences. In addition, the MFEL continues to make critical advances in the area of chemical and biological warfare. 
   * $1 million for hemostatic research, which could help slow hemorrhagic shock and death. This is a collaborative effort between Greystone Medical and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, both located in Memphis.   
   * $1 million for the continued development of the Detective (HPGe) Radio-Isotope Identifier, breakthrough technology used to detect and identify deadly isotopes that can be used in weapons of mass destruction or a dirty bomb. The research will be conducted at ORTEC, located in Oak Ridge.  
   * $5 million for the Next Generation Manufacturing Technologies Initiative (NGMTI), located in Oak Ridge, to support the continued development of manufacturing science and technology, including intelligent systems, enterprise integration and processing technologies, to meet the future needs of military forces. NGMTI is a partnership of integrated manufacturing technology initiative from Knoxville/Oak Ridge and the Advanced Technology Institution in Charleston, South Carolina.  
   * $10 million to construct the Wings of Liberty Military Museum at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Currently, the existing Don F. Pratt Museum can only accommodate 20 percent of the historical artifacts and collections at Fort Campbell. The new 80,000 square foot facility will allow for the display of artifacts raging from World War II D-Day invasion of Normandy to more recent operation in Bosnia, Kuwait and Iraq, as well as an IMAX theater, vintage aircraft displays and educational resources.  
   With the House passing its version of the bill earlier this week, both bills will now go to a conference committee to work out the differences in the legislation.
