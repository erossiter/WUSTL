SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON CONCEALED CARRY BILL SIGNING
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement applauding President Bush for signing the "Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003" into law.  
 The new law exempts certain current and former law enforcement officers from state laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed handguns. 
   "This new law sends a strong message that we support the work of our law enforcement officers to keep neighborhoods safe, whether they are formally wearing the uniform or not. 
   "Before this bill was signed, some states would not permit law enforcement officers from other states to carry a concealed weapon within their borders. With the new law, retired and off-duty police officers will be able to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the United States, potentially allowing thousands of well-equipped and well-trained police officers to continually serve and protect our communities. 
   "I'm pleased that the President signed this bill to make our streets, neighborhoods and law enforcement officers safer. This bill is the number one legislative priority of our nation's law enforcement officers, and I'm proud of this bipartisan effort to support law enforcement and public safety."
