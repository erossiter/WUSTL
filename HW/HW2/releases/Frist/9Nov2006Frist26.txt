SEN. FRIST, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR COMMENTS ON ELECTION RESULTS
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) Communications Director, Amy Call, made the following statement on the Senate election results:  
   "In the end voters gave the responsibility to govern to the Democratic Party. The American people deserve leaders who work towards making America a better place. There will be many differences in the days to come but today we can all stand together and agree on that goal. 
   "Over the past twelve years, what Republicans have done has changed our economy, our country, and our way of life for the better. Our record of success, combined with the lessons of this election, ensures that our party will re-dedicate itself to serving the interests of America, both here at home and around the world. 
   "That vision--optimistic, forward-looking, hopeful--will be grounded in the fundamentals of common-sense conservative values best found on Main Street and in families throughout the country. 
   "Now that Democrats will have control of Congress for the next two years, they have a new responsibility for one of the most important issues of our time. Quite simply, how shall we win the war on terror? 
   "The Army has never won a battle by deploying a hearing; no Air Force jet has ever successfully bombed an enemy position using a subpoena; and the Marines have never taken a hill by attacking the enemy with a report. What is a now necessary is building a critical bipartisan consensus about the best way ahead overseas. 
   "Democrats must step forward as partners, not partisans. To do any less is to damage, perhaps irreparably, our ability to act as one government, together, in one of the largest callings of our time."
