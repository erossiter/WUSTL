SEN. FRIST ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. REID
  Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) this evening made the following statement: 
   "I was concerned to hear that my good friend and colleague suffered a mild stroke. I've since spoken with Senator Reid, and he's feeling fine, showing his usual strength of spirit. Harry is a tireless worker, and I hope he takes advantage of the remaining recess to rest and relax before the Senate returns in a few weeks. Karyn and my thoughts and prayers are with Harry and Landra, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together when the Senate meets in September."
