SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SIGNING OF SUDAN PEACE ACCORD
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the signing of a peace accord between the Sudanese government and rebel forces:  
   "I am heartened by yesterday's peace accord signing between the Sudanese government and southern rebel forces. For two decades, war has shattered the lives of millions of Sudanese citizens, and yesterday's announcement shines a light of hope for the prospects of establishing a comprehensive and lasting peace throughout the country. With the support of the international community, I am certain Sudan can begin to heal from the wounds of war, and usher in a period of freedom and stability. While great challenges lie ahead, I am optimistic about today's agreement, and hopeful that it is the first of many steps towards peace." 
   Senator Frist is the author of the Sudan Peace Act. The legislation laid out a framework for peace negotiations and condemned the slavery being perpetrated against the Southern Sudanese people and the human rights abuses they suffered at the hands of government forces. The legislation passed the Senate in November of 1999.
