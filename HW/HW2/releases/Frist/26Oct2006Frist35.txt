PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF SECURE FENCE ACT HAILED BY SEN. FRIST, SPEAKER HASTERT
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Sen. Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) and Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) made the following statement after President Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006:  
   "Today marks another step forward in making America safer and in stemming the tide of illegal immigration. The American people demand border security, and this Republican Congress and President are committed to achieving operational control of the border through an enforcement-first approach that uses physical fencing and state-of-the-art monitoring technology. 
   "Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate opposed the Secure Fence Act, ignoring the demands of the American people for a secure border. When it comes to critical national security legislation, Democrats have no agenda and offer no solutions. Instead they offer only endless delay and dangerous obstruction. House and Senate Republicans will continue to provide the President with the tools necessary to win the Global War on Terror and will stop the hemorrhaging along our nation's borders."
