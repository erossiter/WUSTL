SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTION EXTENSION
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today praised the tax relief delivered to Tennesseans through final passage of the Tax Extenders Act (H.R. 6111). The bill extends the states sales tax deduction for two years and makes permanent a provision to protect songwriters from unfair taxes.  
 "The issue has always been about achieving fairness for hardworking taxpayers throughout Tennessee," Frist said. "I've fought hard for the sales tax deduction throughout my 12 years in the Senate, and I look forward to seeing the President sign this bill soon." 
 The state sales tax deduction provides nearly $400 in tax relief for more than 530,000 families across Tennessee. Frist secured the deduction in 2004, but the provision expired last year and must be extended by Congress. 
 In addition, the bill makes permanent a Frist-authored provision recently signed into law by President Bush allowing songwriters to claim the capital gains tax rate on music sales, the same rate paid by their corporate partners. This change in the tax code reduces songwriters' tax burden by up to 35 percent. 
 The House has already passed the legislation, which now goes to the President for his signature.
