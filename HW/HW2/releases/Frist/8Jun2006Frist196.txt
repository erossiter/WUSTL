SEN. FRIST HAILS COMPLETION OF DISCIPLINED EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement upon the completion of the emergency supplemental conference report: 
   "Congress is cracking down on excessive Washington spending, and this supplemental spending bill proves that we're on the right track. It adheres to my calls for a conference report that's limited to the President's request for true emergency spending. It focuses resources on important priorities. It provides funding to bolster border security, conduct the War on Terror, aid hurricane recovery, and improve our nation's preparedness against the threat of avian flu -- all while exercising fiscal restraint and responsibility. I applaud the leadership of Senator Cochran and Congressman Lewis to restrain federal spending and ensure the effective and appropriate government use of taxpayer dollars so that our deficit can continue to decline and our economy can continue to grow."
