SEN. FRIST SAYS USA PATRIOT ACT AGREEMENT STRENGTHENS ANTI-TERRORISM PROTECTIONS, ENHANCES CIVIL LIBERTIES SAFEGUARDS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement applauding the bicameral agreement on the conference report for the USA PATRIOT Act:  
   "With much of the USA Patriot Act set to expire on December 31, today's agreement marks a huge step forward in keeping America safe. This improved version of the Patriot Act strengthens anti-terrorism protections and enhances safeguards to protect our civil liberties and privacy. It provides critical tools to investigate and track suspected terrorists and foil terrorist plots before harm is done to innocent Americans. 
   "Since Congress passed the Patriot Act overwhelmingly in 2001, we have been fortunate to remain safe from another major terrorist attack on American soil in no small part because the Patriot Act is such an effective weapon in fighting terrorism. In the last four years, we have used this legislation to charge over 400 suspected terrorists and break up terrorist cells across the country in New York, California, Oregon, Virginia, and Florida. 
   "I will bring the Patriot Act conference report to the Senate floor next week, and, just as the Senate did four years ago, we should unite in a bipartisan way to support the Patriot Act--to stand up for freedom, and against terror."
