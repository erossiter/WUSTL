SEN. FRIST APPLAUDS SENATE RATIFICATION OF OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate ratified the Oman Free Trade Agreement:
   "Increased trade will cement ties between the U.S. and Oman, and in turn will bolster our alliance in the Global War on Terror. The 9-11 Commission Report recommended fostering relationships with moderate Middle East countries as a way to encourage development and more open societies. This trade agreement is an important step toward that end."
