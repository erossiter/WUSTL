SENS. FRIST, ALEXANDER APPLAUD $2.85 MILLION EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE GRANT FOR FORT CAMPBELL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Labor for a $2.85 million Ft.  
 Campbell National Emergency Grant to help dislocated workers and eligible military spouses receive employment-related assistance.
   "I'm pleased to announce this grant providing employment-related assistance to our men and women at Fort Campbell," said Frist. "This funding reflects our commitment and dedication to the brave men and women serving in America's armed forces as well as their families."
   "I applaud the Department of Labor for this funding to aid the needs of our military families at Fort Campbell," Alexander said. "Sen. Frist and I will continue to work together to provide support for our service men and women during a time when they and their families need it most." 
   Today's announcement of $2.85 million, combined with $1 million given in May 2003, provides a total of $3.85 million in employment-related assistance to Fort Campbell. 
   Approximately 649 participants - 399 military and Department of Defense civilian personnel involuntarily separated from Ft. Campbell, and 250 military spouses who qualify as dislocated workers - will receive assistance. 
   The national emergency grants program provide supplemental funds to states, local boards and other eligible entities in order to respond to the needs of dislocated workers and communities affected by major economic changes such as closures and realignments of military installations.
