SEN. FRIST CONGRATULATES IRAQIS ON PROVISIONAL ELECTION RESULTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on the announcement of the results from the Iraqi provisional election:  
   "Just two weeks ago, millions of Iraqis defied the threats of terrorists and went to the polls to determine their own future. I congratulate the Iraqi people for the courage they've shown in making these elections so successful. While the outcome must still be reviewed and certified, this was an historic step on the path to democracy for all Iraqis. After decades of oppression, this election establishes a credible process for governing Iraq in which all communities are represented, minority rights are respected, and violence is not tolerated. 
   "I'm encouraged by Sunni leaders that are seeking a role in the drafting of Iraq's constitution, and by Shiite leaders who're also talking about the need for an open process that engages all parties. This inclusiveness is the essence of democracy. We're witnessing the transformational power of liberty. And I look forward to working with the newly elected Iraqi leaders as they continue on their journey towards freedom."
