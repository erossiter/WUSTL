SEN. FRIST'S COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR COMMENTS ON SCHIAVO CASE
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's Communication Director Bob Stevenson made the following statement regarding the Terri Schiavo case:  
   "Bill Frist has helped save hundreds of lives in operating rooms throughout the world. For him a woman's life...every life...is precious. 
   "Before addressing the Senate concerning Terri Schiavo last Thursday, Senator Frist carefully reviewed medical information, records, video tapes and sworn affidavits that were in the court records. He spoke with physicians involved in the case. He noted that some doctors have concluded she is not in a persistent vegetative state and could improve with therapy. 
   "The suggestion by some that Senator Frist was making a `diagnosis' in the Schiavo case is absurd. Nowhere in his comments was he substituting his opinion for others. But with medical experts split on Terri Schiavo's condition and a woman's life at stake, he suggested the court solicit additional tests and attempt to reach a medical consensus on her condition. Specifically, he recommended current and complete neurological examinations, which she has not had, using the most up-to-date medical technologies. 
   "The fact the bill passed with bipartisan support and without dissent would indicate Republicans and Democrats alike agreed with his assessment that the courts should at the very least solicit additional medical evidence in this case. When medical facts are in dispute we should always err on the side of life."
