SEN. FRIST COMMENTS ON KAISER SURVEY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., today made the following statement regarding the release of the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey:
   "Surveys of opinions about the new Medicare law, including today's Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey, provide interesting figures that may become part of a political debate. But what is important is policy, not politics. The fact is that seniors enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug discount card are getting real relief from the high cost of prescription drugs. And more help is on the way. 
   "The programs enacted by the new law are already helping millions of seniors and Americans with disabilities, and these benefits will dramatically improve when the full benefit is implemented in 2006.
   "Public officials who mislead seniors about their choices and benefits are part of the problem contributing to the unfortunate reality, confirmed in today's survey, that many seniors are confused about the new Medicare law and the benefits available to them, or that they simply don't know enough about its benefits. Seniors deserve to know the facts. Today's survey shows that we need to work together to provide them the information they need to take advantage of the real savings available under this landmark Medicare prescription drug benefit."
