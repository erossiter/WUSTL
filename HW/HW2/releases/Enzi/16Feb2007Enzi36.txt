to expand access to higher education  reduce costs  help students avoid heavy debt      February 16  2007 Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of theSenate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today outlined the need for a broad Higher Education Act reauthorization bill to expand access to higher education  give American students the tools they need to complete college and acquire the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in the 21st century global economy   We must use this reauthorization process to promote innovation and new technologies that will keep costs down  encourage competitive financial aid  open doors to more information helpful to students and parents planning for college  and improve financial literacy across the board  Enzi said at todays HELP Committee hearing titled Higher Education  Higher Cost and Higher Debt  Paying for College in the Future   We need to promote better financial literacy among students and their parents  so that they will know what their financial obligations are  and can manage debt more effectively  Enzi said  Students should graduate with a degree in hand  not a ball and chain of debt holding them back     Enzi  who is the Senates only accountant  said Congress must also work to simplify the federal student aid system  which is so complicated and difficult to navigate that it impedes access to higher education  Its time to make filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA  less complicated than filling out our tax forms  and for an accountant to say that is really something  he said    We must take a close look at the hidden costs of college that are driving up the price  Enzi said  For instance  many students enter school without the knowledge and skills that they need and must take remedial coursework just to catch up  costing them extra semesters  Other students transfer from one school to another only to discover that their hard earned  fully paid credits will not count toward a degree at their new school  This costs students money and time  and adds to taxpayers costs  too  It also contributes to higher attrition rates  particularly for low income students   Enzi said colleges must make better information available to students and parents regarding the costs and advantages of their institutions  By finding innovative ways and utilizing new technologies to help students and parents comparison shop  we can help them make the best choices  Enzi said           Statement of Michael B  Enzi      Ranking Member   Senate Committee on Health      Education      Labor and Pensions  Hearing on Higher Education  Higher Cost and Higher Debt  Paying for College in the Future February 16th  2007  Thank you Senator Kennedy for holding this hearing and continuing our work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  We built an important record of hearings and roundtables on these issues in the 109th Congress  I hope when all is said and done  students will have the tools they need to complete higher education and help them acquire the knowledge and skills to become competitive in a 21st century economy      The American system of higher education is renowned throughout the world  Our more than six thousand colleges and universities enroll over 14 million students and provide access to all types of academic and skill building programs  In   Wyoming we only have a handful of the total   one four year university  and seven community colleges  Our grand total of ten accredited institutions of higher education in the state is the smallest of any state but   Alaska    However  we are no less concerned about a recent report from the Association of American Colleges and Universities that college graduates are less and less prepared to compete in the global economy  The American success story of higher education is at risk of losing the qualities that made it great  competition  innovation  and access for all  Higher education will continue to be the onramp to success in the global economy  and it is our responsibility to make sure that our young adults are able to access that opportunity and reach their goals   The federal government has a role to play in increasing affordability  which is why I support increasing the maximum Pell Grant award  and why this committee is working on a broad higher education reauthorization bill that will promote innovation and new technologies to keep costs down  expand availability of information to help students and parents make more informed decisions  and improve financial literacy across the board so that students have a better understanding of how they can manage their loans and monthly payments  Schools and colleges also have a role to play  They can and must do more to increase accountability and seek efficiencies that bring down the cost of education   Also  we need to explore further innovative solutions to the complexity of the federal student aid system  Right now filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA  prevents many students from even considering college  That was never our intent and it is time to make the FAFSA less complicated than filling out our tax forms  and for an accountant to say that  is really something  One interesting solution Ive heard  and I hope to hear other suggestions today  is the possibility of rolling the financial aid process into the existing tax system  We need to explore this and other approaches to making sure that we improve the FAFSA to help students get timely and useful information about what resources they have available to pursue higher education   Concern for spiraling costs of college is not new  I plan to submit for the record several articles by Dr  Richard Vedder that provide us insight into the perfect storm that is confronting our institutions of higher education  declining state support  stagnant productivity  and students that are left without the tools they need to make informed choices about their college education   Over the last 20 years tuition has grown at rates double the increases in family income  At the same time productivity at our universities is declining  while more students find themselves having to take remedial classes in order to succeed in college level coursework  Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is needed to address these challenges and improve transparency in ways that will combat these hidden costs of college   Institutions must better communicate the difference between the sticker price and net price of a college education  And there are many students that transfer from one school to another only to discover their hard earned  fully paid credits will not count toward their degrees  Other students enter college without the knowledge and skills they need requiring them to take remedial coursework just to catch up  This costs students money and time  and adds to taxpayers costs  too  The result is that students graduate with greater debt  It also contributes to higher attrition rates  particularly for low income students  who find themselves no better off economically  but likely to be facing monthly student loan payments   Ialso want to highlight an issue that I have been championing and see as a critical factor in this discussion  student financial literacy  We must improve the financial literacy of students so they can weigh the costs and benefits of their college education options  And we can no longer assume that only 18 22 year olds are the students being served by these programs  We are seeing more working adults  people with college degrees and mid career Americans pursuing additional education in order to acquire the increasing knowledge and skills they need to be successful  The choice of whether to pursue a postsecondary education is confronting millions of Americans  and they need good tools with which to make those decisions   I have been a strong advocate for financial literacy because I believe that we must give individuals the tools to understand and shape their future  Senator Sarbanes and I were the authors of the legislation establishing the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to develop a national strategy on financial literacy  I should note that next week the Departments of Treasury and Education will be holding the Summit on K Postsecondary Education  Overcoming Challenges to help develop the national strategy  In addition the   Summit will highlight the challenges to teaching young people about money and saving for college and the rest of their lives   I look forward to hearing from todays witnesses as we tackle these issues in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act
