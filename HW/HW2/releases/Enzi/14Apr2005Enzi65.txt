importance of lifelong learning  April 14  2005 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the importance of lifelong education today with testimony from Secretary of Education Spellings  Secretary of Labor Chao  and other educational leaders from around the United States  Enzi noted that about 15 Wyoming state legislators were also in attendance    The full text of Enzis opening statement follows  To view video clips of the statement   Statement of Michael B  Enzi  Chairman   Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  Hearing on Lifelong Education Opportunities  April 14  2005 Lifelong education opportunities are vital to ensuring that America retains its competitive edge in the global economy  and that every American can participate in our nations success  In our technology driven economy  school can never be out  It is estimated that 60 percent of tomorrows jobs will require skills that only 20 percent of todays workers possess  It is also estimated that the average person leaving college will change careers 14 times  Without a lifetime of education  training and retraining opportunities for everyone  we will not meet these 21st century challenges  As new technology emerges and workers change careers  they will need to learn new skills or apply their current skills in new ways    Earlier this year I introduced S  9  The Lifelong Education Opportunities Act of 2005  It has four stated purposes  to set high expectations and raise achievement levels for all students  regardless of their backgrounds  to improve accountability for results  to provide flexibility to the States to manage Federal program dollars effectively  and  to support a lifetime of learning opportunities for students and adults at all stages in life    If our students and workers are to have the best chance to succeed in life  we need to focus on all of our Federal education and training programs from pre kindergarten through postsecondary education to on the job and continuing education  We must ensure that everyone has an opportunity to achieve academically and obtain the skills they will need to succeed  regardless of their background  Just as every student is different and has different needs  not every classroom is the same    On March 21st I visited a classroom in Hudson  Wyoming  The town of 207 residents boasts two world famous restaurants  but its children are taught in a single classroom setting at the elementary school  Two teachers teach five kindergarteners  five first graders  five second graders and two third graders in the same room  There were almost as many classroom pets  hamsters  etc  as kids    Most recently the Governors held an education summit that provided an action agenda for improving Americas high schools  For years  institutions of higher education and employers have expressed their dissatisfaction about the need our high school graduates have for remediation in order to do college level work or to participate in the workforce  Each year taxpayers pay an estimated  1 to  2 billion to provide remedial education to students at our public universities and community colleges  Businesses report spending even more to address the lack of literacy and basic skills of their entry level workers    Let me share a few facts that speak to the seriousness of this issue    American 15 year olds performed below the international average in mathematics  literacy and problem solving  according to the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment    Reading proficiency among 12th graders has declined to the point where just over one third of them are even considered proficient readers    Only 68 of every 100 9th grade students graduate on time  in other words within four years  Americas high school graduation rate is among the lowest in the industrialized world  and the impact on our minority students has been especially severe     Nearly one third of entering college freshmen need at least one remedial course    The United States has one of the highest college enrollment rates  but a college completion rate average to below average among developed countries in the world    In this decade  40 percent of job growth will be in jobs requiring postsecondary education  those jobs requiring associate degrees growing the fastest    Four out of every five jobs will require postsecondary education or the equivalent  yet only 52 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have achieved this level of education    Seventy five percent of todays workforce will need to be retrained just to keep their current jobs     Median earnings of a high school graduate are 43 percent higher than those of a non graduate  and those of a college graduate are 62 percent higher than those of a high school graduate    Two thirds of the 7 million worker gap in 2010 will be a skilled worker shortage    What does this mean  What do we know  To begin with  we know that we must improve high school completion rates  Education beyond high school and lifelong learning opportunities are essential for everyone to assure individual success as well as our nations future prosperity  We need to provide better preparation at every level of education and strengthen the connections between secondary and postsecondary education  In this global economy  learning is never over and school is never out  Technology is demanding that everyone continue to learn and gain skills to remain competitive in the workplace  The labor force participation rate in January 2005 was 68 8 percent   the lowest in 10 years  as more Americans conclude that they cannot meet the skill demands of todays workplace and they choose to no longer participate in the workforce    For these reasons and many others  I am looking forward to the testimony of our witnesses today  We are facing a significant challenge  one that I prefer to think of it as an opportunity     With most of our Federal policies that deal with training and the workforce needing reauthorization we have an opportunity to provide the clear message that we can no longer accept the status quo or business as usual  We need to take a fresh look at how we can structure our education and training programs to better meet the needs of our economy and at the same time ensure every person has the opportunity they need to obtain the academic and technical skills they need to succeed today  tomorrow and for years to come                                                      April 2005 News Releases           Browse by
