Committee look for ways to eradicate child pornography  September 19  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   in a Senate Banking Committee hearing today  explored ways the financial industry can help protect our children from the ever growing child pornography trade   We all agree that child pornography is evil  Now we must put our minds together and come up with viable ways to stop this disgusting practice  This hearing brought in justice and financial experts to look at ways of cutting off funding for child pornography  said Enzi  member of the Senate Banking Committee  Congress supports efforts already underway by the financial community and this hearing is a way to bring in more groups and agencies to combat this problem with the end goal being a complete eradication of child pornography  The hearing analyzed solutions ranging from creating a uniform system for reporting suspected child pornography  developing an effective system for identifying merchant banks supporting illegal sites and adapting current money laundering systems to identify and report unusual circumstances   U S  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other experts testified about efforts and ideas for the future crackdowns on child pornography  Earlier this year leaders in the financial and internet service agencies partnered with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to form the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography   Enzi co sponsored S  2140  the Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation Act  earlier this year  The bill would expand the requirement that producers of sexually explicit material keep and permit inspection records regarding the age of the actors to include the producers of digital images and simulated sexual content   Enzis full statement at the hearing follows    Statement by Senator Michael B  Enzi  For the Senate Committee on Banking at a hearing titled  Combating Child Pornography by Eliminating Pornographers Access to the Financial Payment System  Mr  Chairman  Thank you for holding this important hearing today  Todays hearing is an opportunity to discuss efforts to combat child pornography  Each year  thousands of children are exploited by photographing them and making those images and videos available to child predators  We need to stop these terrible crimes  and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses with ideas about what can be done   The sexual victimization of children is a tremendous problem in our nation  and unfortunately  the problem is more widespread than most recognize  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  statistics show that 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 10 boys are sexually exploited before they reach adulthood  Although these abuses are so prevalent  less than 35  of those child sexual assaults are reported to authorities  The abused children who are the victims of child pornography are harmed both mentally and physically  Physically  they can be molested or face exposure to sexually transmitted diseases  Although the physical traumas are problematic  many child victims struggle with the mental abuse for far longer  Victims of child pornography can often face depression  anger and feelings of worthlessness and low self esteem  These feelings follow them into adulthood and forever alter their lives  In addition  because emotional scars are not as visible as physical wounds  they often go untreated   Child pornography is illegal in all 50 states and most countries  Although the growth of the Internet has been beneficial in many ways  bad actors are using this information sharing tool to spread their filth  Unfortunately  the vastness of cyberspace often makes prosecution of these criminals difficult   Congress has taken steps to combat child pornography  but our actions up to this point have not gone far enough  Earlier this year  the Senate passed and President Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 into law  This legislation included provisions requiring producers of sexually explicit material and simulated sexually explicit material to keep records of every performers name and date of birth  While ensuring that performers are of legal age  Congress and President Bush took one more step to protect the innocent  In addition to this Act  there are a number of other ideas being discussed in Congress and within the Administration  The Department of Justice has sent proposals to the Hill to increase fines if an electronic communications service provider knowingly and willfully fails to report the presence of child pornography on their systems  In addition  Justice hopes to eliminate the practice of hiding terms in the websites code so that the pornography site will come up on a search of the Internet For example  some pornography website owners will place terms such as Sesame Street in the code  When someone searches on Google for the childrens show  the pornography website will also come up on the list of possible websites   Many of the proposals attack the problem of child pornography with increased regulation of the Internet  There are many other ways that we prevent the exploitation of children  Today  we are here to examine the role of the financial industry can play in stopping child pornography and child pornographers  I am pleased that Chairman Shelby scheduled this hearing today to tackle this important issue through the Banking Committee   I also applaud the efforts of the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography to wipe out commercial child pornography by 2008  They seek to do so by destroying the financial network of these criminals  This ambitious goal will take coordination of law enforcement  private industry  states and the federal government  I am committed to providing these individuals with the resources they need to eliminate and eradicate child pornography   I look forward to learning about efforts that are currently underway and learning about what more can be done so that we can provide the resources to help law enforcement deal with this problem  This hearing will help lay the groundwork for legislative action as we all engage in the fight against child pornography  Thank you again to Chairman Shelby for holding this hearing and to our distinguished panels for taking the time to testify today                                                         September 2006 News Releases           Browse by
