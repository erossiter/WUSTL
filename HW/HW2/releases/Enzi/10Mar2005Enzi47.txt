s Perkins education bill 99 0 Rock Springs and Casper programs examples for nation March 10  2005 Washington  D C   The U S  Senate approved legislation today spear headed by U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   that would address the needs of our changing workforce by targeting federal funds for academic instruction and job skills training  said Enzi  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  HELP Committee     Enzi said the reauthorization of the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act  would help America be more competitive in the long term    Getting the legislation passed was a priority when I took over the chairmanship of the committee  I talk with Wyoming educators and students frequently about this bill and Im pleased to report members of the committee on both sides of the aisle came together to make sure we delivered this legislation to our constituents  Senator Ted Kennedy  D Mass   the Democratic ranking member on the HELP Committee  worked diligently with me on this legislation    Enzi said the bill would require state agencies to work together to identify the needs of the workforce and design job and skills training programs to match those needs  It would also provide vital resources that are needed to prepare students of all ages for a lifetime of learning necessary to pursue high wage and high skilled occupations     The Senate approved the legislation by a vote of 99 0    S  250  introduced by Enzi on February 1  also emphasizes the needs of non traditional students and other lifelong learners  who are returning to school for the first time  or those who are seeking additional skill training     Enzi spoke on the Senate floor about examples from Wyoming on the impact of the bill    In Casper  Wyoming  right now  the community college and the school district are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical education center  which will help students earn credit toward a college degree  learn relevant job skills  and meet state academic standards  all through a single sequence of courses  This legislation encourages more schools to begin innovative programs like the one being developed in Casper  said Enzi  In Rock Springs  Wyoming  Ted Schroeder  a career and technical education teacher  has demonstrated firsthand the success that comes from connecting career and technical education to the needs of business  In response to complaints heard from local businesses about the need for students with stronger accounting skills  Ted went looking for a program that could help train his students with the skills requested by the businesses  Working with local school leaders  Ted began a computer based accounting program at the high school in Rock Springs and has been enrolling students successfully for the past few years  Some of those students are now moving on to community college or the workforce  Thats the type of relevant instruction that we need to encourage and that we are encouraging through this bill  I would expect that the students performing well in that accounting class are also performing well on state math assessments in Wyoming    Enzi said Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction  Dr  Trent Blankenship  has also been a valuable resource in the reauthorization of this legislation    S  250 improves programs authorized under the Perkins Act by requiring a more effective accountability system and stronger partnerships between schools and the business community    The House Committee on Education and the Workforce unanimously approved a companion billl  H R  366  and the whole House is expected to vote on the bill soon  Senator Craig Thomas  R Wyo   is a co sponsor of S  250    The American economy is in the midst of a skills revolution  making a quality education more important than ever  Enzi said  Some estimates suggest that 60 percent of the jobs created in the next decade will require skills that only 20 percent of workers today possess  The Perkins Act is a critical piece of a comprehensive effort to train American workers to fill the good jobs being created     S  250 improves programs authorized under the Perkins Act by requiring    A More Effective Accountability System   that aligns accountability requirements with other federal education and training programs      Stronger Links to Businesses   that build stronger partnerships between high schools  colleges  and businesses  so they can better meet the needs of the workforce  including small businesses      Better Links from High School to College   that require states to outline a logical sequence of courses  including high school and college courses  that will lead to an industry recognized credential  certificate  or postsecondary degree      Stronger Academic Focus   that promotes an enhanced emphasis on academic instruction for federally supported career and technical education programs consistent with other federal education programs     end  FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR MICHAEL B  ENZI  CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION  March 10  2005   Mr  President  I rise today in support of S  250  the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005     This legislation reflects a bipartisan effort to strengthen and improve federal programs designed to support career and technical education  I am very pleased to have introduced this bill with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts  Senator Kennedy    This legislation was reported favorably by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee yesterday morning by a unanimous vote  I am encouraged by the wide range of support for this legislation as we move forward in the legislative process    This legislation is important for three reasons  The first reason is the added emphasis on academic instruction  I commend the President and the governors for raising the issue of high school reform  and I believe this legislation is an important part of that process  Improving and strengthening the academic focus of the Perkins act is part of a much larger effort to ensure that todays students will be ready for tomorrows reality  whether it is in college or the workplace    In 1998  when Congress last reauthorized the Perkins program  additional emphasis on student academic achievement was incorporated into the bill  That emphasis was critical  and the results have been demonstrated in the program  More Perkins students are performing better on national reading and math assessments than ever before    According to a recent study of Arizona career and technical education students  students in career and technical training courses were more likely to meet State math proficiency levels than students not enrolled in technical training courses  Thats good  because todays jobs are requiring stronger academic preparation than ever before  especially in math and science    Were also facing a significant problem in terms of todays students completing high school  Many college instructors and employers agree that public high school graduates are not prepared for college level classes or to advance beyond entry level jobs    Only 68  of the students entering the ninth grade four years ago are expected to graduate this year  and  that for minority students this number hovers around 50   In addition  we continue to experience an overall drop out rate of 11  per year    Another recent study  conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  shows that American students are lagging behind the international average in math proficiency  Another study by this same group has pointed out that American high school students are less likely to complete high school than their peers in other countries  In that study  the United States ranked sixteenth out of twenty nations studied in terms of graduation rates    The legislation we are now considering emphasizes high school completion by making academic courses more relevant  According to the National Assessment of Vocational Education  released last year  career and technical education students are three times more likely to apply academic skills to job related tasks than students in academic courses    Making learning relevant is one of the best ways to ensure students stay interested in their coursework  while also preparing them for college or the workforce    The National Governors Association recently held an education summit here in Washington  D C   to discuss the issue of high school reform and how we can do a better job of graduating students on time with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life  According to their report  high school is now the front line in Americas battle to remain competitive on the increasingly competitive international economic stage    In the bill we are now considering  we have made academic achievement one of several core indicators of performance for programs receiving funds from this act  As states are elevating their expectations for students under No Child Left Behind  we anticipate that career and technical education students will benefit from those same high expectations  We believe that career and technical education programs should be able to take credit for helping students improve their academic achievement in core subject areas  like reading  math  and science    This legislation also emphasizes the connection to postsecondary education  Many of todays high schools students are entering college behind the curve before they even start  Twenty eight percent of college students are taking some remedial education courses before graduating  We need to makes sure that more high school students are receiving the instruction they need before they leave high school in order to be successful in college     The impact of the need for remedial academic instruction has dramatic consequences  As many as three in four students requiring remedial reading instruction will not complete a postsecondary degree program  Over sixty percent of students requiring remedial math education will not complete a postsecondary degree    The Perkins program can help address the wasted senior year by helping to improve student academic achievement  It does that by linking learning to relevant applications and tasks  Students that are excited about learning will always do better  and a great way to get students excited about learning is to show them how they will use some the skills theyre learning    For many students  understanding how they will use the skills they learn can mean the difference between completing a high school degree and dropping out  For others  it means greater investment in their studies than they might otherwise have     The Perkins program can support students in high school by providing strong academic courses linked through a career pathway that will help reduce the need for remedial education     The Perkins program is in a unique position to help prevent the need for additional remedial education at the postsecondary level  Because the program provides funds to both secondary and postsecondary schools  programs are more coordinated  and students have broader exposure to postsecondary education before leaving high school  A number of programs enabling students to earn concurrent credits for high school and college are springing up within the Perkins program  helping students prepare for college and reduce their time to graduation from a postsecondary degree certificate or degree program    In Casper  Wyoming  right now  the community college and the school district are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical education center  which will help students earn credit toward a college degree  learn relevant job skills  and meet state academic standards  all through a single sequence of courses  This legislation encourages more schools to begin innovative programs like the one being developed in Casper    The second reason this legislation is important is because it will help ensure we are preparing students for tomorrows workforce  We are in the midst of a skills revolution  It is estimated that todays students leaving high school or college will have fourteen different careers in their lifetimes  It is also estimated that the top ten jobs ten years from now havent been invented yet  The question that faces all of us  put simply  is got skills    We must equip our workers with the skills the technology driven economy demands  We need to prepare our students for tomorrows economy in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace  China is graduating four times as many engineers as the United States  and there is no way for us to catch up in terms of raw numbers of graduates  The only way we can compete is to graduate students with the highest quality academic and technical skills  If we are going to support a strong economy  we need to ensure our students have the high quality skills they need to succeed in postsecondary education and the workforce    Earlier this week on the Senate floor we discussed the need for skills training and its impact on wages  I made a speech to the effect that the problem we are facing is one of minimum skills  not minimum wages  The effect may be low wages  but the cause is low skills  We need to address those workers who have few  if any  of the skills they need to compete for a better job and command higher wages  We need to start thinking in terms of skills  the kinds of skills that will help students support themselves and their families in the future    Research suggests that high school drop outs have an unemployment rate two times higher than high school graduates  and three times higher than college graduates  Over time  the earning differential between high school and college graduates has increased as well  In 1980  college graduates earned fifty percent more during their lifetime than high school graduates  Today this differential has increased to 100 percent and continues to expand    The Perkins program helps students learn and develop the skills they need to compete in the workforce  In the bill before us  weve emphasized the need to prepare students for placement in high skill  high wage  or high demand occupations  These are the types of jobs that will ensure a stronger future for students and will help them become self sufficient    Eighty percent of the jobs created over the next ten years will require some postsecondary education  However  the majority of those jobs will require less than a four year degree  This is a critical issue  and we need to start now to meet the needs of the future workforce  I believe that a stronger  more effective Perkins program is an important way to address this issue    As you can see on this chart  by 2010 we face a projected skilled worker shortage of 5 3 million workers  Thats 5 3 million American jobs that cant be filled because our workers dont have the right skills  That is why career and technical education funds are so critical to the supply of skilled labor in this country  These are precisely the types of careers for which the Perkins program is preparing students  Career and technical programs in this country are preparing engineers  health care professionals  information technology workers  trade  industry  and business leaders  and a host of other careers    One of the most critical improvements weve made to the Perkins program in this bill is to strengthen the connection of career and technical education programs to the needs of businesses  If we are going to help fill the growing need for skilled workers  we need to ensure Perkins programs are coordinating their instruction with current practices in industry and the needs of the local workforce    In Rock Springs  Wyoming  Ted Schroeder  a career and technical education teacher  has demonstrated firsthand the success that comes from connecting career and technical education to the needs of business  In response to complaints heard from local businesses about the need for students with stronger accounting skills  Ted went looking for a program that could help train his students with the skills requested by the businesses    Working with local school leaders  Ted began a computer based accounting program at the high school in Rock Springs and has been enrolling students successfully for the past few years  Some of those students are now moving on to community college or the workforce    Thats the type of relevant instruction that we need to encourage and that we are encouraging through this bill  I would expect that the students performing well in that accounting class are also performing well on state math assessments in Wyoming    The final reason that this legislation is important is because it provides a foundation for the redesign of federal education policy  We need to structure federal education policies that provide students and adult learners have access to lifelong education opportunities  In this twenty first century economy  learning never ends  and school is never out    The Perkins Act is one part of a three legged stool of federal education and training programs  all of which we will be considering this year  The other two key pieces of this approach are the Workforce Investment Act  and the Higher Education Act    If we are going to stay competitive  federal education programs need to help support seamless transitions from education to the workforce  throughout life  from preschool through postsecondary education and beyond  The bill we are considering takes the first step in that direction by emphasizing the connection between academic and technical education and the workforce and postsecondary education  The Workforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act will be the next critical steps in ensuring that American students are prepared for today and tomorrows careers  many which havent been invented yet    Todays students are more and more likely to return to school throughout their lives for additional training  Some estimates suggest that as many as seventy five percent of todays workers will need additional training just to stay current with their jobs  The modern college student reflects this trend perfectly  Todays average college student is likely to be older than twenty four  independent  and more likely to be female     That snapshot reflects the reality that todays college students are there for training and technical skills acquisition more than anything else  Postsecondary education is one of the fastest means to advancement in todays economy  With a postsecondary education  workers are more likely to keep their jobs and take advantage of opportunities to grow and advance in the workforce  or transition to another occupation as the workforce changes     Federal policy needs to reflect the twenty first century reality that we are in the midst of a jobs revolution  We are going to experience dramatic changes in the workforce over the next ten to fifteen years  and we need to start now if we are going to adapt federal education and training policy to meet the coming crisis of too few workers with too few skills    I am grateful for the work of my colleagues and the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on this legislation  We were able to move this bill quickly through Committee  and now to the floor  because we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize a program that the members of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee feel is an important part of the federal education and training system    I hope that we will be able to proceed quickly to conference with the House  I know they marked up their legislation yesterday as well  and I expect they will also proceed quickly to floor consideration     We look forward to working with the House to conference this bill and send it to President for signature this spring    I am hopeful we will be able to complete action on this bill quickly and send it to the President for signature  so that we can begin work on the Workforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act  the next critical pieces of a comprehensive approach to federal education and training initiatives  and lifelong educational opportunities                                                      March 2005 News Releases
