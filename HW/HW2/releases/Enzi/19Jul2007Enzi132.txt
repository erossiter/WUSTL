                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi introduces bill to wipe out tobacco in America in a generation  July 19  2007  Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo  Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today introduced legislation to wipe out tobacco use in   America through an innovative cap and trade program that will shrink the size of the tobacco market over the next 20 years     Tobacco kills  We need new ideas to get people to stop smoking  or better yet  never to start  Enzi said  Thats what my legislation does  My bill contains a novel cap and trade program that will guarantee that fewer people suffer the deadly consequences of smoking  while providing flexibility in how those reductions are achieved     Cap and trade programs have a proven track record in the environmental arena  particularly in addressing acid rain  My tobacco plan is based on the successful program in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990  This system achieved the desired results faster and at lower cost than had been anticipated  The same can be done for tobacco  Enzi said        The cap and trade program will reduce the adverse health effects of tobacco use through reductions in the size of the   US tobacco market to fewer than 2 percent of the population over 20 years  Tobacco manufacturers would be required to meet specific user level limits by specified deadlines and the plan would set up a market share allocation and transfer system in which allowances could be used  banked  traded  or sold freely on the open market        The Enzi proposal  the Help End Addiction to Lethal Tobacco Habits Act  HEALTH Act   would also close loopholes in the law that tobacco companies have exploited and enjoyed for far too long  It would use proven approaches to help people stop using tobacco products and implement tried and true prevention programs    Some have suggested that FDA regulation of tobacco is the way toward safer tobacco products  But we know that there is no such thing as a safe cigarette  Enzi said  Proposals to have FDA regulate tobacco are a misguided attempt to force a deadly product into the regulatory structure developed for drugs and devices  products which DO have health benefits  The Democrats deadly scheme for tobacco would be very costly  and would not result in much of a health benefit  We can do better     The Help End Addiction to Lethal Tobacco Habits Act  HEALTH Act    Title I  Raising the bar on our knowledge    Removes an outdated provision that allows manufacturers to shield from the government which ingredients are in which tobacco products     Modernizes and standardizes testing methods for measuring and reporting nicotine  tar and carbon monoxide in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco     Strengthens warning labels on packages  changes to bold warnings with color graphics  a strategy that has been proven to work in the EU and   Canada        Title II  Determining who uses tobacco    Consolidates multiple overlapping surveys on tobacco use to gather the necessary data to monitor the baseline and reductions under Title III       Title III  Reducing the number of tobacco users    Creates a cap and trade program to reduce the adverse health effects of tobacco use through reductions in annual size of the   US tobacco market from 2006 levels     Requires compliance by tobacco manufacturers with specific user level limitations by specified deadlines     Sets up a market share allocation and transfer system  Allowances can be used  banked  traded  or sold freely on the open market     The number of allowances decreases each year  ultimately resulting in fewer than 2  of the population using tobacco  versus nearly 21  today  a 90  reduction       Title IV  Increasing the tobacco excise tax    Increases the tobacco excise tax based on the relative risk of products  see Title V for information on risk classification      Distributes the revenue as follows  50  to Medicare  25  to Medicaid  and 25  to tobacco control and prevention  This maintains the tight link between tobacco tax policy and tobacco health policy       Title V  Encouraging tobacco control and prevention  and smoking cessation    Establishes an FDA panel to classify tobacco products or groups of products by risk     Gives FDA explicit authority to ban nicotine     Creates a program of counter advertising  conducted by HHS  and funded from the 25  for control and prevention in Title IV     Closes a loophole in Medicare and Medicaid to provide coverage for smoking cessation  regardless of whether the beneficiary has a diagnosed smoking related illness     Enhances the Federal match under Medicaid for states that meet the CDC recommended levels of MSA funds spent on tobacco control and prevention     What is cap and trade     Cap and trade is an  approach used to control something  historically a   by providing   for achieving reductions in the emissions of that   Cap and trade programs have a proven track record in the environmental arena  the most dramatic success story being the control of acid rain in the 1990s  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 instituted a system of allowances for emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that could be used  banked  traded or sold freely on the open market  The number of allowances decreased each year  This system achieved the desired air quality improvements faster and at lower cost than had been anticipated     In cap and trade programs  the sets a limit or cap on the amount of a pollutant that can be emitted  The cap provides the standard by which progress is measured  and it creates an artificial scarcity  Companies or other groups that emit the pollutant are given allowances to emit a specific amount  The total amount of allowances is fixed and cannot exceed the cap  limiting total national emissions  The allowances then have value  due to the artificial scarcity created  The cap is lowered over time   aiming towards a national emissions reduction target      Companies must hold a sufficient number of allowances to cover their emissions  or face heavy penalties  A source that reduces its emissions below its allowance level may sell the extra allowances to another source  A source that finds it more expensive to reduce emissions below allowable levels may buy  trade  allowances from another source  Buyers and sellers may bank any unused allowances for future use  This system reduces emissions at the lowest possible cost to society     In some cap and trade systems  organizations which do not pollute may also buy allowances  For example  e could purchase and retire allowances to reduce emissions and raise the price of the remaining credits  the  in action      Cap and trade systems leverage the power of  to deal with pollution  While the cap is set by a political process  individual companies are free to choose how  when or if they will reduce their emissions  Firms will choose the least costly way to comply  creating incentives to reduce the cost of achieving a pollution reduction goal  Cap and trade systems are easier to enforce than traditional command and control bureaucratic approaches because the government overseeing the market does not need to regulate specific practices of each source     Cap and trade systems guarantee reductions  and companies are given time and flexibility to meet the targets  Sources have flexibility to decide when  where and how to reduce emissions  Making the power of the market work to achieve our policy goals just makes sense
