                                                                                                                                                                                      Senate OK  s Farm Bill  Enzi supports reform  COOL  meat shipments  livestock title  December 14  2007 Washington  D C    Following nearly four weeks of debate  the U S  Senate passed the 2007 Farm Bill  according to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   This legislation promotes competitive markets and seeks to reform farm support programs  There is much reform needed with current farm programs and this bill deals with many of them but much more should be addressed in the future  I am constantly in contact with Wyoming producers who voice their opinions about what they expect and dont expect from a Farm Bill  Folks in Wyoming believe that their checks should come from an auctioneer or buyer  not the government  We should help our producers but not to the point of completely supporting them  said Enzi    Country of Origin Labeling   The bill contains language agreed to by the House of Representatives that would implement country of origin labeling by September 30  2008  The proposal would require the U S  Department of Agriculture to do what it has failed to do under current law  Labeling would be required for beef  lamb  pork and goat products  The House language establishes a three label system for meat products that would differentiate completely domestic products from completely foreign products  Enzi sent a letter to Chairman Harkin on Sept  25 asking for inclusion of COOL language in the bill    Interstate Meat Shipments   The Farm Bill contains language that would ensure meat tested in state with the strictest federal standards could be sold across state lines  The language  similar to a stand alone bill Enzi introduced earlier this year  S 1150  would open markets and expand economic opportunities for producers  As the law is written now  meat and poultry products that are not federally inspected may only be sold within the borders of the state  even after passing a state inspection which is on par with federal inspection guidelines  Meat and poultry from some foreign countries are allowed to be freely shipped and sold anywhere in the U S  Enzi believes it is important to fix this inconsistency so Wyoming producers do not have to jump through more federal hoops than foreign producers    Disaster Planning  The Supplemental Disaster Assistance Program which allows the federal government to plan ahead for weather related disasters to help producers  consumers and taxpayers  was included in final passage  Enzi likened the program to a family starting a rainy day savings account to ensure protection against future misfortunes  The federal government does not have a rainy day account for agriculture disasters or any other disasters  This program would provide fiscal responsibility and predictable assistance to agriculture producers while easing the minds of taxpayers    Livestock Title  The bill also contains language that would facilitate efforts to make the current voluntary reporting system mandatory  Packers  processors and importers are required to report critical market data to the USDA  which is then calculated  published and made available to the industry  These reported prices and other information have become an integral part of setting prices under contracts and in the open market  Included language will speed up the process for making this program  critical for transparency in livestock markets  mandatory  The livestock title also contains a ban on packer ownership of cattle shortly prior to slaughter  Enzi sent a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture on May 14 urging the department to implement the laws that are critical for transparency in livestock markets   Sheep  Sugar Beets  Conservation  Brucellosis  A continuation of the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center  which plays an important role in enhancing the marketing of sheep and goat products in the U S   was included in the bill as well as a 20 cent increase in the loan rate for graded wool  Funding for the National Sheep and Goat Industry Improvement Center is also included  The enrollment acreage for the Conservation Reserve Program  Farmland Protection Program and the Grassland Reserve Program levels are maintained in the bill in addition to an increase in funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  The bill includes a phased in one cent loan rate increase for sugar beets and a marketing allotment program to accommodate for Mexican sugar imports expected to begin in January 2008  Language in the legislation also authorizes the USDA to offer bids for excess domestic sugar to be sold for ethanol and bio fuel production  The language also directs the USDA to make veterinary and brucellosis research a priority  Wyoming has been brucellosis free since December 2006   The bill will now go to a conference committee where differences will be worked out between the Senate and House version of the bill  Enzi will work with his colleagues to figure out ways to decrease spending levels in the bill through the conference process   to read Senator Enzi s floor statement on the Farm Bill                                                      December 2007 News Releases           Browse by
