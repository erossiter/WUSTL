business health insurance bill  November 3  2005 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee introduced a bill this week he said would help small businesses and their employees increase access to affordable health insurance plans     The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005  is designed to lower health insurance costs by stimulating market reforms and promoting competition while allowing trade associations the ability to offer group insurance plans for employees     Enzis bill  S  1955  would allow business and trade association to band their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or statewide basis  The group plans would be in direct response to runaway costs that are driving many employers and families from comprehensive health insurance  Since 2000  group premiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 percent    We are nearing almost five years of double digit growth in health insurance premiums   increases that have repeatedly exceeded more than five times the rate of inflation  said Enzi  a former small business owner  This inflationary spiral is lowering the quality of life for countless families and hurting our economy  But those hardest hit are Americas small businesses and their hard working employees and families  Never before has there been a more urgent need to encourage market reforms like those proposed in this bill     The bill is designed to enhance the market leverage of small groups as well as individuals by giving associations a meaningful role on a level playing field with other group health plans  streamlining the current hodgepodge of varying state regulations  preserving the primary role of the states in health insurance oversight and consumer protection  making lower cost health plan options available  and achieving meaningful reform without a big price tag  Enzi said     According to Enzi the legislation will benefit families struggling to keep their current insurance as well as those already priced out of their plans  The bill is the result of more than a year of negotiations and responds to pleas from the small business community to be allowed to pool their members and provide group health insurance  called Small Business Health Plans  SBHPs   Enzis bill will also include safeguards to protect against adverse effects that could result if new group plans were given a blanket exemption from state based oversight and enforcement     Enzi held a hearing in April to gather information that would help small businesses combat growth in health insurance costs and dwindling access to health coverage  Jackson businessman  Mitchell Blake of Blake Ward Architects traveled to Washington to testify before the committee at the invitation of Enzi  Many of the ideas and solutions brought forward during the hearing were incorporated into Enzis bill
