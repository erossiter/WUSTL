theatrical ploy to pull troops from Iraq  July 18  2007 Washington  D C   During an all nighter in the Senate  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   spoke about the mission in Iraq  supporting our troops and winning the war against terrorism  This morning the Senate voted on a procedural motion to end debate on an amendment that would require pulling troops out of Iraq  Senators defeated the measure by a vote of 52 47  Under Senate rules  it needed 60 votes to pass  When debate on the National Defense Authorization Act continues later this year  Enzi hopes Democratic leadership will allow a vote on the final bill  which would authorize funding for our troops  including an across the board pay raise   Enzis statement follows   Mr  President  I rise to express my disappointment in this all night session and the attempt to call this PR stunt progress for our troops It is clear that some in this chamber are putting rhetoric before results Our troops in Iraq continue to pay the price of political rhetoric in Washington  DC  I believe my colleagues truly care about our troops and I share their desire to have all of our troops home as soon as possible To endorse a strategy of withdrawing troops in 120 days after this bill passes  however  undermines those very troops  We make it even more difficult for them to achieve their mission With todays rapid communication made possible by the Internet  cell phones  and other technologies  what we say here can almost instantaneously find its way around the world and straight to the camps of both friends and foes  and they are both watching In fact  I dont think its an exaggeration to say that the whole world is watching to see what we will decide to do  Ambassador Ryan Crocker  our United States Ambassador to Iraq  has made some very interesting comments that I find valuable  He  like our military commanders in Iraq  is in the best position to give us in Washington a true assessment of the situation on the ground Ambassador Crocker has stated that he could see the Iraqi Government achieve none of the deBaathification benchmarks and yet have a situation of stability and progress  At the same time  we could see a situation where all benchmarks are achieved and yet have an unstable and unsecure nation  In statements on this floor  I have discussed the goals of benchmarks for the Iraqi Government  and I continue to believe we should be setting those goals  We should be helping the Iraqi Government achieve them  But we cannot expect the Iraqi Government to exist in a vacuum where our American ideals of democracy will simply exist in one day  one month  or one year  I have also recently read an article by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Washington Post Dr  Kissinger wrote about the centuries long struggles between the Sunni  Shiia  and Kurdish populations in Iraq He  too  points out that it is unrealistic to expect these groups to  in a matter of a few years  forget hundreds of years of conflict and work together in our time frame   I ask that three articles be included in the record  The people of the United States and certainly the members of the United States Senate should continue to press for progress being made by the Iraqi Government We should provide our troops and our civilian representatives on the ground in Iraq with the resources they need to assist the Iraqis in achieving a secure and stable state We must not undermine their efforts in an attempt to score political points  An assessment of military actions will be released in September When that assessment is made by those on the ground in Iraq  I will carefully evaluate what their determinations mean for the future of Americas troops serving in Iraq  Mr  President  I want to close by expressing my heartfelt thanks to all of the men and women serving in our United States Armed Forces You are all true heroes You have volunteered to defend our nation  our freedom  and our way of life For those of you deployed in Iraq  Afghanistan  and around the world  I hope you know the difference you are making in the lives of the people around you Your families  friends  and the people of America are safer because of the work you are doing Thank you  I yield the floor                                                               July 2007 News Releases           Browse by
