 Highway Bill To Provide Jobs Thomas  Enzi  Cubin secure more than  100 million to take care of state road priorities  July 29  2005 Washington  D C   After several years of partisan battles  the United States Congress has approved a comprehensive highway bill  creating thousands of jobs across Wyoming and ensuring that our highways remain safe  The highway bill reauthorization agreed to by a conference committee of the House and Senate was approved by the House by a vote of 412 8  The Senate later passed the measure  91 4  Wyomings Senators Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi  and Rep  Barbara Cubin  all R Wyo  voted in favor of final passage     This bill is about the creation of jobs  The more jobs we can create  the better the infrastructure  and the more sound the quality of life well have for folks from Barnum to Baggs  While this bill is important for jobs  it is equally important to the Wyoming Department of Transportation  WYDOT  so they can set their plans for future projects  This is a good day for Wyoming highways and roads  Thomas said     For the last several years  the Wyoming Department of Transportation  Wyoming contractors  and all those who drive on our roads have waited anxiously for the authorization of new funding for necessary improvements to our roads  The wait is almost over  Now plans can be made years in advance to ensure that Wyoming towns have the fewest interruptions on their roads while improvements are being made  said Enzi  Funding formula changes in this bill also recognize the unique transportation situations faced by rural states  especially Wyoming with all of our national parks and forests that attract travelers from around the world     This is a big win for the people of Wyoming  said Cubin  Wyoming historically has gotten back more than  1 30 for every dollar we paid in and this bill preserves that  Transportation spending is an investment in our future and I m pleased with how this bill turned out for the people of Wyoming  In a rural state like Wyoming  being able to get from one side of the state to the other is crucial for economic development  This bill will provide the resources we need to keep Wyoming moving into the future    Under the reconciled conference report  Wyoming will receive about  1 24 billion in highway funding for the five year period  Fiscal Years 2005  2009  Senators Thomas and Enzi and Rep  Cubin were able to secure  102 million for the projects to which WYDOT gave top priority  The Wyoming delegation also helped ensure that the formula used to allocate funding to states directed the highest amount of funding possible to rural states like Wyoming   The Wyoming projects that will be funded by the legislation include     4 3 million Recreational Trails Program FY 05 09    Parks Roads Program  PRP   310 million in FY 2005 and  320 million in FY 2006 through 2009     25 million for the reconstruction of Togwotee Pass between Dubois and Moran Junction     11 6 million for the reconstruction of WY Highway 59     30 million for the Western Research Institute asphalt research consortium     6 6 million for the extension of Burma Road and Burma Road Overpass in Gillette     22 6 million for the Casper West Belt Loop     20 52 million for improvements to I 80 near Rock Springs     6 6 million for U S  85 passing lanes     5 million for improvements to I 25 between Kaycee and Buffalo     4 million for I 25   Hwy 220 connector in Casper     880 000 for Main Street renovations in Riverton The members of the Wyoming Congressional delegation were also pleased that included in the bill was a designation of the Heartland Expressway along Highway 26 from the Wyoming Nebraska border to I 25  This designation will allow the highway to receive improvement funds as a route for commerce and trucking  This designation has been strongly supported by the City of Torrington and the State of Wyoming    Additionally  Senator Thomas was also able to insert language for trucks which exempts tractors weighing 19 500 pounds or less from the heavy vehicle tax if the gross combined weight of the tractor and a towed vehicle does not exceed 33 000 pounds  Thomas said  People who are just hauling a bull or taking their boat to a lake shouldnt have to pay an excise tax     Senator Enzi  as a member of the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee which drafted the transit portion of the bill  was able to secure  3 million for Wyoming statewide bus and bus related facilities  Additionally  the Banking Committee was able to improve the formula under which transit funds are allocated to address low population area transit needs    During consideration of the bill  which has been ongoing since last year  Rep  Cubin led a group of western House members who were concerned that rural states wouldn t be treated fairly  This western coalition of members was able to make sure that Wyoming s transit funding will double from what it was under the last highway bill  enacted more than six years ago    The legislation will now go to President Bush  who is expected to sign the bill into law    end
