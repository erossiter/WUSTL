                                                                                                                                                                                      Salad and savings Senate rejects SLAW January 24  2007 Washington  D C   Senate Democrats turned away legislation today that would give Presidents the ability to weed out earmarks and overspending and submit them back to Congress for closer scrutiny  This negative vote was a rejection of the change voters demanded  I m disappointed opponents of this measure cling so tightly to  business as usual   Don t let them kid you  the bottom line is that if this measure had been allowed to go through it would result in real spending reform  Enzi said  The fact that the proposal is modeled after a 1995 Democratic bill and is now being rejected by Democrats should not be lost on people who don t want their tax dollars wasted  They had a chance to do more here than just talk about cutting back on wasteful spending  but they blew it  Opponents of the measure  offered by Budget Committee Ranking Member Judd Gregg  R N H   used a filibuster to block the legislation and require 60 votes in order to continue debate on the proposal  The vote was 49 48  Gregg s spending amendment  a Second Look At Wasteful spending or SLAW  would allow Presidents to go through Congressional spending bills  pick out pork and then send it back to Congress in a special rescission message  Congress would have to approve or disapprove of the rescission package by a majority vote within eight days  If the spending is rejected the savings will go to pay toward deficit reduction  The President would be allowed to send Congress four special rescission messages per year   more  Senator Greggs proposal allows both Congress and the President the opportunity to seriously reconsider both mandatory and discretionary spending  By allowing the President to single out wasteful spending and giving Congress the final say through vote on a rescission package  this amendment will help eliminate waste  rather than perpetuate the current out of control spending habits  Enzi said  Enzi and supporters of the Gregg proposal believe that it would pass Constitutional muster  unlike a previous line item veto law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1996  because the Gregg legislation requires Congress and not the executive branch to make the final decision on spending  Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi A Second Look at Wasteful Spending Amendment Gregg Amendment  101 to H R  2 January 24  2007  Senator Enzi  Mr  President  I rise today in support of Senator Gregg and Senator McConnells Second Look at Wasteful Spending amendment  While I would prefer that this issue be addressed on a separate bill  I understand the procedural reasons behind why my colleague from    New Hampshire is offering this amendment to the minimum wage package  I am treating this amendment as separate from the rest of the minimum wage debate and I hope my colleagues will do the same  I am pleased  however  that the Senate is able to debate this important issue on the floor    This amendment is a responsible step towards spending accountability  It provides for a greater level of accountability which is critical to enhance the fiscal wellbeing of the country  Senator Greggs proposal allows both Congress and the President the opportunity to seriously reconsider both mandatory and discretionary spending  By allowing the President to single out wasteful spending and giving Congress the final say through vote on a rescission package  this amendment will help eliminate waste  rather than perpetuate the current out of control spending habits   By forcing Congress to take another look at spending  this amendment gives the President the ability to send up to four rescission packages a year  Congress then has up to eight days to act on the Presidents proposal through a fast track process  However  a simple majority of both houses of Congress must approve before any of the rescission package can become law  Finally  any savings from the rescissions must go to deficit reduction   Ibelieve that A Second Look at Wasteful Spending is a simple  clear cut proposal that stands within the parameters of the United States Constitution  This amendment includes the same principles of fiscal responsibility that have received bipartisan support since the passage of a comprehensive veto in 1992  and strongly echo the Daschle Byrd proposal of 1995  Here is a chance for both Republicans and Democrats to help restrain frivolous spending   Iemphasize the gravity of fiscal responsibility because it sets the standard for the success or failure of our nation  We need to take action now to avert an even larger economic crisis in the future  A Second Look at Wasteful Spending is a step in the right direction  though there is more work to be done  Many of my colleagues in this chamber have supported this concept in the past  and I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment       As I stated in my maiden speech in 1997  the American people continue to demand an end to runaway spending  We need to show the American people that we are responsible  I said those words about the balanced budget amendment in 1997  and they also hold true for this amendment today  By adopting the Second Look at Wasteful Spending  we would show that Congress is willing to take a much needed step toward fiscal restraint  I stand in full support of this amendment and am proud to be a co sponsor  This outstanding amendment is worthy of your consideration and support                                                       January 2007 News Releases           Browse by
