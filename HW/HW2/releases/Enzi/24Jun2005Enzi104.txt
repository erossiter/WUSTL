bill to   Stop the Raid on Social Security    June 24  2005 Washington  D C   At a news conference on Capitol Hill today  11 Republican Senators announced new legislation to Stop the Raid on Social Security  The new measure protects the Social Security surplus by creating personal savings accounts that workers would own and that would be fully inheritable     Calling on Congress to stop the raid and start saving the surplus  Senators Jim DeMint  Mike Enzi  R Wyo   R S C   Rick Santorum  R Pa   Lindsey Graham  R S C   Mike Crapo  R Idaho  Tom Coburn  R Okla   John Sununu  R N H   Johnny Isakson  R Ga   John Cornyn  R Texas  Trent Lott  R Miss   and Sam Brownback  R Kan   announced the introduction of the Stop the Raid on Social Security Act    In recent years  Congress has worked to strengthen corporate accountability and enforcement measures against illegal accounting practices in the corporate world  Now its time to look at our own accounting practices  This would help restore transparency to our national insurance policy and protect Social Security money from government spending down the road  The managed personal account plan is the best accounting technique to stop the raid on the Social Security Trust Fund and help us move toward long term solvency  said Enzi  Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee  When my grandson retires I dont want him to say my grampa had a chance to fix Social Security and he didnt  I want him to say my grampa fixed it    The bill works to achieve three goals  1  the Social Security surplus should only be used for Social Security  not other government programs  2  Surpluses should be saved in personal accounts that are legally owned by workers  and 3  the surplus should not be used to mask the true size of the national deficit  The proposal accomplishes these goals by walling off Social Security surplus money from other government spending through the creation of personal retirement accounts    According to the Social Security Trustees  Social Security will run a surplus until 2017  Currently Social Security taxes pay for retiree benefits  as well as benefits for widows  orphans  and the disabled  Any funds left over  known as the Social Security surplus  are used for other government spending  Including interest  Congress has already spent  1 7 trillion of the Social Security surplus since 1985    The Stop the Raid on Social Security Act would change this practice by directing money from the surplus to fund newly created personal retirement accounts  People under the age of 55 will have personal retirement accounts  or can choose to opt out  The accounts will initially be invested in marketable Treasury bonds  This allows a safe and prudent transition period for the development of personal accounts to protect the Social Security surplus     An independent board  similar to the one which administrates the retirement plan for Members of Congress and Federal workers  will administer the personal retirement accounts  In January 2008  the board can offer individuals the opportunity to diversify into other prudent investment options  When a person retires  the account balance will be used to help pay Social Security benefits    According to the analysis prepared by the Office of the Chief Actuary at the Social Security Administration  the plan     Saves  792 billion in cash surpluses in personal accounts between 2006 and 2016      Attracts universal participation since there is no down side for workers      Rebates surpluses back to workers on a proportional basis  For example  if the surplus amounts to 1 5  of total taxable earnings for all participants  then participants may contribute 1 5  of their taxable earnings      In 2006  workers are estimated to receive a 2 2  rebate  Therefore  a worker earning  35 000 in 2006 could contribute  770 to their personal retirement account  If this worker is 25 years of age  invests in government bonds  and retires at age 67  he she would accumulate over  43 000      Holds solvency harmless so that full scheduled benefits would be payable until 2041     Uses near term surpluses to make a dent in the long term cash flow deficit  The present value of future spending reductions would total  519 billion     Senator DeMint said  Social Security has been a secret slush fund for Congress for over twenty years  Its time to stop the raid and start the accounts  American families pay thousands of dollars in Social Security taxes every year  and not a penny is saved for their retirement  Politicians of both parties have been secretly robbing workers retirements to pay for other programs  This plan will take the first step toward long term reform by locking away money today and reducing government obligations tomorrow  This plan will restore integrity to the program and restore trust with the American people about how Social Security is run    end                                                       June 2005 News Releases
