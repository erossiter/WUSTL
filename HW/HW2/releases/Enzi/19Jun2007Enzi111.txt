                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi seeks to name Teton Park visitor center after Thomas Senate passes naming as part of Thomas bill to expand park June 19  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   is working to honor the memory  life work and passion of friend and former colleague U S  Senator Craig Thomas by naming a national park visitor center after the senator and continuing Thomas work to expand Grand Teton NationalPark   Enzi worked with his Senate colleagues to unanimously pass a bill Thomas sponsored  S  277  the Grand Teton Land Expansion Act  The Senate unanimously passed thebill late on June 19  The legislation wouldadd nearly 50 acres to Grand Teton National Park  Enzi added an amendment to the legislation to rename the new Grand Teton visitors center after the former senator   If Craig loved anything like his family and horses it was national parks  especially Grand Teton and    Yellowstone   It is appropriate that we formally recognize the contributions Craig made to the country and especially   Wyoming through his dedication  passion and work on behalf of national parks  Families who pass through    the Park gates for generations to come should know the name of Craig Thomas  said Enzi  In addition to Craig  we have the Halpin family to thank for their generosity  It will truly be a gift enjoyed by the people of    Wyoming and the West  and also by all who come to visit our national parks every year   The amended bill will name the Grand Teton National Park Visitors Center the Craig Thomas Discovery and     Visitor    Center  It would also direct the Secretary of Interior to accept the donation of 49 62 acres to the eastern boundary of the     Grand Teton    National Park near Lost Creek  The added acres will help continue preservation efforts in the area   On May 5  2007  the House passed legislation identical to S  277  but without the amendment to name the visitors center after Senator Thomas  Senator Enzi will now work with colleagues in the House to swiftly pass the amended bill   Enzi spoke on the Senate floor today about the legislation and his former colleague       Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi on passage of S  277 The     Grand Teton    National Park Extension Act of 2007 Mr  President  It was just a few days ago that we heard the news that we had lost our dear friend and colleague in the Senate  Craig Thomas  We lowered our flags and joined together as a family to say goodbye to someone who fought for what he believed in and worked till the end to make   Wyoming and the West better places to live   Craig is gone now  but the work he began goes on  That is why I am pleased to offer an amendment to S  277  the Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007  My amendment builds on the work begun by Craig and the efforts of Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici who worked so hard to shepherd this bill through the legislative process  In addition  I would also like to thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for bringing this bill to the floor so we could make one of Craigs legislative goals a reality  It really is no surprise that Craig worked so hard to develop  draft and introduce this legislation  No one understood the needs of   Wyoming and the West better than he did  Craig was a cowboy from the top of his hat to the tips of his boots  There was nothing he enjoyed more than takinga horseout for a ride and spending time in the great outdoors  Craigs love for the wide open spaces of our state led him to introduce the Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007  When it is signed into law it will allow the Secretary of the Interior to accept the donation of approximately 50 acres of private land that would be added to     Grand Teton    National Park   In addition to Craig  we have the Halpin family to thank for their generosity  It will truly be a gift enjoyed by the people of   Wyoming and the West  and also by all who come to visit our national parks every year  When that land is added to the     Grand Teton    National Park   my amendment would add something else  It will be called the Craig Thomas Discovery and     Visitors    Center and it will provide people with a place to stop by during their visit where they can learn about the history of the Park and the life of Craig Thomas  I cant think of a better way to remember Craigs life than to share it with all who will benefit from his many years of hard work and public service  Craig dedicated his life to protecting and preserving our states natural resources  especially our parks  He was a tireless and true advocate for these important and precious facilities and he fought for their protection when he served as Chairman and later as Ranking Member of the National Parks Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  Craig had a proud history on the Committee and in the Senate as he constantly and consistently advocated for the best administration and management of our parks system  He authored legislation that provided critical funding and mandated management reforms that were necessary to keep our parks pristine and ensure they would be available for future generations to enjoy  He worked with all of his colleagues  regardless of their party affiliation to increase the funding for our parks so they could better deal with the maintenance backlog that exists  Now that hes gone  our parks have lost one of their best friends  Renaming the     Visitors    Center will ensure Craigs legacy will continue and never be forgotten  As noted in a letter written by the Grand Teton National Park Foundation  Senator Thomas championed this project since 1997  His leadership in securing an  8 million appropriation inspired the Foundation to raise  13 6 million in private funds for the project  For his efforts on this and so many issues of importance to our national park system  the Grand Teton National Park Foundation supports the naming of the Center after Senator Thomas  I ask that a copy of their letter of support be entered into the Record  The ribbon cutting ceremony for the newly constructed     Grand Teton    Visitors    Center is August 11  2007  It will be a day that will long be remembered by all who come to honor the memory of one of the parks greatest champions  By passing this legislation  we are making that day possible and ensuring that those who attend that special ceremony will be the first to enjoy all that the Craig Thomas Discovery and     Visitors    Center will have to offer  This is an honor that I know would have pleased Craig and made him very proud  I can almost see him  riding tall in the saddle of his favorite horse  taking it all in from under the brim of his favorite cowboy hat  Naming the     Visitors    Center for Craig Thomas will also mean a great deal to everyone who knew and loved him  It will be a tribute to a special American that will last for a long time to come  Many years from today when people come to the Park and stop by the     Visitors    Center that bears his name they will know that Craig Thomas was so many things in life    a Marine  a Senator  a rancher  and a dedicated and devoted father and a husband  But  most of all  they will know that Craig loved   Wyoming and the West and fought with everything he had to maintain our precious resources  I have always said that God saved some of his best handiwork for   Wyoming  Were fortunate that he also gave us one of his best to champion the fight to protect and preserve it all
