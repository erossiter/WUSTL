SEC should study stock option proposal  October 6  2005    Washington  D C  A bipartisan group of more than 300 House members voted for legislation this summer that would protect companies  ability to offer stock options to their employees  Now  by the dozen  senators are telling the Security and Exchange Commission that a thorough evaluation is needed as it moves forward with the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposal to expense stock options     At a minimum  the SEC should  conduct comprehensive  cross industry field testing of the various valuation proposals that have been submitted to FASB  as called for by a wide range of organizations  issue guidance on the use and liability associated with each of the various valuation models  and grant appropriate relief or safe harbors for small companies  Senate Republican Conference Chairman Senator Rick Santorum  R Penn   Sen  Mike Enzi  R Wyo   and 32 other senators wrote in an Oct  5 letter to SEC Chair William Donaldson  We are extremely concerned that without additional field testing of the various valuation models and implementation guidance from the SEC  U S  companies will be subject to unending lawsuits if they choose the wrong  valuation model     The letter requests guidance from the SEC  authority the SEC already possesses and has used on other accounting standards in the past     Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   wrote in a Sept  29 letter to Donaldson that the SEC should       conduct appropriate testing and determine the best method or methods to value employee stock options  Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens  R Alaska  said Tuesday he would support a study     A recent letter written by Minority Whip Harry Reid  D Nev   and Sen  Patty Murray  D Wash   and 13 other senators echoed the sentiments of the Santorum Enzi letter  Senators Jon Kyl  R Ariz   Chris Dodd  D Conn  and Kay Bailey Hutchison  R Texas  have written or are in the process of writing individual letters expressing concern about FASB s proposal     The overwhelming majority of the House and now the Senate believe the SEC should take a closer look at the FASB standard  The senators who have expressed concern include leadership from both parties  most of the members of the Appropriations Committee and Banking Committee  This speaks volumes about the flaws with the FASB rule  Enzi said  There is growing concern about the FASB proposal s effect on small businesses and their ability to compete in the global market     Senators who signed the Santorum Enzi letter include Senators

and contentious subject  no matter how much time it takes  the senators wrote     The letter text follows     October 5  2004    The Honorable William H  Donaldson  Chairman  U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  Washington  DC 20549    Dear Mr  Chairman     We write regarding a recent decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  on its proposal to require stock option expensing  Earlier this month  FASB decided not to require companies to use a specific valuation model to calculate stock options  In their opinion  companies should choose a stock option valuation model that is appropriate to each individual company  We are extremely concerned that without additional field testing of the various valuation models and implementation guidance from the SEC  U S  companies will be subject to unending lawsuits if they choose the wrong valuation model     While many studies have found that current valuation models are highly inaccurate for large companies  stock option grants  the lack of accuracy is an even greater concern for entrepreneurial and start up companies  Virtually no research has been conducted regarding the accuracy of valuation models to be used by small companies     At a minimum  the SEC should  conduct comprehensive  cross industry field testing of the various valuation proposals that have been submitted to FASB  as called for by a wide range of organizations  issue guidance on the use and liability associated with each of the various valuation models  and grant appropriate relief or safe harbors for small companies  It is crucial to get the right answer on this complex and contentious subject  no matter how much time it takes     In addition  companies should be given an ample amount of time to implement current accounting and corporate governance reforms before embarking on new accounting standards  The 14 million American workers who hold stock options  our business community  the investing public  and our economy depend upon accurate and reliable financial statements and information     Thank you for your attention to this important issue  We look forward to your response     Sincerely     Senators
