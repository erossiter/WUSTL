real change in Cuba travel policy  March 1  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Sen  Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said it is time to break down travel barriers between the Unites States and Cuba  Enzi  with bi partisan support from nine other senators  introduced S  721  the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act  today which would allow Americans to travel to Cuba free of the restrictions now in place   If we want to give the Cuban people a taste of the real America  we need to allow Americans to go there and share it  said Enzi  Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods  but the flow of ideas  ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to positive change in any nation  If we allow travel to Cuba  if we increase trade and dialogue  we take away the Cuban government s ability to blame the hardships of the Cuban people on the United States  In a very real sense  the more we work to improve the lives of the Cuban people  the more we will reduce the level and the tone of the rhetoric used against us by the Cuban government  The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act is a continuation of Enzis efforts to address travel provisions under the current Cuba policy  Cosponsors of the bill include Senators Byron Dorgan D N D   Max Baucus D Mont   Larry Craig R Idaho  Patrick Leahy D Vt   Tom Harkin D Iowa  Chuck Hagel R Neb   Russell Feingold D Wis   Dianne Feinstein D Calif   and Jeff Bingaman D N M  Floor Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi Introduction of the Freedom to Travel to    Cuba Act   March 1  2007 Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  today I am pleased to introduce the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act with Senator Dorgan and a number of Senators  This legislation addresses only the travel provisions of our    Cuba policy   The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act is very straightforward  It states that the President should not prohibit  either directly or indirectly  travel to or from Cuba by    United States citizens    I have had the opportunity to watch what has happened with    Cuba through the years and I am reminded of something my dad used to say   if you keep on doing what you have always been doing  you are going to wind up getting what you already got     That has been the situation with the United States policy on    Cuba   We have been trying the same thing for over 40 years  and our strategy has not worked  I am suggesting a change to get a more people in    Cuba to increase the dialogue    Most of us know that Fidel Castros health is not good and that he ceded power to his brother Raul last year  I have heard arguments that now is not the time to change our policy toward    Cuba   and that by changing policy  we could strengthen Rauls grip on the nation  This is the same argument we have been hearing for the last 40 years  simply a new verse   When we stop Cuban Americans from bringing financial assistance to their families in Cuba  end the people to people exchanges  and stop the sale of agricultural and medicinal products to   Cuba   we are not hurting the Cuban government  we are hurting the Cuban people  We are further diminishing their faith and trust in the    United States and reducing the strength of the ties that bind the people of our two countries     If we allow travel to Cuba  if we increase trade and dialogue  we take away the Cuban government s ability to blame the hardships of the Cuban people on the    United States   In a very real sense  the more we work to improve the lives of the Cuban people  the more we will reduce the level and the tone of the rhetoric used against us by the Cuban government   It is time for a different policy  one that goes further than embargoes and replaces a restrictive and confusing travel policy with a new one that will more effectively help us to achieve our goal of sharing democratic ideas with the people of    Cuba    The bill we are introducing today makes real change in our Cuba travel policy toward that will lead to real change for the people of    Cuba   What better way to let the Cuban people know of our concern for their plight than for them to hear it from their friends and extended family from the    United States   Let them hear it from the American people who will go there  The people of this country are our best ambassadors and we should let them show the people of   Cuba what we as a nation are all about  If we want to give the Cuban people real knowledge of the truth about    America   we need to have Americans go there to share it   Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods  but the flow of ideas  ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to positive change in any nation  The rest of the world is not doing what we are doing  Countries around the world are trading with Cuba  investing in Cuba  and allowing their citizens to visit    Cuba   China  Venezuela  and    Iran are becoming the largest investors on the island  These nations are in a position to directly influence the future of   Cuba   Americans are nowhere to be found   Keeping the door closed and yelling at the Castro government on the other side does nothing to spread democracy and does nothing to help the people of    Cuba   Let us do something  let us open the door and talk to the Cuban people    I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at this legislation and join me in this effort  I yield the floor
