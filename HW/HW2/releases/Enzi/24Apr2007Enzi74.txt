schools must be designed to prepare students for the 21st Century  April 24  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   ranking member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said that more must be done to prepare Americas high school students to enter post secondary education and the workplace with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed  Simply graduating students is not sufficient  because a high school diploma today is no guarantee that a student has learned the basics  Enzi said  Nearly half of all college students are required to take remedial courses on subjects they should have learned in high school before they can begin college level coursework  This contributes to the rising costs of college  prevents students from graduating on time  and deters many students  particularly low income and minority students  from ever earning a degree  At todays HELP Committee hearing titled  No Child Left Behind Reauthorization  Modernizing Middle and High Schools for the 21st Century  Enzi said that Congress must address the alarming dropout rates across the country  Every day  7 000 students drop out of school  and unless high schools are able to graduate their students at higher rates than the 68 to 70 percent they currently do  more than 12 million students will drop out during the next decade  To remain competitive in a global economy  we must ensure that all Americans have the education and training they need to be successful  Enzi said  We need a plan  We need to ensure opportunities are available to all Americans  because our future depends on widely available and extensive knowledge and training and a commitment to excellence  The decisions we make about education and workforce development will have a dramatic effect on the economy and our society for a long time to come  Enzi said  For America to retain its competitive edge in the global economy  we need to find ways to encourage high school students to stay in school and prepare for and enter high skill fields  like math  science  engineering  health  technology  and foreign languages  In the HELP Committee  we are working to strengthen Americas education and training pipeline  Through the reauthorization of the Head Start Act  the No Child Left Behind Act  the Higher Education Act  and the Workforce Investment Act  we can make sure that every individual has access to a lifetime of education and training opportunities that provide the knowledge and skills they need to be successful and that our employers need to remain competitive  Statement of Michael B  Enzi      Ranking Republican  Senate Committee on Health      Education      Labor  and Pensions Hearing on NCLB Reauthorization  Modernizing Middle and High Schools for the 21st Century  Thank you  Senator Kennedy  for holding this hearing today on modernizing our high schools  We need to make sure our high schools are designed to prepare our students for the 21st century  We need to find ways to encourage high school students to stay in school and prepare for and enter high skill fields such as math  science  engineering  health  technology and critical foreign languages  We must also strengthen the programs that encourage and enable citizens of all ages to enroll in postsecondary education institutions and obtain or improve knowledge and skills  The decisions we make about education and workforce development will have a dramatic impact on the economy and our society for a long time to come   The present situation is discouraging  Every day in the   United States   7 000 students dropout of school  If the high school students who had dropped out of the class of 2006 had graduated instead  the nations economy would have benefited from an additional  309 billion in income they would have earned over their lifetimes  Its an incredible statistic  Because we couldnt reach those 7 000 students  it will cost us and them  309 billion in income we will both lose  We simply cannot afford to lose those resources  We must deal with the situation head on  we cannot allow students to waste their senior year  and graduate unprepared to enter postsecondary education and a workforce focused on skills and knowledge   The future outlook is not good  Unless high schools are able to graduate their students at higher rates than the 68 to 70 percent they currently do  more than 12 million students will drop out during the course of the next decade  The result long term will be a loss to the nation of  3 trillion  and as you can imagine  even more in terms of the quality of life for those dropouts   In addition  its important to remember the fact that a high school diploma does not guarantee that a student has learned the basics  Nearly half of all college students are required to take remedial courses  after graduating from high school  before they can take college level coursework   Each year  more than one million first time  full time  degree seeking students begin their undergraduate careers at four year colleges and universities with every hope and expectation of earning a bachelors degree  Of those students  fewer than four in 10 will actually meet that goal within four years  barely six in 10 will make it out in six years  Among minority students  remediation rates are even higher and completion rates are even lower   To remain competitive in a global economy  we cannot afford to lose people because they do not have the education and training they need to be successful  We need a plan  We need to ensure opportunities are available to all Americans  because our future depends on widely available and extensive knowledge and training and a commitment to excellence  Strong partnerships and alignment among K 12 schools  institutions of higher education  business and government will help us meet the needs   In the HELP Committee  we are using this opportunity to shape policy and strengthen the education and training pipeline  Through the reauthorization of Head Start  No Child Left Behind  the Higher Education Act and the Workforce Investment Act we can make sure that every individual has access to a lifetime of education and training opportunities that provide the knowledge and skills they need to be successful and that our employers need to remain competitive   I look forward to hearing the testimony of our witnesses and to working with members of the HELP committee in developing a sound policy to address these critical issues
