                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi continues work to put senate confirmed leaders at helm of mine  workplace safety agencies  January 31  2006    Washington  D C   Saying the loss of 14 men in the darkness of the        Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia has brought a great light to        bear on mine safety  U S  Sen  Mike Enzi  R  Wyo   Chairman of the        Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee today pledged        that the Senate will continue its work to make mines safer by putting solid        and experienced leaders in charge of the federal agencies overseeing        mine and workplace safety    The accidents of the past few weeks        have brought together labor  industry  and legislators on the local  state         and national levels  all determined to make the changes that are needed        to make our mines as safe as they can possibly be  Enzi said Tuesday         during a confirmation hearing for the Presidents nominees for Assistant        Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  OSHA   Edwin Foulke         and Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health  MSHA   Richard        Stickler     It is essential that both of these important agencies        have experienced and permanent leadership  At present  neither has the benefit        of a Senate confirmed administrator  Enzi said  He pledged to work        with HELP Committee members and other interested Senators to draft legislation        aimed at improving mine safety     Last year  the total number of coal mine fatalities was 22   the lowest        ever recorded  according to the Department of Labor  The injury rate in        the coal mining industry was also the lowest on record in 2004  Enzi has        seen first hand the safety successes of Wyoming mines and the low numbers        are evidence that the industry has made strides improving and promoting        workplace safety  but he said even one fatality or injury is too high of        a number and all those associated with mining must strive to do better            I met with the families of the miners lost in the Sago Mine        disaster and have seen people in my own community of Gillette suffer after        the loss of a loved one in a mine accident  Key to safety in an open pit        coal mine in Wyoming or a mine deep underground in West Virginia or even        a grain elevator in Iowa is a commitment to a culture of awareness and prevention         This committee will do its part by appointing responsible leaders and exploring        new ways to increase safety  Enzi said    Enzis experience with mine and worker safety extends beyond his committee        chairmanship    Mining and worker safety are very familiar to me         As a former Mayor of Gillette  I know well that part of Wyoming we call        the energy capital of the world because of the deposits of coal and coalbed        methane that are found here  I am also familiar with workplace safety issues        and regulations from my employment before I ran for office  Back then  I        was working in a management capacity in Wyomings oil industry  responsible        for our workplace safety programs  My experience there taught me lessons        I have never forgotten about what does and does not work in the effort to        make the workplace safer  It also served to impress upon me the sincere        and genuine interest of both employers and employees in the creation  and        effort to maintain  safe and healthful workplace environments  Enzi        said    Enzi said safety legislation the committee develops should be done by closely        following three principles    First  we must implement laws and        regulations that work in the real world  not merely ones that score political        points inside the beltway  In doing so we must keep our approach to workplace        safety simple and easily understood by everyone involved  including small        businesses and their workers  Second  we need to realize that workplace        safety is a team effort and it involves everyone on every level of an organization         There are no adversaries in the effort to promote workplace safety  Third         we must recognize that every worker must have every possible tool at their        disposal to increase their safety  and that comes with the training        and supervision necessary to ensure that they are using their equipment        properly and safely  Enzi said   Opening Statement of U S  Senator Michael B  Enzi           R WY  Chairman  Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  Nomination of Edwin Foulke to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor    Occupational Safety and Health Administration and  Nomination of Richard Stickler to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor           Mine Safety and Health Administration    Good afternoon  and welcome to the confirmation hearing for Edwin Foulke          to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health           and Richard Stickler to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine          Safety and Health  As we meet today  although the events of the recent          past will not be the subject of our hearing  it is impossible to separate          our focus on the issue of workplace and mine safety from the tragic mining          accidents in three mines in West Virginia and Kentucky  For the past few          weeks the attention of the nation has been centered on these mines as          we watched the heroic efforts that were underway to try to save those          who were trapped far below the surface  We then shared in the sorrow that          the families felt as they received the news that their loved ones had          died before they were able to be rescued  Our thoughts and prayers continue          to be with all those whose lives were forever changed by that tragedy    The loss of those men in the darkness of that mine has brought a great          light to bear on the issue of mine safety and the need for us to use every          resource at our disposal to make every workplace  especially our mines           safer     A week ago last Friday I traveled to West Virginia with Senator Rockefeller          to meet with the families of the Sago miners and to begin our Committees          review of mine safety issues  I was accompanied by our Ranking Member           Senator Kennedy  our Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee Chairman           Senator Isakson  and  although she was unable to come with us because          of an injury  Senator Murray  the Ranking Member of the Employment Subcommittee           sent her very capable staff    As we met with the families of those who had lost husbands  sons and fathers           we were moved by their determination and dedication to working with us          to ensure that everything is done to both prevent and better respond to          accidents in the future  Their firm resolve that a mining accident would          never leave another family without a father strengthened our own commitment          and increased our determination as a Committee to look for ways that we           as legislators  could be part of the solution to the complex problem of          workplace safety    I can only imagine the pain of losing a loved one under circumstances          like these and as we saw them trying to cope with their loss  it quickly          became apparent that words were inadequate without a corresponding pledge          to take action  Each of us who traveled those miles to West Virginia           in our own way  promised those families that the loss of their loved ones          would not be an end but the beginning of the work that must be done to          address the issue of mining and workplace safety  Today this Committee          begins the task of fulfilling our own responsibility for ensuring mine          and workplace safety by examining the plans of our nations principal          workplace safety officers for both short term and long term change in          our mines and other dangerous work environments  Our journey begins by          ensuring that the federal positions charged with overseeing worker safety          are filled with strong and experienced leaders    Fortunately  we will not be alone in that effort  The accidents of the          past few weeks have brought together labor  industry  legislators  and          other stakeholders on the local  state and national level  all determined          to make the changes that are needed to make our mines as safe as they          can possibly be    Coming from Wyoming  mining and worker safety are very familiar to me           As a former Mayor of Gillette  Wyoming  I know well that part of Wyoming          we call the energy capital of the world because of the deposits of coal          and coalbed methane that are found here     Today  Wyoming is the largest producer of coal in the nation  We mine          and ship an average of one million tons of coal a day  Coal is vital to          the economy of my state  and equally vital to the economy and energy security          of our country    I am also familiar with workplace safety issues and regulations from my          employment before I ran for office  Back then  I was working in a management          capacity in Wyomings oil industry  responsible for our workplace          safety programs  My experience there taught me lessons I have never forgotten          about what does and does not work in the effort to make the workplace          safer  It also served to impress upon me the sincere and genuine interest          of both employers and employees in the creation  and effort to maintain           safe and healthful workplace environments    If history has taught us anything  it is that the advances and innovations          that have been made in other fields of science and engineering are among          the most effective means of addressing workplace safety  That means we          must investigate the innovations that have been made by agencies like          NASA  and the work being done by the Department of Homeland Security to          provide first responders to the scene of an accident with the tools they          need to immediately begin rescue efforts  At the very least  it means          using available technologies that may be able to locate miners and send          them communications     It may be that we have the technology to do that and more  and we certainly          have the technological base upon which to build even better tools for          tomorrow  A hearing has already been held in the Senate  and legislation          has already been introduced on the state level to promote the use of tracking          devices to determine where miners are to aid rescue efforts    In addition  there are already personal emergency devices in use in some          mines that make it possible to deliver emergency text messages underground           In 1998 there was a mine fire in Utah and the use of these devices helped          45 miners to escape to safety    These devices are available now  However  we must improve their effectiveness          so they can be used in more mines  Then  in the event of an accident           we would know exactly where the miners are  and using these emergency          devices  we could communicate to them and let them know if there are any          routes available to them to bring them to a safe haven from which they          could be rescued    It is unfortunate that it took the accidents at those mines to focus our          attention on these issues  but it is very clear that the need for better          safety procedures demands our action now  It is also clear that providing          and promoting better safety procedures will produce better results for          every company in terms of production  morale  and its ability to more          effectively compete in the marketplace    Last year the total number of mine fatalities was the lowest ever recorded           The injury rate in the mining industry was also the lowest on record           Overall  that tells me that the industry has made strides improving and          promoting workplace safety  However  we can do better  We must look for          new and better ways to make mines and other hazardous workplaces safer          for all workers    Legislation will surely play a role in this effort  As the Chairman of          the Committee  I intend to work with my Committee members as well as other          interested Senators and stakeholders to draft legislation very soon to          provide and promote mine safety based on the following principles     First  we must implement laws and regulations that work in the real world           not merely ones that score political points inside the beltway  In doing          so we must keep our approach to workplace safety simple and easily understood          by everyone involved  including small businesses and their workers    Second  we need to realize that workplace safety is a team effort and          it involves everyone on every level of an organization  There are no adversaries          in the effort to promote workplace safety  To achieve success we have          to get everyone involved from the top down and the bottom up  Of course           employers have to take an active leadership role in the effort  That is          leading the best way  by example  and it will ensure workers          understand the importance of safety  by making it everyones          first and primary responsibility    Third  we must recognize that every worker must have every possible tool          at their disposal to increase their safety  and that comes with          the training and supervision necessary to ensure that they are using their          equipment properly and safely  As in all things  workplace safety involves          training  a constant improving of skills and a good basic education on          ways to avoid accidents  and what to do if they occur    Over the years  the Occupational Safety and Health Act has helped in the          promotion of workplace safety by reducing by 60 percent the number of          workplace fatalities and decreasing by more than 40 percent the rate for          occupational illness and injury  One of my primary goals upon coming to          Congress was to improve the effectiveness of federal worker safety oversight          and not to create more bureaucracy and red tape  Just before the holidays          I introduced three OSHA reform bills and each is cosponsored by five fellow          members of the HELP Committee  We believe that this legislation will improve          both OSHA and worker safety and we look forwarding to moving them this          year    At the Federal level  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration          and the Mine Safety and Health Administration are the two bodies that          Congress has charged with the primary responsibility for ensuring and          enhancing workplace safety  It is essential to this mission that both          agencies have experienced and permanent leadership  At present neither          of these important agencies has the benefit of such permanent leadership           While both agencies have been ably served by dedicated individuals in          acting capacities  the benefits of permanent leadership cannot be understated           We now have the opportunity to realize these benefits by the expeditious          confirmation of the two nominees appearing before this Committee today           It is an opportunity upon which we must act now to provide the leadership          that is needed to begin the process of addressing the issues of workplace          safety that have come to light in the past few weeks    Equally essential to the permanency of the leadership at these agencies          is the experience of those who will lead them  The Committee nomination          process is where we have the opportunity to hear from the nominees and          to review their qualifications  I would urge my colleagues to wait until          we have had the chance to hear from the nominees and to review their responses          to our questions and not rush to judgment    We are fortunate to have two nominees who have spent their entire working          careers deeply involved and engaged in the issues that lie at the core          of their respective agencys responsibilities    Richard Stickler  the nominee to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration           has extensive experience in the mining industry that spans over thirty seven          years  Mr  Stickler has worked as a miner  engineer  mine construction          foreman  mine shift foreman  superintendent and manager  He left private          sector employment in 1997 to become the Director of the Pennsylvania Bureau          of Deep Mine Safety where he served for six years    Like Mr  Stickler  Mr  Foulkes professional career has been one          of extensive involvement in workplace safety issues  Mr  Foulke is an          attorney who has specialized in the practice of labor and employment law           He is a partner in the firm of Jackson  Lewis  Scnitzler and Krupman           and a member of the firms OSHA Practice Group  In addition to his          private practice  Mr  Foulke served as a member of the Occupational Safety          and Health Review Commission for six years  five of which he served as          its Chairman     I look forward to hearing from both of you today                                                              January 2006 News Releases           Browse by
