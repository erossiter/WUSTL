fraud bill heads to Senate floor  June 14  2006 Washington  D C   The Senate Banking Committee voted in favor of a bill introduced by U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   that would protect military personnel against individuals using deceitful practices to sell financial products  The committee unanimously passed the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act  The bill is now slated for consideration by the full Senate  A similar bill  H R  458  passed the House last year by a vote of 405 2  Protecting our military personnel is not a partisan issue and this bill and this vote are proof of that  Our men and women in the military are trained in the use of high tech weaponry and defense systems  This training doesnt protect them from shady salespersons out to make an easy profit  This bill does  said Enzi  member of the Senate Banking Committee   Some financial services companies have been disguising  marketing and selling high cost periodic payment plan certificates solely to military personnel on military bases  These plans  nonexistent in the civilian market  are similar to mutual funds except that extremely high sales commissions rob investors of years of earnings and penalize them when they stop investing in the fund  Some insurance products provide very low death benefits while charging very high premiums are marketed to soldiers  Salespersons have disguised the product to appear endorsed by the Department of Defense or the federal government  Many investors who fell prey to these types of sales became aware that they were scams too late   The bill would provide for state insurance regulator jurisdiction over the sale of insurance products on military bases  It would also require the Department of Defense to keep a list of individuals barred or banned from military bases because of abusive sales tactics  Military families would also be protected under the bill because it would prevent investment companies from issuing periodic payment plan certificates  an outdated form of mutual fund with high up front costs and penalties  U S  Senator Hillary Clinton  D N Y   co sponsored the bill   Enzis statement as prepared for delivery at the committee hearing follows     Statement of Senator Mike Enzi Senate Banking Committee Markup of   S  418  the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act June 14  2006 Thank you Mr  Chairman  Today  I am pleased that the Committee will vote on S  418  the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act  I think the provisions of this bipartisan bill are crucial for the protection of our Armed Forces and their families  While most of Americas focus on the military concerns our actions abroad  protecting personnel and their families at home can sometimes be overlooked  But for years now  men and women in the armed services have fallen victim to unscrupulous salespersons pushing high cost and unnecessary financial products and life insurance  This practice must be stopped   As numerous investigations  studies  and congressional hearings have shown  bad actors within the insurance and financial products industry have been taking advantage of military personnel in order to turn a quick profit  The military personnel they target are often young  inexperienced in financial matters  and particularly vulnerable to the aggressive sales tactics used by some companies  To make matters worse  Department of Defense Directives and state regulations would be violated or completely ignored by these salesperson  without repercussion   In some cases  service men and women were sold life insurance policies with low benefits and premiums as high as fourteen times the amount available to every enlisted person under the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance program   In other cases  they were sold investments that have all but disappeared from the civilian markets because they can rob  investors of years of earnings  But some salespersons found a niche outside of the public mainstream to sell these disreputable investments  on our military bases   It should be noted that there are many upstanding financial and insurance companies that sell very worthwhile investment and insurance products to military families  They should be applauded for the fine job that they do in helping our military members and their families  This bill is targeted at the few who abuse the system and prey upon our military   And I believe that my bill  the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act  will stop these practices by targeting the bad actors and adding much needed transparency and communication between agencies   My bill clarifies confusing jurisdictional issues between DoD and state regulators  allowing regulators to better enforce state and federal law on military bases  It would create a registry to track investment advisors  brokers  dealers  and insurance salespersons  and let bases know when a suspicious salesperson has walked through their gates  Finally  the bill would ban the worst types of financial products being sold to our military  These products have disappeared from the civilian market  and they should disappear from our military installations too   This bill has gained bipartisan support in Congress  The House bill  introduced by Congressman Geoff Davis  passed last year by a vote of 405 2  In the Senate  the bill is cosponsored by three other members of this committee  Senator Hagel  Senator Bunning  and Senator Schumer  I would like to thank them for their support in this effort  I also thank Senator Clinton  with whom I introduced this legislation in the Senate  Finally  I thank Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes for their cooperation in finding the consensus solution and bringing this bill before us today  Members of this committee  I urge you to support this legislation and protect the financial future of our military personnel and their families  During a time when so many of our armed forces are bravely fighting tyranny abroad  we must ensure that they are protected at home  Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                        June 2006 News Releases
