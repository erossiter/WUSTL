Senate in health  education  other issues  January 5  2005 Washington  D C   In 1895 Marconi invented radio  Wyoming was five years old  That year was also when the last senator from Wyoming to chair the U S  Senate Committee on Education and Labor retired  Jump forward 110 years  It s 2005 and Wyoming again has a senator in charge of one of the Senate s most powerful committees     The Senate made it official this week  Mike Enzi was elected chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee during the 109th Congress     As chair  Enzi will draft many of the initial bills  set the committee s agenda  preside over the amendment process  lead the floor debate and chair Senate House conferences  He will lead the Senate in its efforts to help ensure that every child  career and college student in America receives a quality education  provide Americans access to affordable  quality health care  protect workers  provide them training to get the best jobs and oversee the security of their pensions     I ve had the privilege of serving on this committee for eight years and am thrilled with the opportunity to lead it  said Enzi  This is the committee with jurisdiction over legislation that affects how our young people are educated  how our healthcare system works  the safety of our workers and their retirement security  I m excited and awed at the tremendous responsibility  These issues can be as controversial as they are important  but I am optimistic that this committee will be productive during this congress and we will pass problem solving legislation     Sen  Ted Kennedy  D Mass   is the ranking member or leader of the minority party for the committee  Even though the two senators differ widely on political philosophy  Enzi believes they will work together and achieve passage of meaningful legislation     Senator Kennedy and I have worked together successfully before and we ve passed bills such as the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act  which helps prevent healthcare professionals who work with needles from being exposed to blood borne diseases  Enzi said  I ve already met to discuss the committee agenda  We recognize our differences  but we also both recognize that we are here to help people and that s what we are going to do      In its history  Wyoming has had eight senators ascend to the rank of chairman  The list started with Joseph Carey of Cheyenne who chaired the Committee on Education and Labor from 1891 to 1893  Wyoming s last chair was Alan Simpson of Cody who led the Committee on Veterans  Affairs in three different Congresses the first beginning in 1981 and the last ending in 1997     Other Wyoming senators who chaired committees include  Francis Warren of Cheyenne  Clarence Clark of Evanston  John Kendrick of Sheridan  Joseph O Mahoney of Cheyenne  Henry Schwartz of Casper and Gale McGee of Laramie      There are 16 Senate committees that have standing to vote on bills and pass them on to the Senate as a whole for consideration     The chair of each committee and a majority of its members represent the majority party  The chair primarily controls a committee s business and often initially drafts bills for consideration  Each party assigns its own members to committees  and each committee distributes its members among its subcommittees     According to the Congressional Research Service  several thousand bills and resolutions are referred to committees during each two year Congress  Committees select a small percentage for consideration  and those not addressed often receive no further action  The bills that committees report help to set the Senate s agenda     A committee s influence extends to its enactment of bills into law  A committee that considers a measure will manage the full Senate s deliberation on it  Also  its members will be appointed to any conference committee created to reconcile its version of a bill with the version passed by the House of Representatives     Committees receive varying levels of operating funds and employ varying numbers of aides  Each hires its own staff  The majority party controls most committee staff and resources  but a portion is shared with the minority     Enzi became the number one senator on the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee after Sen  Judd Gregg  R N H   the senator with the most seniority on the committee  decided to step down as chairman and become chairman of the Senate Budget Committee     More information about Wyoming senators who have chaired committees and the committee process and
