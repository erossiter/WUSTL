                                                                                                                                                                                      Senate rejects government   interference   with Medicare prescription drug program  April 18  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   hailed the Senates rejection of a plan to allow the federal government to fix prices for prescription drugs as a victory for Wyoming seniors  Last year I personally encouraged folks in Casper  Sheridan  Powell  Rock Springs  Cheyenne and Douglas and seniors from everywhere in Wyoming to sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug plan  They signed up in droves and this year theyve written and called me by the hundreds telling me not to let Congress change their plan because its working  Enzi said  So far  weve been able to hold off attempts to ruin a good thing  Some senators have pushed forward with legislation that would set up a federal price control system for prescription drugs  They fell five votes short of the 60 votes they needed today to move forward with the plan that would change Medicares Part D  Enzi  the Ranking Member on the Senate Health Committee  strongly opposed the measure   The government doesnt negotiate in the Medicare program  Medicare sets the prices it will pay  Having government set the price is the same as price controls and we saw what happened in the 1970s when we tried to control the price of gasoline  Long lines  shortages and a complete disaster  Enzi said  A big government price control program would mean some central committee in Washington D C  would decide what drugs would be available to seniors  Thats not only bad policy  its unhealthy policy  Seniors and their doctors should decide what drugs the doctors can prescribe  not the government  The House has already passed a measure that would allow the federal government to fix drug prices  but Enzi hopes the Senate will be able to stave off further attempts to further federalize Medicares Part D  The non partisan Congressional Budget Office has said over and over that this proposal to change the prescription drug plan would not save money  The plan we have now is helping almost 90 percent of Wyoming seniors and seniors nationwide get the prescription drugs they need  Its costing less than originally expected  When was the last time a government program cost less than estimated  Competition between the private plans is working  Dont fix what isnt broken  Enzi said  Those who want to change the current plan have advocated changes that resemble the drug benefit plan of the Veterans Administration  but Enzi reported that veterans in Wyoming are telling him they are switching to the current Medicare plan from their VA plans because the Medicare plan offers more choice  better prices  faster approval and easier access  Lets stop wasting the time of this important body and move to a bill that can do some good for the American people instead of trying to destroy a law thats already doing some good  Enzi said  Enzis full statement for the record is below   Floor Statement of Michael B  Enzi  Medicare Non Interference April 17  2007 Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  I rise today to speak in opposition to the bill currently before the Senate   First Mr  President  I would like to briefly review the status of the new Medicare law that Congress passed in November of 2003   That landmark legislation enacted the first major benefit expansion of the program since 1965 and placed increased emphasis on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits  It created a new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities  The legislation also expanded covered preventive services and created a specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified threshold   I am pleased to be able to report that this new program is working  All across the country  seniors are expressing their approval of the new benefit  In my State of Wyoming  the new Part D prescription drug benefit has been a huge success  Last year  I traveled around Wyoming and visited with seniors in Cheyenne  Douglas  Sheridan  Casper  Powell  and Rock Springs  I talked to folks all over the state and told them about the new program as I encouraged them to sign up for it  I also talked to a few of the pharmacists in Wyoming that worked so hard to make this program a success  I believe I can speak on behalf of many of my colleagues in saying thank you to the thousands of pharmacists throughout the country that did so much to implement this great program   Today  about 89 percent of Wyoming seniors are receiving prescription drug coverage  an increase of 16 percent from last year  They remember what it used to be like when they tried to get their prescription medications and they dont want to go back  I have received hundreds of calls and letters from Wyoming seniors who like the way things are and dont want Congress interfering with their prescription drug plan because it is working for them  Five separate surveys show that more than 75 percent of all beneficiaries are satisfied with the way the program works   Not only are about 90 percent of seniors now receiving prescription drugs  the program is costing LESS than originally expected  When is the last time a government program cost less than was estimated  I came to Washington in 1997  ten years ago  and I dont know that I have ever seen a government program that spent less money than we expected  Private competition is working better than we envisioned and it is saving seniors and the government more and more money every day  Why should we change that  Mr  President for some reason my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided they need to fix a program that isnt broken  We have implemented a plan that is working and before we change it  we need to be sure about what we are doing and the effect it will have on the program and the impact it will ultimately have on seniors from coast to coast  The bill now before the Senate would strike the non interference clause from the Medicare law  The non interference language in the Medicare law prevents the federal government from fixing prices on Medicare drugs or placing nationwide limits on the drugs that will be available to seniors and the disabled  I support this language 100 percent  Decisions on what drugs should be available should be made by seniors and their doctors  not by some central committee in Washington   Under the Medicare Part D law  each prescription drug plan has its own list of preferred drugs  Each plans list is different  some are broader  some are narrower  Each list  however  has at least two drugs from each therapeutic class of medications and everyone can find a plan that is advantageous to them  Mr  President  the non interference bill before us is not only unnecessary  but it could also prove to be harmful to the health of our nations seniors  The non interference language protects seniors and the disabled from having the government decide which drugs their doctors can prescribe  It maintains the sacred relationships that seniors have with their doctors  who know best about what particular drugs are right for their patients  Patients support this language  and they want us to maintain it  Mr  President  I would like to repeat  we have already implemented a plan that is working  Yet  the majority party wants to fix the Medicare drug benefit  Its ironic to me that they use the word fixfix is exactly what this bill will lead to  the government fixing prices on drugs  Its not a bill about negotiating prices  its a bill about fixing prices  As most Americans know  the government doesnt negotiate in the Medicare program  It sets the prices that the government will pay doctors and hospitals for serving seniors   Setting the price is the same as price controls  And we saw what happened in the 1970s when we tried to control the price of gasoline  Do you remember the long lines at the gas pumps  Trying to control the price of gasoline was a complete disaster  Lets not experiment with giving government the ability to control the prices of prescription drugs  Despite what some folks are reporting  the non partisan Congressional Budget Office has said over and over again that removing this language would not save the government or seniors any money  It wouldnt save money because the Medicare prescription drug plans will have strong incentives to negotiate drug price discounts that would be as low  or lower  than anything the government could negotiate  Additionally  many plans represent more people than Medicare  Medicaid  or the Veterans Administration  so the plans have greater purchasing power than the government  To effectively negotiate  you need to competing products  or you have to be willing to do without one of the products on which you are negotiating   How many times does the Congressional Budget Office have to say that this bill will not save the government any money before it starts to sink in  When will my friends on the other side of the aisle acknowledge that this bill will not save any money   We do  however  know of something that will save the Federal government and seniors money  competition among private plans  What has been proven to reduce costs    especially for seniors with low incomes    is the new Medicare drug benefit that we passed in 2003  The competition among private plans is driving the cost of the program down  The average monthly premium has dropped by 42 percent  from an estimated  38 to  22  and there is a plan available in every state for less than  20 a month  So let me suggest letting competition work to drive the prices even lower instead of instituting government price controls that have failed in the past   Also  because the program has choice  if the price of one plan goes up  beneficiaries can switch plans  Its important to remember that sometimes the prices will go up  because medical costs will go up as long as new technologies are invented that allow people to live longer  healthier lives  Democrats want to change Part D to resemble the drug benefit program of the Veterans Administration  In the VA system  the government sets a price on a drug it can get at the cheapest rate and limits or restricts access to those it can not get at cheap rates  As a result  the VA benefit excludes three out of four drugs available through Part D  Changing the Medicare program to be as restrictive as the VA system is completely illogical   Another thing about the VA system is that it can take a long time for new drugs to be included on the formularysometimes as long as three years  Let me repeat that  It can take as long as three years for new  life saving drugs to be included on the VA formulary   Lastly  the VA owns the whole system  so you have to order your drugs from them or you have to fill your prescriptions at one of 350 government run facilities nationwide  In contrast  seniors signing up for a Medicare prescription drug plan can choose their plan based on the pharmacy they want to use to fill their prescriptions  As a result of all of these things  more than one million retired veterans have signed up for Medicare in the last year  I talked to many Veterans in Wyoming and they all told me that they signed up for Medicare Part D so they could finally get the drugs they needed that they couldnt get from the VA   Unfortunately  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to make the Medicare program more like the VA program  They want to take away a seniors ability to choose  The real thing we should be talking about is how we can change the VA program to be more like Medicare Part D  The mark also contains a few other provisions relating to the comparative effectiveness of prescription drugsa study that determines whether drug A is better than drug B at treating a disease  The mark also contains a provision authorizing consideration of comparative clinical effectiveness studies in developing and reviewing formularies under the Medicare prescription drug program  No surprise here  but the Congressional Budget Office stated no savings will result because of this section   This is the first step of a dance the democrats want to do called cutting in on the relationship between doctors and patients  Decisions about what drugs patients should take should be made by doctors and patients  I think we should keep the government out of the exam room   To close  I would just like to remind folks of a few key points  The Medicare program is working  More seniors are getting the drugs they need at lower costs   The bill before the Senate tries to fix something that isnt broken    This bill will take away the choices seniors have about the drugs they use  The Congressional Budget Office has stated several times that this bill will not produce any savings   The bill tries to make the Medicare program more like the Veterans program  but the Veterans program has fewer choices than the Medicare programthats why over one million veterans have signed up for the Medicare program   We dont need meddling for the sake of meddling or a new system conjured up for political convenience  Lets stop wasting the time of this important body and move to a bill that can actually do some good for the American people   Thank you Mr  President   I yield
