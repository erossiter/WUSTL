                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi  HELP members working on bill to move mine safety into 21st century following W  Virginia tragedies  March 2  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said the committee is working to develop legislation that will move mine safety into the 21st Century  and reduce safety risks for miners across the country     However  he cautioned that the challenge to improve mine safety through new technology will be to avoid a one size fits all approach to safety  Coal is vital to the economy of Wyoming  which is the largest producer of coal in the nation  Wyomings surface coal mining industry ships an average of one million tons of coal a day  but the mining methods and type of coal differ from West and East  as do safety needs    There are challenges to implementing new and emerging mine safety technologies that we can address by legislative action  but some that we cannot  We can and will work to better coordinate governmental research efforts that may have application in the mining environment  Enzi said  Coming from Wyoming  which leads the nation in the production of coal  and where mining is a way of life  I am acutely aware of these issues  As chairman of this committee I am also uniquely aware of the responsibilities which we bear in ensuring and advancing the cause of workplace safety  I can assure all of you that the focus of this committee on these vital issues will not fade    During todays hearing  The State of Mine Safety and Health  Enzi called for enhancing dedicated mine safety research efforts through a combination of increased funding and structural re organization of the agency tasked with mine safety research  He pledged to work with HELP Committee members as well as other interested senators and stakeholders to produce legislation that will move mine safety into the 21st Century     Since the Alma and Sago mine tragedies in West Virginia earlier this year  many have voiced hope that development of wireless two way phone communications  two way text messaging  and portable oxygen devices containing enough oxygen to sustain miners and rescue teams for hours after an accident may reduce deaths and improve safety overall     However  Enzi cautioned that  We must keep in mind that mining environments vary considerably from mine to mine  While some technology will work in some mine settings  it may not work in others     Among the initiatives being considered as the HELP Committee develops legislation are new laws and regulations designed to speed the approval and certification process for new technology and to harnessing private sector resources to promote technology development    The task of developing new mine safety technology clearly will require new and creative ways to stimulate private sector research and development  Enzi said  Miners deserve the best safety equipment and technology that we can provide  and we should take all steps necessary to enhance its development and speed its implementation     Despite the recent tragedies  Enzi said that both injury and fatality rates in mining have shown a steady downward trend  adding that the total number of mine fatalities and injury rates were the lowest on record in 2005    Overall  we have made strides improving and promoting mine safety  he said  However  we can and must do better  Every miner deserves to return home safely at the end of the day  Even one avoidable accident is one too many  and we must act to reduce the safety risk for miners everywhere     On Jan  20  Enzi and the HELP Committees Ranking Member Senator Edward Kennedy  D Mass   Senator Johnny Isakson  R Ga   and Senator Jay Rockefeller  D W  Va   traveled to West Virginia to meet with the families of Sago Mine workers as well as officials of the International Coal Group  ICG  and MSHA    The best way we can honor the memory of those who have been lost is by protecting the safety of those that remain  We do this best by developing laws and regulations that enhance practical and innovative solutions  rather than simply enacting rigid rules  by developing and sharing new technology and encouraging rather than discouraging its use  and by seeking practical approaches to mine safety that yield real world results  Enzi said  Each of us who traveled to West Virginia  in our own way  promised those families that the loss of their loved ones would not be an end  but the beginning of the work that must be done to address mine safety
