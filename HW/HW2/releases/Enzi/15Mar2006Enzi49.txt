                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi committee passes health insurance bill for small business employees Estimates predict legislation would enable a million more workers to find insurance coverage than are covered now March 15  2006 Washington  D C   The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee voted in favor of a landmark bill today to allow business and trade associations to band their members together and offer affordable group health insurance to working families  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the HELP Committee said     The vote ended a stalemate that has lasted for more than a decade    Todays vote is the first major step in 15 years toward more affordable health insurance options for small business and working families  Enzi said  The people who make up the bedrock of our economy  small  family owned businesses  have demanded change  Its time for the Senate to pass this bill  No more excuses     The bipartisan bill  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act  S 1955  which was introduced by Enzi and cosponsored by Senator Ben Nelson  D Neb   and Senator Conrad Burns  R Mont   will allow business and trade associations to band their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or regional basis in direct response to runaway costs that are driving far too many employers and families from comprehensive health insurance    If Small Business Health Plans can harness the power of Americas small business owners  it would force the entire marketplace to respond  If we transform health insurance to a market where small employers and family owned businesses can demand better benefits at better prices  insurance companies would be forced either to keep up with the competition  or lose their market share  Enzi said  With the help of a diverse group of senators and business groups representing small business  weve bridged the gap between small business proponents of traditional AHPs and state based interests worried about the prospects of dramatic regulatory changes in health insurance markets    A few special interest groups have launched public relations campaigns designed to sink the small business health legislation despite the potential the bill holds to reduce costs and increase coverage  Enzi believes this bill has a better chance of survival because hes worked with diverse interests to include important safeguards to prevent adverse selection that would split healthy and sick groups and send premiums skyrocketing for the sick groups  The bill preserves the state role in protecting insurance consumers and ensures that small business owners will have the choice of both basic and enhanced packages of benefits    If you cant afford insurance you arent getting coverage for any procedures  mandated or not  Enzi said  My bill would allow a small business benefit health association to offer a more affordable healthcare package that may not include some of the states benefit mandates  but it would be required to offer a comprehensive alternative package    Enzi said it is also important for people to understand that just because a service isnt mandated doesnt mean that service is unavailable    My bill doesnt take away anyones right to a comprehensive benefit package  It does ensure that at least one comprehensive policy must be offered to every small or family owned business  while ensuring that basic  affordable policies are available as well  Enzi said  One family shoe store cant get an insurance company to play ball  But 10 000 family shoe stores probably can  We ought to help American small businesses and their employees negotiate for what they want from the insurance companies    Enzi pointed out that nearly every big employer offers cancer screenings  for example  to their employees  yet the big companies that self insure arent subject to state mandates     What we are doing with this legislation is giving small businesses the same power that big businesses have  Small businesses will choose to offer services like cancer screenings  just like big businesses do  They will have more power than ever before to help take care of their workers health needs    Enzi praised the support of Senator Nelson and Senator Burns  the bills cosponsors  saying  Im pleased to be joined by my colleagues  Senator Nelson and Senator Burns  They bring invaluable experience to this effort and I am grateful for their commitment to this issue    Senator Nelson said  If we dont do something to help small businesses cope with the costs of health care  soon we will have an entire workforce without health insurance coverage  Health care premiums are experiencing double digit growth annually  small businesses cant keep up with the costs  As a result  fewer employers are offering health coverage and fewer employees are covered  The continuing problem of skyrocketing heath care costs is a grave threat to our working families  This action by the HELP Committee today is the first step in addressing this problem    Senator Burns said  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act represents the best opportunity to bring affordable health insurance to small businesses in Montana and across the nation  I know this is a goal for all Senators  and I look forward to working with members from both sides of the aisle in achieving this important goal     Designed to enhance the market leverage of small groups as well as individual policy holders  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act will give associations a meaningful role on a level playing field with other group health plans  streamline the current hodgepodge of varying state regulation  preserve the primary role of the states in health insurance oversight and consumer protection  make lower cost health plan options available  and achieve meaningful reform without a big price tag     A report prepared by the Milwaukee firm of Mercer Oliver Wyman  Inc  for the National Small Business Association found that the Enzi Nelson bill would reduce health insurance costs for small business by 12 percent  In todays dollars   about  1 000 per employee  and  would reduce the number of uninsured in working families by 8 percent   or approximately 1 million people
