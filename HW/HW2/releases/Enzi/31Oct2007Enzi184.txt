verse  Dems playing games with kids health care  October 31  2007       Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said Congress is turning a childrens health care plan into one covering adults and is losing sight of the original intention of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  with the so called new SCHIP bill   Enzi spoke on the Senate floor today following a Senate vote to proceed with debate on a House passed bill that is essentially the same bill vetoed two weeks ago by President Bush  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet  but this so called new SCHIP plan thats essentially the same as the old one still stinks  said Enzi  Wyomings senior senator and ranking member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  I know today is Halloween but passing a bill that is as scary as the last one is not what a legislative body listening to the people and focusing on low income children should be doing  Lets put politics aside  low income children first  and get this chamber back on board with the original intention of the SCHIP program   helping children  Debate on the new SCHIP bill  H R  3963 is expected for the remainder of the week  The text of Enzis speech follows    Floor Statement of Michael B  Enzi  The State Childrens Health Insurance Program  October 31  2007 Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  or what folks on Capitol Hill are calling S CHIP   SCHIP was created by a Republican Congress in 1997 to help low income kids get health insurance  The goal of the program is to help kids that dont qualify for Medicaid  but also cant afford to get health insurance on their own  receive the care they need  This program was temporarily extended until November 16  2007  I am here today to speak about how important it is for Congress to work with the President to reauthorize this critical program in a way that gets every single low income child who needs insurance insured  Mr  President  if it werent for politics  this would have been solved last week   We have been working on this issue in the Senate for a few months now and the longer we work on it  the more political it becomes  I worry that some members in this chamber have lost sight of the goalmaking sure all the low income children in this country have health care  The press has been reporting and members of this body have claimed that all the concerns were addressed in the last version of the bill the House voted on last week  Mr  President  thats not correct  The concerns werent addressed   The so called new bill still fails to put low income children first  by gutting the Administrations requirement to enroll at least 95 percent of kids below 200 percent of poverty before expanding programs to cover higher income populations  The so called new bill still expands SCHIP to higher income families  by using income disregards clarifying certain expenses dont count toward income  When the House debated the bill last week  Representative Dingell  the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  participated in a colloquy with Representative Burgess and explained how the income disregard loophole works  What this means in plain English is that the majority party knows there is a provision in the bill that could lead to children from families earning over  100 000 going onto government health care  This is exactly what I mean when I say we have lost focus when it comes to this bill  This program is intended to help low income kidsnot kids from families earning as much as  100 000 a year  The so called new bill still allows the enrollment of adults  though the bill does transition childless adults off of SCHIP in into Medicaid  parents still receive SCHIP coverage   The so called new bill still removes 2 million individuals from private coverage and puts them on government run health care  Congress needs to ensure this program is paying for health insurance for kids that dont currently have health insurance  not switching kids from private insurance to government run health insurance  We need to help all Americans get health insurance  but there are better  more efficient ways than spoiling a good childrens plan  I have introduced a first class 10 step plan that would help us achieve the goal of comprehensive health care reform  But to get back to what is wrong with this bill  The so called new bill still expands SCHIP to illegal immigrants by weakening citizenship verification requirements  The so called new bill still is not paid for  relying on a budget trick to get around budget rules  The so called new bill still includes a tobacco tax increase  The proposed tax hike is highly regressive with much of the tax burden being shouldered by lower income taxpayers  Now I am no fan of tobacco and I have spoken on this floor many times about why I am so adamantly against tobacco usage  but using a tobacco tax to pay for childrens health insurance doesnt make sense  For one thing  to keep the program funding levels stable in the future  we would need 22 million more smokers   The so called new bill still contains district specific earmarks  Again  we know we have lost focus on childrens health insurance when the bill contains earmarks for certain districts   Clearly the so called new bill hasnt changed that much from the previous bills  We have to put low income kids first and this bill just doesnt do that   Ive co sponsored the Kids First Act  S  2152  The bill would provide federal funding for children in need and require that the money actually be spent on children from families with lower incomes  This bill is a good step in the direction of compromise and I hope the majority will see that and start working with the minority to pass something the President can sign rather than continuing to play politics   Now I would be remiss if I didnt mention what a great job my home state of Wyoming is doing in administering SCHIP  Wyoming first implemented its SCHIP program  Kid Care CHIP  in 1999  In 2003  Wyoming formed a public private partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta Dental of Wyoming to provide the health  vision  and dental benefits to nearly 6 000 kids in Wyoming  These partnerships have made Kid Care CHIP a very successful program in Wyoming  All children enrolled in the program receive a wide range of benefits including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  lab and x ray services  prescription drugs  mental health and substance abuse services  durable medical equipment  physical therapy  and dental and vision services  Families share in the cost of their childrens health care by paying co payments for a portion of the care provided  These co pays are capped at  200 a year per family   Wyoming is also engaged in an outreach campaign targeted at finding and enrolling the additional 6 000 kids that are eligible for Kid Care CHIP  but arent enrolled   I am proud of the great job Wyoming is doing implementing its program and I am happy to say that even if the program isnt reauthorized  Wyoming will have enough money to run its program because the folks there know how to budget and plan  I sure hope it doesnt come to that  I hope Congress will be able to set the politics aside and put the kids first  We have a job to dofor all the kids in the States that arent as fiscally responsible as Wyoming and will start running out of moneywe owe it to them to work across the aisle and with the President and get a bill signed into law  Mr  President  I yield the floor                                                       October 2007 News Releases           Browse by
