passes 21st century health information technology bill  heads to Senate floor Wyoming leading efforts that go hand in hand with bill  June 27  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  helped that panel pass a bill today that will encourage the adoption of cutting edge information technologies in health care   The HELP Committee approved the Wired for Health Care Quality Act  a bill that helps doctors get accurate patient information faster thus improving patient care  reducing medical errors and cutting health care costs   This bill will eliminate duplicative tests and reduce medical errors  Moving from a paper based health care system to secure electronic medical records will save lives and reduce skyrocketing health care costs  Doctors  hospitals  health care advocates  and the business community  including small business  are clamoring for Congress to take action and establish uniform health IT standards  Enzi said  Time is of the essence  if we do not act  our health care system will move forward in a highly inefficient  fragmented and disjointed way  I urge Senate Leadership to bring our consensus legislation to the floor for consideration by the full Senate as soon as possible  so that we can establish an interconnected  nationwide health technology system to improve the quality of care in this country   Enzi said the bill will lay the foundation for technology and information sharing among doctors  hospitals  and insurers to ensure that patient data  insurance and medical histories are available wherever and whenever treatment is needed  A Rand Corporation study projected a potential savings of  162 billion a year for the health care industry under the initiative    Wyoming is off to a fast start when it comes to states already looking for ways to incorporate information technology for medical record keeping  I am pleased that my bill will work hand in hand with what Wyoming is doing and provide grants to help organizations like the Wyoming Health Information Organization achieve their vision of an integrated health information network to assist rural areas  said Enzi  Enzi said the bill will provide key stands to help those who want to invest in health information technologies   Without key standards  prospective investors dont know whether they are buying a beta tape  VHS  or DVD  However  given the investment  everyone wants a DVD  We need to move forward with standards so everyone can know whether their purchases are a wise investment  Everyone can be getting the DVD quality  said Enzi    The bill is cosponsored by Enzi  Senator Ted Kennedy  D Mass   Chairman of the HELP Committee  Senator Orrin Hatch  R Utah  and Senator Hillary Clinton  D N Y   The Wired for Health Care Quality Act  Information technology is transforming all aspects of our modern society  but adoption of IT within health care has progressed slowly  IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to patients medical records can improve the quality and efficiency of care while producing significant cost savings  Despite the potential benefits of health IT  investment and adoption has been limited  particularly among smaller providers who are most affected by the financial cost of implementing a health IT system    The legislation encourages the development of interoperability standards for health IT through   Codifying the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in coordinating the policies of federal agencies regarding health IT   Establishing a publicprivate partnership known as the Partnership for Health Care Improvement to provide recommendations to the Secretary with regard to technical aspects of interoperability  standards  implementation specifications  and certification criteria for the exchange of health information  Requiring all federal IT purchases conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President  Adoption of these standards is voluntary for private entities    Establishing the American Health Information Community as a body providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding policies to promote the development of a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure  These include recommendations regarding patient privacy  information security  and appropriate uses of health information   The legislation assures strong privacy protections for electronic health information by   Requiring that the national strategy on health IT includes strong privacy protections  including methods to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed   The legislation encourages the adoption of qualified health IT to improve the quality and efficiency of care by   Providing grants for the purchase of health IT systems to providers demonstrating financial need    Providing grants to states to establish low interest loan programs to help providers acquire health IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care    Providing grants to facilitate the implementation of regional or local health information plans to improve health care quality and efficiency through the electronic exchange of health information    The legislation will help providers use IT to improve quality by      1  Providing grants to integrate qualified health IT in the clinical education of health professionals and encourage the use of decision support software to reduce medical errors   2  Requiring the Secretary to designate a single organization to develop healthcare performance measures     3  Establishing a Health Information Technology Resource Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have implemented qualified health IT                                                      June 2007 News Releases           Browse by
