condolence memorial info  Senate resolution on the life of Senator Craig Thomas  June 5  2007 The following is a transcript of the remarks U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   made on the Senate floor Tuesday morning  June 5  2007 about his friend and colleague U S  Senator Craig Thomas  R Wyo   who died Monday night   Mr  Enzi  Thank you  Madam President  When my plane touched down last night  I received an e mail that told of the fate of a great man  It was a tremendous surprise to me   I just completed a week working in Wyoming  explaining to people that Craig even timed his chemotherapy so that he did not have to miss votes and how tough and strong a man he was  Craig Thomas was a Marine at heart but he was a cowboy in his soul  He was quiet  He was focused  He was independent  He was hard working  He loved the Senate and he loved the Marines and he loved his horses  The flags have been lowered and there is a great deal of sadness in our hearts today as we mourn his loss and celebrate his life   I have had a lot of thoughts  I have not had a chance really to put them together  They come gushing back along with a lot of tears  For those of us from Wyoming  Craig Thomas was more than just our senator  He was our voice in the Senate and he was never one to back off from a fight  especially when he was battling for two things most dear   what was best for Wyoming and what was best for America  Craig had long Wyoming roots and he was very proud of them  He grew up in Cody and became friends with Al Simpson and later on  the two of them would serve together in the Senate  After he graduated from the University of Wyoming  Craig immediately began his service to the country he loved  He joined the Marine Corps  and I am convinced that that experience helped to shape his character and molded his destiny  His steely resolve and firm will took shape I think during those days that helped guide him and prepare him for the battles that would come later in his political life  When Craig s service in the Marine Corps was through  he began what was to be his life s work  which was serving the people of Wyoming to ensure their best interests were taken care of and their needs were addressed  His first efforts for Wyoming brought him to the Wyoming Farm Bureau and the Wyoming Rural Electric Association  He was proud of the service with both of these organizations that kept him actively involved in issues that meant a great deal to him and  more importantly  it kept him in touch with the people of Wyoming and their day to day problems  It also set him on the road to doing anything and everything he could to make life easier for his fellow citizens in Wyoming   I remember our days when we served together in the Wyoming State House  I had been a mayor and had municipal electric experience and he had worked for the Rural Electric Association and we worked a lot of electrical bills together at that time as Wyoming House members  We could bring both perspectives in  find the middle ground and make sure that all of the people  rural and urban    I use the term urban for Wyoming rather loosely    would be able to have low cost electricity and consistent electricity  Nobody knew energy or electricity better than Craig  That led him to running for the U S  House of Representatives  Dick Cheney was appointed Secretary of Defense and Craig ran for and won his seat  It was not an easy victory  but it showed what a fighter and a battler he was as he took on that challenge  which was common  and was in a relatively short period of time  The Wyoming Republican Party Executive Committee just has a few days to select candidates and then there is a very short time for an election for the position in the House  He used his usual toughness and went around the state  talked to everybody and won that election  Incidentally  the person that he ran against in the primary  Tom Sansonetti  became his chief of staff  which shows how people get along in Wyoming  To no one s surprise  Craig focused on the Wyoming issues when he was in the House and he was re elected  When Malcolm Wallop decided to retire  Craig was such a popular choice statewide that he did not have any opposition in the primary  He did face another battle in the general election but once again  his fighting spirit prevailed and he found a way to win  Now  interestingly enough  the person that he defeated in the general election was a very popular governor of Wyoming who was just ending his term  The governor was later appointed ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton and to Craig Thomas  credit  the hearing was scheduled for that ambassadorship before the papers ever got to Capitol Hill  Ambassador Sullivan did a fantastic job in Ireland  Craig won the Senate seat and two years later  I ran for the Senate  He is one of the few Wyoming residents who served both in the U S  House of Representatives and in the U S  Senate  It has not been a tradition in Wyoming to move from the House to the Senate  I was elected in 1996 and then got a chance to work with him again  He was a remarkable man of vision on how to make Wyoming and our country better places to live  He spent a good deal of his time traveling Wyoming  He was one of the most ardent travelers we have ever had in the Senate  going back virtually every weekend  traveling a different part of the state  talking to people and trying to get their vision for the future  One of his efforts on that was called Vision 20 20 and he challenged the people of Wyoming  he stretched the people s imagination on what our state ought to be like in the year 2020  That was in 1998  We are getting a lot closer to 2020 and I think the state is moving toward the vision that he predicted at that time  It was a goal he cherished and fought for and many of the things that he envisioned    or the people of Wyoming envisioned   have been achieved through his efforts on the Senate floor    Craig Thomas will long be remembered as one of Wyoming s toughest and fiercest advocates  Craig knew that much of our work gets done in committee and so he pursued those committees that would help him fight for Wyoming in the Senate  He served on the critical Finance Committee  He was a staunch fiscal conservative and he believed very strongly that the people in Wyoming and across the nation know better how to spend their hard earned money than the federal government does  He used his position on the committee to lighten the tax burden and to make our tax code more fair  He was the ranking member on the Indian Affairs Committee  He served as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee  where he was a tireless advocate for our park system  I think he visited most of our parks and earlier when our Republican leader was talking about horseback  it was even possible to see Craig with the park policemen on horseback taking a look at the parks of the Capitol  I would mention that usually when you saw him on horseback  you also saw his wife Susan on horseback  She was a tireless traveler and an outstanding campaigner and another person who searched for the vision    who searches for the visions of Wyoming  In parades  they always rode horses  They had special saddle blankets that helped to say who they were  as if people in Wyoming wouldn t know who they were  I would mention that she was thrown from a horse a couple of times too  Bands and horses don t always go well in hand  But as Craig always said  she was the real campaigner in the family  She actually liked it  She does a marvelous job for our state   Craig s been real active on all of the agriculture issues and international trade  particularly country of origin labeling  He supported our cattlemen with grazing rights and responsible environmental quality incentive programs for runoff issues  He worked tirelessly to get changes in the Endangered Species Act  He realized that the Act was a national program with national goals and it should not punish individuals or counties or even the states and that there ought to be responsibility at the federal level  With energy  he was the lead sponsor of our soda ash royalty relief bill  He was the lead sponsor on a recreational fee demonstration program that allowed the national parks to keep a higher percentage of the receipts that were received on public lands where they were collected  Specifically  his efforts to include section 413 of the Energy Policy Act  which authorizes federal cost share for the building of a coal gasification project above 4 000 feet  We have huge resources of coal  We ship over a third of the nation s coal  over a million tons a day  The reason we ship so much coal is because it s very low sulfur  Craig was providing a mechanism to be able to have some assurance that coal gasification of this clean coal would be included in projects that we did in the United States  It would help to prove the technology at high altitude and show the viability and make a difference for the United States in all our energy in the future  He was also instrumental in writing the electricity title of the Energy Policy Act  Recently  his efforts to get a coal to liquid section of whatever energy bill we ll soon debate  has been tireless  Although he was unsuccessful thus far  he advanced the debate to the furthest point that it s moved  In the area of transportation and aviation  during the last F A A  reauthorization  Craig was very instrumental in radar upgrades for the Jackson Airport  It was imperative for the growth of the city and the airport  especially related to tourism  I think Jackson is the only state that has    the only city in Wyoming that has long distance direct flights  Most of them come through Salt Lake or Denver or Minneapolis  but Jackson actually has flights that come from Houston and Atlanta direct  Craig also did a lot for Wyoming with two big transportation authorization bills to assure that the large land area of the low population states received a fair amount of highway funding  As I mentioned on fiscal issues  he was a staunch conservative who believed that the people knew how to spend their money better than the federal government   Now  a few months ago  Craig shared his medical situation with us  He was in for another difficult fight but he was used to them  He s been a battler all his life  He took the fierce determination that he learned as a Marine and brought it to this  His latest battle against leukemia  unfortunately  it was a battle this great fighter was not to win  Although that last battle of his life was lost  there were so many victories in his life that we will long remember  Craig died as he lived  with his spurs on  fighting for Wyoming to the very end  I m sure we all have our favorite instant replay memories of Craig and his unique style  I ve always believed that you can get a lot done if you don t care who gets the credit    that was Craig  Never one to seek the limelight or to draw attention to himself  He was the one working in committee to assure that the voice of the Wyoming people and America were heard and heard clearly  For me  I ll always remember Craig s spirit  for his spirit and life was a great illustration of the spirit of Wyoming  His life became a living portrait of the American West  He saw a world from the saddle of his horse and from under the brim of his cowboy hat  He was proud of Wyoming and Wyoming was proud to be represented by him  Craig was my senior senator  He was my confidant  a mentor  but most of all  he was a very good friend  Diana and I will always feel that    an appreciation for the fact that Craig and Susan made us a part of their family  Our prayers are with Susan and their family during these difficult times  I ll miss him but because he was such a special presence in my life and for so many others  I have a long list of instant replay memories I ll always cherish of him  The times we were out on the campaign trail  the legislation we worked on together  and more importantly  the impact that he had on my life personally  As he did with so many others   Wyoming is a different place today because of this great loss of ours  There s a great sadness in the state and also a great joy as we celebrate the life of one of our special citizens  He was with us for all too short a time but he ll never be forgotten  I received a book called Give Me Mountains for My Horses by Tom Reed  but what I always ask for is that they give us men to match our mountains and our horses  That would be Craig  I want to share just a little piece of this because I know that Craig s already riding in a far better place  It says  There s a taste of this place  this time  Nothing is behind you  Everything is ahead  But you don t really think about what s ahead  You only think of now  for this partnership you have entered into is one of the moment  of now  Now has you in a saddle on a bay horse heading up a trail of pines and spruce and mountain of supreme and meadow  Behind you connected by only your hand and the lead rope but carrying everything important to you is another bay horse  an almost identical match to the one you re riding  You call them nicknames as if they were human companion padres  drinking buddies  You cluck and coo and talk to them as if they give a damn about what you have to say  You think they do and maybe  just maybe  they do  Right now  they re stepping out  heads nodding down the trail through the stream and all you have to do is ride  That evening  as dusk brings the mosquitoes out of the willows  the same dusk that put the horse flies to bed  You choose a camp  It s a good place  save for the bugs  with room for the horses and the broad  deep green meadow and camp back against the lodge poles and your kitchen down always  So you ease off the bays back and stretch your muscles with that stiff  good  hard working feeling and you begin to unload the pack horse  talking to him  thanking him  In a while  he has on his hobbles and is out there with his buddies snorting contentedly in the tall grass and swishing a long  coal black tail at the mosquitoes  It goes like this for days  The ride  the squeak of the saddle leather  the smell of dust  the taste of it on your tongue  the smell of horse sweat and your own and the soft muzzles muzzling you off a long day  Good camp after good camp  Muscles turning hard  Eyes becoming sharp for wildlife  And riding  Always riding  One evening  a big sow grizzly and her cub cross a broad meadow far out there  A tough gal rambling  giving you and your horse a wide berth  But still the binoculars sweat in your hand and your mouth is dry  Boy  what a beautiful animal  The next morning  a moose walks the same path  You haven t seen another human in days  but there s a jet contrail reminding you that yes  this is the modern world  You ride   Craig rode the modern world  He worked hard in this body  He would have liked to have been out there in those mountains on those horses enjoying the smells and the sounds  Now he can ride  Ride on  my friend  Ride on   I yield the floor   Condolences and Memorials People wishing to send notes of condolence to the family of Sen  Craig Thomas may send them to  Mrs  Craig  Susan  Thomas  Dirksen Senate Office
