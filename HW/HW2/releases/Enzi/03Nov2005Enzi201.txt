to decrease deficit  November 3  2005 Washington  D C   The U S  Senate approved a sweeping federal savings bill today that would reduce the federal deficit by about  35 billion over five years while decreasing our countrys dependence on foreign oil  providing funding to help students displaced by Hurricane Katrina  increasing insured amounts of retirement and savings accounts and strengthening pensions for American workers  according to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   The Senate passed the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 by a vote of 52 47 Thursday night     This bill is about setting priorities in a fiscally responsible way to pay down our national debt  said Enzi  a member of the Budget Committee and Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee   There was an evaluation by the White House of the sections of the bill that I had control over and the Administration was very positive  The only adverse item they mentioned was that they thought some help should be provided for the people hurt by Hurricane Katrina  I did that today with an amendment  Its important that savings from reforms to student programs be reinvested in students  said Enzi     The deficit reduction bill is the product of the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution Congress approved in April which charged eight committees in each body of Congress to come up with recommendations of  34 7 billion in mandatory savings over five years     The Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  which Enzi chairs  was required to produce  13 65 billion in savings over 5 years in programs under HELPs jurisdiction  The HELP Committees legislative package produced  16 4 billion in savings  and the Enzi amendment reinvested approximately  2 7 billion of the extra savings in student assistance   My committee received the largest reconciliation instruction  nearly 40 percent of the overall target  said Enzi  We exceeded the committees target and achieved meaningful deficit reduction   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  The deficit reduction bill included language to help strengthen our nations energy security by helping reduce our nations reliance on foreign oil by allowing oil exploration in an isolated portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  in Alaska  Enzi believes that drilling can be done in a responsible manner with the utmost care taken to protect the environment  It is estimated that  2 4 billion over five years can be saved from bonus bids for the right to explore in the ANWR    I have carefully considered the matter  and I am confident it can be done in an environmentally sound manner  It is important to point out the same arguments made against drilling in the ANWR were used against drilling in Prudhoe Bay  I have visited Prudhoe and can assure you that the adverse consequences that were originally predicted with drilling in Prudhoe Bay never happened  said Enzi    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  The Banking Committee package of the deficit reduction bill included Enzis Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act  which would better protect the retirement funds and savings of Americans by increasing amounts covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Enzi said this is especially important for rural towns and communities whose depositors depend on their local credit union or bank to deposit their money  Enzi is a senior member of the Banking Committee  By merging the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund to create a new Deposit Insurance Fund  300 million in savings will be generated over five years   Education Aid for Katrina Victims  Enzi successfully added an amendment to the bill that would ensure that some of the additional savings generated by the HELP Committee above and beyond the reconciliation target is used to ease the transition of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina  The HELP Committee produced  2 75 billion in additional savings by cutting corporate subsidies  This amendment ensures that extra savings generated from education will be returned to education  It provides one time additional relief for students enrolled in post secondary education who take out federal student loans to pay for their education expenses  The Enzi amendment also addresses the elementary and secondary education challenges faced by the 372 000 school children displaced by hurricane Katrina  their families and the schools that opened their doors to accommodate the thousands of displaced students   Pensions  A raise in premiums businesses pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  was also included in the bill to ensure the solvency of the federal insurance agency  The PBGC secures the pension plans for many major companies and airlines in the U S    When the House passes its budget deficit reduction package it will go to a conference committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate version
