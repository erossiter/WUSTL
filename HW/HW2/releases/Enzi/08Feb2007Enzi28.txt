successful schools Helping the No Child Left Behind Act help schools February 8  2007 Washington  D C    Cheyenne schools know how to do it  Bighorn County schools know how to do it  Other schools in Wyoming know how to do it  but how do we help the schools that dont  It is being a high performing school  The question being asked  however  by U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   and others today at the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee roundtable on the renewal of the No Child Left Behind Act was  How do we make a low performing school into a high performing school  How do we duplicate the successes you have had in other schools across the country  All witness testimony can be accessed by clicking    Senator Michael B  Enzi Ranking Member Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee Roundtable  NCLB Reauthorization  Strategies that Promote School Improvement February 8  2007  Thank you Senator Kennedy for starting our review of the No Child Left Behind Act with this roundtable  It is a pleasure to be here today to learn more about school improvement strategies that have worked on the state  district and school level  There are many good things happening in our schools today  but that is not what we focus on when we talk about our schools  Just as our schools vary in size and student population  effective approaches of school improvement vary widely  What we have not done effectively is getting the word out about what we know are the most effective improvement interventions  in other words  what works  That is what this roundtable is about    School districts in Wyoming are using a variety of strategies for schools designated as in need of improvement under the Adequate Yearly Progress structure  In Cheyenne  the largest school district in Wyoming  Superintendent Dan Stephan has put in place professional learning communities that focus on three goals  first  increased achievement on math and problem solving skills  second  utilization of writing skills across the curriculum  and  third  increasing the graduation rate  Superintendent Stephan is changing the culture of the school district from one of a teaching district to a learning district and firmly believes that failure is not an option  Superintendent Kevin Mitchell  of Big Horn County School District  1  believes that an increased focus on reading instruction and effective leadership are two key indicators of increasing student academic achievement as part of school improvement  His experience has show that an effective leader who can not only pinpoint the problem  but also execute a strategy to fix the problem  is the key to school success  Both of these district leaders also said that they need help  They need to know what strategies other districts with similar characteristics are using to improve student achievement outcomes  They need technical assistance to implement school improvement plans and to analyze data to determine where interventions are most needed  Finally  they need assistance to provide training to staff on interventions that have successfully improved student achievement levels  Each of you has coped with similar needs  I am very pleased that we were able to hold this Roundtable today to learn from each of you the strategies that have been effective and the obstacles you have faced in implementing those strategies  NCLB has given us a strong framework and good data to learn where schools are faltering  The next step is to learn how we can help schools that are faltering improve and increase student academic achievement   The topic of school improvement is not a new one  In 1979  Ron Edmonds  an expert on high performing  high poverty schools identified what he called the most tangible and indispensable characteristics of effective schools  He found six key characteristics  strong administrative leadership  high expectations for all students  an orderly and quiet atmosphere  clear focus on academics  readiness to divert energy and resources to academics  and the frequent monitoring of student progress  A similar study was published in 2000 which found very similar traits  The only big addition was the use of master teachers   We know what makes a good school  What we dont know is how to make a low performing school into a high performing school  Many of you here today have done just that  The key is how do we duplicate the successes you have had in other schools across the country  The federal government  through No Child Left Behind  can assist with a number of the issues and problems each of you have encountered  First  we need to learn more about what is working  Schools are working very hard to increase the academic achievement levels of their students  and that effort needs to be recognized and successes need to be disseminated  I believe it is important that everyone  school leaders  teachers  and parents  have access to school improvement activities and interventions that have been proven to be successful in both schools and school districts  Superintendents  principals and teachers should be able to adapt these interventions to their school environment so that they work for their students  Second  I believe the Congress should support school improvement activities as they are authorized under NCLB  Schools and districts now have the data and information they need to determine where they need help  but dont often have the resources needed to implement strategies to achieve improved student performance  Finally  I believe we can work within the current NCLB structure to improve teacher training and professional development and that focuses on strategies that increase student academic achievement  Teachers are a necessary and vital factor in the school improvement process  That said  there is no silver bullet when it comes to school improvement  Every school and school district in this country is unique and has different areas in need of improvement  We must focus on strategies that couple effective interventions  such as aligning curriculum and professional development with state standards   I look forward to working with all of you as work progresses on the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind                                                       February 2007 News Releases           Browse by
