death tax  June 8  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   voted today to permanently repeal the death tax  A majority of senators voted with Enzi to continue debate on the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005 and end the tax  but 60 votes were needed to overcome a procedural hurdle put up by those who favor the death tax  The vote was 57 41  I am disappointed that some of my colleagues continue to ignore this issue  The death tax allows the federal government to write itself into the wills of many Americans who own a small business  ranch  farm or estate  This tax takes property away from children and family members of those who die  said Enzi  People pay taxes when they buy  People pay taxes when they sell  They can control both of those things  but they cant control when they are going to die  Its basically unfair to charge people a tax because they died  In February  Enzi signed a letter to Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   with 25 others senators including Senator Thomas  R Wyo   urging Leader Frist to schedule a vote on the death tax repeal   Congress  in 2001  passed a plan to phase out the death tax permanently by 2010  Democrats were later able to insert language into a 2001 tax relief bill that would make the repeal temporary and reinstate it in 2011 with an increase of 55 percent   Enzi has co sponsored several bills in the past as well as voted several times on legislation to permanently repeal the death tax   The House passed H R  8  which would permanently repeal the death tax  in April 2005 by a vote of 272 162   Enzis statement as prepared for delivery on the Senate floor follows  Mr  ENZI Mr  President  I want to take this opportunity to voice my support for H R  8  the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act  Since coming to the Senate  I have continuously supported the repeal of this burdensome and unfair tax and am also a proud cosponsor of S  420  the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act and S  988  the Jobs Protection and Estate Tax Reform Act   I believe the death tax is fundamentally unfair because it constitutes another layer of taxation After years of paying state and federal income taxes and other taxes on property while trying to grow a business  the family must pay again at the time of death This double taxation is unfair and should be eliminated  Many small  family owned businesses throughout my state of Wyoming cannot afford to pay the tax  and are forced to close their doors  In addition  many landowners are forced to sell their property in order to afford paying this unfair tax and avoid passing on the costs to the next generation  Our country should encourage growth and investment  not force people to sell their assets  Families should not have to choose between paying taxes or operating their business just because a family member passed away  In Wyoming  we work hard  in pursuit of the American Dream  to create a better life for our children and grandchildren  Yet  the death tax punishes this dream and the families who must pick up the pieces after losing a loved one  The death tax not only hurts the families who are forced to pay the tax  it also hurts our overall economy  A Heritage Foundation study reports that repeal of this tax would create 482 jobs in Wyoming alone  While this number may not seem large to my colleagues from New York and California  482 jobs would have a substantial economic impact for communities throughout my state  I believe we will see additional financial gains when businesses can continue their operations where previously they would have had to shut their doors  The death tax forces families to spend thousands of dollars on estate planning  By forcing individuals and families to use vital financial resources on estate planning  money is being taken away from the family business or the family farm  When we eliminate this tax  jobs will be saved and money will be devoted to economic growth rather than extensive estate planning costs   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H R  8 which offers relief to Americas hard working families  Eliminating the death tax will bring fairness to our tax code as well as encourage continued growth in our economy  I yield the floor                                                       June 2006 News Releases           Browse by
