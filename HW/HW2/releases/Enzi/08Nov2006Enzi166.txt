                                                                                                                                                                                      Election emphasizes need to concentrate on areas where agreement possible  November 8  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi is disappointed with how many of the elections turned out  but he has also found areas of encouragement  Here is a statement from Enzi  I congratulate Wyoming voters for going to the polls and making decisions important to their lives  I applaud the candidates  winners and losers  for their desire to serve and for putting themselves and their beliefs to the test of public scrutiny  It s these acts of service that make our country great  especially on a state and local level where the impacts are so immediate and close to home  Naturally I m disappointed in the outcome of the elections  but I m encouraged by the comments about more bipartisan efforts  That s the way I ve operated and how I ve run the HELP Committee and worked on my other committees  I established the 80 percent rule years ago realizing that everyone agrees on 80 percent of the issues and 80 percent of each issue  That s how we passed 37 bills through committee  25 bills through the Senate and 15 bills were signed by the President  That s how we were able to get 12 other bills signed into law on top of what we did with the HELP Committee  One of the concepts this election makes clear to us is that Americans do not want bickering  they want results  Unfortunately  disagreement is what people hear most because controversy gets covered  The debate on more than a dozen bills we were able to get through took less than five hours and received limited coverage  Weve actually advanced some great legislation during this Congress  much of it through the HELP  Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  Committee  We passed the biggest revision to pension laws in 30 years  strengthening the retirement of millions of Americans  We passed the first revision of mine safety laws in 28 years  That bill will save lives  Voters heard the debate about medical liability caps  but many probably dont realize that we passed a bill that allows physicians to compare and analyze medical errors without fear of being sued  This helps them avoid errors in the future and improves patient safety  The debate about stem cell research was front and center during this election  but people didn t hear much about the progress we made in this area  We passed into law the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act that establishes a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network to enable patient match  use and research   This election emphasizes my 80 percent rule  It works  Senator Kennedy  Ranking Member of the Senate HELP Committee and I as the chairman have been able to accomplish quality and a quantity of work  In fact  we are planning three hearings for next week  the topics include Indian Healthcare  food and drug safety  I worked with Hillary Clinton to pass a bill into law that protects military personnel from fraudulent sales practices  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and I worked to pass a law ensuring states remain in charge of wildlife management  not the federal government  These are examples of where we have worked together  We need to continue and increase cooperation  We respect each other even if we disagree and that s key  This election was not so much a disagreement of the American people with basic platforms of the majority  but rather that they want to see more progress  They dont want to just hear about deficits being reduced  they want to see deficits reduced  Many Democrats campaigned on this  Im going to give them plenty of chances to help me pass legislation reforming not just how much government spends  but how it spends  Weve got to change the system  treat the disease rather than just the symptoms  Candidates campaigned on cutting health care costs  Ive got a bill lined up that will allow small businesses to band together to help each other help their employees afford it  I have another bill ready to go that will help form a nationwide health information technology system to avoid duplicative tests  reduce medical errors and cut costs  If they disagree on some parts of the legislation then I hope theyll work with me to get to at least the 80 percent because 80 percent of a good bill is still a good bill  My Republican colleagues and I are going to continue to insist on private property rights protection  including gun rights  Were going to work to simplify and reduce taxes  We will continue to employ an energy strategy that moves us away from dependence on foreign countries  Border security  bio defense  anti terror measures  we all agree these are problems  Im hopeful the new members and old members in both the Senate and House will be able to make great strides toward meeting these and the other challenges we have before us                                                      November 2006 News Releases           Browse by
