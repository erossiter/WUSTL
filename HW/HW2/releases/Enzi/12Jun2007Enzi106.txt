can be implemented without Senate bill  June 12  2007 Washington  D C    Today  nine U S  Senators wrote a letter to President Bush urging him to fulfill the border security provisions listed in the Senate immigration bill whether the legislation passes or not  Each border security trigger in the bill can be implemented under current law without any need for new legislation from Congress  The text of the letter is below   Dear Mr  President     We respectfully ask that your Administration enforce the border security laws that have already been authorized by Congress regardless of whether the Senate passes the immigration reform bill  The bill assumes that several critical border security benchmarks can be achieved within 18 months  These security triggers are already authorized under current law and can be completed without the immigration bill  We believe these enforcement measures are vital and should not wait until Congress passes additional immigration reforms     Securing the border is the best way to restore trust with the American people and facilitate future improvements of our immigration policy     Sincerely     U S  Senators Jim DeMint  R  South Carolina   Tom Coburn  R  Oklahoma   Mike Enzi  R  Wyoming   David Vitter  R  Louisiana   Jim Inhofe  R  Oklahoma   Jim Bunning  R  Kentucky   Charles Grassley  R  Iowa   John Ensign  R  Nevada  and Jeff Sessions  R  Alabama           The Senate immigration bill calls for the following security benchmarks to be completed as a trigger before other parts of the bill go into effect  Bill proponents claim these provisions can be implemented within 18 months  All of them can be implemented under current law    Bill Trigger  1  18 000 agents border patrol agents        This is already scheduled under current law    In May  President Bush announced his commitment to hire an additional 6 000 agents by the end of 2008  bringing the Border Patrols total strength to 18 000 agents     Bill Trigger  2  200 miles of vehicle barriers  370 miles of fencing  and 70 ground based radar and camera towers  and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles        This requires less than is already required under current law  The Secure

control over entire border through virtual fence that deploys cameras  ground sensors  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  and integrated surveillance technology     Bill Trigger  3  End catch and release and provide ICE 27 500 beds for immigration detainees        According to DHS  both of these triggers have already been accomplished    Ended Catch and Release Along the Borders  In 2006  the Department of Homeland Security and ICE re engineered the detention and removal process to end this practice along the border ICE also increased its detention bed space by 6 300 during the fiscal year 2006  bringing the current number of funded beds to 27 500 immigration detainees     Bill Trigger  4  Secure identification documents with photo and biometric information and operational employment verification system to determine work eligibility       The REAL ID Act  passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2005  already requires secure identification documents with photo

expand the Basic Pilot   Employment Eligibility Verification  EEV  system to be a national employment database    Other Border Security Provisions of Current Law   Achieve and maintain operational
