pledged to lead the HELP Committee in an aggressive legislative agenda          to support and complement the Presidents agenda  Enzi also offered          a Wyoming solution to our nations dependence on foreign oil    I spoke in person with the President last week  What he told me          on health  education and competitiveness came through loud and clear in          his speech  The President sounded the call for action on many of the same          goals weve set for our work this year on the HELP Committee           Enzi said  following tonights address  I applaud his vision          to move forward on two of the most difficult challenges facing the nation           health care and education  Families are looking to us to provide real          relief and sensible solutions to rising health care costs and strong growth          in top paying jobs  and we plan to deliver    Energy   Enzi said the Presidents statement that America            is addicted to oil that often is imported from unstable parts of the            world is an opportunity for Wyoming    I advocate more coal research  Coal is our most plentiful energy            source  Innovation can turn that into a 500 year supply of clean energy             Enzi said     Making Healthcare Affordable  Protecting              the Uninsured  Reducing Errors  Improving Care   We have to confront the rising cost of care  Enzi                said  We can do this by strengthening the doctor patient                relationship and implementing small business and individual solutions                that will help people afford the insurance coverage they need    Enzi is working to bring to the Senate floor the Health Insurance                Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act  S 1955                 a bill that will increase the ability of small and low wage businesses                to offer health insurance for their employees while promoting market                reforms that also will benefit all Americans unable to obtain group                health insurance    We are nearing almost six years of double digit growth in                health insurance premiums  Enzi said  This inflationary                spiral is lowering the quality of life for countless families and                hurting our economy  Never before has there been a more urgent need                to pass sensible health insurance legislation     In addition  Enzi is a key advocate of legislation supporting Bushs                commitment to bring revolutionary information technology to health                care as provided for in the Wired for Health Care Quality                Act   S 1418   which the Senate passed last year     This bill will help save lives  time and money with better                communications and give people access and control over their own                medical records  This legislation will bring healthcare into the                information age by laying the foundation for technology and information                sharing among doctors  hospitals  and insurers  Enzi said                 This revolutionary technology would improve patient care                by reducing medical errors and allowing for more efficient record                keeping to help save lives     Enzi is working with leaders in the House of Representatives to                push for passage of the bill through the House     Education  Key to a Competitive Workforce     Echoing the Presidents agenda for providing Americans            with the educational tools they need to remain competitive on the world            stage and find good jobs  Enzi said  Our mission is to secure            a lifetime of opportunity at school  at work and at home   and that            begins with providing an educational system that will support lifelong            learning  training  and retraining for Americans     Under Enzis leadership  the HELP Committee laid a foundation            to boost the competitiveness of American workers during the first session            with passage of The Higher Education Amendments Act of 2005             HEA  as well as the Workforce Investment Act  WIA  S 1021             Those important bills will help retain Americas competitive edge            in the global economy by ensuring that higher education prepares todays            students for the demands of tomorrows workplace     President Bush clearly understands this challenge and is committed            to working with Congress to better prepare our workforce to lead the            world in human talent and creativity  Enzi said  Our greatest            advantage is our educated  hard working and ambitious people  We have            legislation ready to be put in place that will train three times as            many people a year for higher skills jobs  The Presidents emphasis            on math and science skills is a way for us to lead    Working in conjunction with HEA and WIA  the Perkins Act  S  250  will            increase higher education opportunities and require state agencies to            work together on identifying the needs of the workforce and in designing            job and skills training programs to match those needs  Reauthorizing            the Perkins Act will help strengthen our workforce and enable America            to compete and succeed in the global economy  Enzi said  The            Perkins Act is a critical piece of a comprehensive effort to train American            workers to fill the good jobs being created    Enzi was also pleased the President emphasized character and compassion            in his speech    We must always strive to be a compassionate  decent  hopeful            society  How we treat one another is a measure of that goal             Enzi said                                                        January 2006 News Releases           Browse by
