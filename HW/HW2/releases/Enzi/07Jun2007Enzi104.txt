maelstrom continues in Senate Enzi rejects amnesty  seeks stronger borders  supports English language June 7  2007  Washington  D C   The Senate Thursday rejected attempts to end debate and finalize an immigration hodgepodge bill that U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said is woefully inadequate because it puts the needs of illegal immigrants before the needs of U S  citizens  This bill  which is hundreds and hundreds of pages  would do more harm than good  We need to put in place the border security measures weve already approved  We need to show weve shut the border  Right now we dont even have computer systems set up to share information about illegal immigrants  We dont know who comes in or who goes out  Thats basic security we are lacking and now proponents of this bill want to give people who are here illegally incentives to stay and put them at an advantage over people who have followed the rules  Enzi said  Enzi also said the bill is a product of bad deal making  In Wyoming we bring up one bill on one issue  The coalition that put together this bill did it by trading votes  Thats not the way to build coalitions  The people who favor this bill only favor their part  I legislate using the 80 20 rule  I work with people and we throw out the 20 percent we disagree on and leave in the 80 percent on which we agree  Amnesty would not be part of this bill if the select coalition had worked this way  Enzis main concern with the bill is that it grants amnesty to those who are here illegally  Ive rejected amnesty in every form  Enzi said  Those who favor this bill say it does not contain amnesty  but if it looks like a duck  walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then in this case  its amnesty  Enzi does favor improving the current guest worker programs  If this bill had been put together without trading votes we could have solved the temporary worker problem for the agriculture and tourism sectors of our economy  We could work on fixing the temporary worker programs by streamlining them and increasing the caps  That way people can work here legally  but will not have amnesty  The people coming in will have been hired from the job pool in that country  not from the illegal pool here  Enzi said   The Senate has taken 31 votes so far on amendments and procedures related to the immigration bill since May 21  Here are some highlights from recent votes    Enzi Votes Against Amnesty  Enzi co sponsored an amendment to the immigration bill that would completely strike the amnesty provisions from the measure  The Senate voted against the Vitter amendment  1157 by a vote of 29 66  ultimately leaving amnesty provisions in the bill    Enzi Supports English as Official Language  Enzi co sponsored the Inhofe amendment  1151 that passed the Senate 64 33 that declares English to be the national language of the United States  Enzi has been an outspoken proponent on declaring one official language for the country  He has also co sponsored a similar stand alone bill in this and past Congresses   Criminals Should Not Be Granted Citizenship  Enzi supported an amendment to the immigration bill that would permanently bar the legalization or citizenship for gang members and terrorists and prohibit those convicted of serious domestic violence crimes and drunk driving from becoming citizens  Enzi was disappointed the Senate rejected the Cornyn amendment  1184 by a vote of 46 51   Enzi Backs Minimum Health Care Coverage Requirement Enzi supported an amendment that would require illegal immigrants who would be granted Z visas under the bill  to have minimum health care coverage  Enzi said the amendment would lessen the problem of non citizens straining the health care system without contributing their fair share  A majority of the senators voted against the DeMint  1197 amendment  It failed by a vote of 43 55  Enzi Backs Entry and Exit Tracking  Systems Operability In the event that the bill ultimately becomes law  Enzi co sponsored an amendment that would not allow it to take effect until certain parameters are met  The amendment would require full implementation of the Secure Border Fence Act  assurance that all computer databases involving aliens be integrated  and that the U S  VISIT program  designed to track the entry and exit of aliens  be fully implemented  The Coburn amendment  1311 failed by a vote of 42 54
