                                                                                                                                                                                        The world was watching that speech   Enzi comments on President  s State of the Union address  January 23  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  tonight praised President Bush for his commitment to reduce health care costs through tax relief  increase the supply of renewable and alternative fuels and step up domestic oil production   Enzi pledged to work as the HELP Committees ranking member to work on and complement the Presidents agenda so that real solutions can be found for problems that up to now have only been greeted with partisan intentions   Energy  Enzi said Wyoming is in a great position to help the country out of its growing energy fix  I favor incentives over mandates and I advocate more coal research  Coal is our most plentiful energy source and the most abundant and clean burning in the world  Innovation can turn that into a 500 year supply of clean energy  Enzi said  If we are serious about finding alternatives to foreign energy sources  coal to liquids projects should be front and center in our efforts  Wyoming is taking a lead  Developers are moving forward with and planning a coal to liquids facility in the Medicine Bow Hanna area  President Bush touched on the importance of producing energy on our own soil and weaning this country from foreign sources of oil  Enzi said Wyoming can be at the forefront of this effort as well as the renewable energy front and he will continue working with and talking to the President about Wyomings abundance of natural resources and the desire to help our country sustain its energy production    Making Healthcare Affordable  Improving Care   Enzi hailed the Presidents announcement to make basic  private health insurance available for more Americans by utilizing the tax code to provide a standard deduction for health insurance  similar to the deduction for dependents  The President also proposed an initiative to direct federal funding to states without creating a new federal entitlement or new federal spending  The money would be used by the states to help citizens afford private insurance   I have long supported plans that use market forces to keep down health care costs and in the hands of consumers  The Presidents plan is a serious proposal that merits serious review  said Enzi  Enzi is working across party lines to reintroduce and pass small business health plans that will increase the ability of small and low wage businesses to offer health insurance for their employees while promoting market reforms that also will benefit all Americans unable to obtain group health insurance  In addition  Enzi is a key advocate of legislation supporting Bushs commitment to bring revolutionary information technology to health care as provided for in a bill the Senate passed last year    Education  Key to a Competitive Workforce   Echoing the Presidents agenda for providing Americans with the educational tools they need to remain competitive on the world stage and find good jobs  Enzi said  Our mission is to secure a lifetime of opportunity at school  at work and at home   and that begins with providing an educational system that will support lifelong learning  training  and retraining for Americans  Under Enzis leadership  the HELP Committee laid a foundation to boost the competitiveness of American workers during the first session with the renewal of The Higher Education Act to make education more affordable as well as passage of the Workforce Investment Act  a workforce job training bill  Those important bills will help retain Americas competitive edge in the global economy by ensuring that higher education prepares todays students for the demands of tomorrows workplace   President Bush clearly understands this challenge and is committed to working with Congress to better prepare our workforce to lead the world in human talent and creativity  Enzi said  Our greatest advantage is our educated  hard working and ambitious people  We have legislation ready to be put in place that will train three times as many people a year for higher skills jobs  The Presidents emphasis on math and science skills is a way for us to lead  Immigration Enzi believes in secure borders and temporary worker programs that are really temporary  In the 109th Congress  I followed a number of principles and I will continue to use these principles when we debate immigration reform in the 110th Congress  America must control its borders  new immigration laws should serve the economic needs of our country  we should not disadvantage those who are trying to come here legally by rewarding illegal immigrants with amnesty  and  all new laws must be realistically enforceable  said Enzi   Global War on Terrorism The world was watching that speech  Friends and enemies are scrutinizing whether we are winning or they are winning  Enzi said  President Bush announced a proposal to form a special advisory council on the War on Terror consisting of congressional leaders from both Republican and Democrat ranks  The President showed a willingness to seek input from members of Congress  Congress job  including those from the other party  is to give him real ideas of practical value  If we do create such a council  its seats should be occupied by the cooler heads from among us rather than those who pander to those who call for the Presidents head  Enzi said  I will be evaluating closely the progress we are making on the goals set forth in the Presidents previous address to the nation as well as the benchmarks set forth tonight  This campaign must provide security for the people of Iraq  If the people do not feel secure with U S  and Iraqi forces  they will turn towards terrorist organizations that prey on their fears and provide a false sense of security   Enzi said he doesnt want the war in Iraq to turn into a scenario similar to Kosovo where we had to quell ugly violence stemming from religious wars                                                        January 2007 News Releases           Browse by
