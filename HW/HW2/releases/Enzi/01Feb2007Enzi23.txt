final passage of minimum wage  small business relief passage a victory for the middle class  February 1  2007 U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today commended the Senate for overwhelmingly approving a fair and balanced minimum wage increase that supports working families and small businesses  declaring final passage of the package a clear victory for the middle class  He urged the House of Representatives to follow the Senates lead  The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 94 3   Who is more middle class than Americas small businessmen and women  Enzi said  Passing the Senates bipartisan minimum wage and small business relief is good for low skilled workers and it is good for the middle class working families of America  Some have made reference to the so called war on the middle class  Lets get our facts straight  Mandating the minimum wage increase without proper relief to the working families who employ many of Americas workers would have been an assault on the middle class  Others like to talk about two Americas  Our action today recognizes that there is one America  We are all in this together and we need not do great injury to one group of Americans just to aid another  The Senate has taken strong action on behalf of minimum wage earners and middle class small business owners  Enzi said  I want to reiterate my hope that our colleagues in the House will not derail this bipartisan approach to offering real support and relief to the middle class  The minimum wage increase is in their hands   Enzi thanked his colleagues in the Senate for rejecting a partisan  overly simplified approach to the minimum wage bill  and instead accepting a bipartisan approach that will help relieve the burden that federal regulation  taxation  and mandates place on small businesses   A Small Business Administration study issued in September estimated that small firms  those with 20 or fewer employees  face an annual regulatory compliance cost 45 percent higher than large firms  Enzi said  The average annual regulatory compliance cost for small firms was  7 647  which happens to be roughly equivalent to the cost of employing a part time minimum wage worker at the higher rate we are passing today  By including targeted tax and regulatory relief  we have ensured that small businesses  the lifeblood of the American economy  can continue to create new jobs and drive economic growth  STATEMENT OF SENATOR MICHAEL B  ENZI REGARDING H R 2   THE MINIMUM WAGE HIKE AND SMALL BUSINESS TAX INCENTIVE PACKAGE  2 1 07 Mr  President  I rise today to speak in support of final passage of HR 2 as amended  I appreciate the wise direction that this body has decided upon with regard to the minimum wage  Yesterday  eighty  eight members of the Senate correctly concluded that raising the minimum wage without providing relief for the small businesses that must pay for that increase is simply not an option  I want to reiterate my hope that our colleagues in the House will not derail this bipartisan approach to offering real support and relief to the middle class  The minimum wage increase is in their hands   The Senates reasonable approach recognizes that small businesses have been the steady engine of our growing economy  and that they have been the source of new job creation  It also recognizes that small businesses are middle class families  too  I am proud that this body has chosen a path which attempts to preserve this segment of the economy which employs so many working men and women  The Senate has recognized the simple fact that a raise in the minimum wage is of no benefit to a worker without a job  or a job seeker without a prospect   As this Congress moves forward we will need to confront a range of issues facing working families  the rising cost of health insurance and the availability of such insurance  the necessity and costs of education and job training  and the desire to achieve an appropriate balance between work and family life  The lessons we have learned in this debate should not be forgotten as we approach new and equally complex issues   In addressing minimum wage we have rejected the notion that it be a clean bill  Ultimately we did so because it is not a clean issue  Around here  clean more often than not  simply means do it my way and does not respect the democratic process of the Senate and allowing the Senate to work its will  There were claims that no Democrats offered amendments to the bill  That is false  The Chairman of the Committee on Small Business  Senator John Kerry offered two amendments and the Senator from Wisconsin  Senator Feingold offered an amendment on Buy America standards  As you can see  members on both sides were not aiming to delay  but they were offering amendments to better the bill   I am pleased that we proved to the American people that we indeed can work together and provide solutions to complex and difficult problems  The Senate chose the right course of coupling an increased wage with provisions that will assist those small business employers that will face the greatest difficulties in paying such increased costs  I hope we do not forget the wisdom of this approach as we address other workplace  economic and social issues I am also heartened that in the course of this debate this body has begun to recognize what I know from my own life to be true   working families are not only those that are employed by businesses  they are also those who own the businesses  I know from personal experience that all small business owners have two families  their own  and the family of those that work for them  I also know that business owners feel the pressure of rising costs  the dilemma of difficult options  and the uncomfortable squeeze of modern life in both of their families  as much as many workers do in their own   America has heard a lot of partisan rhetoric during the course of this debate  talk of a so called war on the middle class and of leaving people out  Id like to note for the record that such rhetoric got us nowhere  We are ending consideration of this issue basically where we began and where many of us were the last few years  with a majority of the Senate supporting a minimum wage increase as long as we can soften the impact of that increase on the small businesses which create minimum wage jobs  A higher wage is of no use when the job itself is gone  The Senate chose to look at the whole picture this time around  The minimum wage could have been raised years ago had some on the other side been willing to accept the important role working families and small businesses play in providing employment in this country   Some people like to talk about two Americas  What the Senate is preparing to do today recognizes that there is one America  We are all in this together and we need not do great injury to one group of Americans just to aid another  That kind of partisan rhetoric isnt accurate and is aimed at spreading a very skewed view of America  It is aimed to divide  rather than unite Americans around a simple solution   Mandating the wage increase without proper relief to the working families who employ many of Americas low skilled workers is an assault on the middle class  Lets get our facts straight  Passing the Senates bipartisan minimum wage and small business relief package is good for low skilled workers and it is good for the middle class working families of America
