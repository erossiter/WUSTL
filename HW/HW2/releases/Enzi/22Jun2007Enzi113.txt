                                                                                                                                                                                      Democrat energy package will fatigue country Enzi successful with Thomas amendment  but votes against final bill June 22  2007  Washington  D C   The U S  Senate passed an energy bill last night  but U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said the measure will mean higher prices at the pump for motorists and higher food prices at the grocery store for consumers   Enzi was one of the senators who voted against the bill  which the Senate passed on a vote of 65 27   This bill relies too much on regulation and non existent infrastructure to ease our energy woes  Enzi said  One of the most glaring omissions in this bill was the absence of a coal to liquids provision  If we are ever going to kick our addiction to foreign oil weve got to increase fuel production here at home and coal to liquids technology is a big part of the answer   Unlike ethanol  which cant be transported in existing pipelines  liquid fuel derived from coal works with our existing transportation and delivery infrastructure  Demand for corn to produce the mandated quantity of ethanol also drives up the price for cattle feed and other products made with corn  Enzi said   The bill mandates that the U S  use 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022  Acknowledging that the mandate could cause economic hardship to some states or regions  the legislation would allow these areas to petition the President for a waiver from some of the requirements  The President would have 90 days to respond to the waiver request  Enzi said that was too long  He sponsored an amendment the late Senator Craig Thomas  R Wyo   had authored that would give the President 30 days to respond  The Senate included this provision in the final package   When an area of the country is really hurting economically it doesnt have time to wait three months for bureaucrats in Washington to decide what to do  Enzi said   Senators will now try to reconcile their version of the energy bill with a version passed earlier by the House  Enzi said the House version also contains strict mandates  increased taxes and more regulation   Enzi spoke on the Senate floor several times during the energy debate and sponsored amendments  He also submitted information for the Senate record   Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi On the Baucus Amendment  1704 June 21  2007  Mr  President  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss my opposition to a few of the provisions in the Finance Committee passed energy tax package  Before I begin  I would like to take a moment to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for their work on this amendment  I know they have exerted an incredible amount of energy to get this legislation to the floor so that we can debate it as part of this energy bill    The package that we are debating includes a number of important provisions  It includes additional funding for clean renewable energy bonds  which are important to rural electric cooperatives who seek to build clean generation  It includes accelerated depreciation for carbon dioxide pipelines  which will encourage more carbon sequestration  It also includes a carbon capture credit that will make it more economical for some carbon dioxide to be used in enhanced oil recovery and for some carbon dioxide to be sequestered  These are important provisions  and I am pleased to see them included in this package    Although that is the case  I have grave concerns about the impact of this tax package  I am specifically concerned about its impact on consumers  When taken as a whole  I believe that the package will lead to increased gas prices and will have a detrimental impact on our countrys quest to become energy independent by discouraging domestic energy production   The amendment contains approximately  28 6 billion in revenue raisers over the next ten years  The phrase revenue raisers is Washington speak for tax increases  and I find it hard to believe that we can increase taxes by  28 6 billion and have no impact on the price of gasoline at the pump for the average American  Businesses are in business to make money  and when we increase their taxes  they pass that increase along to the consumer    It is not Exxon Mobile or Shell or BP who will pay for these tax increases  It is the senior citizen on a fixed income who fills up her station wagon  It is the soccer mom who drives her children to school  This tax title is not punishing the companies  It is punishing the American people who rely on energy to fuel their daily lives   Specifically  I am concerned that three provisions of this bill will increase gas prices and will discourage energy production at a time when our nations supply does not meet our nations demand  Last week  I joined a number of my colleagues in a letter to the Senate Finance Committee that urged the Committee not to repeal the Section 199 manufacturing deduction  and I am disappointed to note that this was included  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the repeal of the Section 199 deduction will raise  9 43 billion over a ten year period  That is  9 43 billion that will be passed along to the American people   I am also disappointed that the legislation includes a new 13 percent severance tax for oil produced in the outer continental shelf  OCS   The OCS represents one of Americas greatest energy sources and raising taxes on those who hope to produce in the OCS will most certainly not encourage the domestic energy production that we all believe is so important    Finally  I am concerned that this legislation changes what is known as the foreign tax credit  This change  which amounts to double taxation  will increase taxes by  3 2 billion over the next 10 years  Someone has to pay for that tax increase  and I am concerned that it will be the American people   While I appreciate the work of my colleagues  at the end of the day  I am extremely concerned that this legislation will slow domestic energy production and increase the prices paid by consumers  There are a number of good provisions in this bill that I do support  However  at the end of the day  raising taxes is not the way to increase energy production and decrease energy prices  I would urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this amendment  I yield the floor                                                           June 2007 News Releases           Browse by
