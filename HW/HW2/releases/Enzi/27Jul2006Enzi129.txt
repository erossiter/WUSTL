                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi supports continuation of small business assistance   Authors Native American provisions  July 27  2006 Washington  D C   The Senate Small Business Committee ushered through legislation today that would fine tune programs offered by the Small Business Administration  SBA  to help more people  provide more support to small businesses  and help increase tribal economic development  according to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo  The Small Business Committee passed the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006 by a vote of 16 0  The legislation would reauthorize the SBA as well as the Small Business Innovation and Research  SBIR  program   The SBA provides support to our small businesses in the form of advice  loan programs  and financing assistance needed to open a business doors  said Enzi  a member of the Small Business Committee  Reauthorizing the legislation will help teach another generation how to operate in the real world and compete with the rest of the business world  The bill also included an amendment that would allow companies that are majority owned by venture capital companies to participate in SBIR programs  but it would limit the participation in order for rural small businesses to still compete in the programs    Native American provisions  Enzi was particularly pleased with the successful inclusion of an amendment he sponsored with Senator John Thune  R S D  Enzi said the provision would have a positive impact on Wyoming  The amendment authorizes a two year pilot project in the Office of Native American Affairs of the SBA to develop and publish a self assessment tool for evaluation and implementation of best practices for economic development for Indian tribes  Native American entrepreneurial development poses unique challenges  said Enzi  a former small business owner  This amendment recognizes that it takes more than federal money to solve these problems  Each tribe needs to be locally vested in a solution for it to work  This self assessment tool would allow tribes to evaluate their own resources  needs and community objectives in order to reach their own solutions  Opening Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi July 27  2006 Markup the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006 Madame Chair  thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the reauthorization bill before us today  As you know  the Small Business Committee is a personal favorite of mine  My service on the Committee allows me to use my small business experience as we work together on policy issues that will make a real difference in the lives of many people in Wyoming and throughout the country  Your legislation includes many new and important provisions that will assist small businesses in the coming years  Thank you for including the Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of 2005 in the bill we are considering today  One of the reasons I came to Washington was to reduce federal red tape for small businesses  This provision would require an agency to prepare a compliance guide to assist small businesses in complying with a Federal rule whenever an agency determines that a Federal rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses   I also appreciate the work that you and your staff did to help Senator Thune and I include our amendment in your bill that would authorize the Office of Native American Affairs to develop and publish a self assessment tool for evaluation and implementation of best practices for economic development for Indian tribes  Native American entrepreneurial development poses unique challenges  Poverty and unemployment are rampant on Native American reservations in my state and across the United States  This amendment recognizes that it takes more than federal money to solve these problems  Each Indian tribe needs to be locally vested in a solution for it to work  This self assessment tool would allow tribes to evaluate their own resources  needs and community objectives in order to reach their own solutions   As each Indian tribe takes these steps  the programs in the Native American Small Business Development Program  which has also been included in this reauthorization  will be even more useful  They will offer opportunities to tribal governments and colleges to create their own Native American business centers to address business opportunities that these tribes have identified   The program also recognizes current small business outreach to the tribes  For example  Wyomings Small Business Development Center employs an individual that is based on the reservation  Within the bill  a pilot program authorizes grants to provide business development training and other services to Native American owned small businesses through Small Business Development Centers and Native American private  non profit organizations  allowing them to build on previous successes   Finally  I would like to mention the issue of allowing companies that are majority owned by venture capital companies to participate in the SBIR program  I believe that Senator Bond will be introducing an amendment on this issue  The compromise that he will be offering is one that no one really likes and for that reason I believe it is a true compromise  It will allow these majority backed company to participate in the SBIR program  but it will limit their participation so that rural small businesses  such as those in Wyoming will still be able to compete in a small business program   The bill before us also includes the reauthorization of the entire SBIR program and it makes some very important and needed changes  such as increasing the percentage of the SBIR set aside  However  I want to move forward with the markup  Madame Chair  I look forward to working through this bill here with you today and on to the Senate floor                                                         July 2006 News
