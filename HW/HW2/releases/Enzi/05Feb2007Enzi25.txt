planning  priorities  process and politics  February 5  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said many of his education and health priorities he has in the 110th Congress were outlined in the Presidents  2 9 trillion Fiscal Year 2008 budget request released today  Enzi pointed out that the Presidents budget request is only the first step in a long process that ends with House and Senate lawmakers setting a budget which serves as a blueprint for broad categories of spending   As important as this budget is in outlining the Presidents priorities  at the end of the day the House and Senate control the purse strings  said Enzi  a senior member of the Budget Committee    The Budget Committees in the Senate and the House will take into account the Presidents ideas  but Congress ultimately establishes limits on total spending  Decisions on specific discretionary spending programs will be made by those committees   The Presidents budget request is an indication of his priorities and is a useful starting point for lawmakers  Congress will take into account the Presidents priorities  but the final document may look very different from the Presidents proposal  said Enzi    Congress typically approves the final budget by April   Enzi was pleased to see that the President has signaled his support for an increase in funding for education programs  Enzi  Ranking Member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee said he will do his best to work with the other members of the HELP Committee to weigh all options with an eye toward the goal of making college more affordable and accessible for everyone with college aspirations  The budget proposal would increase the maximum Pell grant award to  4 600 in 2008 and to  5 400 by 2012   I support the Presidents budget request that provides an increase in Pell grant funding to help make college more accessible and affordable for low and middle income students  I also support the Presidents request for a meaningful increase for No Child Left Behind funding  a  1 2 billion boost  This shows a commitment to renewing the law  which is scheduled to take place later this year  said Enzi  While I support these proposed increases in student aid  I will continue studying the budget request and evaluating how the Administration proposes to pay for the new spending  While funding is important  it is not the panacea for all of the education woes in this country  The funding must be backed by sound policy  Schools and colleges must also play a part in accountability and in bringing down the cost of education     This year the HELP Committee will be renewing the Higher Education Act as well as the No Child Left Behind Act   The budget process is a good opportunity to review and streamline the laws to make sure programs are operating efficiently and that limited federal dollars are stretched the farthest  Evaluating the overall cost of a college education will be one of my focal points during the renewal process for these bills  said Enzi  who helped author the No Child Left Behind Act    Also on the HELP Committees agenda this year is the renewal of many laws relating to funding of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Enzi was pleased to see the Presidents proposal included a  151 million increase for the agency over the next year    The FDA regulates  1 trillion worth of products each year  representing 25 cents out of every consumer dollar  said Enzi  An increase in funds for this critical agency can ensure that the products Americans use every day are safe and effective   The Presidents budget also proposes a  57 million increase in health information technology funding    Moving from a paper based health care system to secure electronic medical records will reduce mistakes  save lives  save time and in the long run save money  said Enzi  Last year the HELP Committee  under Enzis leadership  passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act  and the Senate passed it unanimously  The proposal helps rural areas adopt cutting edge information technologies in electronic health records to improve patient care and bring cost savings for health care providers  Enzi is hopeful that the Presidents support of portable  electronic health records will help lawmakers pass the legislation into law this year   Enzi applauded the Presidents request to balance the budget and is working with colleagues on new legislation designed to change the entire federal spending system so that emergency spending will be anticipated  spending deadlines will be met and there will be more time for oversight of how the money is being used    Any sound budget should have a plan to decrease the national deficit  I applaud the Presidents request to balance the budget by 2012 and help stabilize spending  Enzi said                                                        February 2007 News Releases           Browse by
