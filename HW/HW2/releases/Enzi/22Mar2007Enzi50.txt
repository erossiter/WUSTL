protection for small businesses  resists tax increase  March 22  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   introduced an amendment today to make it harder for the federal government to impose mandates on the private sector unless there are funds provided to pay the costs associated with those laws   Every time Washington pushes an unfunded mandate onto the backs of small businesses  operating costs increase and hinder the economys ability to grow  create jobs and compete in the global economy  My bill would stop this burden on the private sector  said Enzi  member of the Budget Committee  Small Business Committee and the Senates only accountant  Enzi offered his amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution  S  Con  Res  21  Enzis measure would protect small businesses and the private sector by establishing a 60 vote Senate threshold to pass legislation that imposes burdensome  unfunded federal mandates  Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  legislation imposing unfunded mandates above  66 million on state and local governments requires 60 votes to pass  The Enzi amendment would establish that same threshold for mandates on the private sector  Unfunded mandates are laws imposed on organizations that are not accompanied by appropriate funds to execute the laws   Enzi was disappointed by the close 47 49 vote that kept his amendment from inclusion in the final bill  Budget Consequences for Wyoming  Wyoming residents filed 245 733 individual tax returns in fiscal year 2006  Wyoming taxpayers will see their taxes go up if the  2 8 trillion budget being debated on the Senate floor is passed into law  according Enzi   The authors of this resolution see higher taxes as a way to solve our nations financial problems  but increasing taxes is not the way to balance a budget  said Enzi  Much of the federal tax relief Wyoming tax payers have grown to rely on to pay their bills goes by the wayside in this budget   Avote on S  Con  Res  21 is expected later this week   Statement of Michael B  Enzi  FY2008 Budget ResolutionAmendment to Create a Point of Order for Imposing Mandates on the Private Sector  March 22  2007 Mr  President  I call up Senate Amendment   497  My amendment is very simple  it establishes a 60 vote threshold for legislation that imposes unfunded mandates on small businesses  as determined by the Small Business Administration  in excess of the  131 million threshold for FY2007 established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  UMRA    As my colleagues may know  small businesses make up 99 7  of all US employers  and employ 50  on the Nations non farm private sector workersaccording to the Small Business Administration  Congress has an obligation to make sure laws written in Washington dont unfairly burden Main Street  The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act already requires CBO to estimate the cost of mandates that Congress imposes on the private sector  Right now there is currently a 60 vote point of order against legislation if the CBO federal mandates estimate has not been printed in the committee report or Congressional Record   The FY2006 Budget Resolution Conference Agreement included a 60 vote point of order for imposing unfunded mandates on State and local governments  And if this FY2008 Budget Resolution is adopted  in order to spend federal money  there will be four different 60 vote Budget Act points of order  over 19 different time periods  that must be adhered to in order to spend federal money  I think the Senate should have a new 60 vote point of order that applies to legislation that creates unfunded private sector mandates  It is time for Congress to remember that our actions here in Washington have very real monetary consequences on the small business owner in Buffalo  Wyoming  or Conway  New Hampshire   I came to Washington from Wyoming as a firm believer in the 80 20 rule  We can reach agreement on 80  of the issues  and were probably never going to reach agreement on the other 20   Any unfunded mandates that the Congress imposes on the private sector should fall in the 80  category  and receive strong support on both sides of the aisle  This 80 20 rule was a guiding principle of my chairmanship at the HELP Committee during the 109th Congress  And for what was supposed to be a partisan Committee  we accomplished a tremendous amount of work  In fact  President Bush signed 27 Committee bills into law  We here in Washington must stop thinking that we have a monopoly on good ideas  And to that end  the Senate needs a procedural tool to remind ourselves that the policies we pass in Washington often translate to direct cost increases for businesses on Main Street  This is a common sense proposal  and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment  I yield the floor                                                         March 2007 News Releases           Browse by
