program needs to be remodeled  updated Makes changes to major homelessness bill with rural focus September 19  2007 Washington  D C    While many people in Wyoming are trying to find an affordable 3 bedroom 2 bath house with a backyard and garage  many people are also trying to find a car or even a campground to call home   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   called attention to the plight of the homeless in rural America and highlighted changes to a major homelessness funding bill that would alleviate some of the struggles rural areas face  Enzi made his comments during a Banking Committee executive session this morning on Capitol Hill before the bill was passed unanimously   Owning a home is the American dream but for many Americans finding a roof over their heads for one night is hard enough  said Enzi  senior member of the Senate Banking Committee  When a person is homeless in a rural area the difficulty finding housing is even more intense with greater distance between towns  fewer resources  and in Wyoming  much harsher weather than most areas of the country  Enzi was successful in including provisions in the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2007  CPEHA  that passed the Banking Committee  which would help Wyoming  One provision Enzi sponsored would allow rural states to apply for funds through a new Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program  geared specifically for rural areas  By acknowledging the difference between homeless situations in rural and urban areas  we are already closer to providing more help for both areas  Rural areas are now guaranteed a minimum of funding and will no longer be competing against urban areas for funding  said Enzi  Wyoming homeless programs are usually run by volunteers who dont have a lot of time to write grant proposals and be effective when most large cities have full time grant writers  By separating the rural grant program from those geared toward large cities Wyoming is able to focus on helping the homeless  not filling out paperwork  This new program would allow Wyoming to compete for grant money with other rural areas instead of going up against urban areas for funds  The CPEHA bill would increase all formula homeless funding to 20 percent  the type of homeless funding Wyoming benefits from the most  and guarantee rural areas would receive a minimum level of funding through the competitive grant process  This lock down of funding for rural areas ensures Wyoming is not penalized for its small population  according to Enzi   Wyoming received a little over  400 000 last year in homeless assistance funds  With Enzis changes in the CPEHA bill  it is fair for the state and  depending on overall appropriations and individual grants  Enzi believes Wyoming would do much better than in the past  Enzi also added language to the bill that would expand the definition of what constitutes homeless to include camping  living in motels  hotels and cars or living doubled up in housing meant for single families   The CPEHA bill is now awaiting debate by the full Senate   Statement of Senator Mike Enzi Senate Banking Committee Markup of  The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2007 and the FHA Modernization Act of 2007  September 19  2007  Thank you Mr  Chairman   I appreciate that the Committee is moving to mark up this legislation today  Two of these bills are meant to address the issue of housing in our nation  and there is no more pressing or important need  As the members of this Committee have discussed during the hearing process  the housing market has taken on enormous risk over the past few years  and has finally begun to suffer the consequences  More and more citizens are realizing that they cannot afford the house they live in  Unfortunately for many  it is too late   The FHA bill we will vote on today is an attempt to help those people by expanding the power of a federal program to take on that risk and deflect the rising costs of homeownership  I urge taking extreme caution in this approach  The Federal Housing Administration is and always was an affordable housing program meant to supplement the housing insurance market  not replace it  When a federal program like FHA expands  it also expands the risk borne by the taxpayer  Should the subprime mortgage market continue to decline and spread into the traditional mortgage market  this could be a significant problem for the FHA  and for all American citizens as taxpayers   I am hopeful that this Committee can continue to address the problems of the subprime market in the months to come  However  the only way to solve a market crisis is with a market based solution  and I intend to work with my colleagues in this Committee to find that solution   I am also very pleased that the Chairman and Ranking Member have scheduled a vote today for the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act  This Committee has been considering this bill for a long time  Every iteration of this legislation gets better and better  and this is the best version yet  It balances the needs of charities and non profits to offer homelessness services and emergency shelters in some parts of the country with the need for permanent homeless housing in other regions  It also balances the needs of rural and urban programs  and I think there are several important distinctions between the two   The face of rural homelessness is much different than in an urban setting  In Wyoming  we have residents who live in unsafe and condemned housing  or live doubled up in housing meant for an individual or single family  In other cases  residents in Wyomings rural towns live day to day in motels or hotels because they cannot find anywhere else to live  In the most desperate cases  people live in campgrounds or in their cars  As you can understand  a car or a campground is not protection against the harsh Wyoming weather  Wyoming also faces the problem of geography  Wyoming may have a small population  but our residents are spread over a great distance  This presents a difficult problem when rural services try to coordinate their efforts  share resources  and address a homeless population that is scattered throughout the state  Rural states are at a distinct disadvantage from urban centers with a consolidated organization for this reason   This bill provides rural programs the power to help confront rural homelessness by addressing these two issues  It will grant much needed flexibility for our rural non profits and help them coordinate their efforts over large geographic distances by streamlining the application process  This legislation will also increase formula grant funding  where many rural states get the bulk of their federal homelessness dollars  Under this bill  federal funding can be used to specifically help the homeless populations I mentioned earlier  These groups have long been ignored by traditional homeless programs  These reforms will allow them to receive the services and housing they need to survive   I am hopeful this legislation will help rural organizations truly address the problems of rural homelessness   I want to thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby  and Senators Reed and Allard for their hard work on this bill and for working to address the concerns of rural states  I would also like to thank Senator Crapo for working with me to ensure that rural states like ours have their homelessness priorities addressed in this legislation   Thank you Mr  Chairman
