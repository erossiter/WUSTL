Wyoming sugar beet growers by opposing CAFTA  June 30  2005 Washington  D C  The blow to Wyoming sugar beet growers and the inability of consumers to differentiate between foreign and domestic meat products were reasons enough for U S  Sen  Mike Enzi  R Wyo   to vote against the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   S  1307  Thursday evening  I support fair trade  but am not willing to gamble with the futures of Wyomings sugar beet growers and entire communities in my state in order to support this agreement  said Enzi  Im also disappointed in the foot dragging that has been going on with country of origin labeling  Consumers should not be kept in the dark about where their food is coming from  CAFTA will lead to an influx of foreign products  but the people who buy them wont know if they are eating beef raised in America or if their hamburger is from Honduras     The Senate passed CAFTA 54 45  The agreement must still be approved by the House in order to take effect    Additional remarks from a Senate floor statement follow      end    Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi   on S  1307  the Dominican Republic Central American United States   Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill   June 30  2005    Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  I rise today to express my opposition to the Dominican Republic Central American United States Free Trade Agreement  known as CAFTA  I am opposing the implementing legislation before the Senate today due to the negative impact that passage of the agreement will have on the domestic sugar industry  I also believe mandatory country of origin labeling should be implemented before we sign trade agreements that will bring in additional meat products    The production of sugar is vitally important in Wyoming  Behind hay  which is fed to our livestock  sugar beets are the number one cash crop in Wyoming  So  the small sugar beet farms in Wyoming have a big impact on my states economy  For example  my office received calls from bankers and local economic development agencies in towns that depend upon the viability of the sugar beet industry  They were concerned about the impact of CAFTA on the health of their local economies  the economies of my home state     In addition  the sugar industry is vertically integrated  Sugar beet farmers are invested in their land and specialized farming equipment  However  across the nation sugar beet farmers have also banded together to purchase the processing plants that add value to their crop  So  their investment in sugar is higher than the investments of other farmers in their crops  Many of these plants have been purchased in recent years with a long term debt load  Wyoming sugar beet farmers have a special interest in ensuring that their industry has long term viability  The sugar that would be imported from CAFTA countries under this agreement  in addition to the sugar expected to be imported from Mexico under NAFTA  would have a detrimental impact on the sugar beet industry in the near and distant future     I appreciated the recent efforts the Administration made to engage the sugar industry to work out an agreement  However  I am concerned that the two sides only recently came to the table to address this divisive issue  The trade agreement has been signed for more than a year  but talks only began about three weeks ago  The problem should have been recognized and truly addressed earlier in the process  I am convinced that an agreement could have been reached  As it was  the sugar industry chose not to accept a short term offer by the Administration  The offer would have provided a remedy for the length of the Farm Bill  this year and next years sugar beet crop  As I stated before  sugar beet farmers in Wyoming have made long term investments in their processing facilities  They need a long term solution not a short term fix     This problem will not go away  As the Administration continues to seek additional free trade agreements with countries that desire to send their sugar to our markets  this issue will resurface  I recommend that the Administration and the sugar industry continue creative discussions to identify a long term solution beyond the next Farm Bill to ensure the viability of the sugar industry and the small family farmers that the industry supports in the United States     Beyond Wyoming sugar  Wyoming cattle producers have made it clear to me that they want mandatory country of origin labeling implemented before new trade agreements are signed that could bring in additional beef and meat products  I agree that consumers should have the opportunity to make an informed purchase regarding their meats country of origin at their grocery store  U S  beef is competitive  but it doesnt receive a chance to compete when it isnt labeled as U S  beef for consumers    With my vote against this bill  it would be easy for my opponents to cast me as an free trade obstructionist  I would like to remind them that until today  I have never voted against a free trade agreement on the floor of the Senate  The principles of fair trade  which I support  generally bring about increased democracy  more transparency in government and increased productivity  Along these lines  there are industries in Wyoming that communicated their support of CAFTA to me  I am pleased the agreement will improve market access for important industries like soda ash and oil and gas  I recognize the benefits this agreement will bring to many and applaud the Administration for their hard work in bringing this agreement to fruition  Unfortunately  I cannot vote for the agreement today because the costs outweigh the benefits for my state as a whole    Thank you Mr  President  I yield the floor
