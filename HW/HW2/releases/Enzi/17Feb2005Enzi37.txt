bill to keep military families safe from fraud  February 17  2005 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   introduced legislation Thursday designed to give unknowing military personnel some defense against individuals pushing high cost financial products with low death benefits     Our men and women serving in the military are expertly trained in the use of the world s most advanced weaponry and military tactics to defend against threats to our country  said Enzi  They shouldn t have to defend against high pressure sales people pushing expensive  unsound financial and life insurance plans     Some financial services companies have been disguising  marketing and selling high cost periodic payment plan certificates solely to military personnel on military bases  These plans are similar to mutual funds except that 50 percent of the first years payments go directly towards the commissions of the salesman  The average commission on similar securities products is less than six percent per sale in the first year  Some products are also marketed as investments but provide very low death benefits while charging very high premiums in the first years     Our soldiers put their lives on the line to protect this country and they deserve the best treatment  No insurance company should use military personnel and their families as easy profit for unscrupulous policies said Enzi     Enzi s bill  the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act  would      Provide for state insurance regulator jurisdiction over the sale of insurance products on military bases     Require the Department of Defense to keep a list of individuals barred or banned from military bases because of abusive sales tactics     Protect military families by preventing investment companies from issuing periodic payment plan certificates  the mutual fund like investment product with extremely high first year costs    Senators Hillary Clinton  D N Y   Chuck Hagel  R Neb  and Charles Schumer  D N Y are co sponsors of Enzi s bill  A companion bill  H R  458  was introduced in the House          Floor Statement Of Michael B  Enzi Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act   February 17  2005    Mr  Enzi  Mr  President  I rise today with my colleague from New York to introduce the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act of 2005  This bill is needed to protect our military personnel and their families from unscrupulous financial products  Over the past year  it has become increasingly clear to many that the lack of oversight in this area has allowed certain individuals to push high cost financial products on unknowing military personnel  This practice must be stopped  Our soldiers and their families deserve much better  especially during a time when so many of them are serving at home and overseas to protect our freedom     The bill that we introduce today will halt completely the sale of a mutual fund like product that charges a 50 percent sales commission against the first year of contributions by a military family  Currently  there are hundreds of mutual fund products available on the market that charge less than six percent   The excessive sales charges of these contractually based financial products make them susceptible to abusive and misleading sales practices     In addition  certain life insurance products are being offered to our service members disguised and marketed as investment products  These products provide very low death benefits while charging very high premiums  especially in the first few years  Many of these products are unsuitable for the insurance and investment needs of military families     One of the major problems with the sale of insurance products on military bases is the confusion of whether state insurance regulators or military base commanders are responsible for the oversight of sales agents  Typically  military base commanders will bar certain sales agents from a military base only to have the sales agents show up at other military facilities  Since there is no record of the bar  state insurance regulators have been unable to have adequate oversight of the individuals  The bill that we introduce today will solve that problem  It will state clearly that state insurance regulators have jurisdiction of the sale of insurance products on military bases     The bill will also urge state insurance regulators to work with the Department of Defense to develop life insurance product standards and disclosures  The Department of Defense will keep a list of individuals who are barred or banned from military bases due to abuse or unscrupulous sales tactics and to share that list with Federal and State insurance  securities and other relevant regulators     Finally  the bill that we are introducing today will protect our military families by preventing investment companies from issuing periodic payment plan certificates  the mutual fund like investment product with extremely high first year costs  This type of financial instrument has been criticized by securities regulators since the late 1960s     It should be noted that there are many upstanding financial and insurance companies that sell very worthwhile investment and insurance products to military families  They should be applauded for the fine job that they do in helping our military members and their families  This bill is targeted at the few who abuse the system and prey upon our military     Congress is fully aware of the dangers faced by our military personnel in keeping our country safe from harm  Likewise  we must do all that we can to arm our soldiers when they face the dangers of planning for their financial futures     Mr  President  I urge my colleagues to take up this bill immediately so that we can help our men and women in the military and their families                                                        February 2005 News Releases           Browse by
