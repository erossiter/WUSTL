potential security dangers  January 12  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   participated in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today called to take a look at the national security dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction technology in the former Soviet Union     Increasing Our Non proliferation Efforts in the Former Soviet Union  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi  April 23  2002   Mr  Chairman  I am very pleased you called this hearing  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as well as the unauthorized sharing of weapons grade technologies are significant threats to our national security  As you may know  I recently visited Russia to discuss export controls and non proliferation  I believe today s hearing is timely and an important issue for the Committee to address  As we all know  non proliferation is not a new issue and neither are the threats posed by unsafe and unsecure nuclear technologies     The main objective of my trip was to form a U S  Russia working group that would expand legislative cooperation between our countries in order to better control the transfer of weapons of mass destruction technology     I am pleased to share with everyone on the Committee a copy of the agreement signed by the Chairman of Russia s Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security and the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security  It is my hope that our agreement to form a joint working group will help maintain an open dialogue between our countries  As you will note in the agreement  Russian officials do recognize the threat posed to international security by terrorism and the need for more effective export control regulations     I believe if both the United States and Russia produce an item that can be detrimental and aid proliferation and only one of the countries restricts its sale  countries who are bad actors can wind up with dangerous items  I have been working on the re authorization of the Export Administration Act  EAA  which would modernize our export controls  Russia recently adopted its own export control law to regulate the transfer of certain technologies  Russian officials  however  have had problems implementing and enforcing many aspects of their export controls legislation  With EAA pending in the U S  House of Representatives and Russians unable to implement their legislation  it is imperative that the United States enact its own legislation and work with Russia to control the export of items designed for civilian use  but which can have military applications     While in Russia  I traveled with a highly intelligent professor from the University of Georgia in Athens  Mr  Igor Khripunov  Mr  Khripunov is an expert in international trade and security  When discussing the status of the military and related technologies  Mr  Khripunov points out that  This desperate situation is caused not only by underfunding and economic dislocation  but also by lack of motivation and moral values that were supposed to replace the communist ideology  The situation faced by Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union  combined with the low moral values of those seemingly in charge of Russia s military technologies  led to a very dangerous status for nuclear safety and security     While I am very pleased that Russian legislators see the need to deal with export controls  cooperation in this one area will not address all of the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction  The threats come in a variety of areas and threaten international safety and security in a number of ways     One such threat is the lack of qualified people to handle nuclear technologies  Each year  both the United States and Russia have fewer and fewer nuclear engineering schools  This leaves both our countries with fewer and fewer experts who can help us address the permanent threats created by having nuclear technologies  We need to have people highly educated in nuclear engineering to work on the safety of the nuclear facilities and the security of the nation  In the United States  we can begin developing programs where students receive funding for school in exchange for working for the U S  Department of Energy or the National Security Council  We have the opportunity and the ability to create and re enforce an educated group of experts whose knowledge and experience will help protect our nation     In Russia  the continued isolation of the so called closed cities creates another security threat  Scientists and experts in these cities do not currently have opportunities to advance their ideas  By offering these experts a business opportunity  their knowledge can be utilized to achieve better economic possibilities  Small business development should be brought to these Russian cities to encourage the scientists to use their ideas to enhance their personal economic status and their families  well being  It would also prevent the experts from seeking employment or support from a party that should not have access to their knowledge     This brings up another significant threat to international security  the sharing of highly sensitive nuclear information and machinery with nations who pose a threat to international stability  Our view on many countries differ from the Russian view  Based on our cloudy history  we cannot be surprised  We cannot  however  sit back and allow dangerous technologies to be shared with adversarial nations  Again  only by working with our Russian counterparts to encourage Russian scientists to remain in Russia and not share information with rogue nations  can we help ensure the technologies will not be given away     As non proliferation is discussed  we must also address recent missile defense related issues  To address the threats of the 21st century  we need a new concept of deterrence that includes both offensive and defensive forces  Today  the list of countries with weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles includes some of the world s least responsible nations  These nations seek weapons of mass destruction to intimidate their neighbors and to keep the United States and other responsible nations from helping allies and friends in strategic parts of the world  When rogue nations such as these gain access to this kind of technology  it illustrates just how important it is for us to protect our nation and our troops abroad  In the less predictable world of the 21st century  our challenge is to deter multiple potential adversaries not only from using weapons of mass destruction  but to dissuade them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and missiles in the first place     I believe that the limited national missile defense system that the United States is contemplating is not aimed at the Russian offensive capability  The U S  has been willing to provide Russia with information about what our thinking is  what our development prospects have been for missile defense  and also to engage them in cooperative kinds of activities  because in many respects  the threats that the United States is concerned about from rogue states are threats that are likewise faced by Russia     I support President Bush s willingness to work with Russia to craft a new strategic framework that reflects our nations  common interests and cooperation  I believe the new strategic framework should be premised on openness  mutual confidence  and real opportunities for cooperation  including the area of missile defense  This framework should allow both countries to share information so that each nation can improve its early warning capability and its capability to defend its people and territory  Furthermore  the framework should focus on cooperation to strengthen and enlarge bilateral and multilateral non  and counterproliferation measures     I believe these missile defense capabilities are not an alternative or substitute for traditional deterrence  but rather an essential means to enhance deterrence against the new threats of today  not those of the past     While much press has been given to missiles and military technology  some threats to international security can come from seemingly domestic areas  like energy  As we all know  the energy debate in the United States has been highly contentious  Representing a state like Wyoming with many natural resources  I was very curious about Russia s energy future  Coal  which is a staple of Wyoming s economy  has been a substantial part of Russia s energy resources  While the United States considers technologies like clean coal  I was shocked when the Russian representatives informed me of the possibilities of how to address Russia s future energy needs  In areas like Vladivostok  they are considering using floating reactors  Imagine the safety and security issues of such a energy source  The reactors would literally float in the dock of Vladivostok     This example is a prime reason the United States must remain actively involved with our Russian counterparts on the issue of non proliferation  If the Russian government can find no way  other than floating nuclear reactors  to address its energy needs  the United States and the international community must be prepared to help     The United States had been involved in Russia attempting to halt the dissemination and proliferation of nuclear knowledge  There is  however  much more to be done  In their Annual Report to Congress  the National Intelligence Council noted  Through Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the U S  Department of Energy s Material Protection  Control  and Accounting Program  the United States continues to assist Russia in improving security at nuclear facilities  Unfortunately  upon my return from Russia  I found out that all new program funding from the United States is being held until certification of Russia s compliance with the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  While I understand the need for cooperation certification and I applaud the State Department for doing its job  I do not think this is the appropriate time to send this message to the Russian government  According to the State Department  Congress passed the legislation for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program without including a presidential waiver  I hope my colleagues will support the presidential waiver included in the President s fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental appropriations legislation  I also hope President Bush and the State Department will take all available steps and find a way to certify Russia s cooperation as soon as possible     As President Bush prepares to travel to Moscow in May  I know non proliferation will be an issue high on the agenda  It is my hope that as a legislative body  we can continue to support the President s efforts while also addressing the threats of proliferation with our Russian counterparts  Thank you  once again  Mr  Chairman  for your willingness to discuss this threat to our national safety and international security
