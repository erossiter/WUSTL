                                                                                                                                                                                      When good child care legislation goes bad  the story of SCHIP Enzi laments majority s missed opportunity to help kids August 3  2007 Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   voted in favor of a childrens health care measure Wednesday  but Thursday Senate Democrats pushed through their own Trojan horse which Enzi said would push America further toward government run health care   Enzi voted in favor of a version of the State Child Insurance Program  SCHIP  reauthorization  that would fully fund the program and target low income children as intended under current law   I supported legislation that would have made sure Wyoming kids would continue to have access to health care coverage and would have helped get those kids who are eligible to be part of the program  actually signed up  Our bill would fund the program  but the difference is that our plan concentrates on helping kids instead of providing for the expansion of an inefficient federal bureaucracy  said Enzi  who is the top Republican on the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are aching for government run health care and they are using this as a vehicle to get closer to that goal  but I did not support this unruly expansion of big government  This bill is a Trojan horse  Now that its in the city we see non children interest groups crawling out of it and sneaking toward the city gate  We should not create a new federal entitlement for families making  82 000 a year  but thats what this bill does  This program exists to help kids whose parents cant afford health insurance  not lure people who already have insurance out of the private market  I will not support a childrens health care bill that takes resources away from American children and gives them to non citizens and adults  We should preserve SCHIP  It has worked for Wyoming   but we should not be expanding it beyond its intent   The Senate defeated the proposal Wednesday supported by Enzi by a vote of 35 61  but passed the majority version by a vote of 68 31 Thursday night    Enzi says SCHIP dollars would go farther and cover more kids if the program forms a partnership with the private market   Health care at twice the price  half the quality  That should be the advertising line for federal health care  The federal government cant provide health care as efficiently as it can when it is partnered with the private sector  Wyoming s program indicates that  Enzi said  Through competition we can keep prices down and at the same time provide better service   Enzi said Wyoming is doing a great job administering its SCHIP  but that cant be said about all states   Wyoming first implemented its SCHIP program  Kid Care CHIP  in 1999 and in 2003  Wyoming formed a public private partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta Dental of Wyoming to provide the health  vision  and dental benefits to nearly 6 000 kids in Wyoming   These partnerships have made Kid Care CHIP a very successful program in Wyoming   Enzi said  Some states SCHIP programs cover parents of kids that are on SCHIP and some states even cover childless adults  Lack of health insurance for adults is a problem in this country  but not a problem this program was originally intended to address  There are responsible  market based actions we can take to help more American adults get health insurance  but this bill  the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  should focus on the C  for Children   The House passed its version of the legislation 225 204 Wednesday  The next step for the legislation will be for House and Senate members to meet and work out the differences in the two bills   This State Childrens Health Insurance  SCHIP  debate has been one of those old tricks from the book  but the majority party has taken the easy road by seeking to vilify those who sought to improve its proposal  The easy road is not the right road  however  We should be discussing how we can cover the most kids the most efficiently  not just turn this into another bidding war and race to expand federally controlled healthcare  said Enzi   Enzi also supports current law that requires proof of citizenship in order to receive health benefits  but the proposal passed by the Senate contains no such requirement  making it easier for illegal aliens to get government health care benefits  It would also expand coverage to adults and families with incomes well above the poverty level                                                          August 2007
