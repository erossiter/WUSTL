Wyo  Job Corps Center  June 28  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   is asking the U S  Department of Labor to locate a Jobs Corps center in Wyoming that would help train young adults and fill a gap in the work force  In a June 27 letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  Enzi and Senator Judd Gregg  R N H   urged Chao to locate a center in Wyoming and New Hampshire  the only two states that do not currently have a center  The senators reminded Chao that legislation passed by the Senate last year includes language urging the department to put a priority on locating new centers in these areas  It is our understanding that this language directs the Secretary of Labor to give priority consideration to applications for new centers in states that do not have a Job Corps center  the senators wrote  We look forward to working with you to ensure that all states enjoy the benefits of the Job Corps program   Enzi  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  said a Job Corps center can be an integral part of supplying Wyoming with skilled workers  Wyoming employers are in desperate need of skilled workers  This center can train students right here in Wyoming and not only provide technical training  but assistance in social skills and independent living  said Enzi  The Fremont County Board of Cooperative Educational Services has proposed a Job Corps Center be located within the county  Job Corps is a vocational and educational training center offered at no cost to at risk young adults ages 16 to 24 to prepare them for a career  The Department of Labor administers the program to help young adults earn a high school diploma or GED  get help finding a better job  or learn a trade  The program is self paced and can take between eight months and two years depending on the career area of study  Students are provided with career counseling and transition support for up to 12 months after they graduate   Text of the Enzi
