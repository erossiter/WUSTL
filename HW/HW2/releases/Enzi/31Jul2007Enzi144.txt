State of the Union  July 31  2007  Washington  D C    Anyone who owns stock in a company or is thinking of buying or selling stock should keep tabs on the organization that works to ensure the securities industry is working within the law  according U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   senior member of the Senate Banking Committee  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission briefed the Senate Banking Committee about the U S  securities market during an annual hearing this morning designed to gauge the current activities and progress of the Securities and Exchange Commission  Chairman Chris Cox and Enzi emphasized the importance of regulation not hindering capital formation in the U S  and that American markets remain competitive across the globe    Enzis opening statement from the hearing is included below    Statement of Senator Mike Enzi  Senate Banking Committee Hearing on   The State of the Securities Markets July 31  2007  Iwould like to thank my colleague Chairman Cox for appearing before this committee today  Mr  Chairman  we worked together on several issues during your time in the U S  House of Representatives and now as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission  We collaborated on stock option valuation  We were both conferees on the Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002  I have always appreciated your perspective on the state of the U S  and world financial markets  and I look forward to your testimony today    Speaking of Sarbanes Oxley  I noted that last week the Commission voted unanimously in support of Auditing Standard Number Five  the auditor guidance issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to complement the Commissions management guidance for Sarbanes Oxley  I have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the Commission on their work  and support their final product  As I have said before  the key to successful implementation and financial controls testing is a risk based  top down approach    In the early days of Sarbanes Oxley  auditors could spend hours testing financial controls that posed little or no risk to the company as a whole  These hours translated into skyrocketing costs for public companies and heightened criticism for the way the law was being implemented   In order to solve this problem  I urged the Commission to develop management guidance and create a smaller company advisory panel to assist the Commission in developing tailored guidance for small public companies  I also worked with the PCAOB as they refined their guidance and elicited public comments from their small business forums held across the country   The result of this effort is clear  The Commission has developed a streamlined process that is scalable for smaller companies  yet still maintains the accountability and transparency required by the Act  I am pleased the Commission spoke with a single voice on this important issue  and look forward to the tangible benefits this guidance will bring to the U S  companies struggling to comply with the Act  I hope the Commission will continue to monitor the application of their management guidance to anticipate and address issues before they grow into larger problems    The Commission has also announced the beginning of another accounting project  I read last week in a Concept Release by the Commission that they are proposing a new method of accounting for U S  issuers  Now companies can choose to follow U S  generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards when filing their financial statements with the Commission    As an accountant  I understand that implementing this proposal could require a significant amount of time and effort by the Commission  It would require new filing procedures  and change the way company data is analyzed by the Commission and the U S  public  In a sense  this departure from current practice would change the landscape of our capital markets  and possibly at a high cost   However  this change could have very appealing benefits  like attracting foreign companies to the U S  and making our markets more competitive overseas  There has been an explosion of growth and productivity in the Asian and European capital markets  and it is smart to find new ways to attract that business to our shores  I look forward to hearing more about the Commissions plans for this project  and their interaction with the FASB and IASB on merging the two accounting methods    I would also like to mention the Commissions work on mutual recognition of foreign financial jurisdictions for the purpose of servicing U S  investors  Again  there are substantial opportunity to streamline a bureaucratic process to the benefit of the American public  but significant implementation issues must be considered as this proposal is refined  A delicate balance must be reached between investor access and investor protection  I understand the Commission held a roundtable discussion on this issue in June  I would like to learn more about what was discussed and how the SEC plans to work with financial entities in foreign jurisdictions  Finally  I have been following the Commissions investigation on the illegal backdating of stock options  This issue seems to keep getting bigger as the investigation continues  Just last week  the Commission announced new criminal charges in the case    I wish to share my support for Chairman Cox and the SEC Enforcement Division for the speed and determination with which they are conducting these investigations  The PCAOB can also play an important role in this issue  as investigations could result in new audit practices for firms auditing public companies   Despite the growing amount of evidence about improper accounting and possible fraud within the suspected companies  it is important to understand that stock options remain a legitimate and useful form of compensation  Start up companies and Fortune 500 companies alike use options plans to motivate rank and file employees and attract top talent    The Commission has set an ambitious agenda for the coming months  I look forward to working with the Chairman to implement policy that will protect U S  investors and Americas competitive edge in our growing global economy    I would like to thank Chairman Cox again for appearing before the Senate Banking Committee today  I look forward to his testimony                                                       July 2007 News Releases           Browse by
