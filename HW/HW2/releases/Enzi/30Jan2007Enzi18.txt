protected with Senate minimum wage vote  January 30  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said the Senate has rejected a partisan  one sided approach to raise the minimum wage and voted to move forward a bipartisan  fair and balanced minimum wage increase that supports both working families and the small businesses that will face the greatest difficulties in meeting a federally mandated wage hike  Raising the minimum wage without providing relief for the small businesses that must pay for that increase is simply not an option  Enzi said  In the long run  we simply cannot claim to be helping workers while at the same time we hurt the businesses that employ them   A vote for cloture is a vote for small businesses and working families  It is a vote for a well balanced and bipartisan solution   The Senate approved today the motion to file cloture on the Baucus Substitute Amendment to H R  2  the minimum wage bill by a vote of 87 10  The Senate can now proceed to a final vote on that amendment  which couples an increase in the federal wage from  5 15 an hour to  7 25 an hour with targeted tax and regulatory relief for small businesses  In addressing minimum wage we have rejected the misguided notion that it be a clean bill  because it is not a clean issue  While pretending that economics or social issues are simple often makes for great rhetoric  and always makes for great politics  it seldom makes for responsible policy  Around here  clean  more often than not  simply means do it my way and does not respect the democratic process of the Senate and allowing the Senate to work its will   I am pleased that we rejected such false simplicity here and chose the course of coupling an increased wage with provisions that will assist those small business employers that will face the greatest difficulties in paying such increased costs  I hope we do not forget the wisdom of this approach as we address other workplace  economic and social issues  STATEMENT OF SENATOR MICHAEL B  ENZI REGARDING  THE BAUCUS SUBSTITUTE TO H R 2   THE MINIMUM WAGE HIKE AND SMALL BUSINESS TAX INCENTIVE PACKAGE  1 30 07 Mr  President  I rise today to speak in support of the motion to file cloture on the Baucus Substitute to HR 2  Around the noon hour today  we will be voting to end debate on the minimum wage bill  Regardless of how that vote turns out  I believe the direction that this body has decided upon with regard to the minimum wage is clear  Raising the minimum wage without providing relief for the small businesses that must pay for that increase is simply not an option   We here in the Senate recognize that small businesses have been the steady engine of our growing economy  and that they have been the source of new job creation  Americas working families rely on small businesses and vice versa  I am proud that this body has chosen a path which attempts to preserve this segment of the economy which employs so many working men and women   The Senate has recognized that our economy is interdependent  One simply cannot credibly claim to be helping workers while at the same time hurting the businesses that employ them  Recognition of this simple fact is the reason why the bill before this body couples a raise in the minimum wage with relief to those businesses and their working families that will face the most difficulty in meeting the mandate  This body has also recognized the even simpler fact that a raise in the minimum wage is of no benefit to a worker without a job  or a job seeker without a prospect  I would take this occasion to urge that these simple real world truths be recognized by our colleagues in the other chamber   Unquestionably  as this Congress moves forward we will need to confront a range of issues facing working families  the rising cost of health insurance and the availability of such insurance  the necessity and costs of education and job training  and the desire to achieve an appropriate balance between work and family life  These are important issues  and the way in which this body has determined to address minimum wage should give us an outline as to the way such other issues might be approached as well   In addressing minimum wage we have rejected the notion that it be a clean bill  Ultimately we did so because it is not a clean issue  By that I mean that neither the real world  nor questions of national economics and social policy  are as simple as some would like them to be  Quite the contrary  they are complex and interrelated  While pretending that economics or social issues are simple often makes for great rhetoric  and always makes for great politics  it seldom makes for responsible policy  Around here  clean more often than not  simply means do it my way and does not respect the democratic process of the Senate and allowing the Senate to work its will   I am pleased that we rejected such false simplicity here and chose the course of coupling an increased wage with provisions that will assist those small business employers that will face the greatest difficulties in paying such increased costs  I hope we do not forget the wisdom of this approach as we address other workplace  economic and social issues  None of these are simple  and none  no matter how laudable the end  are without costs or free from the danger of unintended consequences where  in an effort to do some good  we wind up causing great harm  I am also heartened that in the course of this debate this body has begun to recognize what I know from my own life to be true   working families are not only those that are employed by businesses  they are also those who own the businesses  I have noted many times that I was a small business owner  that my wife and I operated mom and pop shoe stores in Wyoming  My story is not unique  particularly in todays economy  I know that all small business owners have two families  their own  and the family of those that work for them  I also know that business owners feel the pressure of rising costs  the dilemma of difficult options  and the uncomfortable squeeze of modern life in both of their families  as much as many workers do in their own  I believe we have begun to realize this reality in the way we have approached the minimum wage legislation  and I do not think we should lose sight of it as we move through this Congress   I would also note that while I am pleased by the overall approach this body adopted  I am somewhat disappointed that it was not as complete as it could have been  In the event cloture is invoked we will not have addressed a range of provisions that were offered  and that should have been considered and voted on  In this respect  I would note specifically those I mentioned late last week  Senator Greggs amendment on Employee Option Time  or flex time for private sector workers  and Senator DeMints amendment dealing with the same matter  as well as Senator Burrs amendment on health insurance costs  and Senator Vitters amendment that would have provided a measure of monetary relief for small businesses that make inadvertent paperwork errors in providing government required information   All of these were well reasoned  would have provided benefits in addition to  or in counterbalance to a minimum wage hike  and all were entitled to due consideration and a vote in this chamber  We were not allowed to have a vote  Many have charged that the majority denied us a vote on these amendments because they would have passed  and that would have somehow represented a win for Republicans  Therefore  goes the theory  voting on these amendments was prevented  Whether true or not  the lack of a vote on these amendments does nothing but lend credence to the view that in the Congress partisanship too often trumps positive progress   The reality is that good ideas do not simply fade away  and that if not here and now  then at some point in this Congress these and other good ideas must be given consideration and must be voted on  Fairness demands it  and our responsibility to working families and small businesses requires it   A vote for cloture is a vote for small businesses and working families  It is a vote for a well balanced and bipartisan solution
