                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi  American competitiveness must boost graduation rates  promote lifelong learning  February 9  2006    Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the        Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said        the nation faces dual challenges meeting global competition for high paying        21st Century jobs  boosting graduation rates to prepare students for postsecondary        education and the job market  and promoting lifelong learning to keep established        workers armed with the skills needed in todays workforce and in the        future    During a hearing  The Role of Education in American Competitiveness         Enzi said the need to respond to these challenges becomes more pressing        each day  Teaching American students the language of success        will require both short term and long term strategies to bring our education        system up to world standards    We are facing challenges that we        must view as opportunities  Enzi said  We must ensure our        children develop the strong foundation they will need in math and science        to acquire skills and knowledge needed in todays job market  Its        equally important that established workers  those already on the        career ladder  get the additional training and retraining they will        need to advance in the marketplace of tomorrow and throughout their lifetimes            While hearing testimony from Department of Education Secretary Margaret        Spellings  Enzi praised the American Competitiveness Initiative outlined        by President Bush during his State of the Union address delivered January        31  Enzi said the Presidents outlook served to increase optimism        that we can and will meet these challenges by continuing to improve our        schools and the education we provide our children  As part of the Competitiveness        Initiative  the Presidents budget proposes almost  400 million to        strengthen schools and improve elementary and secondary instruction in math        and science     This focus is important because studies show America is starting to lose        its edge in the race for knowledge    Without an educated workforce        we are certain to lose our preeminence in the world to developing nations        that are quickly growing and innovating at a much faster rate than we are         Enzi said     American students have lagged behind their peers in Asia and Europe in math        and science skills  For example  only 7 percent of Americas 4th and        8th graders reached the advanced level on the 2003 Trends in International        Math and Science Study  By contrast  38 percent of Singapores 4th        graders and 44 percent of their 8th graders reached the advanced level         Moreover  American 15 year olds ranked 24th out of the 29 developed nations        in mathematics  literacy and problem solving on the most recent program        for the international student assessment test     Meanwhile  the number of American students who have graduated from college        each year with degrees in engineering also has lagged far behind foreign        nations  In 2004  China graduated about 500 000 engineers  while India graduated        200 000 and the United States graduated 70 000  In less than five years         China has more than doubled the number of their students who have graduated        from college each year with degrees in engineering     According to Enzi  statistics for minority students and the prospects for        their future participation in a global economy add even greater cause for        concern  Nationally  about one third of all high school students do not        complete their course of study on time  For minority students this figure        hovers around 50 percent     At a time when most jobs will require        some postsecondary education  we must focus on how to graduate more students        on time  with less need for remediation  and give them a greater likelihood        of success in college or the workplace  Enzi said  Today         tomorrow and for the foreseeable future  knowledge is kingespecially        knowledge obtained and updated on a regular basis through a lifetime of        learning and a constant upgrading of the skills of our workforce  College        degrees dont have the shelf life they once did    He pledged to lead the HELP Committee to continue its work in the coming        session of Congress to move forward legislation directed at retaining Americas        competitive edge in the global economy by ensuring that higher education        prepares todays students for the demands of tomorrows workplace    Under Enzis leadership last year  the HELP Committee laid a foundation        to boost competitiveness of American workers with passage of The        Higher Education Amendments Act of 2005  HEA   the Workforce        Investment Act  WIA   and The Deficit Reduction Act         a bill that includes provisions to give low income college students eligibility        for billions of dollars in new federal grants if they pursue degrees in        math  science or critical foreign languages    Working in conjunction with HEA and WIA  the Perkins Act         which awaits conference committee action  will require state agencies to        work together on identifying the needs of the workforce and in designing        education and skills training programs to match those needs     end  Statement of Michael B  Enzi  Chairman   Senate Committee on   Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  Hearing on the Role of Education in Global Competitiveness February 9  2006 Good morning and welcome to todays hearing on the            Role of Education in Global Competitiveness  We are very fortunate to            have as our witness today Margaret Spellings  the Secretary of Education             to discuss the Presidents recently announced Global Competitiveness            initiative and other Administration education priorities that will be            a cornerstone of our national strategy to address the challenges of            a global economy  We have a unique opportunity to strengthen and focus            our education and training systems to ensure that  as individuals and            as a nation  we have the knowledge and skills that we need  We must            ensure that Americas students are the best in the world  that            they speak the language of success  and that as a country we get more            than a passing grade  In April of 2005  Secretary Spellings appeared before            this Committee to testify with Elaine Chao  the Secretary of Labor             on this same topic of global competitiveness  At that hearing  the Committees            goal was to find out how we can provide our children with an education            today for tomorrows jobs  In addition  we held a roundtable on            higher education with college presidents and corporate executives where            they cited a great need for a well educated and skilled workforce  Without            an educated workforce we are certain to lose our preeminence in the            world to developing nations that are quickly growing and innovating            at a much faster rate than we are  If our students and workers are to have the best chance            to succeed in life  we need to focus all of our Federal education and            training programs from pre kindergarten through postsecondary education             to on the job and continuing education  To be competitive in a global            economy we must ensure coordination and accountability in our education            and workforce programs across all agencies  departments and levels of            government  To stay in the competitiveness race and to win it  we must            ensure that school is never out and learning is never over  In reading The Jobs Revolution  I was particularly drawn            to a passage about knowledge and job skills  Knowledge             it began  is being outdated at rates that are still escalating             Even where knowledge is current when students graduate  it is soon outdated             While the number of new careers is increasing  the life span of applicable            knowledge is decreasing  Two thirds of the 7 million worker gap            in 2010 will be a skilled worker shortage  This is unacceptable  Today  tomorrow and for the foreseeable future  knowledge            is king  especially knowledge obtained and updated on a regular            basis through a lifetime of learning and a constant upgrading of the            skills of our workforce  College degrees dont have the shelf life            they once did   In 2004  China graduated about 500 000 engineers and India            200 000 compared to our nations 70 000  In less than five years            China has more than doubled the number of their engineering students            who have graduated from college  Only 6 percent of the bachelor level            engineering degrees granted worldwide were earned in the United States            More staggering are the results from national and international            tests showing that American elementary and secondary students are falling            behind and will not be prepared for the demands of global competitiveness             Only 7 percent of Americas 4th and 8th graders in 2003 reached            the advanced level on the international math and science study test             By contrast  38 percent of Singapore 4th graders and 44 percent of their            8th graders did  In addition  American 15 year olds ranked 24th out            of the 29 developed nations in mathematics  literacy and problem solving            on the most recent international assessment test  We are losing the            race  A student who takes just one remedial reading course in            college is eight times less likely to graduate than a student who is            fully prepared for college  At a time when most jobs will require some            postsecondary education  we must focus on how to graduate more students            on time  with less need to repeat basic reading and math courses  and            a greater likelihood of success in college or the workplace   A good education will always be the golden key that will            unlock the door to a brighter future for us all as individuals  and             together  as a nation  Often when there are challenges  there are opportunities             By taking this opportunity to strengthen and focus our education and            training systems on ensuring the knowledge and skills that we as individuals            and a nation need  we are ensuring that Americas students are            the best in the world  that they speak the language of success  and            that as a country we get more than a passing grade   Secretary Spellings  we look forward to your remarks regarding            what the President is proposing for the U S  Department of Education            to meet these challenges  On January 5th  you jointly announced with            the Secretary of State  the National Security Language Initiative to            advance national security and global competitiveness  The President            proposed almost  400 million as part of the American Competitiveness            Initiative  to strengthen the capacity of our schools to improve elementary            and secondary instruction in math and science  These are critical first            steps   Thank you for being here and sharing your vision with            us today   The purpose of todays hearing is to discuss the            competitiveness initiative  I recognize that there are many important            education topics existing today  however  I respectfully request the            Committee to stay focused on this most important topic                                                            February 2006 News Releases           Browse by
