                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi supports bill to give FDA authority  resources to ensure patient safety  says more work is needed  April 19  2007 Washington  D C  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R WY   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today announced an important first step toward protecting American consumers and patients as the HELP Committee approved a comprehensive bill to enhance drug safety  provide key resources to review new drugs and medical devices  and ensure that drugs and devices for children are safe and effective   Enzi added that the bill  the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act  is by no means a finished product  and said that he will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve the bill as it moves to the Senate floor in order to best protect the health and safety of all Americans  The bill was approved by a vote of 15 5  As todays debate demonstrated  there are legitimate concerns about the potential unintended consequences of this bill and the amendments that were offered  Enzi said  I look forward to working with the Members of the HELP Committee in the coming weeks to address the concerns outlined in their amendments  and I am confident that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to strike the right chord for patient safety  The Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act  S  1082  establishes a system of active surveillance for drugs already on the market through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies  REMS   The bill explicitly gives the FDA new authority to measure the risks of drugs on the market and to respond quickly and appropriately when previously unknown risks arise   Many people are asking  Why REMS  Why now  Enzi said  The answer is easy  Right now  the FDA has its hands tied behind its back when it tries to manage the risks of drugs already on the market  This bill will clarify and strengthen the FDAs authority and give it new tools to take measured and appropriate steps to protect the health and safety of America s  when the agencys post market surveillance signals potential dangers from a drug or therapy  Pulling a drug from the market and denying patients who need it shouldnt be the only tool available to the FDA   The authority of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  touches the lives of all Americans  from infants to the elderly  animals that provide the food and fiber for living  and even our pets  Enzi said  We need to restore peace of mind for Americans who are buying drugs for themselves and their children   Like everyone else  when I purchase a product for myself  my children  or my grandchildren  I want assurance that the product is safe and beneficial  Enzi said  Safety must be at the forefront of every decision the FDA makes during the life of a drug  so that moms and dads are able to trust that the products at the pharmacy counter are safe and effective  Imagine a system that gives the FDA  through sound science and remarkable innovation  the tools to get drugs to the market quickly and efficiently  especially when lives are on the line and people need new drugs and therapies  Imagine also a system that gives the FDA new authority to take swift  appropriate  and decisive action to ensure patient safety and protect consumers when new information comes to light to expose unexpected risks  We can make this a reality  The full text of Senator Enzis statement is available at    The Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act Summary Title I  Prescription Drug User Fees Title I codifies the user fee agreement reached by drug and biotech industries with the FDA  It establishes an overall amount for user fees of nearly  393 million for 2008  which will be adjusted upward based on 2007 workload   It includes the expansion of use of drug user fees by nearly  30 million for post approval drug safety programs  Title I also includes the FDA industry proposal to create a voluntary user fee program under which drug companies can submit direct to consumer television advertisements to the agency for review before they are distributed   Title II  Drug Safety Subtitle ARisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies  This subtitle establishes a system of routine active surveillance for postmarket drug safety through a public private partnership  The partnership will aggregate data from Federal  and private health databases containing information for at least 100 000 000 covered lives and support the analysis of utilization and safety data from these databases  The establishment of this system will be supported with up to  30 million in appropriations  Given the ability of this active surveillance system to identify and assess drug risks  most drugs and biologics will not need anything further than this system and the drug label to appropriately manage risk  However  some drugs and biologics will need additional tools to manage serious risks  and these products will be approved with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  REMS   Sponsors would propose a REMS and FDA would approve it after structured negotiations  if necessary  The REMS will be reviewed at 18 months and three years  as well as in labeling supplements and when FDA requests a review    Additional Elements of a REMS  For those drugs that have a REMS  the REMS will always include the FDA approved professional labeling and a timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS   For those drugs that have a REMS  the REMS will always include the FDA approved professional labeling and a timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS   When more is needed  a REMS may include tools to assess  communicate about  or manage risks  The bill contains clear standards detailing the appropriate application of each tool  These standards ensure that new FDA authorities are applied narrowly  and only as necessary   A REMS would be assessed in response to new information about a serious risk  and could be modified  including by reducing the stringency of elements  in response to new information   Compliance  Civil money penalties would apply for violation of an element of a REMS  Civil money penalties would apply for violation of an element of a REMS  Resources  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  This subtitle increases user fee revenue by  50 million over the agreement between industry and the FDA to fund drug safety activities  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  This subtitle increases user fee revenue by  50 million over the agreement between industry and the FDA to fund drug safety activities  Subtitle BReagan Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration  Subtitle B establishes a foundation to lead collaborations amongst the FDA  academic research institutions  and industry directed to supporting the FDAs mission   Collaborative research projects will be selected that are designed to bolster R  D productivity  provide new tools for improving safety in regulated product evaluation  and in the long term make regulated product development and safety more predictable and manageable  The Foundation will be financially supported by industry and philanthropic donated funds   Subtitle CClinical Trials  To enhance patient enrollment and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  the data bank at ClinicalTrials gov will be expanded to include all phase II and later trials  and to include devices  Currently  only clinical trials of drugs for serious and life threatening conditions are required to register in the data bank  In addition  to ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information  results information would be added to this database  Information would be added only after the product in question has been approved or cleared for marketing  Results information would first come from existing FDA and NIH documents  as well as peer reviewed scientific publications  A negotiated rulemaking process would be used to determine when and how to add results information not captured under those conditions   Subtitle DConflicts of Interest  Subtitle D requires disclosure of conflicts of interest of advisory committee members prior to an advisory committee meeting  and greater efforts by FDA to identify and recruit members of advisory committees   Title IIIMedical Device User Fees  Title III is reflective of the agreement between FDA and industry regarding the total list of issues within their agreement from the time of the publication of the Federal Register notice  Given that some of the submitted language does not track the intent of the agreement  we expect to provide further improvements to the language at a later date  Those improvements will be agreed to by both FDA and industry  Per the agreement between FDA and industry  it establishes an overall amount of  287 M of user fees over five years  with  48 M in 2008  This is coupled with a fixed 8 5  annual increase  with no other adjustors  and a further reduction of fees for small business   Title III also includes the FDA industry proposal on third party inspection improvements to ensure that the program works more efficiently and clarifying that entities can register and list electronically   Title IV  Pediatric Medical Products Subtitle A  Best Pharmaceuticals for Children  Subtitle A would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe for pediatric populations  BPCA generally provides six months of additional exclusivity to drug manufactures to encourage the determination of safety and efficacy of drugs in pediatric populations  The bill contains an incentive of three months of additional exclusivity if US sales of the active moiety by the innovator and its affiliates exceed  1 billion annually at the time written request for study is issued  The bill is a five year authorization and will expire in 2012  No PDUFA funds can be used for BPCA studies  The Secretary may send declined requests for study to the NIH Foundation if funds are available   Subtitle B  Pediatric Research Improvement  Subtitle B would reauthorize the Pediatric Research Equity Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe for pediatric populations  In order to improve coordination with the pediatric exclusivity provisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  BPCA   PRIA would consolidate an internal FDA committee to review all issues of pediatric related labeling and assessments  Doing so ensures that a drug that falls under PRIA or BPCA is reviewed not only by experts for that particular drug  but experts with pediatric expertise  PRIA will sunset in tandem with BPCA in 2012  If a company chooses not to pursue pediatric exclusivity for an already marketed drug under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  and no study is performed through NIH  then the Secretary has the authority to require the submission of pediatric data for such drug  PRIA streamlines this process and helps get essential pediatric data for important drugs  while preserving the ability of companies to meet and discuss testing with the agency  The bill would require two reports  one from the Institute of Medicine and one from the GAO  that would allow us to have better data on the number and ways in which the pediatric rule is used  and evaluate its contributions to ensuring overall pediatric drug safety   Subtitle C   Pediatric Medical Devices  Subtitle C modifies the existing humanitarian device exemption  HDE  for medical devices to allow profit for HDE approved devices specifically designed to meet a  pediatric need  Maintains existing requirement that a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and diagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4 000 individuals in the U S  per year  No profit will be allowed for a device used in more than 4 000 individuals  The HDE exemption expansion sunsets in 2013 and a GAO report assessing the HDE exemption expansion and its impact on patients and manufacturers is required   The FDAs Office of Pediatric Therapeutics will acquire enhanced authority to collaborate with NIH  AHRQ  and subject matter experts in order to assess pediatric device RD needs  Demonstration grants  with tracked results  will be established for non profit consortia to promote pediatric device development  manufacture and distribution  The bill grants explicit authority to the FDAs Pediatric Advisory Committee to monitor pediatric devices and make recommendations for improving their availability and safety  This approach incorporates several recommendations of the Institute of Medicine including improving the postmarket surveillance of medical devices used in children and expanding public access to postmarket studies of pediatric medical devices    For those drugs that have a REMS  the REMS will always include the FDA approved professional labeling and a timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS  Civil money penalties
