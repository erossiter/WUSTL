                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi  Crandall Canyon investigation must be thorough  non political Urges patience  not a legislative quick fix October 2  2007       Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said that the investigation of the tragedy at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah should be thorough and non political  and urged lawmakers to resist the temptation to enact quick fix legislation before that investigation is complete   The Crandall Canyon Mine tragedy deserves a thorough  non political investigation  and appropriate action if warranted  Enzi said  We must determine how this accident could have been avoided  and how the rescue efforts could have been better managed  We can honor those whose lives have been lost by acting to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated   However  no tragedy should become an opportunity for political posturing  Not every accident will require legislative action  so we must wait until all the facts are in before we determine what course to take  Enzi delivered his comments at todays HELP Committee hearing titled Recent Mine Safety Disasters  Issues and Challenges  Several family members of those who lost their lives at Crandall Canyon attended the hearing  A tragedy like Crandall Canyon has a profound impact on the loved ones of those whose lives have been lost  Enzi said  My wife and I send our prayers and sympathies out to all of them  especially the families here today  Enzi said that there is an understandable  but not always productive  tendency among those involved in regulating the mining industry to react to the last accident with significant fatalities prematurely  rather than taking a wider view of best practices and learning from every accident  fatal or not  He noted that one of the goals of the MINER Act  Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act   the bipartisan legislation passed last year under Senator Enzis Chairmanship  was to break that cycle   The MINER Act stands for individual  mine based accident prevention instead of a one size fits all approach  Enzi said  With that law  we required that every mine become as best prepared as possible for an accident  We raised the standards for rescue teams  breathable air  communications technology and seals  among other things  and sought to turn the power of American inventiveness toward creating improved mine communication and rescue technology   Enzi emphasized that the MINER Act has been in place only 16 months  and some of its provisions have not yet become effective  He urged his colleagues to allow experts to investigate the Crandall Canyon tragedy thoroughly before considering new legislation  The MINER Act was the first major revision of the Mine Safety and Health Act in 28 years  I believe it is appropriate to wait at least 28 months and allow the law to be fully implemented before changing it       Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions October 2  2007 HELP COMMITTEE HEARING ON RECENT MINE SAFETY DISASTERS  ISSUES AND CHALLENGES   I want to thank Chairman Kennedy for holding this hearing  Like all Americans  I am saddened that we are here again  discussing another tragic mining accident  In Crandall Canyon  Utah  6 miners are presumed dead  and 3 rescue team professionals who risked their lives to save them are also lost  And in my home state of Wyoming just a few days ago  a 17 year veteran in the underground trona mines lost his life when the vehicle he was operating overturned  Id like to express my condolences to his family and the mining community there in Green River   Every mining accident has a profound impact on the loved ones of those whose lives have been lost  Our prayers and sympathies go out to all of them  Every mining accident of the magnitude of Crandall Canyon demands thorough investigation  and appropriate action against anyone found culpable  The investigation and law enforcement efforts  if any  must be carried out by those with the expertise and authority to do so  Every mining accident must be an occasion for us to learn  and to change if necessary  We honor those whose lives have been lost best when we act to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated  Every mining accident should not  however  become an opportunity for political posturing  Likewise  while every mining accident should be a learning experience  not every mining accident will require legislative action   In Wyoming  we are blessed with many natural resources and mining is a major source of employment  So it is very important to me that we do all we can here in the HELP Committee to keep mining as safe as it can be and to improve conditions wherever and whenever we can  In the case of Crandall Canyon  once all the facts are known and once the experts have fully analyzed the situation  we will then have an accurate picture of what may have gone wrong  This factual picture should be the guide for any future action   There is an understandable  but not always productive  tendency among those involved in regulating the mining industry to prematurely react to the last accident with significant fatalities  rather than taking a wider view of best practices and learning from every accident  fatal or not  One of the goals of the MINER Act  the bipartisan legislation Senators Kennedy  Rockefeller  Byrd  Isakson  Murray and I drafted last year and which was enacted  was to break that cycle   The MINER Act stands for individual mine based accident prevention instead of a one size fits all approach  With that law  we required that every mine become as best prepared as possible for an accident  We raised the standards for rescue teams  breathable air  communications technology and seals  among other things  and sought to turn the power of American inventiveness toward creating improved mine communication and rescue technology   The MINER Act is a law we can all be proud of  It has been in place a scant 16 months  and some of its provisions have not yet become effective  Yet some are proposing that Congress amend the mining laws again  This is something we should look at very closely  The legislative proposals some are trying to connect to the Crandall Canyon tragedy actually would have done nothing to prevent that accident  and relate not at all to high cover mining  retreat mining techniques  seismic activity or other issues raised by that tragedy   I would also like to bring to the Committees attention an article in the New York Times last week  They sent a reporter to Huntington  Utah to cover a meeting of the state Mine Safety Commission  The reporter wrote that every miner in attendance opposed new laws and believed current regulations were not inadequate  So that is the view of miners there in Utah  according to the New York Times  One of the reasons I am so proud of the MINER Act is that we wrote it in the way I believe all legislation should be drafted  We brought in all of the stakeholders  the union  the industry  the safety experts  MSHA  and we sat them all around the table and worked through the biggest safety concerns and the best way to approach them  MINER was the first major revision of the Mine Safety and Health Act in 28 years  I believe it is appropriate to wait at least 28 months before going into the statute again  That is not to say that there will not be lessons from Crandall Canyon that may require changes  However  most changes in this highly technical area should be accomplished by the safety experts both inside and outside of government that deal with these complex matters on a daily basis  We should listen to those experts to inform our decision about whether a change in the law is warranted  This is an area in which the experts should lead  and we should make sure the way is clear for them to do so   In that regard Id note that this Committees current work on the MINER Act itself is still not done  This committee significantly enhanced the mission of the Office of Mine Safety and Health within NIOSH and I believe we are all very anxious to follow up on their research into wireless two way communications and tracking devices that might actually work in most underground mines  They are also exploring breathable air apparatus that will last longer  be less cumbersome for miners  and be safer to operate  I am pleased to see Dr  Jeffery Kohler from NIOSH here today  I have invited the mining experts there at NIOSH to come and brief me on the state of the testing and research they are conducting  Just how far away are we from wireless two way communications systems that can really work on a consistent basis  Of course  any of my Committee colleagues that are also interested in these questions are welcome to join in that briefing   Additionally  the Committee is awaiting reports on the belt air technical review panel and on mine refuge chambers  The rescue team provisions from the MINER Act must be finalized by regulation before the end of the year  but there have been concerns raised in some states that have state rescue teams that the new rules may be problematic  The HELP Committee has a responsibility to ensure that the MINER Acts provisions are properly carried out so that they fulfill the promise we have made to miners  I hope we will do that  Following the Crandall Canyon tragedy Chairman Miller in the House and our own Chairman made it clear that they would initiate an aggressive oversight effort into what went wrong  Chairman Kennedy and I asked the Dept of Labor Inspector General to investigate MSHAs actions at Crandall Canyon before and after the accident  and Im glad to say that review is underway  The Secretary of Labor has also initiated an independent review by mining experts and the state of Utah has established a review panel  But these are not the only investigations going on  There are 6 official investigations into the Crandall Canyon accident  and by some counts as many as 8  Majority Committee staff in both chambers are running separate and overlapping investigations  making extensive document requests of private citizens and state agencies  issuing subpoenas  questioning witnesses before MSHA has a chance to question them  and making multiple trips to the accident site  The Department of Labors Solicitor has issued a warning that such committee activities could easily compromise MSHAs investigation and pleaded with Congress not to jeopardize MSHAs ability to hold those who may have violated the law accountable   Let me make it clear  I want to understand what went wrong and learn from this accident as much as anyone  But I believe that the best way to accomplish that goal is to allow experts to review these highly technical issues and issue reports  Based on these reports  Congress should determine whether there was misconduct by federal agencies or mine operators and ensure that proper actions are taken  These multiple  overlapping investigations simply complicate the picture  delay results  add an unnecessary level of combativeness into the situation  and they cost a lot of money  When we are talking about protecting miners lives  it is certainly not something we put a price tag on  But the worst of the duplicitous investigations are not really targeted at protecting lives  they are about scoring political points  And the cost of this misuse will be taken out of the MSHA resources that really do protect miners lives   Colleagues  we have established an Office of Inspector General for the Labor Department that has 423 employees and a budget of  71 million taxpayer dollars  They are investigating at our behest  and they have the access  expertise and staff necessary to conduct this investigation  Quite frankly  Congressional Committees do not  Lets allow the IG to perform their role and stop diverting resources away from MSHAs fundamental functions  We may be just one of the committees currently conducting this sort of oversight  but we could set an example for the others   Finally  I would like to point out another important responsibility this Committee has towards miners  One I hope we will be able to keep  The Mine Safety and Health Review Commission  MSHRC  is an independent agency which acts as a lower court for questions of law and regulation under the Mine Safety and Health Act  This Commission is especially import now as many of the MINER Act provisions which will better protect miners are going into effect and facing challenges  Yet the 5 member Commission is 2 members short and will lose a third by the end of the year  With only two members  it will be unable to make any rulings  but will still spend appropriations    Two nominees for the Commission have been pending before the Committee since January with no activity  I hope that we will move these nominations and ensure that the Commission is able to act to enforce our mining safety and health laws   Clearly  there is much this Committee can do for miners  The Crandall Canyon tragedy should certainly redouble our commitment to this agenda  Let us honor those miners and all miners by focusing on real ways to improve miner safety  not just chasing headlines                                                         October
