terrorist attack anniversary   September 11  2006  Five years ago we saw the face of evil cross our shores as a band of terrorists took control of four planes and used our own technology against us to kill thousands of our fellow citizens  Plotting in secrecy and under the cover of darkness  in caves in the remote hills of Afghanistan  these terrorists planned to kill as many Americans as they could  destroying some carefully selected buildings that  to them  symbolized our nation and our unique way of life  We all remember that day with great clarity and we will never forget where we were and what we were doing when we heard the news  a plane had crashed into one of the     Trade    Towers in what appeared to be a tragic accident  Then  a second plane struck the other Tower  It was then clear that this was no accident  We were under attack   We all remember that day with great clarity and we will never forget where we were and what we were doing when we heard the news  a plane had crashed into one of the Trade Towers in what appeared to be a tragic accident Then  a second plane struck the other Tower It was then clear that this was no accident We were under attack    In the moments that followed a nation looked on in horror as we saw the face of bravery and courage under fire as the men and women of New Yorks police and fire departments responded to the attack in    New York   They battled long and hard  against the odds  to come to the aid of those who were trapped in the towers  Sadly  in the effort to save those who were in desperate trouble  many of those first responders were also trapped in the Towers as they weakened  and ultimately collapsed   As we watched events continue to unfold in    New York   we heard reports that another plane had hit the Pentagon and caused a considerable amount of damage to the building and claimed the lives of many of those who were working there  Then came the news that a fourth plane had crashed in a lonely field in   Pennsylvania   Suddenly the attack took on massive proportions as we looked with fear and trepidation to the skies and wondered if there were more planes headed for additional targets throughout the country    In the days that followed  the story behind the events became clear  The attack was orchestrated by a terrorist group that was led by Osama bin Laden  Three planes had hit their targets  The passengers on the fourth  made aware of the fate of the other three planes by friends and loved ones on their cell phones  had launched their own attack on the hijackers and they were able to take control of the plane and stop the hijackers from using it to destroy another landmark and kill more Americans in a crowded city  The brave men and women on that flight had sacrificed their own lives so that others might be spared   Those are the bare details  a brief outline of some of what happened that day  It was a day that had a great impact on every American  and it hit us all on a deeply personal level  Ask anyone and you will see that we all have our own story  our own recollection of what happened on September 11 and what it meant to us  We arent unique in that  The    Trade    Center was a global marketplace  so people from all over the world also have their own story to tell about that day  especially those who lost friends and loved ones in the attacks on the     Trade    Center and the Pentagon    When it is written  history will make it clear that September 11 was more than an American tragedy  It was the beginning of a global nightmare   It has now been five years since the day the Towers fell and with the passage of time has come study after study  investigations  and other attempts to make some sense of everything that happened that day  There were failures of some systems to work at their peak efficiency  and there were warnings that  with hindsight  should have been handled differently  The important thing now is not to place blame and point fingers  but to ensure we are fully and adequately protected so we dont have to experience another September 11   As I prepared my remarks for this day  I thought about my young grandson  now three years old  He is a wonderful addition to my life and he continues to give me an added perspective to the events I see on the news every night  I know someday he will ask me about that day  When he does  I hope I am able to find the right words to explain to him about the courage and the bravery of all those who worked so hard to try to save the lives of those who were in danger that day  I hope I can help him understand the reasons why our brave service men and women are fighting on the front lines of the war on terror to keep him safe  It wont be easy for his is a world of peace and innocence and far removed from the hatred that drove the events of that day   Still  no matter what I tell him  I know he will ask me why these things happen  His Grampa will tell him that this is a world full of so many good things  like his parents who love him so very dearly  and the things he loves to do  like go fishing with his Grampa  Unfortunately  its also a world where people preach anger and hatred and try to harm people they dont even know   If its a hard lesson for us to learn  you can imagine how difficult it will be for a small child  How to talk to our children about September 11 was a problem when it happened  and it will continue to be so as we work to put an end to terrorism around the globe  wherever it exists   Ultimately  that will be the legacy of September 11  We were cruelly attacked on that day  by a group that underestimated our resolve as a nation and our will as individuals to right the great wrong that had been done to us  Today  five years later  we stand united  still strongly committed to putting an end to the threat of terrorism  wherever it appears  We didnt start this battle  but our Armed Forces will  once again  put an end to it   Five years ago the world stood still  and it was changed forever  The ripples begun on September 11 continue to have repercussions that draw us back to that day almost constantly  As we remember the events of that dark  sad day  we pause to remember all those who lost their lives  especially their families and their loved ones  Our thoughts and prayers are constantly with you  We remember the fireman  police and rescue squads who responded to the sites of the attacks and performed with great bravery  The concern they showed for others and the sacrifices they made to try to save anyone they could will never be forgotten  And  we remember our servicemen and women who stand guard around the world  defending our precious freedoms and our way of life  We owe them all a debt we will never be able to repay for the sacrifices they continue to make on our behalf    Today we rededicate ourselves to the work that must be done to make our nation stronger  safer and more secure so that our world will be a better place for us all to live  It will be difficult and it will require us all to play a part in the effort to rid the world of the threat of terror  It will ultimately be the legacy we will leave to those who will follow us    a world in which everyone is able to live in peace and freedom and without fear  I yield the floor                                                         September 2006 News
