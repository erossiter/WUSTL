                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi cosponsors bill to support community pharmacists  enhance new prescription drug benefits for seniors   April 6  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  has joined colleagues to introduce a bill supporting community pharmacists now adjusting to the new Medicare prescription drug benefit by ensuring they are reimbursed as quickly as possible and by guaranteeing beneficiaries have access to local pharmacists    Enzi and cosponsors Senator Thad Cochran  R Miss   and Senator Jim Talent  R Mo   introduced the Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare Act Thursday     Pharmacists are on the front lines of a revolutionary change in Medicare that is bringing long overdue prescription drug benefits to our seniors  Enzi said  I strongly support our community pharmacists and I realize they face challenges as they help implement the most significant improvement to Medicare since its inception in 1965  This bill will protect the valuable role that pharmacists play in communities across the country by ensuring pharmacists are reimbursed as quickly as possible and guarantying beneficiaries have access to local pharmacists  Supporting our community pharmacists with the assistance provided under this bill will ensure seniors continue to get the prescription drugs they need      Over the past few months Enzi has spent many days in Wyoming talking with seniors from Cheyenne to Sheridan to Rock Springs and communities in between about the new drug program and also learning about the role of pharmacists in implementing it  The Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare Act responds to many of the concerns outlined by Wyoming constituents and community pharmacists by including provisions to      ensure prompt payment to community pharmacists   Because community pharmacists do not have the negotiating leverage necessary to ensure they are reimbursed often enough to keep a positive cash flow   some are being reimbursed only every 45 days  this provision would specify that the Medicare prescription drug plans reimburse pharmacists every 14 days      restrict co branding on Medicare prescription drug cards   Since some Medicare prescription drug plans have established joint marketing programs with large  chain pharmacies  many seniors have assumed that their new benefits can only be accessed through those large chain pharmacies  This bill will eliminate such marketing tactics and encourage seniors to use whatever pharmacy they prefer  whether its their small  independent community pharmacy or a chain drug store      modify medication therapy management services available to seniors   In order to save seniors money on their prescriptions and to promote safe use of prescription drugs  the bill would modify federal medication therapy management services after The Wyoming PharmAssist Program  which directly connects patients with registered pharmacists to review their medications for possible drug interactions and duplications    Floor Statement Senator Michael B  Enzi Introduction of the Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare Act Medication Therapy Management Services Bill  Mr  President  I rise to introduce the Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare Act  I have enjoyed working closely with Chairman Cochran and Senator Talent on this bill that will help protect the valuable role that pharmacists play in our communities    I have spent a lot of time over the past few months traveling around my home state of Wyoming talking to seniors about the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  This new voluntary benefit represents the most significant improvement to Medicare since its inception in 1965  Because of this new benefit  more seniors have prescription drug coverage and are able to purchase the medicines they need  Since the benefit took effect on January 1  2006  17 700 beneficiaries in Wyoming have signed up for prescription drug coverage and 27 million beneficiaries nationwide have drug coverage  I encourage all beneficiaries to enroll in a prescription drug plan before May 15  2006   I strongly support our community pharmacists  The changeover to Medicare Part D hasnt been easy and has produced several obstacles they have had to deal with as they have worked to serve Medicare beneficiaries  In traveling around my state over the past few months  I have talked to a few pharmacists who mentioned a few key problems they are facing with this new Medicare program that I believe we should address    The first is an issue of cash flow management  As the only accountant in the United States Senate  I understand this problem  Most pharmacists have to pay their wholesalers like clockwork two times a month  but they are not receiving their reimbursement from the prescription drug plans in a similar timely fashion  This bill changes that  The bill states that plans have to reimburse all clean claims every 14 days  The bill also facilitates a quicker reimbursement by specifying that claims submitted electronically shall be paid by electronic transfer of funds  This is a small change in the law that I believe will play a large role in helping ease the transition to the new program for our local and community pharmacists    The second issue I have heard about is called co branding  Some of the prescription drug plans have partnered with some of the larger pharmacies and the plans are putting pharmacy logos on the benefit cards the beneficiaries use to get their prescriptions filled  Some people have told me that this is very confusing  because beneficiaries think that they must go to the pharmacy listed on the card  My bill says that co branding is no longer allowed and all newly issued cards will not have pharmacy logos on them    The final thing this bill does is expand upon what was in the Medicare bill that passed in 2003 regarding medication therapy management programs  I am pleased to say that Wyoming is ahead of the curve in this area  A few years ago  the Wyoming Department of Health partnered with the University of Wyoming to provide a service called Wyoming PharmAssist  which directly connects patients with registered pharmacists to review their medications for possible drug interactions and duplications  I was pleased to learn that this service is more advanced than systems in other states  providing patients with ways to reduce their monthly medication costs while improving safety  The Wyoming PharmAssist program can save clients  152 per month and  1 844 a year  Wyoming PharmAssist pays registered pharmacists for these unique services and is a model for the nation  My bill tries to make the Federal program more like the very successful program in Wyoming    I commend all the pharmacists across the country who are working so hard to make this new Medicare program work  They are getting life saving drugs to seniors who may not have been able to afford them before  I am proud to say I voted for this program back in 2003 and I am pleased with all the progress we are making    Mr  President  I believe the Senate operates under what I call the 80 20 rule  80 percent of the things that get done around here are non contentious issues with support from both parties  The other 20 percent are the contentious issues that we seem to spend all our time talking about  I think this bill falls into the 80 percent category  This is a small bill that will do a lot of good for our pharmacists  It has wide support and I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley to help move this bill through his Committee    I invite my colleagues to join me and Senators Cochran and Talent as sponsors of this bill to allow pharmacists to continue to provide the best quality care for seniors and the disabled who rely on them for their medications   I ask that the text of the bill following my statement be placed in the Record   I thank the Chair  and I yield the floor                                                         April 2006 News Releases           Browse by
