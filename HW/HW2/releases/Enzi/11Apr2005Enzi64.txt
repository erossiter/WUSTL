                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi goes to Iraq  meets Wyoming soldiers as part of Middle East  Africa trip  April 11  2005 Washington  D C   During the first week of the March 2005 Congressional work period U S  Sen  Mike Enzi traveled more than a thousand miles in Wyoming meeting with residents  During the second and final week he traveled thousands of miles to and through Africa and the Middle East where he also met with Wyoming residents in addition to world leaders     The Wyoming residents Sen  Enzi met with overseas are serving our country in Iraq as part of the U S  armed forces  The senator also met with military officials and Iraqi leaders in Fallujah and Tikrit before traveling to Ethiopia  Uganda  Tanzania and Turkey    Sen  Enzi kept an informal journal during his overseas trip where he tells of candy bombs  Iraqi troop training  palaces  AIDS  Sept  11  eucalyptus forests  child abduction  prayer and more      Iraq  Jordan  Ethiopia  Uganda  Tanzania  Turkey trip report   U S  Sen  Mike Enzi    March 29 April 2  2005  Tuesday  March 29th Senator Inhofe and his wife Kay  Congressman Boozman  pronounced like Bozeman MT  and his wife Cathy  Diana and I left for Jordan  Wendy Gnehm who is my expert on military and foreign affairs issues was also on the trip as well as staff for the other members and trip coordinators  We were in seven countries in five days which included a day each way to get there and back to the U S  We were in two of the countries twice  three cities in Iraq  and two cities in Uganda  We dont get to see much of any country  but meet many of the leaders of each country     On the way  we stopped for an hour in Ireland to refuel  We arrived in Jordan at 6 30 am after 20 hours of travel  counting time changes   The two senators  the congressman and those staff with security clearances were transferred to a C 130 cargo plane and flown to Baghdad  Halfway there the pilots  engineer  navigator and quartermaster put on flack jackets with armor and helmets  We were in a holding pattern for over an hour before we could land  We taxied a couple of miles after we were on the ground  Once off the plane  we were fitted with chest armor that felt like it was made of concrete     All day  we were loaded in separate vehicles and climbed into separate helicopters  We flew to Fallujah where the greatest insurgency has been  We flew low enough we had to go up and then back down to get over power lines  My helicopter had two door gunners who kept aiming their weapons at potential targets  Two gunships flew on either side of us  We flew over Abu Ghraib prison  see right  which was attacked by insurgents three days after we were in the area  Forty four U S  troops were wounded in that attack    At Camp Fallujah  we were loaded into Humvees  The driver explained how the convoy would work and gave safety instructions  The bullet proof windows had to be up at all times  he didn t explain the bullet hole in the front windshield   In case the vehicle died I had to reach the tow strap behind me so we could hook up and be jerked out of the situation  I was shown where the anti tank gun was so I could hand that to the gunner in the turret and was shown how to pass ammunition canisters to him if he started shooting   We drove to the mess hall and met with Marines from Wyoming  I had a pleasant lunch with CPL Dustin Houghton of Powell  LCPL David Dudrey of Cheyenne and CPL Abram Hansen of Lander   see left  The mess hall had good food and variety  Its great to see the dedication and enthusiasm they showed     The base has hundreds of eight foot tall concrete barriers and miles of 10 foot high dirt berms to protect the soldiers on base at the various work and maintenance sites    We got back in the Humvees and rode into the center of town  The damage to buildings was very evident   see right  Resistance forces should see why there is relatively little loss of life by U S  troops  Hiding in a building and waiting for a target was not healthy for the enemy  Our troops did not have to enter the building to clear it of enemy     We went to secured buildings and met with Fallujah community leaders  We met with an Imam  two tribal Shieks  the person who was deputy mayor from before the battle  and the Iraqi police general  They welcomed us in the name of Allah  the one God  They mentioned several times that they did not approve of the insurgents and could not get them to leave and were glad the U S  was able to get them  They laid out their complaints  The Iraqi government had only provided  100 million of the  495 million they assessed they would need for the reconstruction  They mentioned the need for the completion of the electrical  water and sewage projects the U S  is providing  They did seem to indicate those were coming along on schedule  They asked that no women be held as detainees while assuring that the women would not be dangerous  The general updated us on the training efforts of Iraqis to replace American troops  It was encouraging     We reloaded into the Humvees and went back to the main base where we were shown the evolution of vehicle armor  their mobile fast change tire shop  see left   and the special Humvee engine change out mobile equipment operation   see below  We were given a demonstration of the new Marine medic blood coagulation chemical that takes the water out of the blood and clots a femoral artery in about 15 seconds  The army isn t using it yet because their doctors don t like the heat it generates or the grit left in the wound  The Marines believe it saves lives     We helicoptered to Tikrit  birthplace of Saddam and town where he was hiding when captured  On the way there  the helo crew  when they saw a lot of children near farms would drop out a soccer ball and a candy bomb  a bag filled with candy bars   We saw a lot of excavations done with a backhoe  Pits were dug to 30 feet deep down a ramp  Their shallow water table then hits water that is used to irrigate and turn the desert into green crop land  We also saw dirt walled gun emplacements built by the Iraqis to protect Tikrit  They didn t work    Our briefing was in a beautiful palace built by Saddam for one of his daughters The ceilings were intricately carved  Walls  stairs  bannisters and floors were of exquisite marble   see left  Once again we learned how the violence from insurgents dropped off dramatically since the elections  One police station had been bombed and 10 people were killed  Twenty Iraqis were wounded  They were immediately replaced by family members who see the importance of their freedom  Insurgents had expected to end policing  Tikrit is also the heart of the Sunni s who are now regretful that they did not vote   but it should be noted that a Sunni was elected governor and lieutenant  They are going to be included in the new government     I had dinner with two career troops from Cheyenne  SSGT Gregory Rivera and SSGT Robert Stebbins   see right  We figured out that I probably coached youth soccer against SSGT Rivera  who played for the Cheyenne Sting when he was a kid  They gave me a rundown on a typical day   although a war zone is not typical     We heloed back to Baghdad  got on a different C130 and flew back to Amman  Jordan  We climbed back onto our plane and flew to Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  After clearing customs we got a police escort to our hotel  I thought there must be a curfew since we didn t see another car the whole 22 miles   but it probably was because it was 3 a m     In Ethiopia we met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi  We emphasized the need for Africa to form five brigades to stop African insurgencies against democracies  We were able to offer training  I spoke of HIV AIDS and U S  support  I congratulated their First Lady as well as our Ambassador  Aurelia Brazeal for their leadership on being publicly tested for AIDS to remove some of the stigma and to encourage testing  I helped draft the AIDS assistance bill and I always emphasized that part of any discussion     We went to the offices of the African Union  the confederation of African countries  We had a lengthy discussion with Chairperson Alpha oumar Konare  former President of Mali  about African goals and coordination     We had a lunch with the Ethiopian Parliament Prayer Breakfast group   The Inhofes went to see the place where their adopted granddaughter had been found after being abandoned and almost dead  She was nursed back to health by a couple we met and then Senator Inhofe s daughter adopted her  The Inhofes are welcomed as African grandparents    At that same time  Congressman Boozman and I went up the mountain for a wreath laying at the memorial for our 911 tragedy   see left  September 10 happens to be their new year  To get to the memorial we drove up a four wheel drive mountain  We noticed lots of women carrying big bundles of sticks and leaves on their back coming down the mountain  We learned that eucalyptus trees have been taking over their mountains  The trees are green all year which means they drink water all year and take nutrients out of the soil  All the springs on the mountain had dried up  They are cutting down all the eucalyptus trees and replacing them with indigenous trees   and the springs are coming back  Women make four trips a day to the top of the mountain and carry down 40 pound  eight foot long bundles to sell for eight Birr  about  1 American  each load  That makes them very high in the economy but looking old before their time  Many are barefoot  None have substantial shoes  It was amazing and incomprehensible without seeing it  After a full day we flew to Entebbe  Uganda     On the plane and in the evenings we had notebooks to study for the next meetings  They include biographies of the people we will meet  maps and history of the country and other useful information     At the hotel  the power went off at irregular intervals     While Senator Inhofe met with President Musaveni  I hosted a prayer breakfast with their Parliament Prayer Breakfast Group   see right  I talked about our weekly meeting  how we proceed  our prayer list that provides for each of us to pray by name for each senator and spouse  It is set up so we pray for 1 5 each weekday  so all are covered each week with the premise that you can t pray for someone by name and then do evil to him or her  I talked about the Thomas Jefferson Bible that just covers the teachings of Jesus  The teachings of Jesus are recognized by all major religions and are uniting principles with no violence     We boarded the plane with several people from Uganda and our embassy  We flew to Gulu  Uganda  the site of many children abductions by the Lord s Resistance Army  LRA    see lower left  The children are then forced to kill brutally to desensitize them and then become the army  The girls abducted are given as prizes to the commanders  The girls often have babies and contract AIDS  We visited a facility that reconditions the children when they escape or are freed when their captors are captured  We saw the freed combatants and the young girls who are already mothers  We met the three U S  college students who made people aware of the plight by filming it in a documentary called The Invisible Children that we had watched   see right  Man s inhumanity to man is unbelievable   even after you see and hear about it     We flew the government people back to Entebbe and flew on to Tanzania  We were greeted by several of the people Diana and I had met on our previous Madagascar prayer trip  We met with the defense minister  then the leader of the opposition party  then the foreign minister who also happens to be the front runner to be the next president  We finished with a meeting with the Parliament Prayer Group and boarded the plane for the seven hour flight to Turkey   another very full day  We had breakfast with the troops  Lieutenant Michael Meek of Cowley  left  and Nikki Murphy of Cheyenne  right      Ambassador Eric Edelman provided a Turkey briefing   see lower left  He is being appointed by the President to the Dept  of Defense  Ambassador Edelmans mannerisms remind me of Vice President Cheney    A novel about us invading Turkey for the borax mines then Turks coming to the US to blow up DC and NY is a best seller and concern of the Turks  Mein Kampf is being sold in huge quantities for just  3  Its possible its sale is being subsidized in Turkey     We need to keep arrangements so the kids from other countries can keep going to college in the U S  They become advocates of democracy and their parents form a better understanding too  Its a future investment as well      Turkey is a secular democracy with a majority of citizens who are Muslim  They are not an Islamic republic which would mean a Khomeni fundamentalist type country     Incirlik AFB  We received a strategic briefing and had a tour of the base while we were waiting for the air crew to be rested to fly us home  We flew from Turkey to Ireland where we refueled and then went on to the U S  arriving late Saturday night  April 2
