                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi opposes unfunded federal mandates  supports private market solutions already in place  February 13  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today noted that proposed legislation requiring employers to provide paid sick leave would be a massive unfunded mandate on employers that could easily cost small and large businesses tens of billions of dollars  Labor market competition has already resulted in employers establishing a wide array of paid leave plans  insurance programs  paid time off policies  sick leave banks and other human resource options  Enzi said at a HELP Committee hearing titled The Healthy Families Act  Safeguarding Americans Livelihood  Families and Health with Paid Sick Days  The question is  should the federal government mandate one costly  inflexible approach to employee benefits  an approach that will be an administrative and logistical nightmare for many employers  at the expense of all the other good things that employers are already doing  And I think the answer to that question is a resounding No  If the goal of this bill is to promote healthier families  why not support legislation that will get more working families insured  as the bipartisan Small Business Health Plan bill I introduced last year would do if adopted  That initiative will make Americas working families healthier by allowing small businesses and associations to band together and buy into health plan coverage at better rates  If I were one of the 46 million uninsured Americans  Im certain that putting health insurance within reach of my familys budget would be my choice over more days off work   Todays hearing focused on a Democrat proposal that would establish a rigid federal mandate requiring employers with 15 or more employees to give all employees 7 days of paid family and medical leave  The mandate would cover part timers  as well as those with little or no seniority  The reasons for leave under the proposal are extremely broad  the checks on potential abuse are few  and the paid leave would be divisible into increments as small as a few minutes   By some estimates this bill will affect roughly 45 million workers  The legislation requires up to 56 hours of paid sick time per employee  and the average hourly non supervisory  non farm wage is right around  17 per hour  As a result  the average cost exposure of the proposed legislation for each full time employee is nearly a thousand dollars  Even if one adjusts the pool of the approximately 45 million workers that would be affected to allow for part timers  the cost exposure here is plainly in the tens of billions of dollars   The money necessary to pay those increased costs must come from somewhere  Enzi said  The pool of available labor dollars is not infinite  and when we mandate their expenditure for a specific purpose  we always run the risk of unintended consequence  A dollar that must be spent here  often results in a dollar that will not be spent elsewhere  Imagine the irony for an employee who is granted sick leave under this bill  but whose employer decides to eliminate or reduce health plan benefits   Enzi noted that the legislation lacks definitional precision  adequate safeguards against abuse  and due recognition of  or provisions to counter  its disruptive impact on affected businesses  In fact  the legislative language is so open ended as to arguably create a federal mandate of 56 hours of paid time off to be used as an employee wishes  and in such increments as the employee wishes   All across the country  without any Congressional intervention  the operation of the labor market economics  and the voluntary cooperative efforts of employers and employees  are resulting in the establishment of leave policies that meet their unique needs  Enzi said  This bill throws good will out the window and abandons free markets and innovation in favor another Big Government  one size fits all mandate that will only compound existing problems   Statement of Michael B  Enzi  Ranking Member  Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions February 13  2007  HELP COMMITTEE HEARING ON THE HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT I want to thank the Chairman for holding this hearing and I also want to thank the panel for their willingness to participate in this important dialogue   Anyone who works for a living is keenly aware of the time demands that work imposes  The task of balancing work and family life is never easy  and when illness compounds the situation  the challenge becomes even greater  Most private sector employers are acutely aware of this reality and increasingly responsive to it   In the most recent member benefit survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management  86  of the respondents reported that their companies provided paid sick leave either under a separate sick leave program  or as part of a general paid time off plan  More than 80  also indicated that they provide both short term and long term disability insurance coverage  In addition  an increasing number utilize even more creative approaches such as paid time off  and sick leave banks  or pools   The more broadly based National Compensation Survey reveals that on an overall national basis 68  of full time employees have access to paid sick leave programs at work   Most employers make these provisions both because they know that a healthy workforce benefits their business  and  because they know that in a competitive labor market  such as the one we have right now  they must address this issue to attract and retain quality employees   Today  the average cost of employee benefits for all employers in the private sector is nearly  7 50 an hour  Average benefits now comprise nearly 30  of total payroll costs  That number has been increasing over the years  and such numbers support the importance that most employers attach to providing meaningful benefit packages  including provisions for illness related absences  for their employees   Despite these facts  however  some employees do not have paid sick leave available to them at their place of work because many of these individuals are part time employees and many work for smaller employers  Those small employers very often face the same cost squeeze and financial pressures that their own employees face  Many business owners view their employees as their own extended family  That is a fact that we need to always keep in mind as we discuss either wages or benefits and small business  We also must be aware that any additional requirements we place on small business may be the imposition of an unfunded employer mandate   Some estimates suggest that approximately 55 million private sector workers are without access to paid sick leave  The Health Families Act  as proposed  would extend paid sick leave benefits to all of those individuals except those that work for establishments with fewer than 15 employees which would cover roughly 45 million employees  The legislation requires up to 56 hours of paid sick time per employee   Currently  the average hourly wage is right around  17 00 per hour for non supervisory  non farm employees  Thus  the average cost exposure of the proposed legislation for each full time employee is nearly one thousand dollars  Even if we adjust the pool of the approximately 45 million workers to include part timer employees who have pro rata entitlements  the cost exposure here is clearly in the tens of billions of dollars   To extend this type of leave requirement to businesses  as is contemplated by the Healthy Families Act  would be little more than an unfunded mandate on small businesses throughout the country  In addition  this legislation represents only direct labor cost  and does not account for a myriad of other indirect costs  The money necessary to pay those increased costs must come from somewhere   Proponents of this legislation argue that the huge cost of this legislation would be offset by productivity savings gained from eliminating presenteeism which is called by some individuals the practice of less than healthy individuals coming to work  Presenteeism losses are  at best  highly speculative and subjective  Moreover  private sector human resource systems have traditionally shown the ability to adapt to economic reality  Put another way  businesses do not require federal mandates to instruct them how to operate more efficiently  productively and profitably  No matter how desirable a particular goal may be  one cannot simply dismiss the costs involved as unimportant or inconsequential  Here  the costs are decidedly not inconsequential  particularly for smaller businesses  The pool of available labor dollars is not infinite  and when we mandate their expenditure for a specific purpose  we always run the risk of unintended consequence  A dollar that must be spent here  often results in a dollar that will not be spent elsewhere  Imagine the irony for an employee who is granted sick leave under this bill  but whose employer decides to eliminate or reduce health plan benefits  If the end result this bill seeks is indeed healthier families  then I would also like to invite every member of this committee to work with me on small business health plan legislation  That initiative will make Americas working families healthier by allowing small businesses and associations to band together and buy into health plan coverage at better rates  Surely as we are rating the To Do list of the 110th Congress  increasing the number of insured Americans ranks higher than giving people days off who may not even have a health care provider to go to  I know if I were one of the 46 million uninsured Americans  I would think so   Obviously  increased benefits  like increased wages  enjoys universal popularity  However  we cannot even contemplate mandating such benefits in an economic or policy vacuum  We also need to bear in mind that Washington does not always have a monopoly on good ideas  and that whenever we act prescriptively  we also decrease flexibility and creativity  What works in one place of business may not work in another  and  what we inflexibly mandate may not be best for all   I also believe that our consideration of this legislative proposal must be informed by our experience with similar legislative initiatives  As some of you may recall last Congress  the HELP Committee held a Roundtable discussion on the Family and Medical Leave Act  During the course of that Roundtable we learned about many of the practical issues and problems associated with implementing that legislation  Id also note that the Department of Labor has recently solicited information from the public about many of these same issues   The Healthy Families Act  as it was introduced in the last Congress  while not an FMLA proposal  does import some of the practical problems associated with FMLA that have been repeatedly brought to our attention  Among those issues have been the practical problems associated with unanticipated  or intermittent leave  the issues associated with suspected abuse of leave entitlements  medical verification and privacy concerns  the existence of vague legislative terms and definitions  the issues related to the appropriate increments in which leave can be taken  and the incidence and costs of leave related litigation   These are not isolated or minor concerns  These concerns have not been raised in support of any claim that FMLA should be repealed  Quite to the contrary  virtually all the employers that have raised these concerns support FMLA  however  they believe it must be clarified in several important  real world respects  In a wide variety of instances this legislation borrows from FMLA  and imports  and even expands  many of these same real concerns to the proposed legislation  An appropriate first step would seem to be meaningfully addressing these very real issues in the context of our current laws before simply repeating them in new ones   Unfortunately  a review of this legislation replicates many of the practical problems we have witnessed with FMLA  and makes them even worse  The legislation lacks definitional precision  adequate safeguards against abuse  and due recognition of  or provisions to counter  its disruptive impact on affected businesses  The legislative language is extremely open ended as to arguably create a federal mandate of 56 hours of paid time off to be used as an employee wishes  and in such increments as the employee wishes   While I share the Chairmans concern for working families I am also concerned for the businesses  particularly the small businesses  which employ them  I also appreciate that as both a policy matter and a personal matter the achievement of an appropriate balance between work and family is a matter of great importance  However  these are complex problems and complex problems very often defy simple or universal solutions  I think we need to recognize this as we move forward  and also recognize that as simple and attractive as it may appear  we cannot solve all problems through legislative fiat without any regard to those that must pay the cost of the mandates we impose   Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing today  I look forward to hearing from all of our panelists and look to see how we can help employees and their families to be healthy while providing the flexibility and stability for our nations small businesses to build and grow their businesses with the goal towards hiring more workers                                                      February
