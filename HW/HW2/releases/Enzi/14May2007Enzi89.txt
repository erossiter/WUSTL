taxpayers where it hurts Enzi says President  s budget director right to issue appropriation veto warning May 14  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee  seconded the remarks of President Bushs budget director  who warned that the budget pushed through Congress by Senate and House Democrats  would sour federal spending bills   This budget is a one two punch that hits taxpayers squarely in the jaw  First it raises taxes  which blocks economic growth  Then it increases spending  which pushes our country deeper into debt  Enzi said  The President is right on the money  When the government is in the red the American people are in the red  I am thankful the President is taking a hard stand for taxpayers against the waste  fraud  abuse and duplication thats rolled up in this budget proposal  The Administration does not believe that the first step on the path to a balanced budget should be a substantial increase in Federal spending  yet that is precisely what is called for in the budget resolutions adopted by the House and Senate  Rob Portman  the Presidents Budget Director wrote in a letter last week to Congressional budget committees  Because the budget will set the framework for consideration of fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills  it is timely to notify you that I will recommend the President veto any appropriations bill that exceeds his request until Congress demonstrates a sustainable path that keeps discretionary spending within the Presidents topline  Later this year  the House and Senate are expected to take up the fiscal year 2008 spending bills that provide funds for all government agencies  roads  education  defense and social programs  Each of the dozen appropriations bills are subject to a Presidential veto  The Congressional budget is the broad spending plan  the federal spending blueprint and is not subject to a Presidential veto   A copy of President Bushs budget directors letter follows   The Honorable John Spratt  Jr  Chairman Committee on the Budget U S  House of Representatives Washington  D C  20515 Dear John  I am writing to express the Administrations views regarding House Concurrent Resolution 99  the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008  As you know  on February 5  the President submitted a disciplined budget that achieves balance in 2012 through spending restraint  and without raising taxes  While the Administration appreciates that both the House and Senate have embraced the goal of a balanced budget  we oppose the budget resolutions passed by the House and Senate because they would threaten the economic and job growth of the past four years through massive tax increases  increase Federal spending by hundreds of billions of dollars  and fail to address the unsustainable growth in entitlement spending   The Administration does not believe that the first step on the path to a balanced budget should be a substantial increase in Federal spending  yet that is precisely what is called for in the budget resolutions adopted by the House and Senate  Furthermore  we are concerned that both budget resolutions adopt a pay as you go rule that would effectively block the continuation of tax relief critical to sustained economic growth  At the same time  this pay as you go rule permits spending to expand dramatically through a loophole that exempts all increases in discretionary spending  The Administration urges the conferees to set an overall fiscal year 2008 discretionary funding level that does not exceed the Presidents Budget   Because the budget will set the framework for consideration of fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills  it is timely to notify you that I will recommend the President veto any appropriations bill that exceeds his request until Congress demonstrates a sustainable path that keeps discretionary spending within the Presidents topline of  933 billion and ensures that the Department of Defense has the resources necessary to accomplish its mission   The proven formula of keeping taxes low while restraining spending has decreased the budget deficit by over  165 billion in the last two years  It has helped create economic conditions that foster job creation and rising wages  And it has put our Nation on a path of reduced deficits and a balanced budget within five years  The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee and others in Congress to continue successful deficit reduction through the fiscal year 2008 budget process  Sincerely  Rob
