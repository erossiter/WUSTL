                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi offers sales tax fairness bill  December 21  2005 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   introduced legislation recently that will level the playing field for all in store  catalog and online retailers so each has the same sales tax responsibilities as well as help states collect more revenue from the sales    The Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act  S  2152  would help states efficiently and fairly collect sales and use tax revenue that is being lost because remote sellers do not have to remit sales and use taxes on catalog and Internet purchases  Main Street retailers collect sales taxes  while many online and catalog retailers are exempt from collecting the same taxes  This is costing states and localities billions in lost revenue     Enzis bill would encourage tax simplification by requiring states to implement and maintain measures before they can require any seller to collect and remit sales and use taxes  Simply put  if Congress continues to allow remote sales taxes to go uncollected and electronic commerce continues to grow as predicted  other taxes  such as income or property taxes  will have to be increased to offset the lost revenue to state and local governments  I want to avoid that  said Enzi    The legislation would streamline the countrys more than 7 500 diverse sales tax jurisdictions by permitting states that become voluntary members of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes  A total of 19 states have already enacted legislation to change their tax laws and implement the requirements of the agreement  The Agreement would help harmonize states sales and use tax rules  bring uniformity to definitions of items in the sales tax base  reduce the paperwork burden on retailers  and incorporate new technology to modernize administrative procedures     The states have acted  It is now time for Congress to provide states that enact the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the authority to require remote retailers to collect sales tax just as Main Street retailers do today  said Enzi    Enzis bill would not increase taxes or allow duplicate taxes by different states     The bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee    FLOOR STATEMENT  Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act  Senator Michael B  Enzi  December 20  2005 Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  I rise today to introduce the Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act  a bill that will level the playing field for all retailers  in store  catalog  and online  so each retailer has the same sales tax collection responsibility  All retail sales should be treated equally  The bill will also help states begin to recover from years of budgetary shortfalls   This bill is not a disguised attempt to increase taxes or put a new tax on the Internet  Consumers are already supposed to pay sales and use taxes in most states for purchases made over the phone  by mail  or via the Internet  Unfortunately  most consumers are unaware they are required to pay this use tax on purchases the retailer does not choose to collect sales tax on at the time of purchase   That means consumers who buy products online are required to keep track of their purchases and then pay the outstanding use tax obligation on their state tax forms  This has proven to be unrealistic  but what is real is most people do not know this or do not comply with the requirement  As such  states are losing billions of dollars in annual revenue  This legislation will help both consumers and states by reducing the burden on consumers and providing a mechanism that will allow states to systematically and fairly collect the taxes already owed to them   This bill is not about new taxes  Simply put  if Congress continues to allow remote sales taxes to go uncollected and electronic commerce continues to grow as predicted  other taxes B such as income or property taxes B will have to be increased to offset the lost revenue  I want to avoid that  That is why we need to implement a plan that will allow states to generate revenue using mechanisms already approved by their local leaders  This bill is about economic growth  Sales and use taxes provide critical revenue to pay for our schools  our police officers  firefighters  road construction  and more  It will bring more money B money that is already owed B into rural areas that are struggling economically  It will also help businesses comply with the complicated state sales tax systems  That means the business resources that have historically been spent on tax compliance could be used  among other things  to hire new people and buy new equipment  This bill is about tax simplification  As the Supreme Court identified in the Quill versus North Dakota decision in 1992  the complicated state and local sales tax systems across this country have created an undue burden on sellers  The Quill decision stated that a multitude of complicated and diverse state sales tax rules made it too onerous to require retailers to collect sales taxes unless they had a physical presence in the state of the buyer  Local brick and mortar retailers collect sales taxes  while many online and catalog retailers are exempt from collecting the same taxes  This is not only fundamentally unfair to Main Street retailers  but it is costing states and localities billions in lost revenue   The bill will help relieve this burden by requiring states to meet the simplification standards outlined in the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement  Working with the business community  the states developed the Agreement to harmonize state sales tax rules  bring uniformity to definitions of items in the sales tax base  significantly reduce the paperwork burden on retailers  and incorporate new technology to modernize many administrative procedures  This unprecedented Agreement will increase our nation s economic efficiency and facilitate the growth of commerce by dramatically reducing red tape and administrative burdens on all businesses and consumers  However  most importantly  the Agreement removes the liability for collection errors from the retailer and places it with the state  This historic Agreement was approved by 34 states and the District of Columbia on November 12  2002   The states have made tremendous progress in changing their state tax laws to become compliant with the Agreement  Already  19 states have enacted legislation to change their tax laws and implement the requirements of the Agreement  On October 3  2005  the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement became effective   This bill requires states to implement and maintain these simplification measures before they can require any seller to collect and remit sales tax  The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement includes dramatic simplification in almost every aspect of sales and use tax collection and administration  especially for the sellers who sell their products in more than one state  Areas of simplification include exemption processing  uniform definitions  state level administration of local taxes  a reduced number of sales tax rates  determining the appropriate tax rate  and reduced audit burdens for sellers using the state certified technology   While the states have made great progress  the Quill decision held that allowing states to require collection is an issue that  Congress may be better qualified to resolve  and one that it has the ultimate power to resolve  The states have acted  It is now time for Congress to provide states that enact the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the authority to require remote retailers to collect sales taxes just as Main Street retailers do today   Congress needs to level the playing field for all retailers in store  catalog  and online so each has the same sales tax collection responsibility  All retail sales should be treated equally  I believe Congressional action is needed to provide states that implement the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the authority to collect sales and use taxes from remote retailers  Adoption of the Agreement and Congressional authorization will provide a level playing field for brick and mortar and remote retailers  Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and I have worked tirelessly to assist sellers and state and local governments to find true simplification in almost every aspect of sales and use tax collection and administration  I want to thank Senator Dorgan for working with me on this policy issue for so many years  We have been successful in moving this issue forward from discussing it at the federal level with Members of Congress to the drafting of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to approving the Governing Board this year to push forward with implementation   For the past eleven months  Senator Dorgan and I have worked with all interested parties to try to find a mutually agreeable legislative package to introduce this year  Many hours have been dedicated in trying to find the right solution to address all concerns  I appreciate everyones hardwork on this piece of legislation and believe it is time to introduce the bill before the end of the year   Senator Dorgan and I will be introducing two separate bills this year  but will continue to work with each other and all interested parties to find compromise on the outstanding policy issues of concern to the stakeholders  Some of the issues that will be further discussed include  but are not limited to  modifications to the small business exception language  inclusion of tribal governments language  and modifications to the language about transactional taxes on telecommunications services  Bill introduction does not stop us from negotiating and working together to improve the final product that should be enacted into public law  I look forward to working with Senator Dorgan and all interested parties to produce a compromise bill in 2006 that addresses all concerns raised over the past year  The Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act provides states that implement the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the authority to collect sales or use taxes equally from all retailers  Adoption of the Agreement and Congressional authorization will provide a level playing field for brick and mortar and remote retailers  I respectfully request unanimous consent for my statement and bill to be entered into the official record  I yield the floor
