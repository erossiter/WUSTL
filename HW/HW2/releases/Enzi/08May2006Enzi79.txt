Report On Sarbanes Oxley Finds Burdensome Compliance Costs  Senators Urge SEC To Adopt Clear and Practical Regulations For Small Businesses  May 8  2006 Washington  D C   Senator Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  and Senator Michael B  Enzi  R WY   Chairs of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  respectively  today released a Government Accountability Office report they requested on the impact of the Sarbanes Oxley Act on small businesses  The report found small business compliance costs for the Acts internal controls were disproportionately higher than larger businesses  a significant increase in companies going private to avoid compliance costs and a considerable increase in audit fees since the passage of the Act  which include hiring more staff or paying for outside consultants     As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  I hear from small business owners in Maine and across the nation who struggle to comply with an ever increasing list of statutory and regulatory requirements  Senator Enzi and I requested this Government Accountability Office study to determine the burdens that the Sarbanes Oxley Act may impose on small business owners  which include harming their ability to obtain capital  said Senator Snowe  While I believe in right sizing regulations  this report leads me to caution the Securities and Exchange Commission against creating complex and cumbersome regulations that have the potential to place small businesses in a paralyzing state of regulatory limbo and damage their ability to create jobs  Instead  I urge the SEC to adopt clear  unambiguous  and practical small business rules     I joined Chairwoman Snowe to request this report because small businesses are the primary force behind the American economy  They employ millions of American workers and keep our economy growing and productive  Yet  the same small companies are hit hardest by the cost of regulatory compliance  We need to look for ways to lessen the impact of Sarbanes Oxley implementation on these companies  This report serves to highlight that point  Enzi said  I was an author of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and I believe that it was necessary to restore confidence in our public markets  It remains necessary to ensure that such confidence is well earned  but we need to find a way for small companies to implement the Act  including the strengthening of companies internal controls  Doing so will benefit investors and businesses alike    Senator Snowe and Senator Enzi noted a central recommendation of the report  Sarbanes Oxley Act  Consideration of Key Principles Needed in Addressing Implementation for Smaller Public Companies  urged the SEC to consider the size  the unique characteristics of smaller public companies and the knowledge base  educational background  and sophistication of their investors during the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley requirements  It found smaller public companies face compliance costs disproportionately higher  as a percentage of revenues  than for large public companies  particularly with respect to the internal control reporting provisions in section 404 and related audit fees     Excerpts from the report       Smaller companies that responded to our survey reported that their CFOs and accounting staff spent as much as 90 percent of their time for the period leading up to their first section 404 report on Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance related issues      Public companies with market capitalization of  75 million or less paid a median  1 14 in audit fees for every  100 of revenues compared to  0 13 in audit fees for public companies with market capitalization greater than  1 billion      The number of public companies that went private has increased significantly from 143 in 2001 to 245 in 2004  with the greatest increase occurring during 2003      For smaller public companies  the costs of complying with securities laws likely required a greater portion of their revenues  and cost considerations  indirect and direct  were the leading reasons for companies exiting the public market  even prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act      Smaller companies reported paying fees to external consultants for the period leading up to their first section 404 report that ranged from  3 000 to more than  1 4 million      Smaller public companies may have found it harder to retain a large accounting firm as a result of increased demand for auditing services  largely due to the implementation of section 404 and other requirements of the act  and the capacity limitations of the large accounting firms    Senator Snowe and Senator Enzi said the Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the date by which companies with less than  75 million in market capitalization must comply with Sarbanes Oxley to July 15  2007  The SEC also formed an Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies in response to the concerns of small business owners  On March 3  2006 the Committee issued a draft of its final report for public comment that contained recommendations that would exempt 70 percent of all public companies from all or some of the internal controls mandated by Sarbanes Oxley   Click on the following link to view the report
