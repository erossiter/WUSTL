granddaughter Lilly Grace into the world  Enzi holds Lilly Grace  the newest addition to the Enzi family and his second grand child  Lilly was born October 14 weighing 7 pounds  two ounces and 20 inches long  October 17  2007    Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to share a joy as though in morning business  I d ask unanimous consent to have my whole statement appear in case I m not able to make it through this emotional sharing  I m a grampa again  Incidentally  that s spelled with an M not an N and no D  Grampa  It s the greatest title anyone can have  It s really indescribable unless you ve felt the thrill  felt the love  felt the awe  This weekend  my son and his wife had a daughter  Lilly Grace  My son  who also like me had the good fortune to overmarry to Danielle  a delightful lady from Kentucky  who he met here in    Washington   She s one of the most organized and focused people I know  My son  Brad  and daughter in law Danielle already have a son  Trey  who first made me Grampa  Now they have a daughter  Lilly Grace Enzi  I can t begin to share the emotion and feeling that overwhelms me today  It s such an incredible feeling to hold another generation in your hands  To see such a miniature person and such a huge miracle  Danielle and Lilly Grace had extremely fortunate timing for my wife Diana and I  Trey and Lilly were both born when we were close by in    Wyoming   Trey was born when we were attending a     University of    Wyoming football game just 45 miles away  Lilly was born during a Redskins football game  when we were just two blocks from the hospital  Brad checked Danielle into the hospital at 11 00 Sunday morning and at exactly 2 00 p m   October 14 that Sunday  we had a granddaughter  Lilly Grace weighed 7 pounds  two ounces  and was 20 inches long with delicate hands and long fingers  Danielle came through  as is her nature  invigorated and enthusiastic  You would not have known by looking at her face except for the aura of a mother  that she had just given birth  The rest of us were emotional wrecks  When Danielle went into labor  I rejoiced at the timing and extended the weekend another day and had the pleasure of holding that baby and watching her breathe and move ever so delicately with a thousand different expressions and listened to all the sounds she made  Of course  I had to let Diana hold her a little too  and her mom and dad even wanted turns  If you would have told me that I would spend time just gazing at the miracle of life and having only that thought for hours  I probably wouldn t have believed you  But I have some instant replay memories of that little face and those moving hands and all those blankets and the cap they used to hold in the body heat locked in my mind  And I m constantly doing instant replays for myself and thanking God for the opportunities he s given me  from finding Diana  to learning about prayer with our first child  the daughter who was born premature  who showed us how worthwhile fighting for life is  To the birth of our son  to the birth of our youngest daughter  to helping me through open heart surgery so that I might have this chance to hold yet another generation in my hands  I think of the prayer of Jabez in Chronicles where he says  Lord  continue to bless me indeed and to that  I add my thanks for this and all the blessings noticed and unfortunately often unnoticed  So now I m a grampa  That s not grandfather  That s too stilted  Years ago  my daughter gave me a hand stitched wall hanging that says  Any man can be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad  That s a challenge for grampas to live up to  too  And again  I note that the name is not grandpa with a D  Grandpa  that s a title a little too elevated  This grampa is with an M and no D  That s what I called my grampa Bradley  who took me on some wonderful adventures and taught me a lot of important lessons  including fishing  Now it s my turn to live up to that valued name  He liked to be called grampa  and I m now delighted to have the opportunity to earn that name  too  I wish I could adequately share with you the joy that s in my heart  Now  some would say  Lilly Grace  you ve been born at a scary time  a time of fear  fear of almost everything  fear of war  fear of people from other countries  fear of our neighborhoods  As an Enzi  we have faith that doing the right thing  doing your best  and treating others as they want to be treated will solve most problems  which will overcome fear  Now  in my job  I get to hear a lot of disparaging comments about our country and our government  But for you  granddaughter  you were lucky to be born in this country  I ve been to a lot of places in the world now and I can tell you that there are none anyone would trade for the    United States  In my job  I often have to remind people that I never hear of anyone trying to get out of our country  I do hear from millions who would like to be here  Now  as you  precious baby  get older  if things don t change  you ll hear people who think that the government owes them a living and all kinds of guarantees and you ll hear people portray business as greedy and you ll see attempts to keep faith and God out of your vocabulary  And all those things could come to pass except for you  You and others who will know how to do the right thing and will value the way our country was founded and has grown  Lilly  granddaughter  welcome to this world of promise and hope and faith and love  I m excited to have you in my life     Related
