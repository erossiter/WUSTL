                                                                                                                                                                                      Senate Passes Perkins Technical Education Act   Bill sent to President would help with Wyoming workforce needs  July 26  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  applauded the Senate for passing the conference agreement on the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act S 250  a bill he said will help close the gap that threatens Americas long term competitiveness  by addressing the needs of the nations changing workforce   This bill will help support lifelong learning opportunities for students to gain technical skills and knowledge that will help them find and hold high skill and high wage jobs  Enzi said  Employers in Wyoming need workers to fill high wage jobs that require specialized technical skills  This bill means funding for programs that teach students the essential skills and can help place them in jobs around the country  I hope the House will follow quickly and I will be proud to present this bill to the President for his signature  The Perkins Act would authorizes more than  1 2 billion in federal support for career and technical education programs in all 50 States  It also reauthorizes federal career and technical education programs which were last reauthorized in 1998   The Perkins Act has been  and I believe will continue to be  a critical part of ensuring that this nation remains competitive  Enzi added  Together with the Workforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act  the Perkins Act is part of a comprehensive system of education and training programs that will help todays students become the leaders in the global economy  State and local funding supports the career and technical education infrastructure  teachers salaries and other operating expenses while the federal funds authorized in this bill could be used for equipment purchases  teacher professional development  and integration between academic and technical courses S  250 will improve programs authorized under the Perkins Act by requiring    A More Effective Accountability System   that aligns accountability requirements with other federal education and training programs     Stronger Links to Businesses   that build stronger partnerships between high schools  colleges  and businesses  so they can better meet the needs of the workforce  including small businesses  Better Links from High School to College   that require states to outline a logical sequence of courses  including high school and college courses  that will lead to an industry recognized credential  certificate  or postsecondary degree   Stronger Academic Focus   that promotes an enhanced emphasis on academic instruction for federallysupported career and technical education programs consistent with other federal education programs   Statement of Michael B  Enzi  Chairman  Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and PensionsSenate Consideration of the Conference Report to Accompany S  250  the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 July 26  2006 Mr  President  I rise today in support of the conference report to accompany S  250  the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006   This legislation reflects a lengthy bipartisan effort to strengthen and improve federal programs designed to support career and technical education  I am very pleased to have worked with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts  Senator Kennedy  from introduction of the bill in the Senate through todays consideration of the conference report  This legislation was reported favorably by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee last Spring by a unanimous vote  The following day it passed the Senate on a vote of 99 0  I am encouraged by the broad support for this legislation and I am pleased to be able to recommend passage of this conference report  This legislation is important for three reasons  The first reason is the added emphasis on academic achievement  I commend the President and the governors for raising the issue of high school reform  and I believe this legislation is an important part of that process  Improving and strengthening the academic focus of the Perkins Act is part of a much larger effort to ensure that todays students will be ready for tomorrows reality  whether it is in college or the workplace  In 1998  when Congress last reauthorized the Perkins program  additional emphasis on student academic achievement was incorporated into the bill  That emphasis was critical  and the results have been demonstrated in the program  More Perkins students are performing better on national reading and math assessments than ever before  The National Assessment of Adult Literacy  released earlier this year  pointed out that career and technical education students perform better than their peers in both reading and math comprehension  Another recent study of Arizona career and technical education students showed that students in career and technical training courses were more likely to meet State math proficiency levels than students not enrolled in technical training courses  Thats good  because todays jobs are requiring stronger academic preparation than ever before  especially in math and science  We are also facing a significant problem in terms of todays students completing high school and earning a secondary education degree  A significant amount of research  many college instructors  and employers agree that far too many high school graduates are not prepared for college level classes and many more do not have the skills to advance beyond entry level jobs  Only 68  of the students entering the ninth grade four years ago are expected to graduate this year  For minority students  this number hovers around 50   In addition  we continue to experience an overall drop out rate of 11  per year  The Perkins Act emphasizes high school completion by making academic courses more relevant  According to the National Assessment of Vocational Education  now two years old  career and technical education students are three times more likely to apply academic skills to job related tasks than students in academic courses  The Perkins program can help address the wasted senior year by helping to improve student academic achievement  It does that by linking learning to relevant applications and tasks  Students that are excited about learning will always do better  and a great way to get students excited about learning is to show them how they will use the skills theyre learning in real life  For many students  understanding how they will use the skills they learn can mean the difference between completing a high school degree and dropping out  For others  it means greater investment in their studies than they might otherwise have  Making learning relevant is one of the best ways to ensure students stay interested in their coursework  while also preparing them for college and the workforce  In the bill we are now considering  we have made academic achievement one of several core indicators of performance for programs receiving funds from this act  As States are elevating their expectations for students under No Child Left Behind  we anticipate that career and technical education students will benefit from those same high expectations  We believe that career and technical education programs should be able to take credit for helping students improve their academic achievement in core subject areas  like reading  math  and science  This legislation also emphasizes the connection to postsecondary education  Many of todays high school students are entering college behind the curve before they even start  Almost a third of all college students are taking some remedial education courses before graduating  We need to make sure that more high school students are receiving the instruction they need before they leave high school in order to be successful in college   The impact of the need for remedial academic instruction has dramatic consequences  As many as three in four students requiring remedial reading instruction will not complete a postsecondary degree program  Over sixty percent of students requiring remedial math education will not complete a postsecondary degree  The Perkins program is in a unique position to help prevent the need for additional remedial education at the postsecondary level  Because the program provides funds for both secondary and postsecondary schools  programs are more coordinated  and students have broader exposure to postsecondary education before leaving high school  A number of programs enabling students to earn concurrent credits for high school and college are springing up within the Perkins program  helping students prepare for college and reduce their time to graduation from a postsecondary degree certificate or degree program  In Casper  Wyoming  right now  the community college and the school district are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical education center  which will help students earn credit toward a college degree  learn relevant job skills  and meet challenging state academic standards  all through a single sequence of courses  This legislation encourages more schools to begin innovative programs like the one being developed in Casper  The second reason this legislation is important is because it will help ensure we are preparing students for tomorrows workforce  We are in the midst of a skills revolution  It is estimated that todays students leaving high school or college will have fourteen different careers in their lifetimes  It is also estimated that the top ten jobs ten years from now havent been invented yet  The question that faces all of us  put simply  is got skills  We must equip our workers with the skills the technology driven economy demands  We need to prepare our students for tomorrows economy in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace  Nations such as China and India are rapidly catching up to our institutions in terms of quality  and they have a much larger student body from which to draw  The only way we can compete in the changing economy is to graduate students with the highest quality of academic and technical skills   Earlier this month on the Senate floor we discussed the need for skills training and its impact on wages  I made a speech to the effect that the problem we are facing is one of minimum skills  not minimum wages  The effect may be low wages  but the cause is low skills  We need to address those workers who have few  if any  of the skills they need to compete for a better job and command higher wages  We need to start thinking in terms of skills  the kinds of skills that will help students support themselves and their families in the future  Research shows that high school drop outs have an unemployment rate two times higher than high school graduates  and three times higher than college graduates  Over time  the earning differential between high school and college graduates has increased as well  In 1980  college graduates earned fifty percent more during their lifetime than high school graduates  Today this differential has increased to 100 percent and continues to expand  The programs supported by the Perkins Act helps students learn and develop the skills they need to compete in the workforce  In the bill before us  weve emphasized the need to prepare students for placement in high skill  high wage  or high demand occupations  These are the types of jobs that will ensure a stronger future for students and will help them become self sufficient  Eighty percent of the jobs created over the next ten years will require some postsecondary education  However  the majority of those jobs will require less than a four year degree  This is a critical issue  and we need to start now to meet the needs of the future workforce  I believe that a stronger  more effective Perkins program is an important way to address this issue  By 2010 we face a projected skilled worker shortage of 5 3 million workers  Thats 5 3 million American jobs that cant be filled because our workers dont have the right skills  That is why career and technical education funds are so critical to the supply of skilled labor in this country  These are precisely the types of careers for which the Perkins program is preparing students  Career and technical programs in this country are preparing students with the skills to succeed in health care  information technology  trade  manufacturing  and a host of other careers  One of the most critical improvements weve made to the Perkins program in this bill is to strengthen the connection of career and technical education programs to the needs of businesses  If we are going to help fill the growing need for skilled workers  we need to ensure Perkins programs are coordinating their instruction with current practices in industry and the needs of the local workforce  Thousands of examples are available of schools connecting with businesses to help develop the right curriculum for available high skill  high wage jobs  At a roundtable I chaired earlier this year on high school redesign issues  several of the participants described programs that linked academic programs at the high school or community college with the needs of the employers in the area  One such example was a program that prepared students to work in a nearby nuclear energy plant  The area high school offered classes so students in the area could begin the technical training to get a job at the nuclear power plant  earning more than  40 000 a year to start  Thats the type of relevant instruction that we need to encourage and that we are encouraging through this conference report  I expect that the students performing well in their nuclear power management and safety class are also performing well on State math and science assessments   The final reason that this legislation is important is because it provides a foundation for the redesign of federal education policy  We need to structure federal education policies that provide students and adult learners have access to lifelong education opportunities  In this twenty first century economy  learning never ends  and school is never out  The Perkins Act is one part of a three legged stool of federal education and training programs  all of which we will have considered during this Congress  The other two key pieces of this approach are the Workforce Investment Act  and the Higher Education Act  This is the first of those three bills to make it through conference  but I hope we will quickly follow with the others  If we are going to stay competitive  federal education programs need to help support seamless transitions from education to the workforce  throughout life  from preschool through postsecondary education and beyond  The conference report we are considering takes the first step in that direction by emphasizing the connection between academic and technical education and the workforce and postsecondary education  The Workforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act will be the next critical steps in ensuring that American students are prepared for today and tomorrows careers  many which havent been invented yet  Todays students are more and more likely to return to school throughout their lives for additional training  Some estimates suggest that as many as seventy five percent of todays workers will need additional training just to stay current with their jobs  The modern college student reflects this trend perfectly  Todays average college student is likely to be older than twenty four  independent  and more likely to be female  They are also likely to have transferred institutions at least once in their postsecondary career  That snapshot reflects the reality that todays college students are there for training and technical skills acquisition more than anything else  Postsecondary education is one of the fastest means to advancement in todays economy  With a postsecondary education  workers are more likely to keep their jobs and take advantage of opportunities to grow and advance in the workforce  or transition to another occupation as the workforce changes   Federal policy needs to reflect the twenty first century reality  we are in the midst of a jobs revolution  We are going to experience dramatic changes in the workforce over the next ten to fifteen years  and we need to start now if we are going to adapt federal education and training policy to meet the coming crisis of too few workers with too few skills  I am pleased that this legislation is now at the final stage of the process  We were able to move this bill quickly through Committee and the floor because we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize a program that the members of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee feel is an important part of the federal education and training system  Although the intervening work took much longer than I would have liked  I am happy to see the conference report taken up in the Senate  I want to thank Senator Kennedy and his staff for their hard work  and for the hard work of the Senate conferees  I specifically want to thank Carmel Martin  JD Larock  and Jane Oates from Senator Kennedys staff  Although I understand Jane has moved on to greener pastures  she had a significant role to play in helping the legislation get to this point  I also want to thank Mr  McKeon and Mr  Miller  as well as the other House conferees  for helping us get to this point  and their staffs  Whitney Rhoades  Stephanie Milburn  Krisann Pearce  Lisa Ross  Denise Forte  Lloyd Horwich and many others  Finally  I want to thank my own staff  Scott Fleming  Beth Buehlmann  Lisa Schunk  Ilyse Schuman and Katherine McGuire  for helping me to move this bill all the way through the legislative process  They have spent many long hours seeking agreement on the provisions of the conference report and have done stellar work  Mr  President I urge my colleagues to support adoption of the conference report  and I yield the floor                                                       July 2006 News Releases
