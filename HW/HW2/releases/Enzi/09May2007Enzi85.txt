passage of bipartisan FDA legislation A   monumental victory for patient safety      May 9  2007  Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   ranking member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said the Senate has taken a bold step to protect American consumers and patients  voting to approve a comprehensive bill to enhance drug safety that provides new resources for post market surveillance and review of new drugs and medical devices   key improvements to ensure that drugs and devices are safe and effective    Each day  half of all Americans take at least one prescription drug  Enzi said  Today we have risen above partisan politics to deliver a monumental victory for all Americans who want peace of mind that the drugs they purchase to treat illnesses and chronic medical conditions are safe and effective  This bill will meet the challenges of protecting American consumers and patients and usher in a new era of drug safety    This bill will establish a system that gives the FDA  through sound science and remarkable innovation  the tools to get drugs to the market quickly and efficiently  especially when lives are on the line and people need new drugs and therapies  Enzi said  It gives the FDA new authority to take swift  appropriate  and decisive action to ensure patient safety and protect consumers when new information comes to light to expose unexpected risks   The Senate approved final passage of the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act by a 93 1 count    The bill represents over a year of bipartisan discussions and cooperation following the Vioxx incident  It establishes a system of active surveillance for drugs already on the market  and explicitly gives the FDA new authority through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies  REMS  to respond quickly and appropriately when previously unknown risks arise    Right now  the FDA has its hands tied behind its back when it tries to manage the risks of drugs already on the market  This bill will clarify and strengthen the FDAs authority and give it new tools to take measured and appropriate steps to protect the health and safety of Americans when the agencys post market surveillance signals potential dangers from a drug or therapy  Pulling a drug from the market and denying patients who need it shouldnt be the only tool available to the FDA    The Senate approved S  1082 with the following amendments  Brownback  985  Inhofe   987  Gregg  993  Landrieu  1004  Levin  1005  Murkowski  1006  Hatch  1009  Stabenow  1011

Education and Pensions Committee  Conclusion of the Drug Safety and FDA Debate  May 9  2007   Mr  President  I rise today in support of S  1082  the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act  This comprehensive bill will enhance drug safety and provide key resources to the Food and Drug Administration  Its been a long road for this bill  and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote YES on final passage  and endorse the most comprehensive drug safety overhaul in more than a decade  Completion of this bill marks yet another significant step in the process  But there is more work to be done  The House needs to pass their version of the legislation  and then the two bodies need to work out differences in a conference committee   My hope and expectation is that the House will act in a reasonable manner and soon  because this is widely considered to be must pass legislation  This key FDA package includes four reauthorizations that must be done this year  along with essential new authorities for FDA to be able to react in a timely way to any safety problems that arise after a drug has been brought to market   I would like to take a couple minutes to recap for my colleagues the path this legislation has taken thus far  The Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions conducted a top to bottom review of the FDAs drug safety and approval processes over two years ago    This bill is the culmination of that review and our continued evaluation and analysis of the FDA  The changes made in the drug safety components of this legislation are critical to restoring peace of mind to Americans who want to be assured that the drugs they purchase to treat illnesses and chronic medical conditions can be relied upon and trusted    Given the limitations we identified during our review of FDA  I strongly felt it was necessary to correct those problems and ensure that FDA has the right tools to address drug safety after the drug is on the market  Thats why this bill creates the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or REMS  The REMS gives FDA the full toolbox of options for dealing with potential safety problems  even if they are discovered after a drug is first marketed   With this new toolbox  FDA has the ability to identify side effects after the drug is marketed through active surveillance  FDA also has the authority to request a separate study or clinical trial to learn more about a particular  potential safety problem  FDA can also obtain timely label changes for the first time under the new REMS system   Through the REMS process  the bill also makes several key improvements to how patients get their information through advertising and labeling  I want to thank my colleague Sen  Roberts for his tireless efforts to provide an appropriate balance for direct to consumer advertising  It was not an easy task to reconcile some very different opinions  and I am so pleased that we were able to reach a resolution to this issue that we could all support  I also thank my colleagues Senator Harkin and Senator Kennedy for their hard work on this issue  Senator Roberts had planned to vote for S  1082  but could not be here today because he is in    Kansas showing the President the damage from our tornadoes  I wish him all the best in helping his state recover from this tragedy  The FDA currently has very little authority to require labeling changes after a drug is brought to market  We have included provisions that ensure that discussions between the FDA and a drug manufacturer regarding labeling changes come to a close quickly and effectively  rather than relying on FDAs nuclear option    pulling the drug from the market  This legislation gives FDA the tools needed to get drugs to the market quickly and efficiently and to respond to potential problems the same way  especially when lives are on the line and people need new drugs and therapies    FDA currently has no mechanism for active  routine surveillance of potential safety problems  It cannot easily detect safety problems after a drug has been put on the market  This legislation fixes that challenge and ensures that FDA has the right tools to address drug safety after the drug is on the market  The legislation allows for routine  active  safety monitoring using large linked databases  what I like to call health IT for drug safety  I want to thank Sen  Gregg for being the champion of this provision and ensuring that we crafted this provision appropriately    Not every drug will need a REMS  However  every drug will need a very active FDA  a FDA with all of the necessary tools to identify and quickly manage additionalrisks  Title IV of the bill before us contains a number of critical provisions to improve childrens health  Up to 75  of drugs used by kids have not been tested in kids  Without information from pediatric studies  kids are often overdosed  under dosed  or receive ineffective treatment  They may suffer needlessly  or even die    The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act makes drugs safer for kids by creating incentives to perform pediatric drug studies  The incentives have produced astonishing results  In the 7 years before BPCA incentives  a total of 11 pediatric studies were performed  In the 10 years since incentives were authorized  at least 132 studies have been completed  and more are underway    As a grandfather  I am very happy the law is in place  If my grandson Trey is sick  I want the drugs he needs to have been tested for kids  All of us want that for our children and grandchildren    The bill also reauthorizes BPCAs companion statute  the Pediatric Research Improvement Act  which enables FDA to require a pediatric study if it is not done under BPCA or through the National Institutes of Health  These two laws work together as carrot and stick  and I strongly support their reauthorization    So far Ive only talked about drugs for kids  This bill will also make medical devices safer for kids    Devices designed for adults might not fit in kids  A scaled down device might fit at first  but a child will grow out of it  Doctors must jerry rig adult devices  improvise  or use more invasive treatments  In addition  the market for kids devices is small  and development costs are high  so few kids devices get made  The bill before us creates new incentives to grow the market for kids medical devices  and I am hopeful these new incentives will be as successful as the kids drug incentive    I would like to thank Sen  Alexander  Sen  Allard  Sen  Bond  Sen  Dodd  Sen  Clinton and others for their leadership on behalf of kids    A number of other FDA issues were also addressed during the debate on this legislation  The legislation was improved when the Senate adopted a food safety amendment by a vote of 94 0  This amendment adds additional food safetyprovisions to better protect our pet food supply  and track when food is adulterated  My colleagues and I also reached consensus that the issue of follow on biologics will be addressed in the HELP Committee early this summer   As my colleagues know  I have some concerns with the Dorgan amendment on drug importation that was adopted last week  and I supported the Cochran safety amendment that was also adopted  I didnt support the Dorgan approach to foreign drug importation because I dont believe it adequately ensures the safety of our prescription drug supply  I was pleased to work with my colleague Senator Dorgan to add some very significant anti counterfeiting language to the bill  but a lot of work still remains  I support the process moving forward  and I will continue to work with my colleagues and Senator Dorgan and Senator Snowe to improve this language during the conference process   Finally  I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his work on the antibiotics and other Hatch Waxman issues  Senator Hatch was responsible for the first FDA Revitalization Act in 1990  before I was elected a member of the Senate  and I would like to thank him for helping me bring that full circle    Ill have a lot more thank yous to deliver after the votes  but right now  we have a bit of business left to conduct    I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from    Iowa   Senator Grassley  number 1039  regarding joint signing authority between the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology  This amendment would add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to what we have designed to be a nimble and responsive process to deal with emerging drug safety issues  The underlying bill has a dispute resolution process with firm and tight deadlines  and requires by its very nature close collaboration between the two offices  This amendment only serves to separate out what should be together  and delay what should be rapid  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment    With respect to the other amendment number 998 offered by my colleague Senator Grassley  I must also oppose this amendment regarding the level of civil monetary penalties that may be assessed for violations of a drug safety plan  The level of civil penalties in the underlying bill was carefully crafted to reflect existing FDA policies for other regulated products  So there is precedent for these levels  which I would add have never before been available to FDA as a tool on drug safety issues  Furthermore  I believe the very threat of a civil penalty is sufficient to deter bad behavior  This is the name and shame principle  the fine may be affordable to the company  but the loss of their reputation isnt  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment as well    Finally  I must also oppose amendment number 1034  offered by my colleague from    Illinois   Senator Durbin  The FDA relies on its 30 advisory committees to provide independent expert advice  lend credibility to the product review process  and inform consumers of trends in product development  Given the complex issues considered by the FDA  outside help is needed and beneficial  But any scientist who is expert enough to merit interest by FDA has almost certainly merited interest by other entities  such as granting agencies and companies involved in the field    This amendment would seriously limit FDAs ability to access the best experts in the field to assist the agency with its decision making  It would restrict FDA to granting only one waiver per committee meeting    How would FDA decide who gets that one waiver  Who is more worthy  The toxicologist  The drug safety expert  The specialist in womens health  These are not easy questions    FDA in March released a guidance document outlining strict new limits on evaluating advisory committee members for service  The comment period on this guidance has not even closed  It is premature to void that guidance before we even know whether and how it will work    Lets take a step back and think about what might happen if we dont allow anyone who has worked with or for industry to be involved in an advisory committee meeting  Louis Pasteur was a brilliant microbiologist who revolutionized human health and food safety  Every time you buy milk in the grocery store  you are benefiting from his contributions to society   But under the Durbin amendment  Pasteur would probably not have been able to serve on an advisory committee  You see  Pasteurs research was funded by the wine industry  Do we really want to prevent the FDA from benefiting from the advice the best and brightest have to offer  I think not  and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment   In conclusion  I urge my colleagues to oppose all three of these amendments  but to strongly support the legislation on final passage  I thank all of my colleagues for their genuine efforts to improve this bill  and I yield the floor                                                                                       May 2007 News Releases
