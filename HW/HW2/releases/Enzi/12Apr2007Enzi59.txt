cinch up earmark disclosure  April 12  2007 Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said the Senate should enact earmark disclosure requirements now  without wasting time waiting for the House to approve S  1 the Senate Ethics Reform bill  Enzi said American taxpayers should clearly see how their money is being spent   With this years appropriation cycle in full swing the Senate must act quickly to implement this important ethics reform  Enzi and four other senators wrote in an April 11 letter to the Senate Majority and Minority leaders  If we are serious about changing the culture in Washington  we must be completely transparent about how we spend American tax dollars  The resolution  if passed  would become binding and require disclosure of information related to earmarks in committee passed bills and must be available in a searchable format on the Internet  The information available would include the name of the senator requesting the earmark  the name and address of the recipient  the purpose and a certification the requesting senator and his or her spouse have no financial interest in the request   Enzis letter urges Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   to allow the Senate to unanimously approve Senate Resolution 123  the Senate earmark disclosure rule  The rule was included as an amendment to S 1  the lobbying and ethics reform bill  by a vote of 98 0 on Jan  16  The House of Representatives has not acted on S  1  which must happen before the bill can be signed into law  Because this important change will not go into effect in the Senate until President Bush signs S  1  Enzi is looking for ways to ensure this important change is made in the Senate as soon as possible  Senators who signed the letter plan to see it approved by unanimous consent on Tuesday April 17  Enzi hopes senators will follow through on the 98 0 vote they took earlier this year  If one senator objects to unanimous approval the resolution will not pass   Unfortunately  recent events indicate that the new Congress may be less inclined to shine light on the congressional favor factory than it previously claimed  the senators wrote  No one opposed this rule when it was put to a roll call vote earlier this year and no one should object to it now  Enzi and the other senators who sent the letter are members of the Republican Executive Steering Committee  a group of conservative senators who work together to promote fiscally sound and socially responsible policies   A copy of the letter follows    end   April 12  2007 Dear Senators Reid and McConnell  We are writing to notify you that we will seek unanimous consent to enact S Res 123  the Senate earmark disclosure rule  on Tuesday  April 17   As you know  this rule was passed the Senate by a vote of 98 0 as an amendment to S 1  the lobbying and ethics reform bill  Unfortunately  the House has not acted on this legislation and therefore  the Senate s new earmark disclosure requirements have not been enacted  With this year s appropriation cycle in full swing and other heavily earmarked bills being drafted  the Senate must act quickly to implement this important ethics reform   S  Res  123 requires disclosure of several types of information related to earmarks contained in committee passed bills  which must be made available in a searchable format on the Internet  This includes the name of the senator requesting the earmark  the name and address of the intended recipient of the earmark  the purpose of the earmark  and a certification that the requesting senator and his or her spouse have no financial interest in the requested earmark  This is simple information that every senator should be willing to provide the public   Unfortunately  recent events indicate that the new Congress may be less inclined to shine light on the congressional favor factory than it previously claimed   For example  the Fiscal Year 2008 earmark solicitation form circulated by the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development did not require the disclosure of the name or address of the intended earmark recipient  nor did it require certification that the requesting senator has no financial interest in the earmark  The earmark solicitation forms circulated by the Appropriations Subcommittees on Interior and Agriculture also failed to require the disclosure of these items  and the only requirement of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education was that earmark requests be submitted on time  These events clearly demonstrate that it s time for the Senate to stop dragging its feet on this critical issue   In November  the American people demanded change in the way Washington operates  A central component of that change was reforming the earmarking process that has led to wasteful spending and political corruption  If we are serious about changing the culture in Washington  we must be completely transparent about how we spend American tax dollars   S  Res  123 will bring needed transparency to the earmarking process and we hope you will encourage every senator to support its immediate enactment  No one opposed this rule when it was put to a roll call vote earlier this year and no one should object to it now   Sincerely   Senator Jim DeMint  R South Carolina  Senator Saxby Chambliss  R Georgia  Senator Tom Coburn  R Oklahoma  Senator John Cornyn  R Texas  Senator Michael Enzi  R Wyoming
