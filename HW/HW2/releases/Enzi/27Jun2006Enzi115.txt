symbol of sacrifice  deserves protection  June 27  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   voted today to prevent the desecration of the United States flag  a universal symbol of freedom  The flag is not just a piece of fabric  decorated with stars and stripes   it is a symbol for what being an American truly means   freedom  justice and liberty  Americans have given their lives for what our flag stands for  Changing the law may not change people  but the discussion alone that we are having should point out what is right and wrong and how other countries view disrespect that we demonstrate for our country  Enzi said  Most Americans want this symbol protected and are hopeful that we will get the votes needed to pass this measure in the not so distant future  Enzi is one of 59 senators who cosponsored Senate Joint Resolution 12  introduced by Senator Orrin Hatch  R Utah  S  J  Res  12 proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States   The resolution was defeated on the floor of the U S  Senate receiving66 of the 67 votes needed  Enzi said the amendment restores the right to the people to choose if their Constitution should protect the American flag   Enzis statement as prepared for delivery on the Senate floor follows   Statement Related to S  J  Res  12  Flag Amendment Senator Michael B  Enzi June 27  2006  Mr  ENZI  Mr  President  I rise in strong support of S  J  Res  12 which proposes an amendment to our Constitution allowing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the resolution introduced by my colleague from Utah  Throughout the years of our nations existence  many brave men and women have fought and died to defend the freedom that our flag symbolizes  We must honor their memory by protecting our flag and preserving this symbol of our nation and the unity of the 50 states  I have heard from veterans across my home state of Wyoming about their service and the importance of the flag in both their military and civilian lives  Our flag is a constant reminder of all those who have sacrificed so much so that we might be free   We are now engaged in a new and different kind of war  We have taken up arms to end the threat of terror  We have been joined by many different nations in that effort  but we are  once again  relying on our own armed forces  the greatest fighting force in the world  With the talents and abilities of our service members  and our support and prayers  I have no doubt they will get the job done  When our deployed troops return home  they will deserve our support and encouragement as they return to their everyday lives  I believe they will also expect us to take action to ensure the symbol of our nation that they carried with them into battle is afforded the protection it deserves  We must ensure our flag is respected and protected as a symbol of our freedoms and the sacrifices that were made  Over the last couple of days  some members of this body have made some misleading statements about what this resolution does  Lets be clear  this piece of legislation does not ban anything  It does begin the process of restoring the authority of Congress to pass a flag desecration statute  A Constitutional amendment will only become law if it is approved by three quarters of the states   I have also heard some of my colleagues claim that the language we are debating is too vague  Again  this is simply the first step in a process  The details will be debated once Congress regains its authority to make laws related to the desecration of the flag  It is then the job of those in Congress to talk about and debate the definition of desecration and what that word will mean in our laws  Again  I believe our flag should be protected as a symbol of this nation and our history  It represents us in military actions  in athletic competitions  diplomacy  and any activity we engage in around the world  The flag helped rally the nation after the attacks of September 11  2001  It calls to mind those who serve on our police  fire and emergency response teams  risking their lives every day to ensure we are safe and protected from harm   Diana and I have a friend from Finland who taught in the United States for a year  She had a flag of Finland that she traveled with while we were debating a flag burning amendment  She couldnt believe that anyone would dishonor their countrys flag by burning it  As a symbol of the country  she couldnt believe that anyone would desecrate it in any way  She couldnt imagine that burning or desecrating the flag of a persons own country could have any positive effect  She believed that what people were doing to the symbol of our nation would have a very detrimental effect overseas  Changing the law may not change people  but the discussion alone that we are having should point out what is right and wrong and how other countries view the disrespect that we demonstrate for our country  People are missing the issue of the protests  They are only seeing the disrespect for the country  We can do better  We must do better  This amendment will help us do better on focusing on problems instead of drama that takes away from ways we can make our lives and our country better  Our flag symbolizes our hope for the future and our willingness to work together to make this world a better place for us all to live  That hope for tomorrow unites us  guides us  and helps to make us truly one nation under God  with liberty and justice for all  I encourage all Senators to support S  J  Res  12 and I yield the floor
