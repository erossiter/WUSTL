2007 November 14  2007   I am very pleased that after many years of false starts we have finally reached agreement on the reauthorization of the Head Start Act  This conference agreement is a bipartisan  bicameral effort that focuses on improving the lives of low income children and their families  We need to ensure that children  regardless of their circumstance  have the opportunity to get the preparation they need to enter school ready to learn and successfully achieve   The Head Start program was established in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty to level the playing field for low income children  The purpose of the program was  and remains  to provide educational and other developmental services to children in very low income families   It recognizes that children do not start school with the same set of experiences or knowledge  Head Start programs provide low income children with a solid base of experiences and knowledge that enables them to start their elementary school experience on par with their more affluent peers   Since its creation  Head Start has been a comprehensive early childhood development program that provides educational  health  nutritional  social and other services to low income preschool aged children and their families  Head Start currently provides services to over 900 000 children and their families through a network of over 1600 public and private agencies  The program also recognizes the important role that families play in a childs development and encourages their regular participation in the program  I want to thank Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller for their commitment to working together on a bipartisan basis  That commitment has resulted in a conference report that meets the needs of the children and families who participate in Head Start programs throughout our nation  I would also like to thank my other colleagues  particularly Senators Alexander and Dodd  and Congressmen McKeon  Kildee and Castle  for their fine work and dedication to this important legislation  The conference agreement before us today builds off of legislation we developed last Congress when I was Chairman of the HELP Committee  Senator Kennedy agreed to use that legislation as the base for this years bill to build on the bipartisan support it had received  Senator Kennedy and I understand that to get anything done  especially in the Senate  you must have bipartisan support   I established the 80 percent rule years ago to help guide my work in Committee and on the Floor It means eighty percent of what Congress works on  we agree to  The other 20 percent is stuff that we may never agree on  but it always seems to get the most attention I think we do our best work when we focus on the 80 percent Legislation seems to move more quickly when we work together in a bipartisan way  This probably wont make headlines  and its not the most sensational sound bite  However  this is the work Congress can and must do to improve the lives of children and families across America  Today  with the passage of the Head Start Conference report  we begin to fulfill this obligation  But our work is far from done  This is just the first of a number of education and training bills we must complete this Congress  With the reauthorization of the Head Start Act  the first bookend is in place  I hope that we can continue to work together on legislation to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act  the Higher Education Act  and the Workforce Investment Act  These four bills represent the continuum of education and workforce training legislation supported by the federal government  with Head Start as one bookend and the Workforce Investment Act as the other  These Acts support programs from preschool  through elementary and high school  into postsecondary education and the workforce  and are critical to maintaining our global competitiveness  We cannot afford to let these programs fall victim to election year politics   I am very pleased that the House Education and Labor Committee has moved forward with a mark up of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act   It is my hope that we can continue this momentum and move to a conference on that important legislation in the very near future  Head Start provides the building blocks children need for success later in life  The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 before us today helps ensure that children in Head Start programs will be better prepared to enter school with the skills necessary to succeed  We have all worked hard to improve and strengthen this Act because we believe in the future success of these children   I am particularly pleased with the accountability provisions in this conference report  The conference agreement includes important changes related to the evaluation and review of grantees  We have taken steps to increase the quality of Head Start  and there is now greater clarity for grantees as to what constitutes a program deficiency   The roles of the governing body and policy councils have been clarified and strengthened while also preserving the important role of parents  It is absolutely necessary and vital that a single entity  the governing body  has fiscal and legal control of the federal grant dollars  That said  we maintain the equally vital and necessary role of the policy councils in setting program priorities  classroom activities  and classroom personnel changes  We believe this will help ensure the continued integrity of the Head Start program for years to come   Parents are their childs first teacher  It is vital that we continue to encourage and strengthen the role parents play in Head Start programs  This conference agreement increases the presence of parents in Head Start programs  strengthens services for families  and provides training and development opportunities for parents that serve on policy councils and governing bodies   Today we are taking the final legislative step toward a comprehensive and bipartisan reauthorization of the Head Start program  As we take this step to reauthorize Head Start it is important that we also review the effectiveness of  and need for  the 57 other early childhood and preschool programs currently receiving Federal support  Many of these programs are programs in name only  Others are ineffective and fail to provide the services children need to be ready for school  We must direct funds to programs that have been shown to be effective at preparing children for success in elementary school  Head Start is a successful program that deserves our continued support  This support should not be diluted by competing programs or the creation of new programs  I  again  wish to thank all the members of both Committees  in particular Senators Kennedy  Alexander  and Dodd  and Congressmen Miller  McKeon  Kildee  and Castle  for getting this done  I also wish to thank all of the staff that worked to complete this reauthorization  Passage of this conference report will ensure that low income children are prepared not only for success in school  but for later success in life   I look forward to getting this conference report to President Bush for his signature as soon as possible                                                         November 2007 News Releases           Browse
