reached on health insurance market reform bill  Enzi says  mark up scheduled  March 3  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today announced a landmark agreement between key stakeholders on a broad ranging health insurance bill to provide more affordable health insurance options to Americas small businesses and working families  and confirmed that the Committee will markup up the bill next week     Working with a diverse group of Senators and business groups representing small business  weve bridged the gap between small business proponents of traditional AHPs and state based interests worried about the prospects of dramatic regulatory changes in health insurance markets  Enzi said Thursday  The bill is cosponsored by Senator Ben Nelson  D Neb   and Senator Conrad Burns  R Mont  Enzi has scheduled a mark up of the bill on Wednesday  March 8th at 10 a m  in the HELP Committee     Senator Nelson said  If we dont do something to help small businesses cope with the costs of health care  soon we will have an entire workforce without health insurance coverage  Health care premiums are experiencing double digit growth annually  small businesses cant keep up with the costs  As a result  fewer employers are offering health coverage and fewer employees are covered  The continuing problem of skyrocketing heath care costs is a grave threat to our working families  I am pleased to be working with the Chairman to find a workable solution to this problem    Senator Burns said  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act represents the best opportunity to bring affordable health insurance to small businesses in Montana and across the nation  I know this is a goal for all Senators  and I look forward to working with members from both sides of the aisle in achieving this important goal     The bill  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act   S 1955  will allow business and trade associations to band their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or statewide basis in direct response to runaway costs that are driving far too many employers and families from comprehensive health insurance  Since 2000  for example  group premiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 percent  compared to an underlying inflation rate of 9 7 percent over the same period     Designed to enhance the market leverage of small groups as well as individual policy holders  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act will  give associations a meaningful role on a level playing field with other group health plans  streamline the current hodgepodge of varying state regulation  preserve the primary role of the states in health insurance oversight and consumer protection  make lower cost health plan options available  and achieve meaningful reform without a big price tag     We are nearing almost five years of double digit growth in health insurance premiums  increases that have repeatedly exceeded more than five times the rate of inflation  Enzi said  This inflationary spiral is lowering the quality of life for countless families and hurting our economy  But those hardest hit are Americas small businesses and families outside of employer provided insurance  Never before has there been a more urgent need to encourage market reforms like those proposed in this bill    It responds to pleas from small business trade groups to be allowed to pool their members and provide group health insurance  called Small Business Health Plans  SBHPs  under the Enzi bill  but will also include safeguards to protect against adverse effects that could result if new group plans were given a blanket exemption from consumer protections available under state laws and regulations    Enzi praised the support of Senator Nelson and Senator Burns  the bills cosponsors  saying  Im pleased to be joined by my colleagues  Senator Nelson and Senator Burns  They bring invaluable experience to this effort and I am grateful for their commitment to this issue     He also praised the cooperation of Senator Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine  Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business  and Senator Jim Talent  R Mo   who have been working for years to give more affordable health insurance options to Americas small businesses  I want to thank them for their constant efforts  Enzi added  We owe them thanks for never losing sight of that important goal
