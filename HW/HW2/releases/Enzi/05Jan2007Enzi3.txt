Congressional agenda  budget and spending reform  fair livestock markets  small business protection  January 5  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   started the first day of the 110th Congress by attending the swearing in of recently elected members  Enzi hopes to work with those members to bring about positive change for Wyoming agriculture producers  small business owners and veterans   One priority for Enzi will be to restore open and fair competition to the livestock market through Enzis Captive Supply Reform Act  The bill would restore competition by making packers and livestock producers bid against each other to win a contract  The bill would require that forward contracts and marketing agreements be traded in open  public markets to which all buyers and sellers could have access  By also requiring these contracts and agreements to have a fixed base price  the bill would end price manipulation   Enzi would also like to increase travel reimbursement rates for veterans traveling to VA treatment facilities through the Veterans Road to Health Care Act  Enzi also hopes to provide a national designation for a renowned Jackson museum through his National Museum of Wildlife Art bill  Another priority are measures that would provide comprehensive federal budget process reform including a biennial budget to stop overspending in Congress   Enzi also looks forward to helping small business by reauthorizing the Small Business Administration to improve technical and financial support for small business  Enzi and his staff will also be working to allow community banks to use loan underwriting systems under the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act  Allowing unrestricted travel to Cuba for all Americans is also a priority for Enzi who has been working on the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act for several years   Committee Assignments Enzi is keeping his key committee assignments  allowing him to move up in seniority  He is the top Republican on the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  As the ranking member  he will resume his work with Senator Ted Kennedy  D Mass   who assumes the chairmanship of that committee for two years  Even though the two senators differ widely on political philosophy  since working together on the HELP Committee Enzi ushered 37 bills out of the committee  The Senate passed 25 bills Enzi worked on or sponsored and the committee reported 352 nominations favorably  Enzi was a sponsor  co sponsor and or played a major role in helping to pass more than two dozen bills that have been signed into law by the President  Enzi looks forward to continued meaningful work of the HELP  Banking  Budget and Small Business Committees  Senator Kennedy and I have demonstrated an ability to find areas of agreement and produce quality legislation despite political views that are sometimes miles apart  One of my goals is to improve the use of health information technology to create a more portable  patient friendly  efficient and less expensive health care system  Im hopeful we can continue and complete this important bill early in this new Congress  Enzi said  Enzi plans to use his position on the Senate Budget Committee to help implement new controls on how the federal government spends taxpayer money  Instituting biennial budgeting  fiscal planning for emergencies and increased disclosure of spending are a few of the measures we should take to improve the fiscal picture  I hope we get some help on these measures from the other side of the aisle  Enzi said  Enzi brings a lifetime of personal experience to the areas of small business and will serve on the Senate Small Business Committee for his 10th consecutive year   There is a tendency for some legislators  especially those from urban areas  to think of small businesses as those who have fewer than 500 employees and shape legislation accordingly  Enzi said  When I work on legislation in every area  I want to know how it will affect the workers and owner of a five person business and the self employed   Enzi will remain a senior member of the Banking Committee  allowing him to continue oversight over federal housing programs  financial institutions  public company accounting and more                                                       January 2007 News Releases           Browse by
