earn highest national certification  December 12  2007 Washington D C   The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards announced recently that 66 Wyoming teachers earned National Board Certification  the highest level of K 12 certification available to educators   The certification is designed to recognize and reward teachers who demonstrate exceptional skill in their designated area of education  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee  congratulated the Wyoming teachers who were honored as part of the 8 500 teacher class of 2007  the largest ever   I extend my sincerest congratulation  in addition to the utmost respect to the 66 teachers of Wyoming who earned this great honor  Education is vital and it is extremely important for our educators to demonstrate a superior ability in their profession  said Enzi   Working in the Senate Education Committee  I see first hand how hard educators work toward preparing our states youth for their future  I look forward to more Wyoming teachers continuing to ensure that our children receive the best education available  Much like the evaluation of other professional fields such as medicine and law  educators who earn National Board Certification face a rigorous evaluation process that includes demonstrating advanced teaching knowledge  skills and practices by way of performance based assessments  Teachers who earn this certification are already certified to teach in Wyoming and have participated in a process that usually takes one to three years to complete  according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards   The National Board Certification is offered in 24 subjects covering 97 percent of the course work offered in K 12 education    Cody  Amy Gerber  Cody High School Joleen Stonehouse  Eastside Elementary Linda Bachmeier  Sunset Elementary Penny Blake  Eastside Elementary   Lovell  Janene Hatch  Cowley Elementary
