federal spending Enzi comes through with  16 billion in savings from HELP Committee October 26  2005 Washington  D C   The U S  Senate Budget Committee today approved a bill that would save about  39 billion in federal spending over five years to help reduce the national deficit  The bill would also pave the way for enhanced grant aid in higher education and improve the safety net for the pension accounts of millions  according to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo    The Budget Committee passed the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Bill of 2005 by a vote of 12 10  Enzi  a member of the Budget Committee  voted in favor of the bill which can now be debated on the floor of the Senate perhaps as early as next week     The reconciliation bill is the product of the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution Congress approved in April charging eight committees in each body of Congress to come up with recommendations for  34 7 billion in savings over five years  The reconciliation bill that passed today is a compilation of savings packages from eight Senate committees  The Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  which Enzi chairs  was one of the Senate committees called on to recommend savings    My committee received the largest reconciliation instruction  nearly 40 percent of the overall target  said Enzi  We exceeded the committees target of savings with an additional  2 75 billion reduction in spending  I am proud to say this bill makes unprecedented strides in deficit reduction with net savings from my committee totaling  16 4 billion over five years  This reduction in spending is vital to help pay down the national debt  especially with the  75 billion in relief Congress recently approved for Hurricane Katrina victims     In addition to providing savings  the HELP Committees budget reconciliation package includes provisions for higher education priorities and pension reform  The education portion of the bill boosts new grant aid for low and middle income students and would help make higher education more accessible and affordable  according to Enzi    Our savings generate higher education opportunities for those with lower incomes  said Enzi    A raise in premiums businesses pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  was also included in the bill to ensure the solvency of the federal insurance agency  The PBGC secures the pension plans for many major companies and airlines in the U S     Under current funding rules  the PBGC is carrying a deficit of  23 billion  a level expected to climb even higher by the end of this year  The agency estimates that U S  pension plans are under funded by a total of  450 billion    This bill required making tough choices about which programs to responsibly reform and how to reinvest subsequent savings while still meeting deficit reduction goals  said Enzi  the only accountant in the Senate     Congress passes a budget every year to outline spending priorities and allow the federal government to function  Budget reconciliation is an optional process  in addition to the yearly budget  to help reduce the deficit by identifying cuts in mandatory spending programs  Budget reconciliation is helpful when Congress faces deficits or has other unexpected spending measures  such as aid for Hurricane Katrina victims    This bill helps to reign in spending and points the federal government in the right direction for being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar  said Enzi  Paying down the national debt not only strengthens our economy it requires Congress to re evaluate budgets  programs and spending  Reducing deficits also helps to ensure our grandchildren are not left to run the government with trillions of dollars in the red    The reconciliation bills submitted by the seven other committees included additional provisions to help Americans  The Banking Committee package included Enzi s Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act  which would better protect the retirement funds and savings of Americans by increasing amounts covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Enzi said this is especially important for rural towns and communities whose depositors depend on their local credit union or bank to deposit their hard earned money  Enzi is a senior member of the Banking Committee     When the House passes its Budget Reconciliation package it will go to a conference committee to reconcile differences between the Senate version     end                                                        October 2005 News Releases           Browse by
