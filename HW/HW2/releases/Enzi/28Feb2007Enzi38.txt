t be the ones hit when terrorists strike Enzi resists increased and long term federal role in terrorism insurance February 28  2007 Washington  D C   Its OK  maybe even necessary to  for the time being  extend the federal safety net for insurers of potential terrorist targets  but renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  TRIA  must continue to scale back the program and include explicit protections for the taxpayer  according to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo  Enzi said the 9 11 attacks were a tremendous jolt to the system and TRIA was put in place to help and it has  but a permanent government subsidy would not be healthy in the long term  He also said that a long term and or increased federal intervention in this area would be bad news for the taxpayer   We must allow the markets to continue to innovate and price terrorism risk accurately  Enzi said today at a Senate Banking Committee hearing  I will be looking for ways to allow the market to grow and strengthen without large government subsidies and without leaving the taxpayer on the hook  Enzi  a member of the Banking Committee  maintains that taxpayer protections such as a ban on punitive damages and controls on out of court settlements are essential to any renewal of the TRIA bill  which expires this year  TRIA provides a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism   Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi Senate Banking Committee Hearing on   Examining the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program 2 28 07 Thank you Chairman Dodd  And thanks to the witnesses for appearing before the Committee today  I hope that your testimony today and the testimony of future hearings on this subject will help us understand the state of the insurance industry since the 9 11 attacks  and specifically  since the last reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002  Our markets are the strongest  most resilient markets in the world  and I believe that  when allowed to operate with minimal interference or influence  are capable of exponential growth and productivity for the people of the United States   Following the September 11th attacks  our insurance markets suffered losses of approximately  32 billion  an enormous amount by any standard  This committee responded by crafting legislation to create a shared public private partnership to allow the markets to stabilize and make terrorism insurance available again  This program was envisioned to be limited and temporary  However  as I am sure some witnesses will testify today  it has taken longer than expected for the markets to recover  So now  in 2007  this committee is meeting to consider another reauthorization of the TRIA program  or possibly make it permanent   As this committee moves forward on this topic  I have some concerns that I will be focusing on  The first is taxpayer liability  In 2001  I supported a bill along with other members of this Committee  including Chairman Dodd  that would have created a temporary program containing explicit protections for the taxpayer in the case of a terrorist attack and lawsuits resulting from an attack  That bipartisan bill never came to a vote on the Senate floor  Many of the taxpayer protections  including a ban on punitive damages and regulations on out of court settlements  were later added  I believe these protections against punitive damage payments and settlements are very important to the American taxpayer and I will be looking to ensure they remain intact should this committee consider reauthorization legislation in the future   I also supported the 2005 TRIA reauthorization because it represented a significant scaling back of the program  allowing the private market to grow it its place  And studies have shown that the insurance market has grown significantly in response  A 2006 report on terrorism risk insurance conducted by the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets found that firms have had more success modeling and managing terrorism risk  reinsurance capacity continues to grow  and insurance companies net worth is rising  This is positive progress as a result of the 2005 reforms that increased event triggers and deductibles for the insurance companies and excluded the number of eligible insurance lines   However  I am concerned that this progress will slow down or stop if the TRIA program is not allowed to continue along this projection  In 2005  the Congressional Budget Office stated that if the government continued to subsidize terrorism insurance it would probably contribute to deferring the private sectors long term adjustment to the increase in risk  This is a significant issue  especially if some are considering an expansion of the program  We must allow the markets to continue to innovate and price terrorism risk accurately  I do not think this can be done with such a large government presence in the marketplace   In a free market  prices are accurate and competition leads to innovation  I am worried that the continued presence of the TRIA program would distort the market in both price and competition  As this committee evaluates TRIA  I will be looking for ways to allow the market to grow and strengthen without large government subsidies  and without leaving the taxpayer on the hook   Thank you Mr  Chairman
