bill approved to better prepare workforce for monumental challenges  Enzi says  September 8  2005 Washington  D C   The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee under the leadership of its chairman  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   passed the bill today that governs major student financial aid programs for college  services designed to help high school students prepare for college  aid to institutions of higher learning and aid to improve K 12 teacher training at postsecondary institutions    Enzi said the Higher Education Amendments Act of 2005  will help retain America s competitive edge in the global economy by ensuring that higher education prepares today s students for the demands of tomorrow s workplace     When the workforce changes  so do the needs of college students  Enzi said Thursday  AAs a result  higher education in America is now in the middle of a revolution and the need for employees with a postsecondary education is growing at a faster rate than ever  The pressure is on to ensure that our students acquire the skills they will need on the job     The reauthorization approved by unanimous committee vote today  is the result of months of bipartisan negotiations between Enzi and the HELP Committee s Ranking Member  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and the House of Representatives     Enzi estimated that by 2015 about 80 percent of jobs will require some postsecondary education or training  However  by 2020  the nation will need 14 million more skilled workers than currently can be provided  Enzi said renewal of the Higher Education Act will help effectively coordinate a range of programs  such as the Workforce Investment Act  the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act  and other federal education and training initiatives  to ensure that America remains competitive for years to come     The availability of seamless lifelong education opportunities is critical for our long term competitiveness  Enzi said  In this global economy  learning is never over  School is never out    To help close the economic gap separating low income students and higher education  the bill establishes the Provisional Grant Assistance Program  ProGAP   a temporary new mandatory program that provides  5 5 billion over five years in grant aid for the neediest students     As approved by the committee  the bill will also improve post secondary education by strengthening the accreditation process  improving access through the use of technology  supporting student financial aid programs  reducing the need for remedial education  helping more students complete high school  and supporting transitions for all students from high school to college    These changes will help today s students attend college and succeed by permitting greater access to distance education  ensuring that students have reliable information about the cost of attending college  and that schools are partners with business in supporting a strong American economy  Enzi said     This legislation amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 by making the following changes    Title I Relaxes the 50 percent rule to permit schools to expand distance education offerings and establishes a new requirement that the Secretary of Education make public information about the costs of attending postsecondary programs    Title II Revises the uses of funds under the State and partnership grants to meet the demand for highly qualified teachers under the ANo Child Left Behind Act as well as enhancing the use of technology in instruction    Title III Reauthorizes programs to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Institutions  Tribal Colleges and Universities  and Professional or Graduate Institutions for minority serving institutions    Title IV B Reauthorizes the Federal Perkins Loan program which permits institutions to operate revolving loan funds  It also allows families with adjusted gross income levels below  20 000 to automatically claim zero expected family contribution in needs analysis     Title V Creates a new grant program to support graduate programs at Hispanic Serving Institutions  similar to programs already established for Historically Black Colleges and Universities    Title VIII Authorizes a series of grant programs to help institutions of higher education develop new curriculum and services related to high skill and high growth occupations    Title X Establishes a temporary new mandatory program  Pro Gap  that provides  5 5 billion in grant aid for the neediest students over five years  and authorizes  1 billion in smart grants targeted at students in their third and fourth years majoring in math  science  or foreign language fields  The legislation provides additional loan deferment for members of the armed services who serve in a combat zone    The next step for the bill is to be considered by the Senate as a whole on the Senate floor before it can be reconciled with the House version of the measure     end                                                       September 2005 News Releases           Browse by
