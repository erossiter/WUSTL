s bipartisan bill to update Ryan White Care Act reauthorization Wyoming funding authorization nearly doubles December 6  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  said the Senate has ended months of stalemate and delivered a victory for people living with HIV AIDS with todays passage of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act  RWCA   a bill Enzi said will  save lives through treatment  and better target funding so that persons with HIV and AIDS have access to high quality care   The passage of this bill is a great victory for people struggling to live with HIV AIDS but who have not been able to receive the care they deserve due to flawed funding formulas under the previous Ryan White CARE Act  Enzi said  We must address the epidemic of today  not yesterday  and make sure the federal funds follow the person being treated  wherever they live  This bill will modernize the RWCA to ensure that federal dollars to treat HIV AIDS finally go to the people who are most in need  On Tuesday  Senate negotiators broke an impasse that had stalled the programs reauthorization since early fall  The final compromise bill passed today modifies the Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act  H R  6143  which the House passed weeks ago  to provide a three year reauthorization  We have spent months at the negotiating table trying to reach that agreement  Enzi said  I am very pleased that we were finally able to reach that agreement  and am deeply grateful to everyone in the Senate who has made passage of this bill a reality   Enzi said he looks forward to the House promptly enacting this life saving bill before the 109th Congress adjourns    Ryan White Wyoming Impact  In FY 2006 Wyoming received about  372 000 in Ryan White funding  Enzi said this new authorization of the act would up that amount to nearly  675 000 per year for three years  Enzi cautioned  however  that his bill only authorizes that funding level  The actual appropriations will be determined through the regular appropriations process  but he is hopeful the dollar amount will be consistent with the authorization  The House must also act first on the reauthorization  The RWCA reauthorization bill approved today by unanimous consent in the Senate will save lives by increasing overall investment in Ryan White programs and revising flawed funding formulas  which currently favor states with urban areas and a longer history of AIDS infections over states where the disease is now spreading most rampantly  It better targets funding so that infected persons have better access to high quality health care  improves accountability for health outcomes  and ensures more equitable treatment opportunities for all persons with HIV AIDS  The Ryan White Care Act is one of our nations hallmark examples of caring and compassion  therefore we must ensure that services and supports are available to all those in need  no matter where they live  Enzi said  I commend the Committees Ranking Member  Senator Ted Kennedy  D Mass   the Committees Ranking Member  for his hard work on this vital legislation  Enzi also praised the commitment of Congressman Joe Barton  R Texas  and Congressman John Dingell  D Mich   to reach an agreement on the RWCA reauthorization  The passage of this bill shows that when we roll up our sleeves and work together across party lines  we can get things done  The Ryan White CARE Act was initiated in 1990 to provide treatment and care for individuals who are in the greatest need of assistance   While we have made significant progress in understanding and treating this disease  there is still much more to do to save lives through education and treatment and to ensure equitable treatment for all Americans infected with HIV AIDS  Enzi said   Key provisions of the bill include  Maintaining funding levels of Title 1 and Title 2 at 95  of FY 2006 funding  and never allowing funding to fall below 95  of what states and cities received in 2006   Requesting that HHS provide a methodology to more accurately convey the need within an area or State so that funding decisions can be more equitable  and  Allowing the law to sunset after the three years  reaffirming the need to readdress the overall structure of the law to better meet the needs of those living with HIV AIDS                                                      December 2006 News Releases           Browse by
