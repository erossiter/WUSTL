regain beef trade with Japan and Korea   May 25  2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senators Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi  both R Wyo   are leading the charge to help Wyomings beef industry by working to resume beef trade with Korea and Japan   In a letter to the Prime Minister of Japan  29 U S  Senators joined Thomas and Enzi in requesting that Japan end the prolonged embargo on beef from the United States before the Prime Ministers scheduled visit to the U S  in June  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the safety of American beef and an agreement between the United States and Government of Japan to resume trade  the embargo on beef from the United States still exists  the senators wrote  We believe you are aware that American beef producers and processors have requested Congress to consider trade retaliation efforts against Japan  Certainly  efforts such as these are never fully positive and should be used only when absolutely necessary  We urge you to resolve this matter and to reestablish beef trade prior to your visit  Thomas and Enzi have been at the forefront of this debate since Japan decided to ban U S  beef in 2003 and cosponsored legislation in 2005 that would impose tariffs on Japan for refusing to import American beef  In a separate letter to the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea  29 U S  Senators joined Thomas and Enzi in emphasizing the importance of beef trade with Korea before negotiations begin on a bilateral free trade agreement with Korea   We are very disappointed and concerned that Korea has yet to take the steps necessary to allow exports to take place  The Korean market is a very important one for Americas ranchers and beef processors  Many American cattle and beef groups have emphasized the importance of regaining full access to the Korean market as part of any free trade agreement  the senators wrote  In 2003  23 percent of total U S  beef exports were sent to Korea   The text of both letters follows and can also

8968 Japan Your Excellency  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the safety of American beef and an agreement between the United States and the Government of Japan to resume trade  the embargo on beef from the United States still exists  We respectfully request that your Administration resolve this prolonged embargo before your anticipated visit in June   This prohibition on trade is unfounded and inconsistent with the guidelines of the mutually recognized World Animal Health Organization  OIE   which establishes the legal framework of a science based approach to safeguard trade for the sake of international solidarity  The U S  Government has taken aggressive and sometimes unpopular actions to address the risks of BSE for more than 16 years  The Government of Japans arbitrary trade constriction has perpetuated severe economic consequences for a very important segment of our agricultural sector  The United States has repeatedly called on Japan to resume trade in American beef  The United States has been respectful and patient of the Government of Japans process for evaluation and rulemaking via the Food Safety Commission  We  too  value scientific methods and understand the value of confidence in governments ability to fulfill their role in ensuring safety  that is why we have taken aggressive actions for the past 16 years  We believe you are aware that American beef producers and processors have requested Congress to consider trade retaliation efforts against Japan  Certainly  efforts such as these are never fully positive and should be used only when absolutely necessary  We urge you to resolve this matter and to reestablish beef trade prior to your visit  We appreciate your response to this inquiry and look forward to working with you on this very important issue  Sincerely     May 25  2006 His Excellency Lee Tae sik Ambassador of the Republic of Korea 2320 Massachusetts Avenue NW Washington  DC 20008 Dear Mr  Ambassador  We respectfully request your personal attention in bringing about a speedy resumption in exports of beef from the United States to Korea  As you know  our respective health officials have reached agreement on import conditions for boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age  We are very disappointed and concerned that Korea has yet to take the steps necessary to allow exports to take place  particularly as our two countries are about to embark upon negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement   The scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that U S  beef is safe for consumers  The United States has put in place aggressive measures  consistent with the World Animal Health Organizations  OIE  international standards  to protect human health  We are confident that the recent visit of Korean officials to the United States demonstrated the efficacy of these measures and has provided assurances about the safety and quality of U S  beef   The Korean market is a very important one for Americas ranchers and beef processors  Many American cattle and beef groups have emphasized the importance of regaining full access to the Korean market as part of any free trade agreement  We believe that it would be essentially impossible to garner the necessary support for a free trade agreement with Korea if it does not include access for all beef and beef products  including bone in and offals   We believe that the proposed Korea U S  free trade agreement will strengthen our two economies and also deepen the friendship between our countries  It is important that we begin our negotiations in the best possible atmosphere  We look forward to working with you on this important issue  and to the resumption of complete U S  exports of beef in the nearest future   Sincerely
