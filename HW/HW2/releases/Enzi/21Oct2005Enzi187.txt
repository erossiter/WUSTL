reveals serious faults with federal programs for the blind  disabled  October 21  2005 Washington  D C   A six month investigation has found two federal programs designed to promote jobs for individuals who are blind or disabled are failing to produce many jobs and instead are helping promote an exclusive class of high paid CEOs  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee said this week    Enzi released a report  prepared by his committee investigative staff  at a hearing Thursday  He called the hearing to examine poor performance of the Randolph Sheppard Act  R S  and the Javits Wagner ODay Act  JWOD   The federal government spends about  2 billion annually on JWOD programs  However  it is unclear how much money goes to fund R S programs  since current contracting data is not available from the Department of Education    I was shocked to learn about the dollar amounts of some of these contracts  We are spending billions of taxpayer dollars on training  supplies and equipment for these programs  but only a few people are benefitting  Meanwhile the 70 percent unemployment for persons with disabilities stares us in the face and I am concerned this may only be the tip of the iceberg  Enzi said  These programs are performing dismally and Congress must improve them  When we know there are currently about 15 million unemployed persons with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 64  this kind of waste under the nose of Congress and several administrations is even more tragic  We are looking for solutions to correct this problem     Investigators found excessive salaries and benefits  including air travel by private jet  personal loans  auto leases and other fringe benefits provided to the CEOs and directors in the JWOD program  As part of the investigation  the Committee examined IRS 990 forms revealing that CEO salaries of similarly sized and similarly situated JWOD 501 c  3  nonprofits earned salaries ranging from  369 000 to  715 000  well above the national average salary for non profit executives  which generally is about  126 000  In one instance a JWOD nonprofit paid its CEO a salary of  0  but provided his consulting company  4 6 million in fees    Enzi called the lavish perks  excessive salaries and self dealing detailed in the report disgraceful and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer money  He also decried the lost potential to produce more jobs during nearly 70 years of neglected oversight of the two programs     Enzi said there are some of these programs that are meeting the goals of helping the disabled  some in Wyoming for instance  but the investigation clearly shows some changes need to be made to the structure of the programs     This is not intended to be an indictment against all the individual programs but the report points to a need for legislative changes on the national level to insure that the programs providing the best opportunities to the most people possible  said Enzi    Similarly  the Randolph Sheppard Act gives certain persons who are legally blind  licensed blind vendors  training  support and a priority to fulfill certain government food service contracts  However  only a select few licensed blind vendors are able to capture the financial windfalls that are available from the program by offering successful bids for pending contracts  These few licensed blind vendors are then able to hire employees or subcontractors to help fulfill the terms of what are often large  lucrative contracts    According to the 2002 Department of Education Randolph Sheppard Act 2002 Report found less than 5 percent of employees hired are blind and that less than 9 percent of the employees hired by licensed blind vendors are blind or have some other disability     The Javits Wagner ODay Act was written to address the needs of individuals living with any severe disability  It requires the federal government to make its purchases of certain goods and services from organizations with a 75 percent rate of direct labor being performed by persons living with disabilities  Through the years  the law has created incentives to hire and retain those living with disabilities  Unfortunately  it also has discouraged those with disabilities to move out of the sheltered employment provided and into the competitive mainstream job market    Enzi pledged that the HELP Committee will look at a number of legislative options to improve the two programs  including       Combining Randolph Sheppard and Javits Wagner ODay into a single program  Streamlining and placing both programs into one line of command and oversight may help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of both programs and increase the opportunities provided for those living with disabilities     Including all persons living with disabilities in the combined program  Options and resources should be based on individual needs instead of disability categories and generalizations      Creating incentives and opportunities for integrated  competitive employment  e g   supported employment  micro enterprise and customized employment   The more employment opportunities that are created  the more individuals the combined programs will be able to assist  An increase in the number of employment opportunities that are available to persons with disabilities will help fulfill the original intent of Congress       Providing training and job placement consistent with a persons capabilities and goals      Requiring accountability  based on outcomes  These programs as currently administered need greater oversight and accountability  As these programs are reformed and modified to make them more accessible and effective  oversight will have to increase to ensure funds are being used efficiently and effectively    end              Laural Henry of Casper and her guide dog Vigor met with U S  Senator Mike Enzi
