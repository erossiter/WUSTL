to prepare for bioterrorism and bird flu  March 16  2006 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  convened a hearing this morning to discuss the state of public health security  bioterrorism preparedness and responses to epidemics like bird flu  Enzi made the following comments during the hearing  Today  we are happy and honored to welcome Secretary Leavitt and a distinguished panel of speakers to testify before us as we formally begin the process of the re examination of our bioterrorism and essential public health security  We need to get prepared for the bird flu and toughen our defenses against bioterrorism  and we do that by making sure all levels of government are coordinated to face these threats    When we last examined these critical issues  there was tremendous cooperation between Democrats and Republicans to address the urgent concerns raised by the events of September 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks  I know that we will work again in a cooperative fashion  recognizing that as members of this committee we are stewards of the public health system    The importance of working together cannot be overemphasized because the enemy we will face already lies in wait on our horizon  Its presence cannot be ignored or denied  We do not know when the threat will be realized and an attack will begin and we cannot identify or categorize what danger we will face  It could be a natural disease like the bird flu or it could be an orchestrated attack by a terrorist group  We cant know for certain what it will be  But  we do know full well that we must have a public health system prepared for it     The 9 11 attacks produced a phrase we have all heard and we should keep in mind during our consideration of this legislation  It has been said that part of the problem was a failure of imagination  an inability to predict in detail the kind of threats that we face  Needless to say  we cannot afford to have another failure to prepare for a threat to our national security    The stewardship of the public health system is not a responsibility the federal government bears alone  but one that is shared with state and local health departments  The federal government cannot provide for all our public health needs  Rather  public health authority begins and ultimately lies with the states  Although we have developed and enhanced key federal resources  the lions share of public health authorities  even during an emergency  rests at the state level  When we last examined this critical infrastructure  Congress understood the need to invest in modernizing our state public health system and to enable them to respond to newly emerging threats     As an accountant by training  I am very comfortable with evaluating a program by measuring the outcomes and effectiveness of past investments  Here we need to do similar evaluations  We have to determine if we are getting enough bang for our buck  We have to make sure that states are using the federal funds wisely and if they have the resources to make all Americans safe from bioterrorism or bird flu     This new reauthorization must provide better coordination  better preparation  bigger and better supply of drugs  vaccines and other medical products and better evaluations of each states preparedness     I would like to take a moment to commend the Bioterrorism Subcommittee and its Chairman  Senator Burr and the Majority Leader  Senator Frist  and their staffs for their persistence and leadership on these issues  I also want to commend Senators Gregg  Hatch  and Hagel for their attention to these issues  In addition  I would like to express my deep appreciation to Senator Kennedy and the Democrats on this committee and their staff as well as Senators Lieberman and Obama for their continued hard work and leadership on these issues     Senator Burr and I look forward to working with the entire HELP Committee in developing the legislation that will lead us to the next level of public health preparedness     Again  thank you for coming here today to engage in this discussion of the threat that lies before us and how we can improve our preparedness  I look forward to working with this Committee and our Subcommittee to do what is needed to ensure a strong national public health system is in place to protect and safeguard the health and well being of all Americans                                                       March 2006 News Releases           Browse by
