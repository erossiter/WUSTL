                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi seeks improvements to long term care systems Laramie and Riverton residents testify at Senate hearing July 10  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Ranking Member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today said that older Americans and individuals with disabilities have insufficient options when accessing long term care and community services  Enzi called on Congress to build on creative solutions to address this growing problem and sought the input of two Wyoming experts on ways to improve the system  Todays long term care  community services  and support system is fragmented and unavailable to most Americans  Enzi said  We need a coordinated response that involves all levels of government  the private sector and most importantly our citizens to provide a streamlined system of care  services  and supports  At todays HELP Committee hearing titled Community Services and Supports  Planning Across the Generations  Enzi said that while most Americans do not have the resources necessary to pay out of pocket for long term care in an institution like a nursing home  there are other  less costly community options available to assist individuals who need help and support  Enzi said that a key provision to a broad health care reform bill that he plans to introduce shortly will build on Aging and Disability Resource Centers programs  ADRCs  to help seniors stay in their homes and communities as they age  ADRCs provide individuals with disabilities  seniors  and their families with information on how they may remain in their own homes with high quality of life for as long as possible through the provision of home and community based services  including supports for family caregivers  Enzi said  My legislation will build on this goal to empower people to live with dignity in their own homes rather than in an institution    Wyoming Testimony  Dr  Deborah Fleming  left   a Clinical Professor of Medical Education and Public Health at the University of Wyoming College of Health Sciences  spoke about her three decades of experience in the fields of aging and public health  Dr  Fleming advocated for more creative use of federal funds  Medicaid and targeted state dollars that can enable states to develop appropriate responses to long term care needs instead of focusing only on the type of disability a person has   Shawn Griffin  bottom   Chief Executive Officer of Community Entry Services in Riverton brought extensive knowledge about providing community based rehabilitation and long term care for persons with disabilities to the hearing  He testified that recruitment and the maintaining of qualified staff is the single greatest challenge faced by service providers today  Griffin also advocated for a review of affordable housing options and program incentives to assist in housing development     Committee on Health  Education  Labor  Pensions Community Services and Supports  Planning Across the Generations  STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD    July 10  2007 Good morning  I would like to first of all thank Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this important issue and for holding this hearing  I would also like to thank our witnesses for taking time out of your schedules to be with us  I particularly want to thank Shawn Griffin  Executive Director of Community Entry Services in Riverton  Wyoming and Dr  Deborah Fleming  Clinical Professor of Medical Education and Public Health at the UW College of Health Sciences in Laramie  for traveling here from my home state  Its a pleasure to welcome all of you to our hearing  Todays hearing will follow up on what we discussed during a hearing that we held in April of 2005 regarding the need for and processes related to advance directives  living wills  health care  and treatment for those who cannot advocate for themselves  The problems and issues we defined and identified at that hearing still exist and must be addressed  Today we will be discussing long term care  community services and supports for millions of people who are aging or who have disabilities  Most of these individuals will be able to participate in society if they have some additional assistance so they are able to maintain and perform the daily living skills so many of us take for granted   Many Americans do not have the resources necessary to pay out of pocket for long term care in an institution  According to the Congressional Budget Office fewer than 7 percent of seniors have annual incomes equal to or greater than the annual cost of a nursing home stay  But there are other  less costly options available to assist individuals that do not need institutional care but do need some extra help and support  These less costly  community based services and supports are being actively pursued and funded through provisions of the reauthorized Older Americans Act that we passed last year  Through programs funded by the Administration on Aging  emphasis is placed on empowering persons with disabilities  older people  their families  and other consumers to make informed decisions about  and to be able to easily access  existing health and long term care options   One of the methods for empowerment is to provide streamlined access to health and long term care through Aging and Disability Resource Center programs  ADRCs   A grantee administering an ADRC in my state will describe this initiative in her testimony  ADRCs provide individuals with disabilities and seniors and their families with information on how they may remain in their own homes with a high quality of life for as long as possible through the provision of home and community based services  including supports for family caregivers  In short  the goal is to empower people to live with dignity in their own homes rather than in an institution   The availability of transportation  housing and a personal care workforce is another topic that will be discussed today by a provider of services to persons with disabilities and aging population of Wyoming   I hope this hearing will make all of us realize that we need to think creatively and figure out ways in which all Americans will be able to access the community services and supports they need at a price that will fit into their individual budgets  We should not require people to become poor to access public programs for the help they need to remain as independent as possible    As we all know  Medicare and Medicaid are the largest funders of long term care  I am mindful that current entitlement programs like Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid face challenges to their solvency that need to be addressed on a bipartisan basis  The 2007 Annual Report by the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees warn that Medicares Hospital Insurance is already expected to pay out more in hospital benefits this year than it received in taxes and other dedicated revenues   Moreover  Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance and the new prescription drug benefit will continue to require general revenue financing and charges on beneficiaries that will grow faster than the economy and beneficiary incomes over time  This will place more and more pressure on the Federal budget  The challenge of providing long term care for baby boomers and beyond should be apart of any solution we propose involving the solvency of those programs which are the primary payers for long term care   Finally  and on a brighter note  I want to reiterate that two of our witnesses will tell us about the success of programs in Wyoming to create a one stop shopping resource center and enhance support services for the aging and disabled citizens of Wyoming as well as other communities throughout the country  Again  I want to thank the witnesses for their participation in todays hearing  I look forward to their testimony                                                          July 2007 News
