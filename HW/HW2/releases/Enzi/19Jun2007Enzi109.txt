should power American cars Enzi cosponsors coal to liquids energy measure similar to one pushed by Senator Thomas June 19  2007 Washington  D C   There is a desire in the United States to move away from dependence on foreign sources of energy  It makes as much sense to meet that goal by using   Wyoming coal as it does using biofuels such as ethanol  To that end  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   joined Energy Committee members Jim Bunning  R Ky   and Pete Domenici  R N M   in sponsoring an amendment today that would supplant some supplies of conventional gasoline with cleaner  more efficient liquid coal   Its in our national interests  both for security and the environment  to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  Coal to liquids technology has been around since the 1940s and there is no question that it can be used today in our transportation markets  It can be transported in pipelines that currently exist  And  because it comes from coal  our nations most abundant energy source  it can be produced at home by American workers  Enzi said  Coal to liquids plants are being developed in    China   They are being developed in other major industrialized nations  but they are not being developed as they should in the   United States   I am concerned that  if we sit on the sidelines  other nations will take advantage of our inaction and our economy will suffer   The amendment being offered today by Sens  Enzi  Domenici  Bunning  Larry Craig  R Idaho and Mel Martinez  R Fla   would establish a requirement for 6 billion gallons of coal to liquid  CTL  fuel between 2016 and 2022  The legislation requires that greenhouse gas emissions from coal to liquids fuels be 20 percent better than conventional gasoline  the same standard applied to cellulosic ethanol in the underlying bill  H R  6   Wyoming Senator Craig Thomas  whose death is still being mourned by   Wyoming and the nation  worked hard in the Energy Committee to include coal to liquids provisions in the underlying Senate energy bill  The proposal was narrowly defeated in the committee last month   Senator Jon Tester  D Mont   offered a coal to liquids amendment today that competes with the amendment cosponsored by Enzi  but Enzi said that proposal is not only impractical  it is technologically unrealistic and could actually hinder coal to liquid technology development   Votes on the coal to liquid proposals are expected this afternoon  Debate on the underlying energy bill is expected to continue throughout the week     Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzion    S  Amdt   1628  Coal to Liquids June 19  2007  Mr  President  I rise today to express my strong support for Senate Amendment 1628  which was offered by my colleagues Senator Jim Bunning and Ranking Member Pete Domenici  The amendment establishes a fuel mandate program for coal to liquid fuel that is identical to the renewable fuel standard  which we are implementing with this legislation   I have listened for the past week as my colleagues have discussed the importance of domestic fuels  They argue that it is essential for us to reduce our dependence on foreign energy barons and that the mandate that this bill lays out for 36 billion gallons of biofuels is an important step in becoming energy independent   I agree with my colleagues in their assessment that we need to produce more domestic fuel  and the amendment that I am speaking in support of does just that  By mandating that we use 6 billion gallons of fuel derived from coal  we will use our nations most abundant energy source to help break    America s addiction to oil   Coal to liquids technologies are not new  The technology has been around since the 1940s and there is no question that it can be used today in transportation markets that currently exist  It can be transported in pipelines that currently exist  And  because it comes from coal  our nations most abundant energy source  it can be produced at home by American workers   Coal to liquids plants are being developed in    China   They are being developed in other major industrialized nations  but they are not being developed in the    United States   I am concerned that  as we sit on the sidelines  other nations will take advantage of our inaction and our economy will suffer   That is why I am speaking today in support of the amendment offered by my colleagues from Kentucky and    New Mexico   The amendment they have introduced is the right approach to moving this issue forward in a way that will truly help the coal to liquids industry and  in doing so  will truly benefit the American people   There is a competing proposal offered by my colleague from    Montana that I will discuss in a moment  but I first want to discuss why this is the right approach if we are to spur investment in the coal to liquids industry  Simply put  if your goal is to create a market for a new energy source  mandates work  We have seen it with the current renewable fuel standard  Since passage of the RFS as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of ethanol plants that exist in the nation and there is no sign of the industry slowing down   We have an opportunity to do so today for the coal to liquids industry  However  we will do so on a smaller scale requiring just 6 billion gallons of coal derived fuel as opposed to the 36 billion gallons mandated for biofuels in this bill  and we will do so with additional environmental standards  Like the underlying legislation  we require the 20 percent lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction language  However  unlike the underlying bill  the amendment requires coal to liquid plants to operate with technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions   In general  I am not a fan of mandates and so I have struggled with this issue  However  if our goal is to reduce our nations dependence on foreign energy sources and to produce more fuel domestically  the current renewable fuels mandate has proven that it is an approach that works   In direct contrast to the success of a mandate is the failure of the loan guarantee program  which has issued exactly zero loans almost two years after the program was created in the Energy Policy Act  The Senator from    Montana s approach of a direct loan program is different than the approach taken in the Energy Policy Act  Although that is the case  I am concerned that his legislation will simply create another loan program that does not work  A direct loan program requires that the federal government loan taxpayer money to private companies to move forward  In the very tight appropriations climate we are currently experiencing  my colleagues are kidding themselves if they think we will spend the kind of money it takes to build one of these plants through a direct loan   In addition to my concerns about the loan program  I am also concerned that the Senator from    Montana s amendment sets forth environmental standards that are technologically unachievable  We have devoted an entire title of this bill  title III  to the research and development of carbon sequestration technologies  I have faith that this research will help us to advance carbon sequestration efforts  but I do not believe we are there yet  As such  the Tester amendments requirement for 75 percent sequestration seems unreasonable   I am not a technical expert  and so I have spoken to the people who are planning coal to liquids facilities  None of the developers whom I have questioned have suggested that they can achieve the 75 percent mandated by the Tester amendment   Both of the Democratic and Republican proposals will reduce greenhouse gases in a major way  Both of these amendments require a 20 percent improvement  But the Democratic proposal goes too far and sets standards that are not technologically achievable   My colleagues are faced with a choice  The amendment offered by Senators Bunning and Domenici takes a proven approach of mandating that we use a domestic fuel  It adds responsible and reasonable environmental standards  and it will work to spur development of a domestic coal to liquids industry   If we truly want to see coal to liquids plants built in the    United States   only one of the approaches before the Senate works  That approach is the one offered by my colleagues Senators Bunning and Ranking Member Domenici  I yield the floor                                                              June 2007 News Releases           Browse by
