and Republicans working to provide relief  April 17  2007 Washington  D C   Many Americans spent the weekend huddled over forms  receipts and a calculator preparing taxes  U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   is spending time this week with colleagues working on legislation that would help Americans spend fewer days working to pay Uncle Sam   We tax what moves  We tax what doesnt move  We tax it when you buy it  We tax it when you sell it  We tax you for living  we even tax you for dying  It is time to stop this way of governing and reform and simplify the system to decrease the burden on Americans  said Enzi  an accountant and former small business owner   Enzi co sponsored a Republican tax package  the Invest in America Act  introduced today that would provide tax relief for teachers  families who adopt  Americans with aging parents  married couples  parents  students and small businesses  The proposal would permanently repeal the death tax and make the increased child tax credit  the marriage penalty relief  the adoption tax credit  the tuition deduction and the teacher deduction permanent  The bill would also make the increased expensing limits for small businesses permanent as well as the new income tax rates and capital gains and dividends rates permanent  The IRS reports that Americans spend 30 hours filing a 1040 form and more than six in 10 Americans have to hire someone to help prepare their returns  Small businesses spent the most time filing returns  said Enzi  The federal government takes enough of our money and our time  I will work with Congress on more legislation this year that would give some of both back to Americans   The Invest in    America Act  Individual Income Tax Rates  Every American taxpayer benefits from the current income tax structure  The lower rates have also been integral to our economic growth  which has averaged 3  per year  Lower marginal rates encourage Americans to work harder and be more productive  which leads to a growing economy  low unemployment  and improving living standards for all    The Invest in America Act proposes to make the income tax rates permanent   Child Credit  Marriage Penalty Relief  Other Family Provisions  The  1 000 per child tax credit  marriage penalty relief  and other provisions enacted in recent years have been a tremendous help to millions and millions of middle and lower income families    The Invest in America Act proposes to make the increased child tax credit  the marriage penalty relief  the adoption tax credit  the tuition deduction  the teacher deduction  and many other provisions permanent   Death Tax Repeal  If Congress fails to act  more than 130 000 families each year starting in 2011 will have to confront the estate tax  Family businesses  farms  and ranches are hit the hardest  as they lack the resources to plan around the tax or to pay it    The Invest in America Act proposes to make repeal of the death tax permanent   AMT Repeal  The individual alternative minimum tax  AMT  was a misguided attempt to tax just the rich  but which has ended up hitting more and more middle income families    The Invest in America Act proposes to permanently repeal the AMT   Capital Gains  Dividends  The economy has grown strongly since the lower investment rates were enacted in 2003  as it became easier for businesses to attract capital to grow and as it became more appealing for investors to put their hard earned savings at risk in the markets  With over half of all Americans owning stock  large numbers of middle income families and seniors are benefiting from the lower rates  including the 5  rate  which drops to 0  in 2008    The Invest in America Act proposes to make the capital gains and dividends rates permanent   Small Business Expensing  The increased expensing limits have helped countless small businesses  which create most of the new jobs in the    U S    expand their operations    The Invest in America Act proposes to make the increased expensing permanent   RD Tax Credit  Countries compete aggressively for high value RD projects  One important tool the    U S  uses to attract these investments is the restructured RD tax credit    The Invest in America Act proposes to make the RD tax credit permanent   Tax Simplification  The    U S  tax system imposes a costly and annoying burden on taxpayers  with filers spending an average 30 hours to complete the typical Form 1040  Six in 10 Americans opt instead to hire a professional  The billions of dollars spent each year simply complying with the tax system could be put to a much better use                 Related Resources     33 8 KBs                                                        April 2007 News Releases           Browse by
