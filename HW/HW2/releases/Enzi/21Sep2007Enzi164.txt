                                                                                                                                                                                      Enzi welcomes Wyoming witness Laramie resident testifies in Washington about women  s business September 21  2007       Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   member of the Senate Small Business Committee and former small businessman  welcomed a familiar Wyoming face to the hearing room this week to discuss issues important to women entrepreneurs   Rosemary Bratton of Laramie  Executive Director of the Wyoming Womens Business Center gave her testimony during the Expanding Opportunities for Women Entrepreneurs hearing of the Senate Small Business Committee  Enzi introduced Bratton and his opening statement  as well as Brattons testimony are below    Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi Senate Small Business Committee Hearing on  Expanding Opportunities for Women Entrepreneurs 09 20 2007  I trust that todays testimony will allow the Committee to better understand how the condition of the programs that assist women in starting and operating their own small businesses  It has long been known that women wishing to start their own small businesses of their own face significant challenges  The Womens Business Center Program has been successful in improving opportunities for women to enter small business ownership and I hope that this hearing will be able to reveal the areas of greatest need where these programs can be improved   I am especially pleased to welcome this morning a former small business owner from Wyoming who currently serves as the Executive Director of the Wyoming Womens Business Center WWBC   Since 1999  Rosemary Bratton has worked to establish and operate the Wyoming Womens Business Center in Laramie  Starting as a project of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault  the WWBC emerged recently as a distinct and separate organization that has worked to meet the needs of working women across Wyoming  Ms  Bratton will be able to share with us valuable insight about her experience starting a WBC in a rural state like Wyoming and working with the Small Business Administrations Office of Womens Business Ownership   My experience as a small business owner tells me that providing consistent and reliable service to your customers is what keeps you in business  Womens Business Centers have reported success in providing services to women when the centers are given the appropriate resources  Lately  these centers have not received that support in a consistent manner  I trust that these proceedings will provide the members of this Committee with a better idea of how business can be improved with WBCs   I also look forward to hearing about the status of the Womens Procurement Program  For some time  the implementation of that program has been delayed and I am interested to know when the set aside for women owned businesses will be available  I cannot over emphasize the importance of providing women owned small businesses access to federal contracting opportunities  Procurement can be a difficult and overwhelming process for small businesses who have limited resources      Testimony of Rosemary Bratton Executive Director  Wyoming Womens Business Center US Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship September 20  2007   Mr  Chairman and members of the Committee  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today  The Wyoming Womens Business Center  WWBC  began in 1999 as a project of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault  WCADVSA  while I was Executive Director of that organization  Since its inception the WWBC has been serving economically and socially disadvantaged women and continues in this work today as a separate 501 c 3 non profit  As an alternative to  or in addition to  accepting positions in low wage  dead end jobs  the WWBC encourages entrepreneurs to create their own opportunities by starting small businesses   I can honestly say that it was my vision and my personal experience that led to the creation of the WWBC  Long before I began my career in the field of working with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault  I experienced first hand the economic struggles that many Wyoming women endure and the success that can come from small business ownership  After a failed marriage and faced with caring for my three boys as a single parent with few resources  I started a cleaning service from my home in Story  Wyoming  Mopsy and Dusty  the Cleaning Company  no house to big  no pad to small  from floor to ceiling we cleaned it all  On some days I was Mopsy  other days I was Dusty and on many days I was both  In addition to Mopsy and Dusty to further increase our income I made and sold purses created from recycled jeans  The success of my small businesses enabled me to raise my children and earn a college degree  The experience began a commitment to work as an advocate for women who are socially and economically disadvantaged   In Laramie  our offices are located on the University of Wyoming Campus and the Laramie Civic Center  Currently one outreach office is located in Cheyenne and another is planned to be located in the central part of the state  The target service area for the WWBC is the entire state of Wyoming  Currently there are three employees  the Executive Director  an Administrative Assistant and our Director of Client Services  Wyoming has been described as a small town with very long streets  The states 98 000 square miles make it the 9th largest state in land area but its population of less than 550 000 is the lowest in the nation  More deer and antelope inhabit Wyoming than people  92  of our state is considered rural  The states open prairies  intimidating mountain ranges  and long empty roads combine to form a unique geography  Weather conditions can be extreme  with snowfall possible any month of the year  Winters are often long and harsh  with low temperatures  strong winds  and driving snow storms making travel difficult  This combination of rural character  geographic obstacles and harsh climate creates economic distress for many Wyoming residents  Other than the minerals industry  economic opportunities with large industry are few  Albany  Fremont  Niobrara  Lincoln and Hot Springs counties  as well as the Wind River Indian Reservation qualify as Historically Underutilized Business Zones  Wyomings economy has been improving although the high paying mineral industry employs primarily men  Work that is traditionally considered womens work  nursing  teaching  office work  is still undervalued with wages for these positions much lower in Wyoming than in other states  The gender based disparity in Wyoming continues to be the highest in the nation  with the average Wyoming woman earning 57  to 67  of what a man earns for full time  year round work  While Wyomings vastness contributes to its natural beauty  it also creates isolation that keeps women business owners from meeting  networking and sharing information  WWBC programs bring women entrepreneurs together throughout the state by sponsoring roundtables located in six communities and participating in other economic related functions  small business expos and conferences   WWBCs services and activities offered to Wyomings women owned small businesses include   WWBCs Microloan Program started in 2000 and provides access to capital through loans for business start up or expansion to those who are unable to secure financing through traditional means  The majority of the WWBCs loan capitalization is from the US Small Business Administrations Microloan program  which makes loans to intermediary relenders  who in turn make smaller loans locally  Most loans are for amounts ranging from  500 to  10 000 although the WWBC can approve loans up to  35 000  Any interest  application fees or late fees are reinvested into the loan program    Individual Development Account  IDA  Program was started in 2004 by the WWBC  It matches the savings of people with low incomes to encourage them to save towards acquiring specific types of assets  including purchasing or repairing a home  business capitalization or expansion and higher education  The WWBC matches participants savings at a rate of 1 1 up to  2 000   Works of Wyoming  WOW  services include skill based education and mentoring to help artists and craftspeople achieve mastery of their art  entrepreneurial education and mentoring that empowers women to establish their own art based and often home based business  As funding allows WOW will promote retail outlets and an online marketplace to position products in niche markets  Any revenues above expenses generated by these sales will be reinvested in the program  Business technical assistance  training  and counseling are offered to women on a variety of business topics  The goal of these programs is to assist clients to develop their capacity for business planning and management  and ultimately make their businesses more successful  These programs were started in 1999 when the WWBC was still a project of the WCAVSA and provide the foundation for all of the WWBCs other programs  Minimal fees may be charged to offset the expenses incurred in providing some of these services  Networking opportunities include roundtables as previously mentioned where participants learn from invited speakers as well as from each other on a wide range of business topics including marketing  business insurance  financing and banking relationships  accounting  time management and organizational skills  employment issues  bankruptcy laws  legal considerations of business structure  business research and business planning  Through the roundtable format  the WWBC encourages more experienced business owners to mentor those with less experience  Personal financial management training and counseling provides information on various personal financial topics including budgeting  understanding credit  and basic financial products  The programs purpose is to assist women to solidify the personal financial foundation upon which they build their businesses  Internet training is offered on our website   We have partnered with Hewlett Packard for online operations and management  finance  communications  marketing and technology management  This training program is interactive incorporating audio and video  In addition WWBC has purchased an extensive QuickBooks and Microsoft Office training module through Custom Guide  This online training module allows the user to work at their own pace while WWBC can track each persons progress and time spent on the chapters of each training program    Collaboration is essential to the WWBCs mission  We work in partnership with the Small Business Administrations District Office located in Casper  WY  Wyomings Small Business Development Center  the Wyoming Business Council  the University of Wyoming  Wyoming State Division of Vocational Rehabilitation  Wyoming Workforce Services and the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault  The WWBC also partners with statewide banks and other financial institutions for support for networking events including space  food and financial contributions for roundtables and conferences  The Wyoming State Legislature through the Wyoming Business Council has generously supported the WWBC during the last eight years and has committed  209 000 to support the WWBC in the coming year   There is a strong need for rural frontier Women Business Centers  The WWBC is not only vitally necessary to the economy of Wyoming  but also appeals to personal interests by helping women forge better lives for themselves and their children in the state with the highest gender wage gap in the nation   Thank you
