budget problems   May 17  2007 Disappointing  failed  offensive are all words U S  Senator Mike  R Wyo   used to describe the budget resolution put together by Senate and House Democrats    If this budget bill were the script for a movie  it would definitely be a horror movie  Enzi said  Unrestrained  unsustainable spending  higher taxes  no meaningful entitlement reform and zero savings  these are hardly theplansfor a solid fiscal blueprint    The Senate passed the bill52 40 with Enzi voting against the measure  The House passed the same resolution earlier today    Enzi said the documentwas largely put together by Democrats  but the final product matters more than the process    Not being included in the crafting of this budget is far less important than the fact that this budget does little to help our economy  said Enzi  a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee  From the day we marked up this budget in Committee  this document has been a tax and spend  big government budget  It also fails to make meaningful reductions in mandatory spending    Enzi noted  however  that the budget does contain some worthy priorities    I am happy to see  however  that this Conference Agreement retains the reserve fund for health information technology legislation that I worked to get into the Senate budget resolution  The HELP Committee is currently working on a bill to increase the widespread adoption of health IT  This isa bill that will eventually do away with clip boards in doctors offices Enzi said in a statement for the Senate record   Enzi is also pleased the budget conference agreement includes a deficit neutral reserve fund for improvements in health insurance coverage     This spring  I have been talking to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about writing legislation that  reduces the number of uninsured  improves health care quality and access  and reduces the growth in the cost of private health insurance by facilitating market based pooling across state lines  My hope is that a common sense proposal similar to this would meet the criteria established in this reserve fund  Enzi said       Wyoming diamonds among the rough Looking past the budget  which sets broad spending priorities  Enzi advocated for actual appropriations that would help    Wyoming strengthen the nation through better use of our energy supplies    As our nations most abundant energy source  coal must play a central role in electrical generation for years to come  In order for that to happen  we need to continue finding ways to make coal generation cleaner  Programs like the Clean Coal Power Initiative will play a major role in making that happen and so I support increased funding of this program  Enzi said  We also need to see proper funding of the federal loan guarantee program  Federal loan guarantees can play an important role in developing new energy projects    Enzi also spoke in favor of funding for rural air service  rural housing  small business and agriculture  His full remarks can be accessed at enzi senate gov    The budget sets limits on total spending under broad categories  Decisions on specific programs will be made by authorizing committees of jurisdiction and the appropriations committees    Statement of Senator Michael B  Enzi    FY2008 Budget Resolution Conference Report  May 17  2007  Mr  President  As the Senate debates the FY2008 Budget Resolution Conference Agreement  I want to first acknowledge the hard work of Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg throughout this Fiscal Year 2008 budget cycle  While I do not always agree with the Chairman of the Budget Committee  I do appreciate the hard work it takes to get a budget through Congress   I also want to acknowledge the importance of writing and passing a Budget Resolution  This document is a vital part of the operation of Congress  It sets a fiscal blueprint that Congress will follow for the year  and establishes procedural hurdles when these guidelines are not adhered to  Because this is such an important document  I am even more disappointed with the fact that this was not a bipartisan process   Not being included in the crafting of this budget is far less important than the fact that this budget does little to help our economy  From the day we marked up this budget in Committee  this document has been a tax and spend  big government budget  It also fails to make meaningful reductions in mandatory spendingeven though our Nations mandatory health programs are growing each year by more than 6   an unsustainable level   Its not right to overspend nowand pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren to pay later  Its regrettable that during this budget debate  the Senate was unable to work across party lines and do more to shore up our economic future   As my colleagues may know  this conference report contains a reconciliation instruction for the HELP Committee  where I serve as the senior Republican Senator  This reconciliation instruction directs the HELP Committee to produce  750 million in deficit reduction over 6 years  The Senate passed Budget Resolution did not contain any reconciliation instructions  However  the House passed Budget did contain such an instruction that called for  75 million in savings  Reconciliation became a conferencable item  because the differences between the two chambers needed to be resolved   Recall that during Senate consideration of the Budget Resolution this year  we never debated reconciliation  Chairman Conrad chose not include it in his budget  That was his choice  He held hearings earlier this year relating to our Nations long term fiscal challenges  and I commend him for that  Health and Human Services Secretary Leavitt testified before the Budget Committee in March that the demand on federal general revenues for Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security exceeds  50 trillionthats Trillion with a Tover the next 75 years based on current law and program operations  But the Senate passed Budget  which I voted against  failed to address these challenges   Now today we are debating a Conference Agreement that directs the HELP Committee to reduce the deficit by just  750 Million over 6 years  Mr  PresidentI said million  with an M  Id like to explain to my colleagues whats really going on in this budget   In his FY2008 Budget request  the President proposed nearly  18 billion in savings related to higher education  Most of these savings are achieved by cutting subsidies the banks are currently receiving  Democratic leadership is also looking at reducing many of these same subsidies in the  20 billion range  and possibly even larger   This Conference Agreement allows for these mandatory higher education proposals to be advanced through the reconciliation process  That means limited debate  strict germaneness requirements on amendments and a simple majority vote to pass the bill  But with just a  750 million savings requirementthe process will be used to fast track massive new entitlement spending  A more honest reconciliation and deficit reduction debate would be to limit the new spending in a reconciliation bill to 30 or even 40  of the total savings  But right now this Budget is teed up to allow  20 billion or more in new spending  with the deficit reduction component amounting to merely a rounding error in a gigantic spending proposal   I wrote a reconciliation bill in 2005 when I had the privilege of chairing the HELP Committee  The title that I authored reduced the deficit by  15 5 billion over 5 years  In addition to the deficit reduction  the bill created new mandatory grant aid proposals  Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants  It also increased loan limits so students could better finance their education  That reconciliation bill spent roughly  9 billion on brand new student benefits  all fully paid for  About 40  of my total savings was spent on new programs  and the remaining funds paid down the deficit   But this budget we are debating today says if the majority party can find  20 billion or even  30 or more billion in savings  they can fast track and spend 95  of those savings  This is an offensive use of the reconciliation process  This year  if just one half of the Senate authorizing Committees could equal the level of deficit reduction that the HELP Committee achieved in 2005  the deficit would be reduced by an additional  100 billion   During the Budget Committee and floor consideration of the Resolution  I also spent a great deal of time on health related issues  I am greatly disappointed that this Conference Agreement contains a deficit neutral reserve fund that encourages repealing the non interference clause from the Medicare law  This is an issue that came before the Senate a few weeks ago and failed  It failed because it is bad policy  The non interference language in the Medicare law prevents the federal government from fixing prices on Medicare drugs or placing nationwide limits on the drugs that will be available to seniors and the disabled  I support this language 100 percent  but this Conference Agreement supports striking this language that protects patients  Decisions on what drugs should be available should be made by seniors and their doctors  not by politicians   I am happy to see  however  that this Conference Agreement retains the reserve fund for health information technology legislation that I worked to get into the Senate budget resolution  The HELP Committee is currently working on a bill to increase the widespread adoption of health IT  What does that mean  That means we are working on a bill that will eventually do away with clip boards in doctors offices  Every time I go to the doctor  someone hands me a clip board to fill out everything I can remember about myself  This is no easy task  and as I get older  this task gets even harder  Wouldnt it be great if instead  doctors had electronic medical records that could keep track of this information for me  If my doctors computer in Wyoming could talk to my doctors computer in    Washington   Well  the bill I am about to introduce is the first step in making that happen  And  if that does happen  and most of the doctors and hospitals in this country start using health IT  the RAND Corporation estimates we could save between  80 and  162 billion a year  That is amazing savings and I am happy to see that this language was included in this Conference Agreement   I am also pleased to see that the Conference Agreement includes a deficit neutral reserve fund for improvements in health insurance coverage  This Spring  I have been talking to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about writing legislation that  reduces the number of uninsured  improves health care quality and access  and reduces the growth in the cost of private health insurance by facilitating market based pooling across state lines  My hope is that a common sense proposal similar to this would meet the criteria established in this reserve fund   As we move forward and complete this resolution and start working on the FY 2008 appropriations bills  I wanted to mention a few programs that are important to    Wyoming    As our nations most abundant energy source  coal must play a central role in electrical generation for years to come  In order for that to happen  we need to continue finding ways to make coal generation cleaner  Programs like the Clean Coal Power Initiative will play a major role in making that happen and so I support increased funding of this program   We also need to see proper funding of the federal loan guarantee program  Federal loan guarantees can play an important role in developing new energy projects  It is my hope that we can provide enough funding to get some of these projects off the drawing board  and most specifically  I hope that we provide funding to the Department of Energy to move forward with loan guarantees for coal to liquids projects  Coal to liquids technology has the potential to help reduce our nations dependence on foreign energy barons and should be explored   In addition  funding for rural air service and maintenance is essential for states like    Wyoming   Without federal support through essential air service and airport improvement programs  many rural communities would have no commercial air service and extremely limited general aviation  I hope this issue will be part of the debate on the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration this year  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this funding  not only as a matter of dependability  but also as a public safety issue   I want to mention two additional issues of great importance to    Wyoming and other rural states  housing and homelessness  The McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act is the primary law through with Congress funds homelessness programs in the    United States   Unfortunately  rural states have historically received very little of this money  Yet rural states must confront homelessness too  and the geographic size of our states further complicates our efforts  In response to this  Congress authorized the Rural Homelessness Grant Program in 1992 under the McKinney Vento Act  This program provides funding for transitional housing and education services in rural states  as well as rental or down payment assistance  The intent of this program is to level the playing field between rural and urban states  Unfortunately  this program has never been appropriated funds since its creation  so the purpose of this program has never been fulfilled  and rural states continue to suffer  This can be a valuable program for rural states like    Wyoming    I would like to briefly call attention to the Small Business Administration  I serve on the Small Business Committee and enjoy using my small business experience to help make a difference in the lives of many people in    Wyoming and throughout the country  We are working in    Wyoming to stabilize and steadily grow our small businesses through the utilization of the Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  program  The risk and expense of conducting serious research and development efforts are often beyond the means of many small businesses  especially rural small businesses  By reserving a specific percentage of federal RD funds for small business  SBIR enables small businesses to compete on the same level as larger businesses and stimulate high tech innovation in their rural states   The FAST and Rural Outreach programs are congressionally authorized programs that provide technical assistance that helps    Wyoming s small businesses utilize the SBIR program   Finally  the Agriculture Committee has a big task in reauthorizing the Farm Bill this year  Writing a tight budget that will help us reach our long term fiscal goals is a priority for me  Though you cannot tell by the name  the Farm Bill affects the lives of many unsuspecting Americans  Policies and projects for distance learning  conservation  food assistance  renewable fuels  and our forests are provided for in the Farm Bill  in addition to the well known commodity programs   So in closing  I want to inform my colleagues that this is not a courageous budget  It fails to make the tough choices  And it passes the debts we carry today on to our children and grandchildren  I urge my colleagues to oppose this budget  and vote NO on the Conference Agreement   Iyield the floor
