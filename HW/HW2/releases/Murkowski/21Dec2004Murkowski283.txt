SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES NEW COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT FOR 109TH CONGRESS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced she will sit on a new committee for the 109th Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  
 In addition, Sen. Murkowski announced that she will continue to serve on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Indian Affairs Committee. "It is an honor to be selected to sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," Sen. Murkowski said. "We have an aggressive agenda for the next legislative session and I look forward to making real progress in areas like energy, transportation, health care, and foreign policy." The Senate Foreign Relations Committee evaluates all treaties with foreign governments; approves all diplomatic nominations; and writes legislation pertaining to U.S. foreign policy, the State Department, Foreign Assistance programs, and many other associated topics. "I believe that my committee assignments will continue to give Alaska a strong voice in the U.S. Senate," Sen. Murkowski said. Committee assignments must still be approved by the full Republican Caucus and Subcommittee chairmanships will be announced at a later date.
   NOTE ON SELECTION PROCESS: The Senate Committee on Committees negotiates the process of assigning Senators to committees. After general elections, Senate party leaders negotiate the party ratios on standing committees. Once committee size and ratios are determined, each party nominates colleagues for committee assignments. The Chairman of the Committee on Committees is responsible for soliciting preferences for committee assignments, then matches those preferences with vacancies on standing committees.
