DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR ANNOUNCES COASTAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDS FOR ALASKA
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today applauded an announcement by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne that Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) Funds have been calculated.  
   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the CIAP which authorizes funds to be distributed to Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas producing states to mitigate impacts of oil and gas activities. Under the CIAP, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to distribute to producing States and coastal political subdivisions $250 million for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2010. 
   Under the formula, Alaska will receive $2.425 million in FY 2007 and FY 2008, of which $1.576 million goes directly to the State and $848,750 goes to local governments. The allocations can be found at the following mms website. 
   "In 2005, Congress approved funds to oil and gas producing states to mitigate the impacts of OCS oil and gas activities," said Senator Murkowski. "I am pleased to see that the Department of the Interior will soon be approving grants to the State of Alaska and local communities under this program."
