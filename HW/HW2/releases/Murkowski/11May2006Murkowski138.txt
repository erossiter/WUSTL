SEN. MURKOWSKI INTRODUCES RURAL PHYSICIANS RELIEF ACT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) in introducing the "Rural Physicians' Relief Act of 2006." This legislation will both assist physicians who currently provide primary care in rural America and provide an incentive to encourage physicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas.  
   "Physicians who provide health care in the most rural locations in American face challenges unlike their more urban counterparts," said Senator Murkowski. "As a result, many of these areas tend to be the most medically underserved areas in the nation - areas where medical care is often urgently needed. It is my hope that our efforts will encourage physicians to practice in rural Alaska and throughout rural America." 
   Patient access to health care in Alaska continues to be limited because of severe provider shortages. The state has 25% to 30% fewer physicians than is needed by the population, a total which ranks Alaska near the bottom in terms of physicians per capita in the country. The state needs to attract a minimum of 500 new doctors in order to meet the current national average of physicians per capita. An American Medical News article recently highlighted Alaska's problematic situation, noting that "Alaska has long ranked among the worst states in terms of physician supply." 
   The Rural Physicians Relief Act of 2006 will give a physician who is a primary health services provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he or she provides services in a designated "frontier" area. In addition, physicians who treat a high percentage of patients from frontier areas would also be eligible for the tax credit.
