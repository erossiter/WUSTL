SEN. MURKOWSKI SPONSORS RESOLUTION TO HELP PROTECT RIGHTS OF IRAQI WOMEN
  The Senate, by unanimous consent, passed a resolution co-sponsored by Sen.  
 Lisa Murkowski late Friday to support the efforts of Iraqi women to protect their legal rights in the Iraqi Constitution. The resolution (S. Res. 231), "Protecting Democracy for Women in Iraq," is also sponsored by Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA). 
   The resolution pledges to support the efforts of Iraqi women to participate fully in a democratic Iraq. It acknowledges the importance of protecting equal rights and opportunities for women under the law and in society. Finally, it encourages the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly to adopt a Constitution that grants women equal rights and opportunities under the law and works to protect those rights. The final draft of the constitution will be presented to the Iraqi Constitutional Committee on August 15, 2005. 
   "This is an important time for the people of Iraq, especially women," said Murkowski. "Women's participation is essential to building a viable democracy in Iraq and they should be provided equal rights under the constitution. These women are risking their personal safety to protect their rights and ensure a better society now and in the future. It is important that the United States recognize the efforts of these women and do everything we can to support them." 
   The proposed constitutional draft would allow domestic matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance to be settled in religious courts under Islamic law. These changes would reverse the advancements in equality made to date, greatly affecting the rights of all Iraqi women.
