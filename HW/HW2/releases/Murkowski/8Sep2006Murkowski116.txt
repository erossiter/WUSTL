SEN. MURKOWSKI URGES GREATER AWARENESS OF CONSEQUENCES OF DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY
  On the eve of National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day, Sen. Lisa Murkowski today urged all Americans to continue to spread the word that no amount of alcohol is safe to consume during the nine months of pregnancy. Sen. Murkowski sponsored the resolution designating September 9th 2006 as National Fetal Spectrum Awareness Day.  
   Tragically, Alaska has the highest rate of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD) in the nation. Furthermore, among Alaskan Native communities, the rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the state. 
   "By continuing to raise awareness, we can hopefully eliminate the harm that drinking during pregnancy causes our most vulnerable population - our children," said Senator Murkowski. "Tomorrow, on Fetal Alcohol Awareness Day, let us remember the innocent babies inflicted with this disorder and then let us imagine the potential that these babies could have attained but for the damage done by alcohol." 
   National Fetal Spectrum Awareness Day encourages the American people to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and to ensure healthier communities throughout the United States. On this day, Americans are also encouraged to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9, 2006, to remember that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any alcohol.
