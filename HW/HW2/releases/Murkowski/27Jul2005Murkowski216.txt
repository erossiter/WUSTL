SEN. MURKOWSKI WINS SENATE APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION OF REYNOLDS CREEK HYDRO PROJECT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced unanimous Senate approval of legislation to extend the license of the proposed Reynolds Creek hydroelectric project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast.  
 The legislation gives the Haida Corp., the sponsor of the project, up to six additional years to begin construction of the project. 
   Murkowski introduced legislation approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this spring to extend the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license for the proposed five-megawatt power project. FERC had issued a license three years ago for the 20-foot long, six-foot high dam on Reynolds Creek. The project including a 3,200-foot penstock, a powerhouse and two turbine units and a transmission line to take power produced by the hydro project to Hydaburg. 
   Murkowski said the extension was needed to give more time for the island's economy - and electrical usage needs - to recover from the downturn caused by the reduction in logging efforts. The project will produce power that is less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the current diesel-generated power used on the island. 
   The bill (S. 178) now heads to the House of Representatives for its approval.
