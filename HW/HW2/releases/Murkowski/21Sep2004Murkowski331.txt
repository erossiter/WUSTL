SEN. MURKOWSKI: RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE IMPACT AID CONSTRUCTION GRANTS TO IMPROVE LOCAL FACILITIES
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that four rural Alaska school districts with large numbers of Alaska Native students will be receiving nearly $11.5 million in federal education aid to help them repair, renovate or build school facilities in rural districts with a large federal land presence. 
   The money, coming from the federal Impact Aid Discretionary Construction Grant program, is a direct result of the No Child Left Behind education reform law of 2001 that authorized grants for emergency repairs and modernization of school facilities in areas with large amounts of federal land that limit local revenues for school districts.
   "Given the continuing need for repairs to school facilities throughout Alaska, especially given the state's harsh climate, it is wonderful that the Department of Education is funneling so much Impact Aid funding this year to Alaska districts. Ensuring that our schools, particularly in rural Alaska, are a safe and comfortable place for students to learn will improve a student's ability to concentrate and help improve their educational performance, in turn helping schools meet the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act," said Sen. Murkowski.
   The grants are:
   * The Bering Strait School District will receive two grants for $557,041 for Unalakleet and $686,831 for the Shaktoolik School. The money will be used to replace the heating and ventilation systems in both schools, Unalakleet serving 200 students and Shaktoolik serving about 60 students.
   * Lower Yukon School District will receive one grant for $1.412 million to replace the Hooper Bay school, moving it to a new location farther from the village's sewage lagoon. The school serves 400 students.
   * Lower Kuskokwim School District will receive four grants, The first for $3.54 million will go to replace the Toksook Bay Elementary School. The school, which serves 190 students, has so many problems it is unsuitable for repair. The other three grants: $1.78 million for Kwethluk school, $1.561 million for the Napaskiak school, and $1.59 million for the Tuntutuliak School will be used to install new water filtration systems to eliminate elevated levels of arsenic and organics in the school's existing water supplies.The three schools in total serve 450 students.
   * Yukon-Koyukuk School District will receive a grant for $366,000 to repair the deteriorating wood piling foundation of the Jimmy Huntington School in Huslia - the home of the famed Alaska dog musher. The foundation repairs will help the school that serves 40 students.
   While most Impact Aid money for school districts is based on a strict formula, with Alaska schools normally receiving about $100 million in federal Impact Aid funds yearly, today's grants came from extra discretionary funds that are provided to needy districts for crucial construction and maintenance needs. Past funds have also gone to school districts in Montana, Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico and Washington.
