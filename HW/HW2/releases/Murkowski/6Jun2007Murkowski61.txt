SEN. MURKOWSKI SUPPORTS ALASKA RAILROAD
  Sen. Murkowski introduced legislation, S. 1552, that would authorize the Administrator of General Services to convey a parcel of land in Ship Creek to the Alaska Railroad Corporation. Similar legislation sponsored by Rep. Don Young passed the House of Representatives on May 15.  
   "This parcel of land is a key transportation component for the redevelopment of Ship Creek," said Senator Murkowski. "This bill is highly beneficial to both the Alaska Railroad Corporation and the General Services Administration. It provides the railroad with land crucial for making improvements in the area, while at the same time freeing the GSA to move their fleet center to a more convenient location." 
   The piece of property in question was originally owned by the Alaska Railroad Corporation and leased to the GSA during a period of federal ownership. GSA acquired the property when the Alaska Railroad Corporation transferred to state ownership. As consideration for the property, the Alaska Railroad Corporation will either convey a replacement facility to the GSA or pay the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best use as determined by an independent appraisal commissioned by the Administrator and paid for by the Alaska Railroad Corporation. The GSA supports this legislation to expedite their move from the present location to one that will allow them to better serve the military bases.
