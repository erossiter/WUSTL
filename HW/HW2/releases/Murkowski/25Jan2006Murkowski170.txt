SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES ACADEMY APPOINTMENTS FOR 2006
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced her 2006 nominations to the U.S. service academies. 
   Murkowski nominated 20 Alaskans for two openings to the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo., 10 for an opening at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.; 10 for an opening at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.; and four for an opening at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.  
   For each academy at least one nominee will receive an appointment. Final selections, based on merit, should be announced in late spring. Appointees will begin their studies at the academies in June 2006. 
   "We received a great many appointment requests from wonderful and gifted Alaska students. It is unfortunate that we never have enough openings to accommodate all of the nominees that all have the makings of successful service men and women," said Murkowski. "These are all well balanced candidates who are strong both scholastically, as shown by their test scores, and personally, based on their personal statements. I have the utmost confidence that those selected for appointment by the academies will represent Alaska with dignity and honor and enjoy outstanding careers in our Armed Forces," she said.
