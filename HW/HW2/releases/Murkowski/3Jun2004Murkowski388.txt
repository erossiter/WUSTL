SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FIRST SESSION SUMMER INTERNS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski this week welcomed 10 Alaska high school seniors to Washington, students who will work as interns in her Washington office for the next month. 
   Murkowski formally kicked off her 2004 summer intern program, a program coordinated by Alaska Pacific University and financed privately, by chatting with the recently graduated Alaska high school seniors for more than an hour. The interns will be performing a variety of administrative and legislative duties in the senator's Washington office, while also attending seminars and touring the nation's capital. The interns also will "shadow" the senator during her daily schedule and participate in other social events.
   "This is a wonderful opportunity for young Alaskans to see first hand the workings of Congress. I know how much I learned about Congress and American government during my time in Washington during college. An internship in Washington allows students to take with them a better understanding of how our laws are made and the problems that face our society. These experiences can truly help them in their future careers," Senator Murkowski said. 
   The students selected for the first session, May 29 through June 26, are: 
   * Shannon Charlton of Ketchikan. She is the daughter of Laura and A.J. Charlton and attended Ketchikan High School. 
   * Brittany Jensen of Pedro Bay. She is the daughter of Rebecca and Keith Jensen and attended Dena'ina School.
