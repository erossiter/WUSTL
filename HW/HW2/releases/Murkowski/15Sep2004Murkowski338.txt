SEN. MURKOWSKI DISAPPOINTED BY DEMOCRATIC WALKOUT BEFORE DEBATE ON ALASKA LAND BILLS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today said she was disappointed by a Democratic walkout at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that prevented a quorum delaying consideration of two of her Alaska bills, one involving a land exchange involving the Cape Fox Native Village Corp. of Saxman and a second bill aimed at speeding up conveyance of 89 million acres of lands promised to the state and Alaska Native corporations decades ago. 
   Murkowski said she was disappointed, but not surprised by the display of rank partisan politics in this election year. She said, however, she was even more appalled by the inaccurate justification voiced at the conclusion of the committee meeting by some that she had not worked to address Democratic concerns about the two measures.  
   "I understand that there is always pressure to deny a senator up for election any accomplishments during an election cycle. It is petty, childish and grossly unfair to the citizens of Alaska, but it is an unfortunate reflection of life in the U.S. Senate. Sometimes it is easier to use a parliamentary tactic than to express your arguments in public and let the majority decide legislation on its merits. But it is absolutely incorrect to say that I have not worked tirelessly to attempt to meet Democratic and public concerns about both pieces of legislation," said Murkowski. 
   Concerning the Cape Fox bill Murkowski said there is no justification to argue it has not been fully reviewed by Congress. She noted a similar bill passed the Senate on Nov. 22, 2002, that the current bill was the subject of an Anchorage field hearing in August 2003, of a formal committee hearing in February of this year and of a town hall meeting held in Juneau last September. She noted that a similar bill also has already cleared the House Resources Committee this year, after passing the House in the 107th Congress. 
   Murkowski said she has attempted to address Democratic staff concerns about the bill, specifically proposing amendments to protect the forested scenic views on the west side of Berners Bay by adding a provision to guarantee that at least 75 percent of all standing timber in the area be fully protected. She also added a provision to guarantee continued public access along and within 75 feet of the shoreline for kayakers, boaters, hikers and berry pickers in the area. 
   The bill itself (S. 1354) is a land exchange designed to address the inequity involving the Cape Fox Corp. of Saxman, which was precluded in 1971 from selecting its Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Lands within 6 miles of Ketchikan. The bill would allow Cape Fox to return 160 acres of mountainous selections and gain 99 acres of land adjacent to its current holdings on Revilla Island near Ketchikan. 
   The bill also allows Cape Fox and the Sealaska Native regional corporation to enter into an equal value land exchange where the corporations would gain surface and subsurface estate on lands around patented mining claims at the Kensington and Jualin gold mines north of Juneau in return for giving up other lands in Southeast. The land exchange will allow Cape Fox to benefit from development of the mine, while Sealaska will gain access to ancient burial and cultural sites. The exchange will create additional opportunities for development of the mines with Cape Fox and Sealaska involvement. 
   Cape Fox will receive an annual lease fee for their land during construction and operation of the mine, with mine operation likely producing 225 direct jobs, 180 indirect jobs and a $16 million annual payroll for Juneau's economy over the expected at least 15-year operating life of the Kensington mine. It also offers excellent opportunities for increased Native hire. 
   Concerning the land acceleration bill, she said the measure has undergone two committee hearings, in August. 2003 and again on Feb.12, 2004. She noted that she has proposed to make dozens of changes to the bill to address Democratic committee staff and public comments on the measure - changes that would have been debated and likely accepted by the committee, if today's "markup" session had not been boycotted by Democrats. She added she has been seeking to work with committee staff since February to iron out all language changes - Democratic staff refusing to meet on the bill until mid July in an obvious attempt to delay passage of the measure for as long as possible. 
   The bill (S. 1466) is intended to lay out a blueprint for the federal Bureau of Land Management to complete the surveying and final transfer of 89 million acres, 60 million of the state's outstanding 104-million-acre Statehood entitlement and the remaining 29 million acres of the 44 million acres given to Alaska Native Corporations under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The bill also addresses steps to complete the transfer of some 2,500 of 16,000 total parcels of native land applications made under terms of the 1906 Alaska Native Land Allotment Act. 
   Murkowski noted she has made a host of changes to accommodate not just Democratic, but public and interest group concerns with the original measure. They include: 
   * Limiting the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior to settle State land claims by agreement. 
   * Deleting a provision that would have allowed closed mining claims to be conveyed to the state because some environmental groups argued that would have increased the size of the state's overall Statehood land entitlement. 
   * Deleting a provision that would have allowed the University of Alaska system to select the reversionary interest in properties owned by non-profit groups. 
   * Amending a provision concerning outdated withdrawals of public lands, so the bill now calls for a public land nomination process, an assessment of nominated lands and a report to Congress so it will make a decision on the future of nominated lands, in place of the original provision which would have immediately opened all such lands to all public land laws. 
   * The addition of language to a provision authorizing conveyance of about 2,000-acres of land owed to the Village of Kaktovik clarifying that the authorization to convey does not allow oil or gas development of lands inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until Congress acts to permit energy development on the Arctic coastal plain. 
   * Deleting of a provision that would have waived a 69,129-acre limitation on conveyance of lands within pre-ANCSA refuges to address environmental concerns. 
   * And the addition of a provision to ease environmental concerns allowing Native corporations and allotment applicants to adjust boundaries of allotment claims to clarify that such relocations may only occur when the move does not create a future management problem for Conservation System Unit land managers. 
   "With little cooperation, we have gone out of our way to try to accommodate staff and public concerns with the original draft of this bill. It is a truly unfair criticism to say that I have not worked hard to meet all valid concerns with the land transfer acceleration bill. 
   "It would appear that the walkout was a thinly disguised attempt at partisan politics," said Murkowski, noting that Democratic committee staff went so far as to hurry one Democratic Senator out of the room when her entrance would have constituted a quorum that would have allowed the committee to report both bills to the floor. Murkowski said she will continue to work to try to have the bills reconsidered next week.
