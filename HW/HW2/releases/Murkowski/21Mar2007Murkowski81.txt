SEN. MURKOWSKI PROMOTES INTERNATIONAL POLAR YEAR
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today convened a meeting with officials from the U.S. Department of Education, four Einstein fellows and representatives from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The participants discussed methods for bringing International Polar Year (IPY) activities to more classrooms nationwide.  
   "IPY marks an exciting and unique opportunity for the United States to participate in an ambitious, multinational scientific effort," said Senator Murkowski. "It is rare when dozens of countries from all over the world mobilize simultaneously for the greater good. I am excited at the possibility of getting students throughout the country involved in IPY in order to help bring about a better understanding of the polar regions." IPY is a comprehensive scientific program focused on the Arctic and the Antarctic that takes place from March 2007 to March 2009. Organized through the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this year is actually the fourth polar year, following those in 1882-3, 1932-3, and 1957-8. In order to have full and equal coverage of both the Arctic and the Antarctic, IPY 2007-8 covers two full annual cycles from March 2007 to March 2009 and will involve over 200 projects, with thousands of scientists from over 60 nations examining a wide range of physical, biological and social research topics. It is also an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate, follow, and get involved with, cutting edge science in real-time. More information is available at www.ipy.org.
