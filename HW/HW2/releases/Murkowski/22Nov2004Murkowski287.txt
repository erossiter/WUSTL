SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FINAL SENATE PASSAGE OF HER VETERANS-HOUSING-RELATED SPENDING REQUESTS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final Senate passage of the Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for FY '05 that passed the Senate late Nov. 20.  
   Murkowski, commenting on just one of nine parts of the final $388 billion Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 4818), said the measure met a number of Alaska's needs. 
   In the largest addition, the Senate accepted an amendment that the Senator sponsored and won this spring in the Senate Budget Resolution that calls for an additional $1.2 billion over the budget request to be added to veterans' health care funding in the Department of Veterans' Affairs budget. The $1.2 billion increase fully funds veterans' health care needs, and should provide enough funds to resolve backlogs in veterans seeking medical appointments at VA facilities. 
   "This increase will help to eliminate the waiting lists for veterans seeking care. It will shorten the time it takes to process a veterans' disability claim and it will result in the VA being able to process veterans' benefits in a timely manner. Given all that our veterans have done for this nation, it is only appropriate that we give them a bit more in return," said Murkowski. 
   The Senator also sought and won an amendment that will allow veterans, generally in rural Alaska, to obtain medical care services from medical facilities supported by the Indian Health Service or tribal organizations. The amendment allows rural Alaska veterans, in areas where an existing VA or VA-contracted service is unavailable, to receive care from the IHS. The change should reduce the inconvenience of rural veterans from having to travel to urban centers for treatment. 
   Murkowski, jointly with Sen. Stevens, also sought and won report language encouraging the VA to continue to support the Brother Francis Shelter in Anchorage that helps homeless veterans, and actually all homeless, in Anchorage. 
   "The Brother Francis Shelter provides such a vital service to the homeless in Anchorage, including veterans, that it is certainly worthy of continued federal assistance," said Murkowski.
