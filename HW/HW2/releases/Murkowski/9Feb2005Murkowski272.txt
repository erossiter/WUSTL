SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES NOMINATIONS TO SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced her 2005 nominations to the U.S. service academies. 
   Murkowski nominated 10 Alaskans for an opening at the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo.; 10 for an opening at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y; 20 for two openings at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.; and one for an opening at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.  
   For each academy, at least one nominee will receive an appointment. Final selections, based on merit, should be announced in late spring. Appointees will begin their studies at the academies in June 2005. 
   "We received a large number of appointment requests this year from qualified Alaska applicants. It is unfortunate that there is such a limited number of vacancies, as all of the nominees have the makings of successful service men and women," said Murkowski. "These are well balanced young men and women, both scholastically and personally, and they have achieved excellent test scores. I have the utmost confidence that those selected for appointment will represent Alaska with dignity and honor in the Armed Forces," she said.
