SEN. MURKOWSKI HELPS SEND OFF ALASKAN TROOPS FROM CAMP SHELBY FOR TOUR IN IRAQ
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today traveled to Camp Shelby, located outside of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to help send off nearly 600 soldiers in the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry of the Alaskan National Guard. The soldiers come from more than 80 communities throughout the state and represent an array of Alaskan cultures. During the farewell picnic, Sen. Murkowski had the opportunity to meet with Guardsmen and women from Chevak, Bethel and Hooper Bay, as well as with Mayor Floyd Ticket from Buckland, who is among those being deployed.  
   "It was an honor to be able to help pay tribute to the soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry, truly some of the finest warriors Alaska has to offer," said Senator Murkowski. "Alaskans uniquely understand the meaning of community. And it in this spirit that our troops go forth to help the people of Iraq protect their fragile democracy. Without question, our soldiers are enthusiastic and well poised for their important task ahead. All of our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as they begin this noble mission." 
   This deployment marks the state's largest send off of Alaskan National Guard troops since World War II. The soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry are the descendants of Territorial Guard Units that protected Alaska from Japanese incursions during WWII.
