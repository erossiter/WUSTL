SEN. MURKOWSKI CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO THANK MERCHANT MARINE
  To recognize the service of the Merchant Marine during World War II, Sen.  
 Murkowski has signed on as co-sponsor of the "Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of World War II Act of 2005" (S.1272). 
   This bill would provide a monthly benefit of $1,000 to surviving Veterans or widows of the Merchant Marine for the period from December 7, 1941 to December 31, 1946. The compensation would be in lieu of benefits not received after World War II. 
   "Alaska is home to over 71,000 military veterans, many of whom served in the Merchant Marine during World War II," said Murkowski. "This legislation not only offers compensation for the years Mariners went without benefits, but also recognizes them for their service during the war." 
   Unlike other World War II Veterans, Merchant Mariners until did not receive veteran status until the courts granted it in January 1988. Without veteran status the Mariners were ineligible for benefits like the GI Bill, priority for postwar jobs, medical care for disabilities, and home or small business loans. 
   "Unfortunately, this group of brave men was denied any benefits under the GI Bill of Rights which Congress enacted in 1945," said Murkowski. "This legislation is the least we can do to compensate those who risked everything and who were overlooked for benefits." 
   The Merchant Marine played a vital role in the U.S. victory in World War II. The Mariners were responsible for delivering supplies such as tanks, airplanes, ammunition, fuel, and food rations to soldiers on the front lines. During the war 9,300 Mariners were killed and 12,000 wounded. These causalities were the highest of any military service division, with one in every 26 Mariners killed.
