SEN. MURKOWSKI: ANCHORAGE TO GAIN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR COPS IN SCHOOLS PROGRAM
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the Anchorage Police Department is gaining a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department to hire additional law enforcement officers to work in the nation's schools. 
   Murkowski said the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) made the grant, one of 73 going to cities and towns in 30 states to fund the hiring of 258 additional law enforcement officers to work in schools. Some $35.2 million were released today nationwide.
   The COPS in Schools program funds the hiring of community policing officers to work in schools. The grants provide up to $125,000 to pay for the salary and benefits of each new officer over three years. The COPS program also provides school safety training for the officer and an administrator from the school to which the officer will be assigned.
   The officers involved are known as School Resource Officers (SROs), and are sworn law enforcement officers who become permanently assigned to a school or school system. While the specific activities of a SRO are determined by the unique needs of the school and community they serve, their primary role is to safeguard students by providing a law enforcement presence on school grounds.
   The program has provided more than $747.5 million to local communities to hire SROs nationwide, some 6,567 now or soon to be in place.
   "Nothing is more important than guaranteeing that students in schools can feel safe and thus can devote themselves fully to learning, rather than worrying about violence on school grounds. This grant is another effort by the federal government to help Anchorage students get the best education possible," said Sen. Murkowski.
