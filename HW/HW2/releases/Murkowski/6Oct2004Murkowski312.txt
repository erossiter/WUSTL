SEN. MURKOWSKI: ANCHORAGE TO GAIN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES IN SCHOOLS PROGRAM
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the Anchorage Police Department is gaining another $97,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department to hire additional law enforcement officers to work in the city's schools.  
   Murkowski said the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) made the grant. 
   The COPS in Schools program funds the hiring of community policing officers to work in schools. The grants provide money to pay for the salary and benefits of each new officer over three years. The COPS program also provides school safety training for the officer and an administrator from the school to which the officer will be assigned. 
   The officers involved are known as School Resource Officers (SROs), and are sworn law enforcement officers who become permanently assigned to a school or school system. While the specific activities of a SRO are determined by the unique needs of the school and community they serve, their primary role is to safeguard students by providing a law enforcement presence on school grounds. 
   "Nothing is more important than guaranteeing that students in schools can feel safe and thus can devote themselves fully to learning, rather than worrying about violence on school grounds. This grant is another effort by the federal government to help Anchorage students get the best education possible," said Sen. Murkowski, who noted that the district last month had received a $500,000 grant under the program.
