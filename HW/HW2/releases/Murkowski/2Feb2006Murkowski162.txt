SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMENDS WAL-MART'S DECISION TO RESUME FOOD BANK DONATIONS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, yesterday, sent a letter to the President and CEO of Wal-mart commending his decision to once again provide needed food to Alaska's local food banks. 
   In the letter, Murkowski notes, "The ability for Sam's Club in Fairbanks to resume donating baked goods to the Fairbanks Food Bank is very much appreciated. The earlier decision to end the donation of baked goods and replace them with cash donations, while generous, had the potential to leave food banks strapped for food donations in the middle of winter when they need donations the most."
   Murkowski also urged Wal-Mart to encourage stores nationally to donate all types of perishable food items to food banks. "The decisions of large nationwide chains, such as Wal-Mart, set a tremendous precedent for smaller grocery stores to follow. These types of donations greatly help non-profits in their fight against hunger in our nation."
