SEN. MURKOWSKI VOTES TO CONTINUE DEBATE ON PATRIOT ACT
  This morning, Sen. Lisa Murkowski joined in a bipartisan coalition to continue debate on the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.  
 The motion to invoke cloture and end debate on the Patriot Act was defeated 52-47. 
   "What unites all Senators today is our interest in not seeing the Patriot Act expire," Murkowski said. "However, that interest does not mean that we should rush to pass a reauthorization of the Patriot Act that may lead to even minor infringements of Americans' civil liberties. It is our hope in opposing cloture today that Congress passes a version of the bill that is more similar to the Senate passed version which passed unanimously. We need a reauthorization that more closely strikes the balance between protecting civil liberties and providing law enforcement the tools they need to do their jobs." 
   Certain portions of the Patriot Act are set to expire on Dec. 31 if not reauthorized. Earlier this week, Murkowski co-sponsored legislation to extend the current Patriot Act by three months (S.2082). Debate on reauthorization of the bill is ongoing.
