SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES FISCAL 2005 PILT PAYMENTS TO ALASKA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that 27 Alaska boroughs, areas and communities will receive nearly $15.8 million in federal aid as a result of the FY05 Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program.  
   Murkowski said she was notified today that the Department of the Interior will transfer funds to Alaska communities to help compensate them for the services they provide to non-taxable federal lands in their boundaries. The 2005 PILT payments will be disbursed by the Department on or about June 24, 2005. 
   The Payments-in-Lieu of Taxes program recognizes that boroughs and other local government entities with substantial acreage of federal land can't collect sufficient taxes to provide needed services or would have to tax fewer residents at higher rates to provide services. 
   "In a state like Alaska, where so much of our land is under federal control, the PILT program helps communities deal with the services they need to provide. PILT funds help offset the loss of tax and economic development revenue that often results from federal land ownership," said Sen. Murkowski. 
   Alaska communities gained $15.78 million in aid in 2005, compared to last year's funding of $15.6 million. The biggest beneficiary of the aid this year was the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. The borough gained $1.909 million, about $40,000 more than in FY04. The Kenai Peninsula Borough was second gaining $1.89 million, while Bethel was third, gaining $924,973 from the program. 
   The program this year is providing $226.4 million in aid to nearly 1,850 local governments to offset service costs on 264 million acres of federal land inside local boundaries. This year's PILT amount is the largest ever provided, with $2.1 million more than payments in FY04. Payments under PILT are made for Federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Forest Service, US Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation water projects and some military installations. PILT Payments are in addition to revenues from oil and gas leases, the sale of minerals and timber and other federal revenues derived from public lands. 
   Since the first PILT payments in 1977, approximately $3.6 billion has been paid to local communities.
