SEN. MURKOWSKI REACTS TO DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski tonight had the following reaction on the death of former President Ronald Reagan. 
   "We'll all miss President Reagan. His steadfast adherence to principle, his vision, his foresight, his civility, his humor and his basic decency should be examples to all of us in public service. The President had a clear vision and during his eight years in office like a laser he followed policies to successfully implement that vision. 
   "A strong opponent of communism he worked tirelessly to bring an end to that ideology. A strong proponent of a strong American economy, his economic policies killed inflation and ushered in an era of economic growth that benefited all Americans. 
   "His good humor and his ability to conduct public business honorably without personal rancor should be a lasting example to us all for how government should work. We'll all miss him, but know that his accomplishments will live on in history. I and Verne send our condolences to Nancy and the entire Reagan family," said Sen. Murkowski.
