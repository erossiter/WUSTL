SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTING TROOPS IN IRAQ
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today released the following statement after the Senate passed two resolutions expressing support for the troops in Iraq and rejected a resolution to support setting a timetable for withdrawal.  
   "We all want our troops to come home as quickly and as safely as possible. I can not, however, support a timetable for withdrawing our forces in Iraq. This would embolden our enemy, give them a blueprint of our military effort and would increasingly jeopardize the safety of our troops. The mission in Iraq will not end at a specific time or date; it will only end when we see the Iraqi people take control of their own safety and destiny. We must continue to provide the full financial support that our troops need to be able to conclude their mission."
