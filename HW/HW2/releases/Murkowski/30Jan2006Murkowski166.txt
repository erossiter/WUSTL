SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES SELECTION OF SPRING 2006 COLLEGE INTERN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced the selection of Roseann Simko of Fairbanks as her Spring 2006 intern.  
 Roseann will begin working this month in Sen. Murkowski's Washington D.C. office as the first intern selected under the Senator's new college intern program. Roseann is currently a junior at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Roseann was born and raised in Fairbanks and graduated from Lathrop High School in 2002. 
   Roseann is an active member in the Fairbanks community; she developed a Voting Awareness Program, is an active member in her church as well as various sports organizations, and is an Academic Tutor for the Literacy Council. Sen. Murkowski announced the creation of an internship program for Alaska college students in 2005. Murkowski's Washington D.C. office also hosts a summer intern program for recently graduated Alaska high school students. The college intern program is designed to provide Alaskan college students with the opportunity to work in a legislative environment at the federal level on behalf of the State of Alaska. 
   "This is a wonderful opportunity for Roseann to come to D.C. and work in a legislative office." Sen. Murkowski said. "An internship in Washington allows students a better understanding of how our laws are made and the functioning of the Federal Government. I believe it is important to involve Alaska's future in governmental processes that affect our great State. I look forward to working with Roseann in the coming months."
