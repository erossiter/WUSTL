SEN. MURKOWSKI PRAISES SENATE FOR APPROVING DRUE PEARCE'S APPOINTMENT TO IMPORTANT FEDERAL POSITION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today praised the Senate for approving the appointment of Drue Pearce to the position of Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects.  
   "The Federal Government has taken another important step to help bring Alaska's natural gas to market," said Senator Murkowski. "Once a project is approved at the State level, we will have the necessary federal support to efficiently coordinate the fifteen agencies required to oversee the massive construction effort." 
   President Bush appointed Pearce to the new position which will oversee the federal permitting process that will be necessary to construct a natural gas pipeline. Pearce, the former Alaska State Senate President, has served in the Administration since 2001 as the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Interior on Alaska Affairs.
