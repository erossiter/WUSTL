SEN. MURKOWSKI EXPRESSES CONCERN WITH ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION ANNUAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today expressed concern with aspects of the annual outlook provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Most troubling are predictions from EIA that the United States will become over 20 percent dependent on foreign sources of natural gas by 2030.  
   "We have seen the impacts in this country of our overdependence on foreign sources of oil," said Senator Murkowski. "We must not make the same mistake with natural gas. With 35 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves of natural gas awaiting development in Alaska's North Slope, it is imperative that the State of Alaska and producers reach agreement on a contract to construct a natural gas pipeline." 
   Murkowski also noted that testimony provided by Guy Caruso, EIA Administrator, further illustrates the need to develop the Arctic National Wildlife refuge. EIA estimated that if ANWR is not developed, oil production on the North Slope of Alaska may dip to levels that are below the minimum amount needed to keep the Trans Alaska Pipeline operating by 2030. 
   "By continually restricting Alaska's ability to develop its natural resources in ANWR, Congress is not only keeping us from exploring and producing the single largest opportunity for on-shore domestic oil in the Nation, but is jeopardizing the ability to keep existing fields on the North Slope operating," said Murkowski.
