SEN. MURKOWSKI NAMES HIGH SCHOOL INTERNS FOR SUMMER '04
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced the names of 20 young Alaskans who have been selected to work as interns in her Washington, D.C. office during the coming summer.
   Murkowski, in a program coordinated by Alaska Pacific University and financed privately, will bring 20 graduating high school seniors to Washington, D.C. for two, four-week sessions. Under the program, interns perform a variety of administrative and legislative duties in the senator's Washington office. Interns also "shadow" the senator during her daily schedule and participate in tours and social events. 
   "This is a wonderful opportunity for young Alaskans to see first hand the workings of Congress. I know how much I learned about Congress and American government during my time in Washington during college. An internship in Washington allows students to take with them a better understanding of how our laws are made and the problems that face our society. These experiences can truly help them in their future careers," Senator Murkowski said.
   The students selected for the first session, May 29 through June 26, are:
   * Shannon Charlton of Ketchikan. She is the daughter of Laura and A.J. Charlton and attended Ketchikan High School.
