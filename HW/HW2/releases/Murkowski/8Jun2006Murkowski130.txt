SEN. MURKOWSKI CONGRATULATES UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS FOR EARNING PRESITGIOUS HONOR FROM NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today congratulated the University of Alaska Fairbanks for being recognized by the National Security Agency as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE).  
   UAF joins only 66 other universities throughout the nation in earning this prestigious honor. The CAEIAE designation recognizes the University's pioneering research, teaching and national expertise in protecting digital infrastructure. To receive this designation, academic institutions are measured against a rigorous set of criteria which are updated annually to reflect national priorities and advancements in technology. The CAEIAE designation is valid for a three-year period, after which recertification is required to ensure that institutions and programs continue to improve and expand in the quickly evolving cyber-security field. 
   "This impressive designation is a fitting tribute to the hard work and determination of the dedicated faculty and staff in UAF's Department of Computer Science," said Senator Murkowski. "By being recognized by the National Security Agency for its accomplishments in digital security, UAF has distinguished itself as a national leader in information technology." 
   By receiving the CAEIAE designation, UAF is now eligible to apply for specialized funding, including full scholarships for students, capacity-building grants and research funds from federal agencies including the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Based on these new resources, UAF intends to provide Information Assurance and Computer Security resources beyond the University, including state and local government, businesses and the public.
