SEN. MURKOWSKI: ANCHORAGE RECEIVES MAJOR GRANT FOR NEW COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT FOR FIRST RESPONDERS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the Anchorage Police Department a major grant for $3.236 million to fund a new integrated communications system for the community.  
   The grant, made under the Department's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, is intended to help local communities develop integrated communications networks for first responders. Anchorage was one of 23 cities in 17 states to win the grant, part of $82.6 million awarded by the Justice Department today. 
   "It is vital that local police, fire, and emergency medical workers can all communicate seamlessly in time of emergency whether it be an earthquake, volcanic eruption, severe storm, terrorist attack or any accident or crime. This money is intended to help Anchorage agencies have the resources to improve communications equipment to the benefit of all Anchorage residents and all visitors to Alaska's largest city," said Murkowski. 
   The grant, an Interoperable Communications Technology Grant, will require a 25 percent local match, Murkowski noted.
