SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF HER VETERANS-HOUSING-RELATED SPENDING REQUESTS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed action by the Senate Appropriations Committee that has agreed to include funding and report language for several projects that the Senator proposed to the committee in its version of the Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for FY '05. 
   The Committee, chaired by fellow Alaskan Sen. Ted Stevens, Tuesday "marked up" and approved its version of the VA-HUD spending bill, clearing the way for Senate consideration of the bill.
   In the largest addition, the committee followed an amendment that the Senator sponsored and won this spring in the Senate Budget Resolution that calls for an additional $1.2 billion over the budget request to be added to veterans' health care funding in the Department of Veterans' Affairs budget. The $1.2 billion increase fully funds veterans' health care needs, and should provide enough funds to resolve backlogs in veterans seeking medical appointments at VA facilities.
   "This increase will help to eliminate the waiting lists for veterans seeking care. It will shorten the time it takes to process a veteran's disability claim and it will result in the VA being able to process veterans' benefits in a timely manner. Given all that our veterans have done for this nation, it is only appropriate that we give them a bit more in return," said Murkowski in thanking the appropriations committee for approving the increase.
   The Senator also sought and won an amendment that will allow veterans, generally in rural Alaska, to obtain medical care services from medical facilities supported by the Indian Health Service or tribal organizations. The amendment allows rural Alaska veterans, in areas where an existing VA or VA-contracted service is unavailable, to receive care from the IHS. The change should reduce the inconvenience of rural veterans from having to travel to urban centers for treatment.
   Murkowski, jointly with Sen. Stevens, also sought and won report language encouraging the VA to continue to support the Brother Francis Shelter in Anchorage that helps homeless veterans, and actually all homeless, in Anchorage.
   "The Brother Francis Shelter provides such a vital service to the homeless in Anchorage, including to veterans, that it is certainly worthy of continued federal assistance," said Murkowski.
