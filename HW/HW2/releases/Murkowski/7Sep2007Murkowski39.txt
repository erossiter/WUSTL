SEN. MURKOWSKI URGES GREATER AWARENESS OF CONSEQUENCES OF DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY
  In commemoration of National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day, Senator Lisa Murkowski urges all Americans to spread the word that no amount of alcohol is safe to consume during the nine months of pregnancy. Senator Murkowski sponsored the resolution designating September 9th 2007 as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day.  
   Tragically, Alaska has the highest rate of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in the nation. Furthermore, among Alaskan Native communities, the rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the state. 
   "By continuing to raise awareness, we can eliminate the harm that drinking during pregnancy causes our most vulnerable population - our children," said Senator Murkowski. "On Sunday, Fetal Alcohol Awareness Day, let us remember the 40,000 innocent children born each year with this disorder and then let us imagine the potential that they could have attained but for the damage done by alcohol." 
   National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day encourages the American people to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and most importantly to bring greater awareness to a disorder that is 100 percent preventable. On this day, Americans are also encouraged to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9th, to remember that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any alcohol.
