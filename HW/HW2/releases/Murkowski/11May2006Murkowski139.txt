SEN. MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION HONORS FAMILIES OF FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS
  In honor of the families of fallen police officers, Sen. Murkowski offered Senate Resolution 473 which designates May 14th as National Police Survivors Day. The resolution is intended to engage all of our fellow citizens to lend their hearts and to lend a hand to the survivors of our police heroes.  
   "It is a tragic fact that one law enforcement officer dies in the line of duty every 53 hours in the United States," said Senator Murkowski. "As we remember the heroic deeds of our fallen law enforcement officers, let us also take a moment to reflect on those who are left to carry on. I am hopeful the nation will join me in doing this on May 14th - National Police Survivors Day." 
   The date chosen has significance for many families. On May 14, 2003, on the eve of the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, 10 widows of fallen law enforcement officers came together. Out of this meeting came the birth of a new national organization called Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS). 
   One year later, COPS was formed at the first National Police Survivors Seminar which drew 110 law enforcement survivors. Today, COPS provides healing, love and the opportunity for a renewed life to over 15,000 families through a network of 48 chapters around the country.
