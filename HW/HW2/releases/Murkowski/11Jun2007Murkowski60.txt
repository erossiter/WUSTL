SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMENTS ON NON-BINDING ATTORNEY GENERAL RESOLUTION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today offered the below comments following her vote against the motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 14. 
   "While I no longer have confidence in the Attorney General's ability to do his job effectively, I could not vote in support of this non-binding resolution. Rather than expend valuable Senate time in a game of political theater, we should focus our efforts on the important issues facing the nation, such as the pending energy legislation, as well as debate over immigration reform."
