  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced a series of grants and loans to state communities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program, grants that will help fund water and sewer improvements statewide, a new regional job training center in Bethel, health care facilities in five areas of the state, a family resource center in New Stuyahok, a new landfill in False Pass, roof repairs to the library in Wrangell and funding for public television programming statewide. 
   Murkowski said the Department has released just over $31 million in grants. The biggest grant of $27.14 million is going to the State's Department of Environmental Conservation to fund water and sewer improvements to 19 communities statewide and feasibility studies to prepare for sanitation improvements for seven additional communities.
