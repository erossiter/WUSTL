SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR CENTRAL FIRE ASSISTANCE DECLARATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed a decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to grant the state's and her request that the federal government issue a fire management assistance declaration specifically for the Central complex fire northeast of Fairbanks. The declaration, issued late Tuesday by FEMA, makes the state eligible for federal funding to pay for up to 75 percent of its costs involved in fighting the 260,000 acres of wildfires in the area. 
   "It is good that the federal government understands the serious nature of all the wildfires continuing to burn in Alaska, and has expanded its previous assistance declaration for the Boundary fire and fires near Tok to take in the Bolgen Creek fire and the other fires burning in the Central area. This fire is threatening a number of subdivisions between Central and Circle Hot Springs and the state needs additional federal financial assistance to help bring the fires in the area under control," said Senator Murkowski this morning.
   The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program allows the federal government to pick up 75 percent of allowable costs. They include the:
   * Costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds);
   * Costs for emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control);
   * Costs for state emergency operations centers;
   * Costs for the pre-positioning of federal, out-of-state resources for up to 21 days;
   * Costs for personal comfort and safety items for firefighters;
   * Costs for field camps and meals in lieu of per diem;
   * Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs;
   * Costs for the temporary repair of damage caused by firefighting;
   * And the costs of mitigation, management and control of fires on co-mingled federal lands.
   Senator Murkowski said FEMA granted the fire disaster assistance request since the Bolgen Creek fire, which involves 49 percent state land and 49 percent federal land with 2 percent in private hands, has flared up burning 64,700 acres since July 13, and now threatens Central and some 100 residential and 20 commercial properties.
   The Senator said she will continue to monitor state and federal agency needs to battle all of the fires now burning in the state.
   As of yesterday some 100 separate fires were still burning in Alaska having blackened 4.569 million acres so far this summer. The Central complex fire, which includes the Wolf Creek and Crazy fires northeast of Fairbanks, is the most serious at the moment, even though the 508,000-acre Boundary fire continues to burn in the headwaters of the Little Chena River and the 240,000-acre Taylor complex fire was also again active on Tuesday.
