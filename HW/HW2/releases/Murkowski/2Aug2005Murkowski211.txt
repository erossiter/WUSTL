SEN. MURKOWSKI REMEMBERS GOV. HAMMOND
  Below is a statement from Sen. Murkowski upon hearing the news of Gov.  
 Hammond's death. 
   "Across the state, we are saddened to learn of the loss of Governor Jay Hammond. My heart and my condolences go out to Bella and the rest of Jay's family and friends. 
   "Jay was the very embodiment of what it meant to go north to the future and to the last frontier. Jack London could not have written a better persona for the 49th state. Jay was a soldier, a farmhand, an amateur boxer, a homesteader, a bush pilot, a hunter and a guide, and a statesman. 
   "From Jay's service in the Alaska State Legislature to his time as Governor to his life as an advocate for the best interests of Alaska and Alaskans, Jay served the state and its people with pride and with distinction. Governor Hammond was here during the most definitive moments of the state - from the moment oil first flowed through the pipeline to the present discussions of what Alaska will be in the future - always contributing his vision and his voice. 
   "He was passionate as he advocated for a fiscal plan for the state, dedicating his time and energy to crafting solutions which he would then present to Alaskans with equal energy and enthusiasm. He committed himself to Alaska's future. It is pioneers that made Alaska and that is the life we will remember and we will honor - Jay Hammond, our bush rat Governor, a true Alaskan, and a true pioneer."
