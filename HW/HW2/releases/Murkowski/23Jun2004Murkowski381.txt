SEN. MURKOWSKI WINS PANEL SUPPORT FOR FUNDING FOR MAJOR HARBOR-PORT PROJECTS IN ALASKA
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today won approval of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for authorization of a number of port and harbor projects in Alaska, including authorization for construction of a $19 million harbor project at Akutan Harbor in the Aleutians, capping a nearly two decade effort to win harbor funding at one of the nation's busiest seafood ports.  
   Murkowski, during a two-hour "markup" of legislative items pending before the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works, including the Water Resources Development Act for 2004 (WRDA), won committee approval for the Akutan harbor project and also for funding for harbor developments at Sitka, Kodiak and at Unalaska. She also won authorizations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study future potential projects - the first stage toward winning development dollars - at Seward, Kenai, Kake, Nelson Lagoon, St. George Island and Dillingham. 
   "Even though this is a tight year for federal funding, we won some long-sought authorizations for major projects that should help the state's fishing industry be more efficient and more profitable and also more safe for the fishermen who are engaged in earning their livings from the sea," said Murkowski. Specifically: 
   * Akutan Harbor: She won an amendment that allows the Corps to carryout the $19 million project, $9.2 million targeted to come from federal funds. 
   * Sitka: For Sitka, she won language to authorize the government picking up the full cost of the $6.3 million project to improve the breakwater in front of the Sitka harbor. 
   * St. Herman and St. Paul Harbors, Kodiak: The Senator won authorization to allow the government to spend up to $2 million to remove debris, sediment and rock that is impeding entrance to the two harbors on Kodiak Island. This provision will allow the Corps to dredge entrance channels to the two harbors. 
   * Unalaska: And for Unalaska, the Senator won a provision to authorize the Corps to carryout the new $23 million small boat harbor at Unalaska. The provisions allow the federal government to pick up $11.5 million of the cost of the harbor project at the Alaska Peninsula community. 
   * Statewide: And the Senator won language to increase the level of funding authorized to $45 million from $5 million for the restoration of abandoned mines nationwide, and especially in Alaska. 
   The Senator also won language in related study resolutions that will allow Corps to study whether to proceed with the following projects: 
   * Kake: Report language to encourage efforts to fix a dam in Kake that feeds the town's water supply. 
   * Seward: Language to have the Corps conduct a new study to determine whether alternative methods of flood diversion are feasible given that the Lowell Creek Tunnel has been badly damaged by flooding over the past decade. 
   * Kenai: A study on how to go about controlling erosion of the bluff along the Kenai River within a mile of the mouth of the river. The Kenai Seniors facility and several private homes are threatened by river bluff erosion in the area. 
   * Nelson Lagoon: A study of what would be involved to improve shoreline protection at the community. 
   * St. George Harbor: A study of the cost of repairing the harbor's breakwater. 
   * Dillingham: Report language encouraging efforts to stop erosion at the entrance to the Dillingham harbor, stopping waves from entering the harbor that are damaging boats and the existing harbor facilities. 
   Besides the Water Resources Development Act, the committee also marked up a number of other major pieces of legislation: 
   * S. 2550, a bill to reauthorize federal financing programs for wastewater and drinking water facilities. Amendments by the committee will also encourage new projects that treat wastewater using innovative and environmentally sound techniques, and provide greater attention to rural water programs. 
   * S. 1134, a bill reauthorizing the grant programs of the Economic Development Administration. Changes will allow the Administrator of the agency to declare "special impact areas" which will receive assistance even when they are unable to comply with all normal requirements for demonstrating low employment and other factors. 
   * S. 2495, a bill to reauthorize the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act, which provides funding for sport fish management programs of all 50 states. Alaska typically receives approximately $12 million, which is derived from taxes on sport fishing equipment. 
   * S. 1547, a bill amending the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to ensure that programs to control non-native invasive migratory bird species are not inadvertently limited.
