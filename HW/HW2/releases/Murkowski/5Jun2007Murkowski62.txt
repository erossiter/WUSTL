SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMENTS ON PASSING OF SEN. THOMAS
  Sen. Murkowski comments on the Passing of Sen. Craig Thomas: 
   "Last evening the United States Congress lost one of its most distinguished public servants, Sen. Craig Thomas. I had the honor to serve with him on the Indian Affairs Committee, where his dedicated advocacy on behalf of Native American communities was unmatched. I also had the privilege to serve alongside Sen. Thomas on the Energy Committee and was deeply impressed by his commitment to craft our successful Energy Policy Act. He served as an inspiration to us all. During this time of loss, our thoughts and prayers are with Senator Thomas' family."
