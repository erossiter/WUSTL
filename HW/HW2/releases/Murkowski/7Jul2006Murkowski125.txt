SEN. MURKOWSKI HIGHLIGHTS ALASKA MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT ENROLLMENT NUMBERS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today highlighted the recently released final tally of Medicare Beneficiaries in Alaska with Prescription Drug Coverage. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 20,488 Alaskans were enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug benefit from November 2005 to June 2006. As a result, over three-fourths of Alaskans now have prescription drug coverage through Medicare or through their former employer. When other forms of creditable drug coverage are included, such as Veterans, Indian Health Service, or other retiree coverage, the percentage of Alaskan Medicare Beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage reaches 98 percent.  
   The 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act launched the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, as well as other programs that are improving health care in rural America and improving the quality of care for Alaskans and Americans alike. "While the implementation of the new drug benefit has not been without problems, thousands of Alaskans and all Americans now have the opportunity to access more affordable prescription drugs," said Senator Murkowski. "I am greatly encouraged by the number of seniors who have signed up for the benefit and for the first time now have access to more affordable prescription drug coverage. " 
   Alaska's seniors are getting additional help from the State's SeniorCare program, covering drug premiums and deductibles for singles with incomes up to $20,913 and couples up to $28,053. Competition among prescription drug plans has resulted in lower costs for both beneficiaries and taxpayers.
