SEN. MURKOWSKI DISPLEASED BY PRELIMINARY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN SALMON LABELING REGULATIONS; URGES FISHERMEN COMMENTS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today expressed strong displeasure with the current draft of regulations implementing a Country of Origin seafood labeling program and urged Alaska fishermen to write comments to protest the regulations and to seek improvements to them during the next 90 days.  
   Murkowski, who last year helped successfully defend the provision requiring that all seafood sold in retail stores be labeled with its country of origin, and that salmon be labeled as "wild" or "farmed," said she was disappointed by the direction of the regulations drafted by the Department of Agriculture and released late today. 
   "I'm pleased the Department of Agriculture hasn't forgotten all about its mandate from Congress to establish regulations for Country of Origin Labeling, but I'm disappointed that it has continued to listen to bad advice about what the regulations should look like," said Sen. Murkowski. "The good news is that they are coming out as 'interim final' regulations, so there is another 90-day comment period for concerned members of the public. I hope Alaska fishermen will give the Department an earful. "These regulations have some glaring deficiencies, including the fact that they will not cover either canned or smoked salmon. Let's get real... canning or smoking may change a piece of salmon from raw to cooked, but it's still salmon, and consumers still deserve to know whether it is clean wild fish from Alaska or questionable farmed fish from somewhere else. "Congress intended the law to protect consumers from unscrupulous marketing practices and to give them the ability to choose for themselves. These regulations will not give consumers the information they asked for. They need to be greatly improved," said Murkowski.
