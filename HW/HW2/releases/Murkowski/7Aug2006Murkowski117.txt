SEN. MURKOWSKI TO HOST KENAI RIVER SALMON ADVENTURE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski will host the first annual Kenai River Salmon Adventure tomorrow, August 8th. Kicking off the event at 10:30 AM at the Harry Gaines Fish Camp, the Senator will join children from the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Kenai Peninsula in their fishing expedition out on the river. Sponsored by the Kenai River Sportfishing Association, the Adventure gives children, who may not otherwise have the opportunity to do so, the chance to catch their first fish.  
   "By giving children the opportunity to fish the greatest salmon river in the world, we are not only giving them the tools necessary to become successful anglers, but also are providing a fun atmosphere in which to enjoy the beauty of the Kenai," said Senator Murkowski. "I am delighted to be a part of this inaugural event and look forward to yet another day of great fishing out on the Kenai." 
   Prior to the day's events, the children will have participated in water safety classes and will have learned about river conservation and the local environment. With a great abundance of pink salmon, each child will go home a "winner" with his own fish. Organizers hope to make this a yearly event and may expand it to include youth from the Boys and Girls Club of Southcentral Alaska.
