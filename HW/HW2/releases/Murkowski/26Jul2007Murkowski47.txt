SEN. MURKOWSKI ADDRESSES KENAI PROPERTY
  Senator Murkowski today made the following statement:  
   "While Verne and I intended to make this our family home and we paid a fair price for this land, no property is worth compromising the trust of the Alaskan people. I cannot allow this to become a distraction from the major challenges I face in representing Alaska so we have decided to sell this property back to Bob Penney at the same price for which it was purchased. While it is disappointing for my family, we'll eventually be looking for a new piece of property to call home. We are fortunate that there are so many beautiful places to live in Alaska."
