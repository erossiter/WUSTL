SEN. MURKOWSKI PROMOTES TELE-MEDICINE TO PROVIDE COUNSELING SERVICES IN RURAL ALASKA
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, today cosponsored legislation aimed at preventing suicide among teenagers living on Indian reservations and in rural Alaska villages. 
   The bill, introduced by Senators Dorgan and McCain, would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to direct $6 million for a four-year demonstration project aimed at increasing the availability of mental health and counseling services for Indians and Alaska Natives. The grant would fund five tribes or tribal organizations that demonstrate a need to address youth suicide or that are isolated and have limited access to mental health services. The project expands the availability of health services delivered through telecommunications technology in order to provide more counseling and suicide-prevention materials to rural tribal communities.
   "Unfortunately, the suicide rate for Alaskan youth is almost five times the national rate," said Murkowski. "Furthermore, the suicide rate for Alaska Natives is consistently higher than the rate for other Alaskans, and rural suicide rates are double those in urban areas. Clearly we need to address this issue." The Indian Affairs Committee held two hearings on the issue of suicide among Native American teens last year. The testimony pointed out the problem is most prevalent in Alaska Native villages and Indian reservations that are in remote areas with limited access to health services.
   "This legislation directs resources to areas where the problem is greatest and the services are most needed. I am hopeful that we can address the alarming suicide rate among Alaska Natives and Native Americans by reaching out to those in need and introducing the professional counseling and services to make a difference," Murkowski concluded.
