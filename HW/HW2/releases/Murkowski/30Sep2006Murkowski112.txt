SEN. MURKOWSKI LEGISLATION TO CONSTRUCT WATER, SEWER SYSTEMS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN ALASKA PASSES U.S. SENATE
  Late last evening, the United States Senate passed legislation sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski to reauthorize the stream of funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the State of Alaska for the purposes of constructing water and sewer systems in rural communities in Alaska. With far too many rural Alaskan homes lacking indoor plumbing, S.1409 will increase and extend funding through FY09 to help ensure all Alaskans have access to modern sanitation services.  
   "For so many rural communities throughout our state the passage of this important legislation means that safe and sanitary water and sewer systems will soon be more than a distant hope - they will be a reality," said Senator Murkowski. "The lack of sanitation in rural villages has a startling effect on the health of the residents of these communities. This vital federal funding will not only improve the health and well being of the residents in these communities, but also will create a long-lasting investment throughout Alaska." 
   As passed, the legislation will increase the authorized level of program funding per fiscal year from $40 million to $45 million. The U.S. House will consider the bill when it reconvenes in November.
