ANWR INCLUDED IN DEFECIT REDUCTION PACKAGE; SEN. MURKOWSKI APPLAUDS BUDGET COMMITEE
  Saying the U.S. Senate completed another step in the process of getting portions of the Arctic Coastal Plain open to responsible and environmentally sensitive oil and gas development, Alaska Sen.  
 Lisa Murkowski today applauded the Budget Committee vote to include ANWR in the deficit reduction package. 
   "For our economic and strategic security our nation needs a truly balanced energy policy that increases development of renewable fuels, increases energy conservation, and increases domestic energy production," Murkowski said. 
   "The recent energy bill provided unprecedented aid to encourage wind, solar and geothermal development. It contained tax breaks for hybrid cars and research aid for nuclear power and hydrogen fuel cell development. What it did not do was open America's best domestic energy prospect to development. That is why Congress still has to vote to open a tiny portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy development. 
   "Today we have cleared one more hurdle to opening ANWR. The Budget Committee voted 12 to 10 to include ANWR in the budget reconciliation package. The race is not finished yet, but I am confident that we are one step closer to providing the nation with more domestic energy production. 
   "Americans are clearly concerned about the high cost of gasoline and home heating oil and our long-term need for energy is only going to grow. I believe that opening a small portion of ANWR to responsible oil development is part of the solution to a balanced energy policy." 
   The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 is the first significant budget reduction package produced by the Senate since 1997 and floor debate is expected to begin next week.
