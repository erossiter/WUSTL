SEN. MURKOWSKI: STATE GAINS NEW SECURITY FUNDS TO BEEF UP SECURITY FOR STATE FERRIES, ALASKA RAILROAD, PORTS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has acted upon congressional requests and is providing a number of grants today to help beef up transportation and port security in Alaska. 
   "The third anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks helps to remind us how we need to improve the security of all forms of transportation in this country, not just aviation, but also ferry and rail service and the security at our ports. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorist attacks on this country continues. These grants provide needed federal assistance to our state to help meet those threats," said Senator Murkowski.
   She said the grants being announced today by the Department of Homeland Security include:
   * $189,000 to the Alaska Marine Highway System to beef up security on the state's ferry system.
   * $175,000 to the Alaska Interisland Ferry Authority based in Ketchikan to improve security on its ferries serving Prince of Wales Island.
   * $297,010 to the Alaska Railroad to fund a video surveillance system at the railroad's yard in Seward.
   * $200,000 to Wrangell to increase security at port and dock facilities in the Southeast town.
   * And two grants to Valdez, $8,800 for new barriers at the Valdez port and $125,000 for an electronic access system.
   "Besides protecting passengers on our ferries and the Alaska Railroad, it is welcome indeed that Homeland Security had provided additional grants to beef up security in Valdez, the site of the terminal for the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The grants will help to increase protection for the pipeline, the source of 80 percent of the state's revenues and of nearly a fifth of America's daily oil production," said Murkowski.
