SENATE APPROVES INTERIOR-RELATED SPENDING REQUESTS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today applauded Senate passage of the Interior Appropriations Conference Report for Fiscal Year 2006. Murkowski stressed the importance of the additional $1.5 billion for Veterans' health care funding contained in the bill.  
   "The additional Veterans funding provided in this bill will help meet the VA funding shortfall that became apparent this year. I'm proud that the Senate was able to quickly approve this funding and that our Veterans will continue to get the health care they deserve," Murkowski said. 
   Murkowski also noted the significance of the $35 million in EPA funding for the Village Safe Water program. "Bearing in mind that the Administration requested only $15 million in EPA funding for this program in FY '06, which would have been almost a 70 percent cut in funding from FY '05 levels, I am pleased that Congress recognizes the importance of this program to rural Alaska communities," said Murkowski, who supported this funding request jointly with Senator Ted Stevens. 
   To help ensure implementation of the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act- legislation passed last year to ensure that all outstanding lands under the Alaska Statehood Act of 1959, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 are conveyed to their recipient's by the 50th Anniversary of statehood in 2009- the bill contains $40.5 million to expedite conveyances. 
   Other items contained in the Interior bill at Murkowski's and Stevens' request include: 
   * $300,000 for the Cook Inlet Tribal Council youth camp reforestation project. This funding will be used to plant seedlings on the Kenai Peninsula that will replace trees previously killed by Spruce Bark Beetles. This project provides summer employment to over 100 Alaska Native youth. 
   * $250,000 in funding for the Regional Mark Processing Center (Mark Center), which is operated by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). The commission, of which Alaska is one of five member states, works to resolve fishery issues. If this funding were not provided, timely coded wire tag fish data exchanges for U.S./Canada fishery treaty obligations would not be possible. This data is vital for fishery management and resource allocation uses in both the United States and Canada. 
   * $500,000 for natural gas hydrates research and development. This funding will go to a consortium, comprised of the Energy Department, U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Alaska. These funds will be used to research and develop commercial applications of gas hydrates. 
   * $750,000 for transportation and facilities management for the Iditarod trail, as well as trails in the lower 48. With respect to the Iditarod Trail, the funding will be used to add new trail signs, trail grooming, safety and checkpoint cabin improvements, bridge construction and improvements. 
   The bill, which passed the House by 410-10 and passed the Senate by a vote of 99-1, now heads to the President for his signature.
