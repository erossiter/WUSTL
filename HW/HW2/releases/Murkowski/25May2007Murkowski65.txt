SEN. MURKOWSKI SUPPORTS IRAQ FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Murkowski today made the following comments on the Iraq Supplemental Funding Bill.  
   "After weeks of debate, leaders in the House and Senate have reached a compromise on an Iraq spending bill that the President has agreed to sign. I supported this bi-partisan spending measure and believe it strikes a good balance between giving troops the resources they need and requiring that Iraqi leaders meet certain benchmarks on political and security reforms. "Throughout the debate, I have remained opposed to an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal. I maintain a timetable puts our troops in greater danger, emboldens our enemy and sends an unacceptable message to American servicemen and women. "This compromise funding measure shows our troops, their families and the rest of the world that Congress and the American people support the military and their efforts."
