SEN. MURKOWSKI CHAMPIONS ENERGY EFFICIENCY
  Senator Murkowski is pleased to support Energy Star Change a Light Day - a national challenge to encourage every American to change one regular, inefficient light bulb to an Energy Star rated light bulb.  
   "The simple task of replacing one light bulb with an energy efficient bulb can have a huge impact on energy savings," said Senator Murkowski. "Though changing a light bulb may be perceived as having little impact, it is in fact an important step in a balanced approach toward improving our nation's energy future. I challenge all Americans to take this easy step towards energy efficiency." 
   If every household in Alaska changed just one incandescent light bulb to an Energy Star bulb, it would have the following effect in Alaska: 
   * Savings of up to 12 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to light Juneau for over 190 days. ? A combined reduction in household electrical bills of $1.7 million a year. ? Reduction of 18 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions each year - this is equal to removing nearly 2 thousands cars from Alaska's roads. 
   Energy Star Change a Light Day is a part of the Change a Light, Change the World Campaign encouraging Americans to pledge to change a light bulb in their home to an energy efficient bulb. Over 500,000 Americans have taken the pledge since the campaign launched in 2005.
