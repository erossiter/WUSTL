SEN. MURKOWSKI WINS PASSAGE OF 'RED RIBBON WEEK' RESOLUTION
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski won Senate approval of a resolution declaring the week of Oct. 23-31 as "Red Ribbon Week."  
   The Red Ribbon Week Senate Resolution (S. Res. 578), sponsored by Sen. Murkowski, commemorates anti-drug efforts and will guide states, Parent Teacher Associations, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Governors and Attorneys General nationwide in partnering in an effort to call attention to the dangers of drug usage. 
   "The Red Ribbon that we will wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of zero tolerance for illegal drug use and our commitment to help people, especially children, make the right life-decisions," said Murkowski. 
   Red Ribbon Week was established by Congress in 1988 to commemorate the work of Enrique "Kiki" Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, who was murdered in the line of duty. The Red Ribbon campaign promotes the belief that one person can make a difference in the fight against drugs while encouraging a drug-free lifestyle and involvement in drug prevention efforts. 
   In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week will be a statewide celebration involving thousands of school children and other supporters. On October 23, the Municipality of Anchorage, in conjunction with the Alaska Red Ribbon Coalition, which is comprised of the Anchorage School District, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Alaska State Troopers, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska, the Alaska National Guard, and many other organizations, will hold its Red Ribbon Week kickoff. Among other activities, there will be poetry readings and dance performances, and a Public Service Announcement featuring local youths sending an anti-drug message will be broadcast throughout the State.
