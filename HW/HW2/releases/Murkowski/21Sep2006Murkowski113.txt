SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES SENATE PAGE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski is pleased to announce that Lily George of Anchorage has been appointed as a Page in the U.S. Senate. Miss George is a junior at Lumen Christi High School.  
   "For 25 years, young women have served with distinction in the Senate Page Program," said Senator Murkowski. "Lily is a lifelong Alaskan who is committed to service and I am confident that she will do all of Alaska proud during her tenure as a Page. I am delighted that Lily has accepted this new challenge and I wish her all the best during her time in Washington, D.C." 
   For more than 100 years, messengers known as Pages have served the United States Congress. Pages are appointed and sponsored by a member of Congress and must be high school juniors and at least sixteen years old. There are thirty Page positions in the United States Senate which serve its 100 Members, making the selection process highly competitive. Senate Page duties consist primarily of delivery of correspondence and legislative material within the Congressional complex. Other duties include preparing the chamber for Senate sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to the desk. Pages also attend classes in the early morning at the United States Senate Page School. The Page School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.
