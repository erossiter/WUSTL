SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES PUBLIC HOUSING GRANTS FOR ALASKA
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, saying that all Alaskans deserve decent housing, today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing the state with a series of grants to maintain, modernize and in some cases expand public, low-cost housing in Alaska. 
   Murkowski, who last year under the umbrella of the Alaska Project convened the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development, Education and Health and Human Services to discuss ways to improve housing in the state, also won a commitment from the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Agency to expand funding with a goal of starting 500 new public housing units in Alaska annually starting in 2005.
   Murkowski today announced that under the Department's Indian Housing block grant program five grants are being released today for public housing improvement and operation. They are:
   * The Tlingit and Haida Central Housing Authority based in Juneau is receiving a grant for $7,946,383 for operations and housing stock modernization in Southeast.
   * Ourtsaramiut Inc. of Bethel is receiving $1,842,906 for its public housing efforts.
   * The Village of Lime Village is gaining a grant for $25,331.
   * The Village of Tanacross is gaining $162,180.
   * And the Village of Ouzinkie is gaining $107,948
   Murkowski said these grants are in addition to a series of additional public housing grants from HUD announced last week, whose money is now being released.
