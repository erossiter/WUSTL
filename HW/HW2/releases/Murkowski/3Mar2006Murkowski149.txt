SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ENDORSES SEN. MURKOWSKI'S PUSH TO RESTORE VILLAGE SAFE WATER FUNDING
  The U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee has endorsed Sen. Lisa Murkowski's call for Congress to restore funding cuts in the President's Fiscal Year 2007 budget for the Alaska Native Village Safe Water program. The President's budget reduces Environmental Protection Agency funding for the program from the $35 million appropriated in Fiscal Year 2006 to $14.8 million in 2007.  
   "The lack of sanitation in rural villages has a startling effect on the health of the residents of these communities," said Senator Murkowski. "I am glad that the Senate Indian Affairs Committee supports funding the Alaska Native Village Safe Water program so that we can continue to make progress in meeting the needs of rural Alaskans." 
   The endorsement came in the Indian Affairs Committee's bipartisan annual budget letter to the Senate Budget Committee, submitted by Chairman John McCain (R-Arizona) and Senator Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota), the Vice Chairman and Ranking Democrat on the Committee. 
   The committee's letter notes that the "Indian Health Service estimated in Fiscal Year 2005 that it would cost more than $26 million just to address the worst deficiencies in Alaska Native villages which have either inadequate and non-compliant wastewater treatment systems or which lack safe water supply and sewage disposal systems." 
   The Indian Affairs Committee also endorsed restoration of funding for several of Senator Murkowski's other priorities for American Indian and Alaska Native programs. 
   * The Committee recommended the restoration of proposed cuts in funding for Indian Health Service hospital construction. Restoration of these funds will enable further progress toward construction of new hospitals in Barrow and Nome, which are number one and two on the Indian Health Service's national health facilities construction priority list. 
   * The Committee expressed its opposition to the Interior Department's proposal to eliminate the Johnson-O'Malley program, which provides cultural enrichment for Native children educated in public schools. The administration argued that the program duplicates similar programs offered by the US Department of Education. The Committee disputed the Administration's assertion. 
   * The Committee expressed its opposition to the Administration's proposal to eliminate funding for urban Indian health clinics which provide vital health services to Alaska Natives living on the West Coast. 
   * The Committee endorsed the administration's proposal for $3 million in new funding for a new program focused on American Indian and Alaska Native youth suicide prevention, noting that the suicide rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives is three times the national average. Senator Murkowski has joined with Senator McCain and other members of the Indian Affairs Committee in calling for a new program to expand tele-mental health services to Alaska Native villages and American Indian communities. 
   * The Committee also endorsed annual increases in the Indian Health Service budget to keep up with inflation, salary cost increases and population growth. Senator Murkowski supports 10 percent annual increases in the Indian Health Service health care delivery budget.
