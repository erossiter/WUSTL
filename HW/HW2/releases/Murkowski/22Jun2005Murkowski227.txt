SEN. MURKOWSKI JOINS NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO ENCOURAGE INTERNET SAFETY
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, along with Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Conrad Burns (R-MT) and six House members, met yesterday with representatives of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), Qwest Communications and leaders of the Senate and House Caucuses on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children to encourage awareness of Internet safety.  
   Sen. Murkowski's resolution that passed recently in the Senate designated June as National Internet Safety Month to help raise awareness among families to keep their children safe online. Members of Congress and other organizations are working together with children's advocates and business leaders to promote safer, more responsible online behavior by children and teens. 
   "With each positive advance we have made because of the Internet, there are unique dangers to children and challenges to families," Sen. Murkowski said. "By participating in online activities as a family, and by being aware of what our children are doing online, we can all help mitigate any of the potential threats to the well being of our families." 
   Studies indicate that 39 percent of youths in grades 5 through 12 in the United States admit to giving out their personal information, such as their name, age and gender, over the Internet. Additionally, 11.5 percent of students in this age group have actually met face-to-face with a stranger they met on the Internet. 
   "Of the estimated 24 million child Internet users, one in five has received unwanted sexual solicitations," said Ernie Allen, president and CEO of NCMEC.
