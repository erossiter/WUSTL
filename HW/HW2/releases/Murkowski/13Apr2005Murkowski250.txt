SEN. MURKOWSKI WINS SENATE SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski won Senate support to designate April 15th as National Youth Service Day to honor youth service efforts nationwide.  
   Murkowski won unanimous Senate approval to designate the day to foster a public awareness and education campaign that highlights the extraordinary contributions that young people make to their communities throughout the year. "On April 15th, youth from across the United States and the world will carry out community service projects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment," Murkowski said. 
   The goals of National Youth Service Day are to mobilize youth as leaders in identifying and addressing the needs of their communities; to support youth in community service and civic engagement; and to educate the public, the media and policymakers about the year-round contributions of young people to their communities. 
   "Too often, the good work to improve our community done by young people goes unnoticed and under appreciated," said Murkowski. "By keeping young people active and involved in their communities, youth have an opportunity to learn valuable skills and to show they can take responsibility. I commend those organizations taking part in National Youth Service Day." 
   National Youth Service Day brings together over 50 lead agencies, 114 national partners, hundreds of grant winners, and thousands of local partners to support and promote the millions of youth engaged in community service.
