SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS AS SUPREME COURT JUDGE
  Tonight, Sen. Lisa Murkowski issued the following statement regarding President Bush's nomination of D.C. Circuit Judge John G. Roberts to be a United States Supreme Court Associate Justice:  
   "Judge John Roberts has the qualifications and experience to be an excellent Supreme Court Justice. From his academic experience to his clerkships on the Supreme Court to his service under President Reagan and his impressive record of arguing nearly forty cases before the Supreme Court, Roberts has excelled as an attorney and a judge. He has been written about as a judge who fairly and equally applies the law and I look forward to the confirmation process."
