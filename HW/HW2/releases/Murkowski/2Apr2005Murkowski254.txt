SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski issued the following statement in response to the announcement today that Pope John Paul II passed away:  
   "My family and I are deeply saddened by the Pope's death. Since 1978, as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, he has showed the world the stunning power of faith. His Holiness acted as a force for peace in the world and furthered the cause of human freedom and dignity. 
   "The Pope's devout faith touched the lives of Alaskans and millions of people across the United States and around the world. We are grateful that Pope John Paul II had the opportunity to visit Alaska on two occasions where he was able to personally touch the lives of many Alaskans. Of course few can forget that the Pope's historic meeting with President Ronald Reagan occurred in Alaska. He was an extraordinary, inspirational and spiritual person and the world is a better place thanks to his service and spiritual leadership."
