SEN. MURKOWSKI ADVOCATES TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS
  Concerned about the rising cost of health care in the United States, Sen. Lisa Murkowski has signed on as an original co-sponsor of S. 1514, "The Over-the Counter (OTC) Medicine Tax Fairness Act of 2005." The bill would amend the medical and dental expense income tax deduction so that nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs would be allowed as a deductible expense for taxpayers who itemize their deductions.  
   Currently, individuals may deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that are not covered by their health insurance if they exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. The IRS code (Section 213) however, only allows for deductions on items used for the "diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease." Items like prescription drugs, insulin, bandages, contact lenses, crutches, hearing aids, health insurance premiums, and lab fees can be deducted. 
   Over-the-counter drugs, even medications that were previously prescription drugs, cannot be deducted. Americans are increasingly burdened by medications being switched from prescription to over-the-counter, preventing patients from claiming them on their insurance. This, along with the rising costs of drugs in general, can make it difficult for Americans to afford quality health care. 
   The popularity of deducting medical expenses has increased as Americans spend more out-of-pocket dollars on health care. In 1997 only 4.3 percent of taxpayers claimed the deduction. By 2000, the last year with available date, the number had increased to 5.02 percent. 
   Medical deductions are especially popular among lower income brackets. In 2000, 56 percent of individuals with an adjusted gross income under $20,000 took the deduction compared to 25 percent of those with an income between $30,000 and $40,000. 
   The proposed change to the tax code would help more Americans afford the medications they need to stay healthy. The bill is being sponsored by Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC). Other co-sponsors include Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and Mark Dayton (D-MN).
