SEN. MURKOWSKI JOINS PRESIDENT AT SIGNING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCEALED WEAPONS ACT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined President George W. Bush at the White House as he signed legislation that she helped craft to allow current and retired police officers to carry concealed weapons. 
   The Senate last spring adopted a bill (S. 253) that provides a federal exemption to state laws to permit law enforcement officers and qualified retired officers with proper identification to carry concealed weapons. July 8 to speed the process, the Senate passed an identical House bill (H.R. 218) without amendment, clearing the way for the bill to become law more quickly.
   "It's been pointed out that many police officers worry about their safety when traveling and especially following retirement, where in some jurisdictions, they lose their ability to carry weapons. These officers are fully trained and qualified to safely carry weapons. With this law we enhance the personal safety of traveling and retired police who for years have worked to protect the public from dangerous criminals," said Murkowski.
   She said the law also increases law enforcement protection for the public since it ensures that off-duty and retired police are ready to handle emergencies regardless of their location.
   "This was a very reasonable measure to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel and actually all of us," said Senator Murkowski.
   Under the measure officers may not carry firearms with silencers, machine guns or any other type of "destructive device," but can carry weapons for which they are qualified or requalified to carry within the previous 12 months.
