SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FINAL SENATE APPROVAL OF HER AGRICULTURAL-RELATED SPENDING REQUESTS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today said Alaska faired well in the final Agricultural Appropriations spending bill for FY '05 that passed the Senate late Nov. 20.  
   Murkowski, commenting on just one of nine parts of the final $388 billion Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 4818), said the measure met a number of Alaska's needs. 
   Senator Murkowski and Sen. Stevens jointly sought and won $26 million in the Agriculture Appropriations section of the bill to continue improvements to the state's rural water and sewer systems. The nearly $15 million increase over funding sought in the President's budget will go for the continued upgrading of rural water and sanitation systems. It is likely one part of total federal funding for improvement to the state's rural water and sanitation systems. 
   Murkowski and Stevens jointly also sought funding to aid the Alaska salmon industry. They obtained $1.108 million for the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service to fund research into development of alternative salmon products. Some $1 million will go for overall salmon products including nutritional supplements with another $443,000 going for research and development into using salmon as a base for baby foods. The goal is to increase the market for salmon by encouraging the production of more "value-added" salmon products. 
   They also won approval for $1.06 million to fund seafood harvesting, processing and marketing programs. The pair also won language in the bill encouraging the Agricultural Marketing Service to make grants to both Kenai and to Alaska regional marketing organizations to promote the sale of "wild salmon." 
   Other items in the bill proposed by Murkowski that were accepted by the panel include: 
   Natural Resource Conservation Service: 
   * The Senator jointly with Sen. Stevens won committee report language to encourage continued federal funding of the Matanuska River Erosion Control program designed to reduce streambank erosion that threatens homes in the Mat-Su Borough. 
  * They won report language calling for a flood plain study of McCarthy Creek near McCarthy. 
  * And they won report language calling for studies on the Tanana River. 
   Rural Development: 
   * The Senator and Sen. Stevens jointly sought and won $28 million of funding for the Rural Community Advancement program, money to be used to provide grants to develop power to reduce high-cost energy in rural communities.
  * The senators also gained $21 million for facilities in rural communities suffering from high unemployment and severe economic depression.
  * They won $1.5 million for a Denali Commission Solid Waste program. 
  * And they won $1 million for the expansion of the dairy industry and related milk processing and packaging facilities in milk shortage states, such as Alaska. 
   All of the items - except defense, military construction and homeland security spending - are subject to a 0.83 percent across-the-board rescission to hold spending within targeted levels.
