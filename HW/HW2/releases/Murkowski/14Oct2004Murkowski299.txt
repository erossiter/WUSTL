SEN. MURKOWSKI: HHS TO GIVE WRANGELL, YAKUTAT FUNDS TO BUILD NEW HEALTH CENTERS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski this afternoon announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is awarding two grants for new health centers to Wrangell and Yakutat so the communities can improve health facilities.  
   Murkowski said Wrangell Community Services is gaining a grant for $650,000 for a clinic to serve the town's 3,300 residents, while the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe is gaining a grant for $321,140 to serve the town's 884 residents - two of the 76 health center grants that Secretary of HHS Tommy G. Thompson announced today nationwide. The Department today provided $49 million nationwide for improvements to local health clinics. 
   The funds can go towards construction of new or renovation of existing community health centers in the towns. The funds will actually be sent to the groups in December. The money comes from an initiative by President Bush to add 1,200 new and expanded health centers nationwide so that the centers can treat up to 16 million Americans by 2006. So far 700 of the new centers have been funded. 
   "These funds will help expand and improve the only clinic in Yakutat and the main health facility in Wrangell. The funds are a real boost to improving health care in the Panhandle. The improvements will allow the centers to offer more and better services for local residents," said Murkowski.
