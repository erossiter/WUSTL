SEN. MURKOWSKI'S RESOLUTION ON FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS PASSES SENATE
  The United States Senate last evening unanimously passed Senator Lisa Murkowski's resolution to designate September 9, 2007 as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day. Tragically, Alaska has the highest rate of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD) in the nation. Approximately 163 Alaskan babies are born each year affected by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Among Alaskan Native communities, the rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the state.  
   "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is so tragic because it is 100 percent preventable," said Senator Murkowski. "By raising awareness and investing in prevention and treatment now, we can ensure that fewer children will become afflicted with certain disorders and disabilities." 
   The resolution encourages all Americans to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and to ensure healthier communities throughout the United States. On National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness day, Americans are also encouraged to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9, 2007, to remember that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any alcohol.
