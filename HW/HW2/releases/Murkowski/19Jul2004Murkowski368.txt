SEN. MURKOWSKI: KENAI LANDING PROJECT GAINS FEDERAL LOAN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to make a $2.75 million loan to permit construction to continue on the Kenai Landing project designed to convert the old Ward's Cove salmon cannery in Kenai into a resort and commercial and recreational development. 
   Murkowski was informed by the USDA's Rural Development Agency that it has decided to grant the guaranteed, low-interest loan to Steve Agni, developer of the Kenai Landing project.
   "It's wonderful to see the government make capital available for a project that is going to be a real addition to Kenai and provide a real boost to the town's tourism and commercial economy - a project that should also help all of Alaska's tourism industry," said Murkowski.
   The project involves turning the 35-building, 90-year-old cannery complex at the mouth of the Kenai River into a tourism resort with restaurant and retail buildings. Other attractions at the project include a small-scale fish processing plant, charter fishing operations, and vendor shops similar to Pike Place Market in Seattle. The complex, being modernized while retaining the historic fishery motif of the cannery and an historic Alaska town, is also intended to include a youth camp, a theater, and recreational attractions.
   The loan came from the USDA's business and industry loan program.
