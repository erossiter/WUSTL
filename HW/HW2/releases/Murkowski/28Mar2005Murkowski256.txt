SEN. MURKOWSKI PRESENTS GRANT TO MAT-SU VALLEY HOSPITAL
  Today, Sen. Lisa Murkowski took part in the presentation of a $4,893,000 grant for the new Mat-Su Valley Hospital.  
 The grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be used to extend water and sewer lines from the City of Palmer to the hospital site. 
   "As we think of those critical infrastructure components in a community - those things that really help build a community and bring it together, a hospital is one of those life blood fixtures. We recognize the incredible growth in the Valley and the need for a first class facility. And that's what we know this will be," said Murkowski at the check presentation. Murkowski was joined at the presentation by Alaska USDA Director Bill Allen, Palmer Deputy Mayor Tony Pippel, Palmer City Manager Tom Healy and Mat-Su Valley Hospital Administrator Norman Stephens. 
   Allen said the Mat-Su Valley, because of its rapid growth, is in particular need of this new health care facility. He also said that this grant would go far in helping build the necessary infrastructure. Allen noted that this grant was an example of how all levels of government - federal to city - can work together to accomplish an important goal. 
   Palmer Deputy Mayor Tony Pippel noted that the hospital is the biggest project the City of Palmer has ever undertaken. "This is a tough funding time in D.C. and with many priorities for federal money this grant is overwhelming for us," Pippel added. 
   In August, Murkowski helped announce a previous grant of $2.4 million in FY04 funding to the hospital for water and sewer lines.
