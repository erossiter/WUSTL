SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON JULY 4
  Sen. Murkowski's July 4th Statement: 
   "This July 4th marks the 230th anniversary of the day our forefathers declared independence and a new nation was born - a nation founded on equality, freedom and justice for all. 
   "As you gather with friends and neighbors to celebrate and to count your blessings, remember the men and women of our Armed Forces who are observing this Independence Day in other nations across the globe. While they are fighting to protect our freedom here at home, they also are helping to bring the principles that make our nation great to people who have only known despair. 
   "Today, July 4, 2006, let us honor America's values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and pay tribute to the men and women of our armed forces who represent these values throughout the world. "May God bless you and may God continue to bless America."
