SEN. MURKOWSKI CONDEMNS NORTH KOREA'S WEAPONS TESTING
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today issued the following statement regarding North Korea's claim of having successfully tested a nuclear weapon.  
   "If North Korea detonated a nuclear weapon, as they have claimed to do, they have crossed a line that earns them universal condemnation. Pyongyang's decision to conduct this test is completely unacceptable. The international community must unite in standing up to the actions of a bully and make it clear that this decision will not be tolerated. 
   "The United States and the rest of the world are faced with a situation in which there are no good options. We must make sure, however, that we do not choose the worst option as our response. I urge the United Nations Security Council to impose significant sanctions on the Pyongyang regime. I also urge the members of the six-party talks to continue their efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program through diplomatic means."
