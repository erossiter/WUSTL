SEN. MURKOWSKI TO POST APPROPRIATIONS REQUESTS ONLINE
  Senator Murkowski today announced that she will join Senator Stevens and Congressman Young in posting appropriations requests on her website. Her office received nearly 500 funding requests this year from local governments, organizations and the State of Alaska.  
   "I am joining Senator Stevens and Congressman Young in taking this step to highlight the appropriations process that the delegation goes through each year," said Senator Murkowski. "By posting appropriations requests on our website we can demonstrate the real needs that local communities and organizations have identified across the state." 
   Each year, Senator Murkowski receives requests for funding from across the state. Funding requests for fiscal year 2009 were due February 15. Constituents will soon be able to visit www.murkowski.senate.gov/approps and view information on all appropriations requests received this year including the organization requesting the appropriation, a description of the project, its location and the amount requested.
