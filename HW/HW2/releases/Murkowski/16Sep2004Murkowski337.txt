SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF COMMERCE- JUSTICE-RELATED SPENDING REQUESTS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed action by the Senate Appropriations Committee that has agreed to include funding for several projects that the Senator proposed to the committee in its version of the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations spending bill for FY '05.  
   The committee, chaired by fellow Alaskan Sen. Ted Stevens, Wednesday morning "marked up" and approved its version of the Commerce, Justice and State spending bill, clearing the way for Senate consideration of the measure. 
   Concerning the Department of Justice budget, the Senator won $1.75 million for infrastructure for the Land Mobile Radio system to improve public safety communication in Anchorage. She also won another $1.75 million for purchase of similar radio equipment for the Kenai Peninsula Borough. 
   The senator, in a joint effort with Sen. Stevens, also won $2.5 million for construction of a statewide Land Mobile Radio network, a network important to further homeland security in Alaska. Working with Sen. Stevens, she also won $2 million for a training program for the state's Village Public Safety Officers program, including money for acquisition of emergency response and search and rescue equipment for rural communities. 
   The Senator also sought and won $1.45 million for Wasilla so that mobile computers can be installed in Wasilla city policy squad cars, the money also funding a computer link to the town's police station. She also gained $225,000 to fund enhanced crime scene examinations by the State and $200,000 for a South Central Alaska Search and Rescue Training project to be developed by the Anchorage Police Department. 
   The Senator also worked with Sen. Stevens to gain $1.1 million from the Bureau of Justice Assistance Discretionary Grant program for a program to help alcohol interdiction efforts, including efforts to investigate and prosecute bootlegging crimes as part of a statewide effort to reduce Fetal Alcohol Syndrome problems in Alaska. The money is intended to go to the Alaska State Troopers and to the Alaska Department of Law and is important since 80 percent of all crime in the state is committed by those under the influence of alcohol. 
   The Senator, jointly with Sen. Stevens, sought and won approval for $950,000 for a domestic violence prosecution unit to enforce zero tolerance policies against domestic violence. 
   The Senator also won $750,000 to fund the Sexual Assault Response Team of the Municipality of Anchorage. She won $2.7 million in funding for a sexual assault, domestic violence prosecution unit for the State of Alaska. She won $2.4 million for funding for an Anchorage Domestic Violence Prevention Project and $750,000 for a Victims of Justice program designed to help victims of violent crime. 
   Murkowski sought much of the funding as an outgrowth of a Domestic Violence Summit that she sponsored in Anchorage this summer, which indicated the need for more effort to combat domestic violence in Alaska. 
   The Senator sought and won $1 million to fund an expansion of Youth Courts in Alaska. The courts offer alternative adjudication and sentencing procedures for first-time youth offenders who are offered mentoring and family counseling services. And she sought and won $602,000 for a child support enforcement effort in the state. 
   She sought $2.5 million for a new Alaska Court System Information Network, funding for the state's court system to develop a computer network to allow remote access to court records. 
   Economic Development Administration: 
   The Senator, jointly with Sen. Stevens, sought and won $4 million in additional funding for economic development grants - money to fund development efforts to diversify local economies. The funding should contribute to fulfilling a commitment that was made to the state in 2000 that Alaska would receive about $15 million in aid for several years to help offset downturns in the state's fishing economy. 
   Small Business Administration: 
   * She sought and won $1.58 million for the Small Business Administration to fund the Technology Venture Center/Tech Ranch in Montana and the InvestNet Partnership program in Alaska. The money, for salaries and expenses, should help these organizations develop innovative programs to promote economic alliances between Alaska and Montana entrepreneurs and investors. The money will be split between the Alaska and Montana programs. 
   * She sought and won $150,000 for the Alaska Procurement Technical Assistance Center. 
   * $1 million to establish a National Database of Minority Businesses. 
   * $1.2 million for construction of a small business development center in Wrangell to assist the town's economic diversification efforts. 
   NOAA: 
   * She sought and won $2.5 million to fund the Alaska Ocean Observing system. The system's mission is to improve the ability to rapidly detect changes in marine ecosystems and living resources and to predict future changes. When finished, the network will deliver both real-time information and long-term trends about Alaska's ocean conditions and marine life. 
   * She sought and won $2 million for the International Arctic Research Center to improve Arctic climate research. 
   * She sought and won $1.5 million to fund a cleanup of trash and marine debris along coastal Alaska. 
   * She sought and won $1 million for new rockfish research in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The basic biological research is designed to prevent a depletion of stocks that could then affect other stock harvests. 
   * She sought some $8.1 million to fully fund implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty next year. Murkowski earlier this year had convinced the U.S. State Department to transfer money to fund salmon treaty habitat efforts following a funding shortfall. This funding level should guarantee full funding for the administrative duties of the commission. 
   * She won $3 million for acquisition of enhanced fishery habitat equipment and the launches to hold the equipment, to be based on the Fairweather research vessel headquartered in Ketchikan. The boats will conduct a variety of fisheries research in state waters. 
   * She also won $4.9 million to fund the costs of moving the research vessel Oscar Dyson to Kodiak. 
   * She sought and won $3,368,000 to fund fish hatchery facilities in Fairbanks using waste heated water from facilities in town. The hatchery should produce more fish on the Chena and Tanana Rivers for Interior fishermen. 
   * And she sought and won $3.5 million for efforts to restore salmon fisheries in her hometown of Anchorage at Ship, Chester and Campbell Creeks including habitat restoration efforts and related facilities.
