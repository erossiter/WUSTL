SEN. MURKOWSKI: GOVERNMENT SEEKING TO BUY NEARLY 18,000 CASES OF CANNED SALMON; ALASKA SELLERS NEED TO ACT FAST
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today was notified that the federal government is seeking to buy nearly 18,000 cases of institutionally packed canned salmon for use in institutional (prison) food and nutrition programs. But Alaska sellers must act very fast, indeed.  
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced it is seeking bids for 17,940 cases of four-pound cans of pink salmon. Bids for the salmon, to be shipped between Oct. 16 and Nov. 30 to prisons such as Leavenworth, Kansas, and other federal facilities, must be submitted by means of the internet by 1:30 p.m. (CDT) Monday, Sept. 20. The internet address is: http://pcsd.usda.gov:3077/mdbc1000.exe? Bids will be selected by midnight Monday. 
   The bidding time is so short so that the sale can be completed before the close of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30. 
   "The Alaska Delegation has been encouraging the government all year to buy more Alaska salmon for food programs because it is nutritious and because its bulk purchases also will help to reduce inventories and raises prices for Alaska salmon fishermen," said Sen. Murkowski who was notified of the purchase by Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman. 
   The buy, which must come from salmon packed during the 2003 season, comes after a commitment made by the Administration earlier this summer to buy at least $15 million of salmon packed during the just concluding 2004 harvest season - an increase of nearly $3 million compared to purchases last year.
