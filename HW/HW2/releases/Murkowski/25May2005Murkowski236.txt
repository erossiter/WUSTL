SEN. MURKOWSKI INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO INCREASE FOOD DONATIONS TO ALASKA NATIVES
  Saying that Alaska Natives and Native Americans face greater challenges in securing basic household necessities such as food, Sen.  
 Lisa Murkowski today introduced legislation to increase the amount of food donations going to Alaska Natives and American Indians. 
   The Senator's legislation, S.1115, would amend the Federal tax code to make corporate charitable donations of food to Native tribes tax deductible. Section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows corporations to take an enhanced tax deduction for donations of food inventory; however, the food must be distributed to 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, such as food banks. Under current law, tribes do not qualify as eligible recipients. 
   "Nearly 36 million Americans face challenges in getting enough food to eat and Natives constitute a disproportionate amount of this group," Sen. Murkowski said. "With this simple correction to the tax code, we can help charitable organizations do more to help our Native communities. 
   "If this legislation is enacted, in Alaska alone, half of the food donated to the Food Bank of Alaska from corporations could go to tribes throughout Alaska. In South Dakota, roughly 30 percent of the food the Community Food Banks of South Dakota distributes would go to reservations. The Montana Food Bank Network projects that food donations could increase by 16 percent. This very small legislative step will go miles toward helping food be distributed to those who need it most."
