SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FIRST GROUP OF ALASKA INTERNS TO WASHINGTON, D.C. OFFICE
  Sen. Murkowski's office experienced a youthful burst of energy last week with the arrival of 10 summer interns. The interns will spend four weeks on Capitol Hill assisting with legislative and constituent duties in the office.  
   Designed for recent high school graduates, the program consists of two sessions and will welcome a new group of interns on July 9. The program, which is coordinated by Alaska Pacific University and financed privately, provides Alaskan students an opportunity to experience politics and history firsthand. 
   "This is a wonderful opportunity for young Alaskans to come to D.C. and work in a legislative office. An internship in Washington allows students to take with them a better understanding of how our laws are made and the problems that face our society. These experiences can truly help them in their future careers," Senator Murkowski said. One of the highlights of the internship is shadowing the Senator for a couple days. The interns not only learn how a Senate office works, but also have the chance to attend committee hearings and seminars. The interns also have an opportunity to visit many of the city's museums and monuments, including a tour of the White House. 
   So far, the Murkowski interns feel the experience has been worthwhile. Kimberly Copadis and Nina Eliassen, both from Anchorage, agreed being in Washington has helped them gain a better understating of politics and the Senate. Eliassen said, "I love history. You hear so much about it in class, but you can't actually see how it all works until you get here." 
   The first group of interns will return home to Alaska on July 2.
