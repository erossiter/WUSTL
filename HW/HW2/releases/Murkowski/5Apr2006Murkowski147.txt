SEN. MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY PASSES SENATE WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski's resolution to designate April 21, 2006 as National and Global Youth Service Day, S. Res. 422, last night passed the Senate by unanimous consent. For the past four years, Sen. Murkowski has offered this resolution in the Senate as a way to raise public awareness of the valuable contributions young people make to their communities throughout the year. Since being introduced by the Senator in 2003, the resolution has passed each year with unanimous approval and strong bipartisan support.  
   "Because of the inspiration provided by our youth, and particularly our young adults in Alaska, I was proud to introduce legislation to designate April 21st as National and Global Youth Service Day," said Senator Murkowski. "It is vital that we recognize our outstanding youth and I strongly believe this is one way we can do so." 
   In Alaska, the following groups will engage youth in community service activities in observance of National and Global Youth Service Day: 
   * Anchorage's Promise is sponsoring an annual Kids' Day event. More than 20 interactive exhibits will be staffed by youth - including booths where young people can learn why bicycle helmets are important. 
   * Eighth graders from the Neon Team at Goldenview Middle School in Anchorage are creating colorful cards with Spring-themed poems. At least 120 students will donate cards to social service agencies, hospitals and community support organizations throughout Anchorage. 
   * Members of Alaska Youth for Environmental Action, a state-wide youth organization associated with the National Wildlife Federation, are developing a project to inform and involve youth in the use of energy efficient light bulbs. 
   The goals of National and Global Youth Service Day are to mobilize youth as leaders in identifying and addressing the needs of their communities; to support youth in community service and civic engagement; and to educate the public, the media and policymakers about the year-round contributions of young people to their communities. On this day, young people across the United States, and in more than 100 countries around the world, will participate in community service projects.
