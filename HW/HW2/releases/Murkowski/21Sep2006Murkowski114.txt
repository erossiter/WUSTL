SEN. MURKOWSKI ADDRESSES YOUNG PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP SUMMIT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today addressed the Young Professional Leadership Summit - a national forum that facilitates policy-based dialogue between governmental leaders and outstanding young professionals.  
   Senator Murkowski helped moderate a discussion on healthcare where she told the group, "We all recognize that healthcare costs are a burden on American families. As a nation we spend more on health care than anything else. As young professionals you can take steps to help alleviate costs down the road. Find ways to reduce stress at work, and encourage your employer to provide a workplace that promotes a safe and healthy environment." 
   Four Alaskans are participating in the Summit. They include: 
   * Angelina Burney, Special Projects Manager at the Alaska Department of Commerce in Anchorage; 
   * Tiffany Cook, Manager at Wells Fargo Bank in Wrangell; 
   * Neal Foster, Vice President at Sitnasuak Corporation in Nome; and 
   * Jennifer Harrison, Executive Director at Chickaloon Village Tribal Council in Chickaloon. 
   "I am proud that these Alaskans, who represent a broad range of interests across the state, have taken an interest in the direction of our nation," said Senator Murkowski. "Our state depends upon young leaders like Angelina, Tiffany, Neal and Jennifer. I encourage them to stay involved to make a difference in their communities." 
   The Young Professional Leadership Summit will convene sessions that will allow a discussion on the most pressing issues impacting our communities. Sessions will focus on ensuring America's competitive edge in education and the global economy, as well as innovations in health care, technology and science.
