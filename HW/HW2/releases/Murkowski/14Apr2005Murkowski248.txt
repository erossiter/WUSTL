SEN. MURKOWSKI RALLIES WITH DOCTORS FOR MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with doctors of osteopathic medicine, medical students, and Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Tom Coburn (R-OK), and Richard Burr (R-NC) to call on Congress to debate and pass meaningful medical liability reform.  
   Noting that the high cost of medical insurance and the threat of large liability lawsuits has driven many Alaskan physicians away from the state or into early retirement, Murkowski said that the lack of medical liability reform is a real problem that needs to be addressed. 
   "Now, I come from the incredibly great state of Alaska. And I'll stand and brag and boast about my state, but we've got a real problem right now," Murkowski told the assembled crowd of physicians and students. "We've got a real problem in that we have lost one half of our internists in the past five to seven years. One half of our internists are no longer practicing in the state of Alaska. I've got a state that is more than 570 thousand square miles. It is huge. Alaskans need to be seen by practicing physicians" 
   Murkowski noted that in Alaska, where medical liability reform has not yet been enacted, there are only three practicing neurosurgeons in the entire state. Whereas, in Idaho, a state with roughly twice the population of Alaska and where liability reform has been enacted, there are 17 neurosurgeons. 
   Today's event was held in conjunction with the American Osteopathic Association's annual advocacy day. 
   Murkowski noted that the Senate Republican leadership has indicated that medical liability reform is a top priority this Congress and that she hopes to see a bill introduced soon.
