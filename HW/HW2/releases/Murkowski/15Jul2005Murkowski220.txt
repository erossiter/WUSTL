SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR ALASKA SALMON FISHERMEN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is inviting public comment on the renewal of petitions for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) that were originally approved for benefits in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.  
 This comment period affects those salmon fishermen in Alaska who have applied for TAA. 
   The USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) must determine annually if trade and economic conditions warrant a petition's renewal. FAS will consider the comments and determine whether to re-certify the petitions in fiscal year 2006. 
   "I encourage Alaska's salmon fishermen to provide comment during this period," Sen. Murkowski said. "Public input is important to the continuation of this necessary aid." 
   Under the TAA program, USDA provides technical assistance to farmers and fisherman adversely affected by imports of foreign farmed commodities. Traditionally, the TAA program has only applied to American farmers affected by imported foreign crops. In 2003, Alaska's Congressional Delegation was successful in advocating that TAA also apply to salmon fishermen as the industry, particularly in Alaska, has been hit hard by farmed imports from South America. 
   Comments regarding petition re-certification should be sent by fax to Jean-Louis Pajot, Coordinator, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, FAS, USDA, at (202) 720-0876, or by email at trade.assistance@fas.usda.gov.
   Contact: Elliott Bundy and Kristin Pugh, 202/224-4513, 202/224-9301.
