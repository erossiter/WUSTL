SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMEMORATES FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11 TRAGEDY
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today issued the following statement on the upcoming fourth anniversary of September 11, 2001.  
   "We can never forget the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001. This September 11, the nation will gather in New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and across the country to remember and honor the victims of the attacks and to pray for their loved ones. 
   "We must remember and honor those who lost their lives and give thanks to the hundreds of firefighters, police and emergency personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice while trying rescue their fellow Americans. September 11 is also a day to reaffirm our commitment to those we lost. 
   "The 9/11 anniversary also reminds us how important it is to support our brave troops who are steadfastly defending our country and protecting our freedoms in the war against terror. 
   "September 11 united and continues to unite our country in a way we have not witnessed before. I hope now that our country will come together as we face the devastation and destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast region."
