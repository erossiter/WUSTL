SEN. MURKOWSKI PLEASED BY ANNOUNCEMENT OF STRYKER RETURN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today expressed her gratitude to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Army Secretary Francis Harvey upon learning that the previously announced 120-day window of deployment will not be extended for the 172nd Stryker Brigade. In August, Sen. Murkowski had written to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressing her dissatisfaction in how the redeployment of the Strykers had been handled and asked that the 120-day extension be honored. In response, Secretary Harvey indicated that the Strykers would indeed be back in Alaska by mid-December, but did not offer a firm date at that time. Congressional Offices were notified through official Army channels over the weekend of the December 13th timeframe.  
   "I am pleased that both Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Harvey closely considered the concerns expressed not only by myself, but also by the families and friends of the 172nd," said Senator Murkowski. "By firmly committing to the 120-day window, as so many of us had asked the military to do, families throughout Alaska can look forward to a truly joyous holiday season. Of course, our thoughts will be with all of the Alaskan Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen who will remain in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout the upcoming holidays and beyond. I very much look forward to a safe return of the Strykers and all of Alaska's servicemen and women."
