SEN. MURKOWSKI INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP OFFSET ESCALATING COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today joined Sens. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) in introducing legislation designed to assist low and moderate income Americans in paying for health insurance. The Helping Working Americans Afford Health Coverage Act of 2006 is intended to help working class families afford insurance. The introduction of this legislation coincides with National Cover the Uninsured Week.  
   "More and more families are finding themselves unable to afford health insurance and without the means to seek necessary medical treatment, a reality that is simply unacceptable," said Senator Murkowski when introducing the legislation in the U.S. Senate. "Making health insurance more affordable will make a real difference to the nation's physical and economic health. This legislation takes a decisive step towards making health coverage available to the working populations with the greatest needs." 
   National Cover the Uninsured Week has been held for the past four years in the first week of May. During this time, bipartisan events are held throughout the nation in an effort to bring attention to the 46 million Americans who have no health insurance. In Alaska, 110,000 people do not have health insurance - a figure that represents nearly 17% of the state's population. 
   The Helping Working Americans Afford Health Coverage Act of 2006 will provide working class Americans with a refundable tax credit they can use to purchase health insurance. Eligible Alaskans would receive an annual refundable tax credit of up to $3,000 per family, which would be advanced on a monthly basis. This bill also contains an important provision to address the higher health care costs in Alaska and increases the qualifying income thresholds for both individual Alaskans and Alaskan families by 25%.
