SEN. MURKOWSKI VOTES TO CONTINUE CHILD TAX CREDIT, REMOVE MARRIAGE PENALTY, 10 PERCENT TAX BRACKET
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski tonight voted to continue a $1,000 child tax credit, to extend the expanded 10-percent tax bracket, to provide continued marriage-penalty relief and to extend a series of energy, environmental and other tax breaks that would soon expire without renewal. 
   The Senator joined Republicans in extending three expiring provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The conference report on the bill, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 (H.R. 1308) passed the House earlier in the day, passed the Senate 92-3, and now heads to the President for his signature.
   The bill extends a series of tax relief initially approved by Congress in 2001. Under the 2001 bill, the tax relief was phased in over a period of ten years. In 2003, Congress accelerated a host of the tax relief provisions, including the child tax credit, the marriage-penalty elimination, and the expansion of the 10-percent income tax bracket. For 2003 and 2004, the child tax credit was increased to $1,000. Without the bill, the credit would have reverted to $700 in 2005, not reaching the $1,000 level again until 2010.
   The tax bill also keeps the upper limit of the 10-percent tax bracket at $14,000 for joint filers, $7,000 for individual, an increase from $12,000 and $6,000 respectively. Without the bill the 10-percent tax bracket would have reverted to $12,000 for joint filers and $6,000 for individuals in 2005, not rising to current levels until 2008.
   The marriage penalty elimination in the 15-percent tax bracket was continued at the current $56,800 level - the bracket scheduled to fall to $52,290 without the change.
   The bill continues to eliminate the marriage penalty by keeping the standard deduction for joint filers at $9,500. The bill also continues to increase the threshold for the imposition of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The law prevents the AMT from going into effect for joint filers with incomes of less than $58,000 and for single taxpayers making less than $40,250. Without the change the exemption amount in 2005 would have fallen to $45,000 for joint filers and $33,750 for single taxpayers.
   And for the military the bill permits members of the military to include combat pay as earned income in calculating the child tax credit. Members of the military may also elect in 2004 and 2005 to include combat pay for purposes of earned-income tax credit. Because combat pay is not subject to income tax and, therefore, was excluded from earned income calculations for purposes of these tax credits, the change will reduce the tax burden on those serving in the military.
   The bill also continues a series of expiring tax credits including ones for:
   * Electricity produced from certain renewable resources;
  * For oil and natural gas production from marginal properties;
  * For electric vehicles and for clean-fuel vehicles;
  * For deductions for certain expenses of school teachers;
  * For research and development
  * Parity in the application of certain limits to mental health benefits;
  * For the work opportunity and welfare-to-work credit;
  * And for environmental remediation costs.
   "Every parent knows that it costs far more than $1,000 a year to feed, clothe and educate a child. It would have been a real hardship for many parents if we had not continued the existing child tax credit and allowed it to fall back to $700 a year a year. That $300 difference is vital to many lower-income parents," said Murkowski.
   She also welcomed the tax bracket changes that were approved plus the provision that reduces the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax on middle income tax payers.
   "If these changes had not passed, Congress effectively would have raised taxes on many individuals and families least able to weather the increases. It would have had a devastating impact on the economy. These changes are most important to low and middle-income tax payers and for our members serving in the military," said Murkowski.
