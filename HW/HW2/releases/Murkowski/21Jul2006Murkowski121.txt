SEN. MURKOWSKI CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN PENALTIES FOR CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PASSES SENATE
  The United States Senate last night passed legislation, co-sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, to strengthen penalties for crimes against children. The legislation, entitled The Adam Walsh Child Protection And Safety Act of 2006, will establish a National Sex Offender Registry, toughen penalties for crimes against children and combat internet predators, child pornography and child exploitation.  
   "This legislation takes a huge step forward in strengthening penalties against criminals who seek to harm and exploit innocent children," said Senator Murkowski. "I am hopeful that by instituting better tracking procedures of offenders, while dedicating additional federal resources for educational outreach to families and for new federal prosecutors to handle crimes against minors, that we can make our communities a safer place for our children." 
   Currently, there are more than 550,000 registered sex offenders in the United States and at least 100,000 are missing from the system.
