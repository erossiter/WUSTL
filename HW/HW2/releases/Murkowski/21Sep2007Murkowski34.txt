SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON SHUTDOWN OF GRAVINA ISLAND BRIDGE PROJECT
  Senator Murkowski today issued the following statement regarding the State's decision to shutdown the Gravina Island bridge project:  
   "The community of Ketchikan has made safe and reliable access to the airport a priority for over 30 years. When the State of Alaska requested resources to build a bridge, the Congressional Delegation worked hard to secure funding. 
   It is unfortunate for the people of Ketchikan that the State has chosen to reprioritize its support of this project. 
   I look forward to working with the State to provide the people of Ketchikan an opportunity for economic growth and safe and efficient access to their airport."
