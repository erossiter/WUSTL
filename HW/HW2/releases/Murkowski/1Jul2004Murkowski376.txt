SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES PROMPT FEDERAL APPROVAL TO GRANT FAIRBANKS BOUNDARY FIRE ASSISTANCE DECLARATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski this morning welcomed a decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to promptly grant the state's and her request that the federal government issue a fire management assistance declaration for the Boundary Fire northeast of Fairbanks. The declaration, issued early this morning by FEMA, makes the state eligible for federal funding to pay for up to 75 percent of its costs involved in fighting the at least 117,000-acre wildfire. 
   Murkowski, who Wednesday was in contact with FEMA's Regional Director John Pennington, FEMA's National Director Michael D. Brown and the White House Emergency Operations Office, learned this morning that the fire declaration was granted at 12:36 a.m. EDT this morning because the fire "threatened such destruction as would constitute a major disaster."
   "It is good that the federal government understands the serious nature of all the wildfires burning in Alaska at present, but especially of the Boundary fire northeast of Fairbanks. Given the winds and the forecast, all federal aid possible to battle this fire is essential now and extremely welcome," said Murkowski this morning.
   The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program allows the government to pick up 75 percent of allowable costs. They include the: 
   * Costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds); 
   * Costs for emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control); 
   * Costs for state emergency operations centers. 
   * Costs for the pre-positioning of federal, out-of-state resources for up to 21 days. 
   * Costs for personal comfort and safety items for firefighters; 
   * Costs for field camps and meals in lieu of per diem; 
   * Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs; 
   * Costs for the temporary repair of damage caused by firefighting; 
   * And the costs of mitigation, management and control of fires on co-mingled federal lands.
   Senator Murkowski said FEMA granted the request since the Boundary fire last night "threatened 400 homes, 40 businesses, two public buildings and to a degree the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline as it runs through the Haystack subdivision and other subdivisions northeast of Fairbanks."
   The Senator said she will continue to monitor state and federal agency needs to battle all of the fires now burning in the state.
