  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced the hiring and promotion of new communications staff for her Washington, D.C. office. 
   Danielle Holland has been hired as the Senator's communications director, effective February 8. Danielle will be moving from the House side where she currently serves as press secretary to Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida. Danielle previously was the press secretary to former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn, who represented the Seattle area, and developed familiarity with Alaska issues in that period. She also has worked for a national public relations firm, in marketing and media relations for CNN and Fox News, as well as in communications positions in national and congressional political campaigns.
   Kevin Sweeney has been promoted to the position of press secretary, effective today.

Before coming to Washington, Kevin lived in Alaska for 10 years, where he spent much of his career in the field of communications and public relations. He was the special assistant to the president of Alaska Federation of Natives for communications, as well as manager of communications for ASRC Energy Services.
   "I look forward to having a well-balanced team lead my communications and press activities," said Senator Murkowski. "As a veteran of Capitol Hill with national press experience, Danielle brings valuable insight to my staff. Kevin will be able to utilize his knowledge of Alaskan issues and challenges, having spent his professional career throughout the state, from Barrow to Juneau."
