SEN. MURKOWSKI COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION VOTE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today offered the following comments following the cloture vote on the immigration reform bill.  
   "Today I voted against invoking cloture on the immigration reform bill. Over the course of the last few days, amendments I felt were needed to improve this legislation did not advance. As an outcome of this debate, it also became clear that important pending amendments would also not advance. I remain convinced that our immigration policies need to be reformed, as the current system is not working. I also recognize that Congress and the Administration must do more to ensure that the border security and enforcement measures currently in law are funded, implemented, and executed. Only when we have shown that we will hold up our end of the bargain in providing for a secure border will the American people trust us to enact reforms to other areas of our immigration laws."
