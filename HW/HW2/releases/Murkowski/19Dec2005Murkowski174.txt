SEN. MURKOWSKI URGES SENATE LEADERS NOT TO ALLOW PATRIOT ACT TO EXPIRE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with Republican Sens.  
 Larry Craig (R-ID), John Sununu (R-NH), and Chuck Hagel (R-NE) in urging Senate leaders not to allow provisions of the Patriot Act to expire on December 31. 
   The following letter was sent to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Judiciary Chairmen Arlen Specter (R-PA): 
   We write to express our profound disappointment that many important provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act will expire on December 31. We agree with the President that it is inexcusable for the Senate to not re-authorize this important law. 
   As you know, we are pursuing changes that have been previously supported by a unanimous Senate and nearly half of the U.S. House of Representatives. We have never sought a full repeal or expiration of these provisions and would like to continue negotiations. 
   We believe that if key changes to the conference report were made, the re-authorization would overwhelmingly pass the Senate. As one of many alternatives, the Senate could pass a 3 month extension to allow more time for negotiations. Or the Senate could take up and pass a bill similar to the Senate version passed with unanimous support earlier this year. 
   We note the House of Representatives may return on December 22, making all these options viable. Therefore, it is still possible for Congress to extend these provisions, and we urge you to exert your leadership to that end, in the interests of our nation.
