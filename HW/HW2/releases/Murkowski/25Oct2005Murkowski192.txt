CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION URGES ALASKANS TO CONTACT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IF REFUND IS MISSING
  The Congressional Delegation today is urging Alaskans who have not received their income tax refund check to contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because 392 taxpayers have refund checks that could not be delivered in 2005 due to incorrect addresses.  
   Checks totaling over $234,000 in IRS refunds for Alaskan taxpayers, with an average of $599 owed to each taxpayer, can be reissued as soon as the taxpayers correct or update their addresses. 
   To update your information with the IRS go to the "Where's My Refund?" feature on the www.IRS.gov web site. Taxpayers will then be asked to enter their Social Security number, filing status (such as single or married filing jointly) and the refund amount shown on their 2004 tax return. When the information is submitted, "Where's My Refund?" will show the status of a refund and, in some cases, provide instructions to resolve potential account issues. 
   Taxpayers who have moved since filing their last tax return can ensure the IRS has their correct address by filing Form 8822, Change of Address, with the IRS. Download the form from IRS.gov or request it by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). Those who do not have access to the Internet and think they may be missing a refund should first check their records or contact their tax preparer, then call the IRS toll-free assistance line at 1-800-829-1040 to update their address. 
   In the case of Gulf Coast residents affected by Hurricane Katrina, the IRS will expedite research into the status of undelivered payments. The IRS advises hurricane victims who had been expecting a refund check but did not receive one to contact the IRS on the special toll-free Katrina disaster line at 1-866-562-5227. 
   Nationwide, 84,290 taxpayers with more than $73 million in undelivered checks can have checks reissued as soon as they correct or update their addresses with the IRS.
