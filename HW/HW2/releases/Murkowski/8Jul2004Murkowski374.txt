SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES REPEAT SENATE PASSAGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCEALED WEAPONS ACT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed Senate passage late Wednesday of a measure she effectively co-sponsored last year that allows current and retired police officers to carry concealed weapons.  
 The measure now heads to the President for his signature.
   The Senate last spring adopted a bill (S. 253) that provides a federal exemption to state laws to permit law enforcement officers and qualified retired officers with proper identification to carry concealed weapons. Wednesday to speed the process, the Senate passed an identical House bill (H.R. 218) without amendment, clearing the way for the bill to become law more quickly.
   "It's been pointed out that many police officers worry about their safety when traveling and especially following retirement, where in some jurisdictions, they lose their ability to carry weapons. These officers are fully trained and qualified to safely carry weapons. It is only just that we enhance the personal safety of traveling and retired police who for years have worked to protect the public from dangerous criminals," said Murkowski after the Senate's vote.
   The said the law also increases law enforcement protection since it ensures that off-duty and retired police are ready to handle emergencies regardless of their location.
   "This was a very reasonable measure to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel and actually all of us," said Senator Murkowski.
   Under the measure officers may not carry firearms with silencers, machine guns or any other type of "destructive device," but can carry weapons for which they are qualified or requalified to carry within the previous 12 months.
