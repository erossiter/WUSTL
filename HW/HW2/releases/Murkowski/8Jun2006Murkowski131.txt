SEN. MURKOWSKI QUESTIONS FERC NOMINEES ON ROLE OF ALASKA NATURAL GAS TO MEET NATION'S ENERGY NEEDS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today stressed the need for completion of a contract for the construction of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the nominations of Phillip Moeller and Jon Wellinghoff to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  
   "One of the leading energy issues facing the nation is our growing shortage of natural gas," said Senator Murkowski. "I do not want to see our country take the same path as it has on oil and become heavily dependent on foreign sources of natural gas." 
   Murkowski then questioned the nominees on the importance of completing an Alaska gasline contract quickly. Both agreed that the single, most efficient action our nation can take to provide needed natural gas is to build an Alaska natural gas pipeline. "It is vital to the nation to have Alaska natural gas flowing," stressed Jon Wellinghoff.
