SEN. MURKOWSKI CO-SPONSORS ?SAFE' DRUG IMPORTATION BILL
  In an effort to speed the ability of Americans to import safe prescription drugs from Canada and some other European Union nations, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski has co-sponsored legislation to permit drug importation, which controls the safety of the drugs imported, especially from foreign internet pharmacies.  
   Murkowski this week joined fellow Sen. Judd Gregg, R- N.H., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in proposing legislation to allow Americans to import prescription drugs (S. 2493) from Canada and traditional European Union nations, provided the drugs are protected by basic safety standards to prevent the counterfitting of drugs or loss of quality control on the medicines. 
   "I am keenly aware that many Alaskans kind it difficult to afford the rising price of prescription drugs and I certainly support efforts to make prescription drugs more affordable and readily available. My concern all along is that drug importation is done in a way to protect the safety of the medicines and the health of Americans taking the drugs. This bill should solve the safety concerns and guarantee that Americans won't be harmed by the medicines that are designed to help them," said Murkowski. 
   The Gregg bill, unlike a Democratic alternative proposed by Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., will require that imported drugs to this country from Canada are: 
   * U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs, manufactured in FDA approved facilities. 
  * Drugs from importers and exporters who are registered with the FDA.
  * Individually labeled as imported drugs. 
  * Drugs, if purchased over the internet, that are from internet pharmacies that are licensed and strictly regulated. 
  * Drugs that are not controlled substances.
  * And drugs that do not require refrigeration or are light sensitive. 
   Murkowski for months has said she supports the concept of allowing the importation of drugs from Canada in an attempt to add competitive pressures to reduce American drug prices. But she said she would only support such importation measures when safety concerns were met. 
   She took that position because during May Senate testimony from the FDA, the agency reported that "import blitzes" conducted last summer at four international drug mail facilities discovered that 88 percent of the mail-order products were unapproved or otherwise illegal. The problems included drugs that were never approved by the FDA, drugs with illegal labeling, drugs that were withdrawn from the market, or drugs that were controlled substances. 
   The Gregg bill solves the problem, in part, by setting up a statutory and regulatory structure to police internet pharmacies. The pharmacies will have to provide specific professional services including providing confidential patient medication profiles, use licensed pharmacists as consultants and require the verification of prescription validity. The bill also requires documentation of an uninterrupted chain of custody from the original drug manufacturer to the foreign seller to prevent the introduction of counterfit or out-of-date drugs and it also beefs up safety standards to prevent the sale of no longer effective drugs to Americans. 
   "The few Alaskans who drive across the border to fill prescriptions know that Canada does an excellent job of inspecting drugs intended to be sold to Canadians. Canada, however, takes no responsibility for drugs shipped outside of its borders. This bill guarantees that the U.S. FDA will have the ability to protect American consumers, but it does not set up such onerous, costly regulations that would defeat the entire purpose of drug importation. This bill will protect the American public, while helping to curb rising drug prices," said Murkowski of her support for the measure. 
   She said teamed with the new Medicare prescription drug benefit that she helped pioneer last year - including the drug card program already in effect - that Congress is certainly working to reduce prescription drug costs for Americans.
