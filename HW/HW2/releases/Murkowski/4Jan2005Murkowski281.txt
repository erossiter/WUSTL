SEN. MURKOWSKI SWORN IN TO SENATE
  Today, Sen. Lisa Murkowski began her first full term in the United States Senate.  
 At a ceremony on the Senate Floor, Vice President Dick Cheney administered the Oath of Office and swore in Sen. Murkowski, the first individual born in Alaska to represent the state in the Senate, and the first woman elected in her own right to Alaska statewide office. 
   "I am thrilled to begin this term and this Congress and to continue to be Alaska's advocate in Washington, D.C. It is humbling serving the people of Alaska and it is an honor to be Alaska's first female Senator. We have had a good start in the Senate and there is much we hope to accomplish in the next six years," Senator Murkowski said. 
   Sen. Murkowski begins the 109th Congress with an aggressive agenda for the state. In the coming months she will continue to press for passage of legislation to allow limited oil exploration in the North Slope's Coastal Plain, work to reduce the cost of and increase access to health care for all Alaskans, persist in making the No Child Left Behind law work in Alaska as well as many other items.

Telestar 6, Transponder 5V, Channel 5, Downlink 3800. Given that it is largely visual in nature there will be no audio feed available.
