SEN. MURKOWSKI REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADDRESS TO NATION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today offered the following comments following President Bush's speech on Iraq:  
   "We have already begun to see important changes being made among those making decisions regarding the objectives of our men and women serving in the region. The President's proposal to increase the number of troops in Iraq is one that should be carefully examined. 
   Any increase to our troop levels must contain a clearly defined mission in the theater to create a stable environment where Iraqis can govern and defend themselves, an environment in which we can safely bring home our men and women honorably serving there. Congress must also make certain that all of our military personnel have the resources and equipment necessary to fully support the mission in front of them. 
   I will closely review the President's proposal and remain dutifully committed to all of our brave men and women in uniform who help safeguard our freedoms here at home and abroad."
