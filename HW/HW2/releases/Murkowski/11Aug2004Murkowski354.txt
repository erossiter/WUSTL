SEN. MURKOWSKI: BIG LAKE, SUTTON WIN FIRE FIGHTER GRANTS; WRANGELL, CORDOVA ALSO RECEIVE FUNDS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded grants to two fire departments in Alaska, part of $750 million that is being dispensed nationwide this year to ensure that local firefighters have the resources they need to be able to protect their communities. 
   Murkowski announced that the Big Lake Volunteer Fire Department outside of Wasilla on Thursday was awarded $29,598 to fund new equipment and operations, while the Sutton Fire Department outside of Palmer gained $92,408, also for equipment and to help fund operations. Murkowski added that the Wrangell Volunteer Fire Department has now received a grant for $44,701 for fire prevention efforts, while the Cordova Volunteer Fire Department has now received a grant for $64,457 for equipment and operations - two grants that had been announced but not formally conveyed earlier this month.
   "I am pleased that the federal government is making money available to assist our local departments to handle their growing burdens," said Murkowski.
   The money, approved in the FY '04 Homeland Security Appropriations bill passed in January and supported by Murkowski, come from the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. The fire grants are authorized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296).
   The money can be used for training, equipment purchases, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
