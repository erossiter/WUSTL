SEN. MURKOWSKI JOINS SENATORS IN ANNOUNCING AGREEMENT WITH WHITE HOUSE ON PATRIOT ACT
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined a bipartisan group of Senators in announcing an agreement with the White House on the Patriot Act. The proposed changes to the conference report will continue to support anti-terrorism efforts throughout the nation, while offering important new protections for American's civil liberties. 
   "The agreement reached today makes the Patriot Act a stronger, better piece of legislation," said Senator Murkowski. "A tenuous balance exists between much needed efforts to safeguard our nation from would-be terrorists and protecting the civil liberties Americans have come to expect. It has always been my intention to work to improve the legislation to offer greater protections. I believe we have accomplished that and what we see today is a better Patriot Act."
