SEN. MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION ON FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS PASSES SENATE
  The United States Senate last evening unanimously passed Sen. Lisa Murkowski's resolution to designate September 9, 2006 as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day. Tragically, Alaska has the highest rate of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD) in the nation. Approximately 163 Alaskan babies are born each year affected by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Among Alaskan Native communities, the rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the state.  
   "The alarming numbers of children born each year with FASD should motivate all Americans to raise awareness about a disease that is 100% preventable," said Senator Murkowski. "Our investment today in prevention, treatment and research will help ensure that fewer and fewer children will become afflicted with FASD and will save in future health costs of this devastating disorder." 
   The resolution encourages the American people to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and to ensure healthier communities throughout the United States. On National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness day, Americans are also encouraged to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9, 2006, to remember that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any alcohol.
