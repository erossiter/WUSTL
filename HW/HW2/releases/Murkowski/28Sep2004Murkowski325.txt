SEN. MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES ALASKA TO GAIN $21.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO BOOST BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, JOB GROWTH
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with U.S. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans to announce $21.8 million in Economic Development Administration (EDA) investments to the State of Alaska to boost business development and job growth. These investments are expected to create/save nearly 4,400 jobs and attract over $58 million in private investment statewide.  
   "The Commerce Department is pleased to partner with the people of Alaska and set the stage for investment and innovation through economic development grants like these," said Evans. "President Bush and I are committed to working with local communities to grow the economy, create jobs and encourage investments in local areas." 
   "These grants all go to fund solid projects that should significantly improve local economies and help create or protect good-paying jobs. In some case the grants will strengthen existing industries, especially the fishing industry in coastal communities. In other cases they go to help diversify local economies," said Senator Murkowski. 
   "These carefully targeted investments will create or save more than 4,000 jobs across the state. In fishing towns they will help to improve infrastructure that will reduce costs and hopefully raise profits for fishermen and processors. These are projects that will pay big dividends for Alaskans statewide," said Senator Murkowski. 
   The grants represent the third year of a five-year commitment between the Alaska Delegation, led by Sen. Murkowski, and the Bush Administration to funnel extra economic development aid to Alaska to offset the downturn in the state's timber and fishing industries and to push development in rural areas of high unemployment.
