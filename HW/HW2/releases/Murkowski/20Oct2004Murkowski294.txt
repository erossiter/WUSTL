SEN. MURKOWSKI SAYS JUNEAUITIES TO BENEFIT FROM GASLINE, FISHING, SALES TAX PROVISIONS FROM RECENT SESSION
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, speaking to the Juneau Chamber of Commerce, this morning said Juneau residents stand to gain much from the 108th Congress, which will conclude after the November elections. 
   Murkowski, in her last appearance in Juneau before the election, reported on her work on a natural gas pipeline, saying that the incentives that she has gained should be sufficient to allow construction to proceed on the line that could generate the state some $50 billion in revenues during its life - money to fund state government and employee needs.  
   "This is truly a great victory for Alaska. It pushes talks between the State and interested applicants further along. We have done our job on the federal side. Now its time to make it happen at the State level," said Murkowski of pipeline construction. 
   Murkowski in two bills won two tax incentives, an $18 billion loan guarantee and a series of regulatory and court provisions to speed permitting and construction of the gas line. The second of the measures is expected to be signed by the President later this week. 
   Murkowski also said Juneau residents stand to gain from two tax provisions she was able to secure in a corporate tax measure - a provision that allows fishermen to average their income over three years from fishing in determining their federal tax payments with help fishermen. And she said all Juneau residents, since they pay local sales taxes, will benefit from a provision in the bill that allows Alaskans who itemize their deductions to deduct sales taxes from their federal tax payments. 
   "The income averaging provision will allow fishermen to be treated more equitably. It will help to smooth out the hills and valleys of good and bad fishing years. The sales tax provision also means that Alaskans who live in towns with such taxes will finally be treated more fairly. This will mean more money in your pockets to spend as you see fit - not in the pockets of the federal government," said Murkowski, who touched on a host of other topics during her address to the Chamber. 
   Text of her Prepared Remarks to the Juneau Chamber of Commerce: 
   * Great to be back in front of you again to give an update on what Congress accomplished in the last month or so. 
   NATURAL GAS PIPELINE: I'm sure you have all heard, but it is such good news it bears repeating many times over. Senator Stevens, Congressman Young and I were able to get provisions to encourage the construction of the natural gas pipeline passed and signed into law. 
   * This is huge for Alaska. It is a project that we, as a State, have been working on for decades. It has to potential to create up to 400,000 jobs nationwide, with thousands of those jobs here in Alaska. 
   * To put this in a little bit of context, I've been in the Senate for two years now working on these provisions and closely followed the issue while in the State Legislature as well. I certainly understand their importance to Alaska. 
   * But to be sitting next to Ted and Don at a press conference to announce their inclusion and likely passage - individuals who have been working on this for 20-plus years - and to see their giddiness and broad smiles at the prospect of this project actually moving forward lets you know right there just how big of a victory passing these provisions was. 
   * Included are: o Accelerated depreciation on the pipeline to recover costs o A tax credit to construct a gas conditioning plant ? These two provisions provide over $700 million in economic incentives to construct a pipeline. o An $18 billion loan guarantee to protect financiers against the risk the line won't be completed o Expedited judicial and regulatory review ? Judicial complaints heard on an expedited process before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. (not the 9th Circuit) ? A single environmental review to be completed within 18 months of receiving a completed application. o Allow Alaska to control in-state use of the gas for our own economic growth o $20 million is authorized for a worker job training program for Alaskans to ensure it is Alaskans who are working on this project. o Provisions promoting Alaska-hire and the opportunity for Alaskans to play an ownership role in the pipeline. 
   * These provisions were included in two separate pieces of legislation - one a tax bill which was needed for the economic incentives, and the other an appropriations bill that we were able to include the authorizing language in. 
   * This was truly a team effort. Alaska's clout with Senator Stevens and Congressman Young as Chairmen of their respective committees certainly did not hurt. I was able to work with Senator Domenici, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Senator Grassley, Chair of the Finance Committee, to break the pipeline provisions out of the Energy bill and include them in the two pieces of legislation. I also had several meetings with Congressman Bill Thomas, Chair of the House Committee with jurisdiction over tax issues (Ways and Means), to impress upon him the importance of the financial incentives. 
   * Senator Stevens and I divided up a list of key Senators on each conference committee and personally spoke with each of them to ensure their support for these provisions. 
   * This is truly a great victory for Alaska. It pushes talks between the State and interested applicants further along. We have done our job on the federal side. Now its time to make it happen at the State level. 
   * I know some contend that what we delivered isn't enough. That a well-head tax credit to guard against low natural gas prices is a must have provision. With prices where they currently are and where they look to be in the future, I disagree. 
   * When discussion about the well-head tax credit arose, gas was selling at somewhere around $2-$3 per million btu (British thermal unit). Now, for November delivery, it's over $7. Shortly before Congress passed these two bills, Senator Stevens and I met with a number of Wall Street officials who are involved in pipeline financing. They all said the price of natural gas would remain high - the need for the well-head tax credit, or price-floor as they like to call it, was no longer there. 
   * We all recognize the potential for price swings. But the odds of that happening with natural gas are very slim. As a nation, we are using more and more natural gas to heat our homes, produce electricity, and meet our transportation needs. The Energy Information Administration estimates that natural gas demand in America will rise by more than 50 percent by 2025. 
   * With developing countries like China consuming vast amounts of natural resources to keep up with their economic growth, the demand for natural gas will remain high for the foreseeable future. 
   * But if there is a price collapse, then Senator Stevens and I will certainly return to the negotiating table to obtain this provision. 
   FISHERMEN/INCOME TAX 
   * Switching gears, I would also like to mention a couple of other provisions in the tax bill that will benefit Alaskans. 
   * We were able to insert a section that will allow fishermen to average their fishing income over a period of three years, rather than the current year-to-year basis. This will allow them to smooth out the hills and valleys of good and bad fishing years. 
   * Income averaging was previously available to farmers and we are now able to include fishermen in it as well. Another step in the march to ensure our fishermen are treated equitably with farmers. 
   * Also included in the bill is a section that allows individuals to deduct state and local sales taxes from their owed federal taxes. Previously, only those who paid a state income tax could deduct their state taxes if they chose to itemize deductions (rather than take the standard deduction). This was of no benefit to Alaska. 
   * By allowing the deduction of sales taxes - and expanding those taxes to include local sales tax instead of just state sales tax - those Alaskans who itemize their deductions will be able to take advantage of this provision. 
   * How much Alaskans can deduct is still being calculated by the Treasury Department - since we don't have a state sales tax to serve as a basis they need to go through the numbers for each borough and city to determine what a fair amount would be. 
   * But whatever the number, this means more money in your pockets to spend as you see fit - not in the pockets of the federal government. 
   INTELLIGENCE 
   * The other major piece of legislation the Senate completed was reform of our intelligence community along the lines of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   * The gist of the legislation is to create a National Intelligence Director who has oversight authority over the entire intelligence community. That currently falls to the head of the CIA, but running the day-to-day operations of the CIA in itself is a tremendous task even without managing the other intelligence agencies. 
   * The Senate bill also establishes a National Counterterrorism Threat Center that will provide greater integration between intelligence agencies. One of the key goals within the intelligence community post 9/11 is greater sharing of information between agencies. To make sure folks at Homeland Security, the State Department, and the FBI are looking at the same names on their terrorist watchlists. The Counterterrorism Threat Center is designed to provide that dissemination of information. 
   * Certainly, the Senate had some turf wars and competing ideas on how to accomplish the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, or if the recommendations should even be adopted. 
   * But what we ended up with is a bipartisan piece of legislation. Senate and House negotiators hold their first meeting today (Wednesday) to try to iron out the differences in the two bills. I don't think anyone is making any predictions on the ability of the conference committee to reach a compromise before the end of the 108th Congress. 
   CAPE FOX 
   * I would like to wrap up with a piece of legislation that was not passed by the Senate and one that I would be remiss to not discuss while here in Juneau - the Cape Fox Land Exchange bill. 
   * Put simply, the bill is dead in the 108th Congress. We were not able to reach an acceptable agreement on language to address the legitimate concerns of those who use Berners Bay while ensuring that Cape Fox's inequity arising from ANCSA would be rectified. 
   * As many of you are aware, Senate Democrats walked out of an Energy and Natural Resources Committee meeting when I attempted to offer amendments to meet the concerns of those who use Berners Bay. The amendments would have prevented logging on the land to be exchanged and allowed continued public access and use of the land along the shore. 
   * The walkout, however, prevented a quorum from being present to vote on the amendments. I'm told a Democrat Senator was even physically restrained from entering the Committee room by Committee staff. 
   * In any event, with limited time in the 108th Congress, and no consensus on how to move forward, the legislation in its current form is not going anywhere. 
   CONCLUSION 
   * All in all, the last month was a productive one for Alaska and Alaskans. The pipeline provisions are of course the shining star, but we got a number of other successes as well that will benefit Alaska.
