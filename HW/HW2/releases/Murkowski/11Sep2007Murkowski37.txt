SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON TESTIMONY FROM GEN. PETRAEUS, AMBASSADOR CROCKER
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today offered the following statement after hearing testimony in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker:  
   "I am encouraged that General Petraeus believes the situation on the ground in Iraq will allow us to reduce forces to pre-surge levels by mid-summer 2008 without jeopardizing security plans. I urge the Administration to accept General Petraeus' recommendations. I am concerned, however, that we are becoming mired in an approval cycle without significant demonstrable signs of progress toward political reconciliation on the part of the Iraqi Government. It appears that the way forward is still, as the President has put it, 'stand down when the Iraqis stand up.' Without progress on the political front, it will not be possible for the Iraqis to stand up."
