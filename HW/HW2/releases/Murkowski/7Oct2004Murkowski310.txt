SEN. MURKOWSKI: FEDS TO FUND DISTANCE LEARNING PROJECTS IN SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST ALASKA
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Administration is providing significant grants to three Alaska school districts to improve distance learning programs in rural areas.  
   Murkowski said the Chatham School District, based in Angoon, the Haines School District, based in Haines and the Kuspuk School District based in Aniak will be receiving funds to set up distance learning programs, including instructional information, and vocational and career training. 
   Murkowski said the Chatham District will be gaining $472,579 to expand instructional and job training programs in cooperation with the University of Alaska. The Haines district is gaining $499,999 for equipment and telecommunication costs to provide academic courses and vocational education through distance learning to four towns in the district. And the Kuspuk District is gaining $411,913 to provide distance learning opportunities to eight villages in conjunction with the Kuskokwim Campus of the University of Alaska and the Kuskokwim Regional Health Corp. based in Bethel. 
   The funding, from a distance learning and telemedicine grant program, will expand programs to serve more than 5,000 residents in the Kuskokwim region, while more than 1,000 will be served in the Haines area. 
   "In Alaska, given the great distances involved, there is no more cost-effective method of offering vocational training and job skill improvement courses than through on-line technology. These grants should help Alaska rural districts offer such programs and meet the educational and job training needs of their individual communities," said Senator Murkowski.
