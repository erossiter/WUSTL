SEN. MURKOWSKI APPLAUDS DESIGNATION OF ALASKA MARINE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AS AN \'All AMERICAN ROAD\'
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today applauded the naming of the Alaska Marine Highway System as a National Scenic Byway - All American Road.  
 The Byways Program is a collaborative effort established to help recognize, preserve and enhance selected roads throughout the United States. Since 1992, the National Scenic Byways Program has provided funding for almost 1500 state and nationally designated byway projects. The All American Road designation is the highest recognition that can received under the Byways Program. 
   "The designation of the Marine Highway System as a scenic byway is a recognition that for Southeast Alaska, the ferry system is a piece of history, a tourist attraction, and a way of life," Murkowski said at today's designation ceremony. "Growing up in Southeast like I did, or in other remote coastal communities, you grow to love the Marine Highway and depend on it. In areas of the State where traditional roads linking communities don't exist, the Marine Highway is the link to the rest of the state. It truly is significant to the State and as a piece of living history it is significant to the country.\"
