SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/ ANWR CLOTURE VOTE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski made the following statement following the vote to break the likely filibuster on ANWR today.  
 "We are extremely disappointed by the outcome of the vote to break a likely filibuster on ANWR today. We won support from all but two Republicans for a bill that contained all the environmental stipulations needed to fully protect the environment and wildlife of the North Slope. Opening ANWR to limited oil and gas exploration is the right thing to do. 
   "Whether or not to develop America's most significant energy reserve is obviously not settled. The fight to open ANWR is not over. 
   "We have a commitment from Congressional leaders that we will consider ANWR again next year. Hopefully, then we will finally get the fair vote where this issue will be decided by a simple majority of the U.S. Senate. 
   "What is clear from today is how much all Alaskans owe to my colleague Senator Ted Stevens. He followed Senate rules, honored Senate traditions and worked harder on this issue than anyone could have. It is an honor to work with him and we will continue to work toward the goal of providing America with the energy this nation so desperately needs."
