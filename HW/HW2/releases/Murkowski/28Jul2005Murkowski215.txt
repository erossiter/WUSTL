SEN. MURKOWSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF TIM BURGESS TO BE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE
  Today Sen. Murkowski issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Alaska U.S. Attorney Tim Burgess to be a district court judge.  
   "I'm delighted with this nomination. Tim Burgess is exactly the type of individual that we want to see on the federal bench. He is a gentleman, he is smart, and he has great integrity. He's an all around good person and I think he will serve Alaska well. He has a good foundation in Alaska law and has built a good resume over the years in serving with the U.S. Attorney's office. I've had the good fortune of working with him in community issues, primarily drug education prevention efforts. He's done a lot for the Alaska community over the years, and I think we will be well served by him."
