SEN. MURKOWSKI WELCOMES SECOND GROUP OF ALASKA INTERNS TO WASHINGTON OFFICE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski this week welcomed 10 Alaska high school seniors to Washington, students who will work as interns in her Washington office for the next month. 
   Murkowski formally kicked off the second session of her 2004 summer intern program, a program coordinated by Alaska Pacific University and financed privately, by chatting with the recently graduated Alaska high school seniors. The interns will be performing a variety of administrative and legislative duties in the senator's Washington office, while also attending seminars and touring the nation's capital. The interns also will "shadow" the senator during her daily schedule and participate in other social events.
   "This is a wonderful opportunity for young Alaskans to see first hand the workings of Congress. I know how much I learned about Congress and American government during my time in Washington during college. An internship in Washington allows students to take with them a better understanding of how our laws are made and the problems that face our society. These experiences can truly help them in their future careers," Senator Murkowski said.
   The students attending the second session, from July 3 to July 31, are:
   * Tyler Miller of Fairbanks. She is the daughter of Linda and Michael Miller and attended Austin E. Lathrop High School.
   * Stephanie Abrego of Anchorage. She is the daughter of Sandra Abrego and attended East Anchorage High School.
