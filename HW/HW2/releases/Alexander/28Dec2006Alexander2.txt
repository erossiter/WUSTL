                                                                                                                   Alexander  Domenici  and Bingaman Ask President Bush to Continue Leadership on Competitiveness          December 28th  2006   WASHINGTON  D C    Three Senate leaders on the issue of competitiveness   Pete Domenici  R NM   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Lamar Alexander  R TN     have asked President Bush to make competitiveness funding part of his Fiscal Year 2008 budget and continue his leadership so that America can maintain its brainpower advantage and prevent jobs from going overseas     Last year at this time the three of us met with you to discuss keeping America  s brainpower advantage  in order to protect our competitive edge and keep American jobs from going to India and China  You followed up by including competitiveness funding in your FY   07 budget  We ask you to do again this year what you did last year  include the competitiveness initiative in your budget and make it a priority in your State of the Union address     the Senators wrote in a letter to President Bush     This is a critical effort  We face a new   flat   world where more and more countries can compete with us  and we must rise to the challenge     they added    That is why we continue to ask you to make this issue a top priority in your budget and for your administration      Earlier this year the Senators introduced the bipartisan Protecting America  s Competitive Edge  PACE  Acts that attracted 70 cosponsors    35 Republicans and 35 Democrats  The legislation was based on the recommendations in the National Academies report  Rising Above the Gathering Storm   The report  requested by Bingaman and Alexander with the encouragement of Domenici  outlined actions the United States should take to retain its edge in the global economy    After working with the leadership of three Senate Committees  Senators Bill Frist  R TN  and Harry Reid  D NV  introduced the bipartisan National Competitiveness Investment Act  which incorporates many of the provisions in the PACE Acts  in September  In the House  the incoming leadership has said competitiveness legislation will be a priority     No legislation in the Senate is more bipartisan than our work to protect America s competitive edge     Alexander said    With the President  s help  we can deliver a victory to the American people so that more of our good paying jobs stay right here      In Tennessee  the impact of the legislation could include scholarships for future Tennessee math and science teachers  summer academies for math and science teachers hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory  ORNL  and universities across the state  support for a proposed math and science specialty high school  high tech internships for Tennessee middle and high school students at ORNL  the UT Health Science Center in Memphis  and other technology and scientific research facilities across the state  and increased funding for research at institutions like ORNL  the University of Tennessee  and Vanderbilt    Text of the Senators   letter to President Bush follows    December 21  2006  The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States The White House Washington  DC  20500  Dear Mr  President  Last year at this time the three of us met with you to discuss keeping America  s brainpower advantage  in order to protect our competitive edge and keep American jobs from going to India and China   We are grateful for your leadership in including competitiveness funding in your FY  07 budget   And  we crafted legislation that ultimately gained 70 cosponsors    35 Republicans and 35 Democrats   We ask you to do again this year what you did last year  include the competitiveness initiative in your budget and make it a priority in your State of the Union address   The competitive challenge that America faces today is really about education and jobs   We Americans    who constitute just five percent of the world  s population    produced about 30 percent of the world  s wealth last year   Most of this good fortune comes as a product of our educated workforce and our technological innovation   Yet  as we look at what  s happening in countries like China  India  Finland  Ireland  Singapore  and others  we worry that America may be losing its competitive advantage    Much has happened this past year in the Senate and in the House of Representatives as we have worked on competitiveness legislation   In the Senate  we introduced the bipartisan PACE Acts that attracted 70 cosponsors   After working with the leadership of three Senate committees  Senators Frist and Reid introduced the National Competitiveness Investment Act   The incoming Speaker of the House of Representatives  Nancy Pelosi  has said that she will make this legislation a priority   And  Congressman Bart Gordon  the new Chairman of the House Science Committee  is actively engaged in this issue   This is a critical effort   We face a new   flat    world where more and more countries can compete with us  and we must rise to the challenge   Competitiveness legislation would invest in basic scientific research and help educate the next generation of scientists   It would help us keep pace with other nations that are moving swiftly to overtake our scientific leadership   More young people would receive the quality education in math and science that they need to succeed in a high tech economy   That is why we ask you to continue to make this issue a top priority in your budget and for your administration   If America is going to continue to be the global economic leader  we can not afford to let this wait   Thank you again for your leadership on this important issue   Sincerely   Pete V  Domenici  Jeff Bingaman  Lamar Alexander
