                                                                                                                   Alexander  Corker Cosponsor Legislation Making State Sales Tax Deductibility Permanent         January 5th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Bob Corker  R TN  today joined Sen  Kay Bailey Hutchison  R TX  in introducing a bill to make the state sales tax deduction permanent      Over 530 000 Tennesseans received average deductions of  400 on their 2004 federal tax returns  resulting in over  200 million in tax savings     said Alexander    Making this deduction permanent makes good economic sense and is the fair thing to do         This is a common sense piece of legislation that will provide tax fairness for Tennesseans     said Corker    I  m proud to cosponsor this bill to make the state sales tax deduction permanent       Nationwide  state and local sales tax collections account for about a quarter of total state tax revenue  which is about the same as property taxes and income taxes  The difference is that the provision allowing people who pay state and local sales taxes to deduct them from their federal income tax is not permanent    The Senators noted that the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006    a comprehensive package of tax  health  trade  and energy provisions that passed the Senate in December and was signed into law by the President    extends the state and local sales tax deduction for Tennesseans for two years    Before Congress passed a bill containing a two year deduction in 2004  individuals were only permitted to deduct income and property taxes from their federal tax returns  Seven states    Alaska  Texas  Florida  Wyoming  Washington  South Dakota  and Nevada    do not have a state income tax  Two states    Tennessee and New Hampshire    only impose an income tax on interest and dividends  but not wages  Therefore  residents of those states who itemize were placed at a disadvantage simply because these states choose to raise revenue primarily through a sales tax instead of an income tax
