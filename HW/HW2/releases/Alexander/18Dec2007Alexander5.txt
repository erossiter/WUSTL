which receive funding          December 18th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Bob Corker  R TN  today announced that the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 Omnibus Appropriations Act  which the Senate passed Tuesday  includes funding for the military and its veterans  border security  drought relief  dam infrastructure repair  national park improvements and other projects vital to Tennessee      The most important thing is that  except for true emergency spending  this bill meets the President  s budget number and funds the troops in the field     said Alexander  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee    It also provides funding for critical Tennessee priorities throughout the state  including dollars for supercomputing research in East Tennessee  Wolf Creek and Center Hill dam repairs in Middle Tennessee and funding for gang and violent crime fighting activities in West Tennessee         I ultimately supported this bill because it provides essential resources for our military men and women on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan and at home  drought relief for farmers in our state  funding for the basic services Tennesseans and Americans depend upon  and I am pleased that because of the pressure that was applied  the price tag of the bill was cut by  22 billion     said Corker   However  Alexander and Corker said the omnibus bill  which combines the 11 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government in fiscal year 2008  highlights the need for major budget reforms to help Congress restrain federal spending  reduce the deficit and gain control of the federal budget process      The bill has too many earmarks and gimmicks     Alexander said    We need to change the way we do business in Washington and cut wasteful spending        This is not the way the Senate should do business  and we must do better     continued Corker    Voting for this bill was a difficult decision because it contains too many earmarks and was assembled without the serious deliberation and public review it deserves       Alexander and Corker support legislation that includes the following budgetary reforms   1       Presidential Line Item Veto    to give the President the ability to cut individual pork barrel projects from congressional spending bills   2       2 Year Budgeting    so Congress would pass a two year budget during the first year and use the second year to take a good look at what federal programs are working and what ones are not    and either fix or stop paying for broken programs  3       Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action    a bipartisan effort to review all aspects of the government  s long term financial condition and find solutions to protect critical programs while keeping costs down which would be fast tracked through Congress and guaranteed an up or down vote   The omnibus bill meets the President  s budget request except for  3 7 billion in additional funding for veterans   health and service needs  which is contingent on the President requesting such funding in his proposed budget for fiscal year 2009 which is due in January   The bill also includes  7 5 billion in emergency spending  which includes funding for border security   3 billion   drought relief   600 million   and wildfires   300 million    The legislation includes  2 billion for National Park Service operations  a  200 million increase above the previous year  s funding which  in part  funds the President  s Centennial Challenge  an initiative to boost funding to the Park Service and attract investment from the private sector    In addition  the omnibus package contains dollars benefiting each of the Tennessee  s grand divisions  including    East Tennessee  more than  4 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard based in Knoxville   1 82 million for land acquisition for the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park   20 8 million for operations and maintenance of the Tennessee River and  34 6 million to continue design  land acquisition and construction of the new Chickamauga Lock     Middle Tennessee  more than  107 million to support troops and maintain facilities at Fort Campbell  more than  115 million to operate and maintain existing locks and dams   634 500 for the Davidson County Mental Health and Drug Courts to meet the needs of the mentally ill in the Nashville area criminal justice system and  487 000 for a comprehensive math and science teacher training program       West Tennessee   2 1 million to fund construction of Interstate 69  more than  11 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard based at Memphis International  and  1 8 million to combat an increase in violent crime and gang activity in the Memphis region   The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 17     Because Senate Republicans succeeded in adding funding for American troops in Iraq  the omnibus bill now must be approved again by the House before going to the president for his signature    For a complete listing of Tennessee projects  including statewide projects and those in each of the state  s grand divisions  follow these
