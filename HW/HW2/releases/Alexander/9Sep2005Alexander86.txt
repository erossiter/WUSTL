                                                                                                                   Alexander Praises HELP Committee Passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 2005         September 9th  2005   Washington  D C     U S  Sen  Lamar Alexander  R TN  on Thursday praised Senate HELP committee passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 2005  S 1614   which included a number of important provisions sought by Alexander  chairman of the the Senate Education and Early Childhood Development Subcommittee    In floor remarks following committee passage  Alexander said     This bill is good for students and good for improving the quality of our colleges and universities      For students  it increases the amount of Pell Grants from  4 050 to  4 500 over five years  Second  the bill gives students who want to use their Pell Grant during the summer the opportunity to do so  for the first time making Pell Grants available year round     In addition  Pell Grants will be larger for students who are majoring in math  sciences  or critical foreign languages  thereby encouraging students to pursue these fields       For colleges and universities  this bill begins to relieve the oppressive paperwork burden the federal government places on them  freeing up scarce dollars to spend on improving quality  teaching and research  rather than paperwork     For example  this legislation creates an expert panel to review  evaluate and streamline the 7 000 federal regulations that govern grants and loans to college students  Universities should be able to focus more on teaching and researching  and less on complying with reporting requirements     In addition  for the first time  the federal government will be required to develop a compliance calendar  making it easier for our 6 000 colleges and universities to comply with federal rules  and helping them with institutional planning and in avoiding inadvertent errors in meeting these requirements     Finally  universities that do a good job keeping down the rate of loan defaults will be given more flexibility in how they use federal dollars for grants and loans to students     I  m delighted that the committee  s bill also included the Teach for America legislation I introduced with the Democratic Leader  Harry Reid  Expanding Teach for America will not only build a corps of young college graduates who spend two years teaching in schools in lower income areas  but a corps of expanding influential alumni who support quality public education     We have the best colleges and universities in the world  but they need to continue to be the best in order to maintain our high standard of living     The federal government is doing its part  Over the last five years  federal spending on higher education has increased 71 8 percent  At the same time  state funding for higher education has increased on average by only 6 8 percent  partly because of big increases in state Medicaid costs  which have increased over the same time by 35 6 percent  This in turn has meant that college tuition at public four year institutions has increased 38 2 percent nationally     In Tennessee  the situation is equally pronounced  As I stated  federal spending on higher education has increased 71 9 percent over the past five years  In Tennessee  spending on higher education has increased 10 5 percent while Medicaid spending has increased by 71 1 percent  During this same time tuition at the University of Tennessee has increased by 43 4 percent     I raise this because I hope in our discussion of the higher education bill that we will come to an understanding that one of the principal reasons for the big increases in tuition is the out of control state spending for Medicaid  Governors constantly have to fight to keep Medicaid spending under control so we will have enough money left for quality education  And if we do not have quality colleges and universities over the next 10 years  we will not be able to keep our standard of living as we compete with Japan  China  Germany  India  and Great Britain  all who recognize the superiority of American higher education and are taking significant steps to keep their brightest students home and to improve their institutions      I am delighted to be able to salute Senator Mike Enzi and Senator Ted Kennedy on a good piece of legislation for students  a good piece of legislation for colleges and universities  and an excellent piece of legislation for our country
