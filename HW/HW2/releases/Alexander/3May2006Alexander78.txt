                                                                                                                   Alexander Introduces Legislation to Improve Air Quality in Tennessee Goes Farther and Faster in Controlling Health Damaging Pollution        May 3rd  2006   Washington  D C     U S  Sen  Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Sens  Tom Carper  D DE   Judd Gregg  R NH   and Dianne Feinstein  D CA   and Lincoln Chafee  R RI  today  introduced a new version of their  Clean Air Planning Act  which Alexander says goes  farther and faster than new Bush Clean Air proposals in controlling health damaging pollution from coal fired power plants      Give the Bush Administration credit  its new clean air rules are important steps forward in reducing air pollution from power plants  But those rules do not go far enough  fast enough to ensure that Tennessee counties come into compliance with federal clean air standards     said Alexander at a press conference on Capitol Hill today    Our legislation puts stricter standards on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides  cuts mercury emissions by 90 percent and addresses climate change by placing a modest cap on carbon emissions     My main concern is the threat to the health of Tennesseans caused by ozone and fine particles and mercury     Alexander continued    According to the American Lung Association  pollution levels in Tennessee may increase lung cancer risks as much as breathing second hand smoke at home   Reducing fine particles and ozone can lower lung cancer risk as well as risk of heart and asthma attacks from excess levels of fine particle pollution      Alexander said mercury contamination is also a problem for East Tennessee  which has mercury   hot spots    due to emissions from coal fired power plants both within and outside of Tennessee    Our legislation will drastically reduce this potent neurotoxin  which is especially dangerous to developing fetuses     Alexander said     The good news is that during the last few years the air in Tennessee is becoming cleaner     Alexander said    But Knox County was recently ranked as the 15th most polluted city for fine particles and in the top 10 per cent of ozone polluted areas   The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is still the most polluted national park in America  Current visibility on the haziest days in the Smokies is 15 miles when natural visibility on those days should be 77 miles       Alexander praised East Tennessee county mayors who he said have been meeting together once a month for the last 28 months to take local steps to control air pollution  saying   Their work is crucial but they will not be able to succeed unless the federal government does its part with stricter standards of pollution produced by TVA plants in Tennessee and blown by the wind into Tennessee from other states       Power plants are the single greatest industrial source of four air pollutants  emitting 67 percent of the United State  s sulfur dioxide  23 percent of nitrogen oxides  37 percent of mercury  and 35 percent of carbon dioxide     The administration  s Clean Air Interstate  Mercury  and Visibility Rules  CAIR  CAMR  and CAVR  are aimed at reducing regional air pollution that is transported into states and helping states meet current national air quality standards for ozone and fine particles   The Clean Air Planning Act of 2006  CAPA  introduced today goes a step beyond the administration s clean air rules  Specifically  it would    Cut sulfur dioxide  SO2  emissions by 82 percent by 2015  CAPA would reduce this acid rain causing pollution from 11 million tons today to a total limit of 4 5 million tons in 2010 and to a total limit of 2 million tons in 2015    Cut emissions of nitrogen oxides  NOx  by almost 68 percent by 2015  Ozone pollution will be cut from 5 million tons to a total limit of 1 9 million tons in 2010 and to a total limit of 1 62 million tons in 2015    Cut mercury emissions by 90 percent in 2015  A stringent  yet achievable  goal that would greatly reduce the risks this neurotoxin poses to human health  particularly pregnant women and developing children    Begin the first ever national cap on carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions  Emissions would be capped at today s levels in 2010 and then power plants would have to reduce their emissions to 2001 levels in 2015  It is important that the U S  regulate CO2 from power plants  because CO2 emissions from U S  power plants equal 10 percent of global CO2 emissions    Alexander said the most innovative feature of CAPA is that it contains a modest cap on carbon emissions and allows offsets  One example of an offset would be if TVA were to purchase a CO2 or greenhouse gas emission reduction from an industrial company in Tennessee  This lets TVA meet their emissions requirement cost effectively and provides income for the company  He said a second example would be if TVA were to purchase a reduction from a farmer who plants new trees  because trees capture CO2  or agrees to farm in a way that captures carbon
