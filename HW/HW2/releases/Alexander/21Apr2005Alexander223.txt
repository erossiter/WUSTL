                                                                                                                   Statement Of Sen  Alexander   Biennial Budget Legislation         April 21st  2005   I  m delighted to be in support of Senator Domenici and Senator Joe Lieberman and glad to see that we have such distinguished sponsorship on both sides of the aisle  It greatly increases the chance that this might pass    I would like to talk about the bill from the point of view of someone who  s had other jobs outside of Washington and hasn  t been here for very long  This always made sense to me from a distance  My view was that if Congress would pass the Appropriations bill in the first year of the session  it could then spend the second year in oversight and review and hopefully repeal of some laws  We may even introduce a new beatitude around here    Tis more blessed to repeal than to enact    We have very little time  as Senator Lieberman said  for oversight  You take a big complicated bill like No Child Left Behind  what we should be doing next year before we reauthorize that  is finding out how it  s working  But we don  t have time because of all the budget appropriations    And as Sen  Domenici said  it could leave more time for us to be home with our constituents who seem better at understanding that we should come closer to spending what we take in  It might help us keep our feet on the ground more if we had more time to be at home instead of here in Washington   As a governor of Tennessee this was always a great frustration to me  This year the state budget of Tennessee is  25 billion  but half that money comes from the federal government  So we start our fiscal year in Tennessee July 1  but this fiscal year starts on October 1  but we don  t know how much money we  re getting until later in the year  So the year  s nearly over before the manager of half the state dollars knows how much they  re managing  That  s bound to hurt people who are supposed to be served and it  s bound to waste money and time    When I was president of the University of Tennessee  60 percent of the students had a federal grant or loan that would follow them to the college or university of their choice  It would be helpful to know a year or two in advance who might be coming and how much money they would have if you want to run an efficient university so we can serve the largest number of students and have the highest quality         If I am the Secretary of Education and my job is to take hundreds of programs passed by the Congress and manage them appropriately  it would help me be a much better manager and help me participate in congressional oversight to repeal or approve programs  if I knew how much money I had to spend every year before it started    So this has always struck me as a no brainer and as a great idea  and I am delighted to see it has such strong support from senior members of the Senate  I hope it passes
