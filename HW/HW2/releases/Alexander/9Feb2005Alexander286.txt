                                                                                                                   Alexander  Frist  and Wamp Commend DOE Choice Of Oak Ridge Associated Universities To Manage National Supplemental Care Program          February 9th  2005   Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  Senator Alexander and Congressman Zach Wamp commend U S  Department of Energy  DOE  s expansion of its Former Worker Medical Screening Program  FWP  and selection of Oak Ridge Associated Universities  ORAU  to lead a new supplemental former worker medical screening effort that will provide services to thousands of workers each year  This cooperative agreement will run for five years  ORAU has teamed with its partners  National Jewish Medical and Research Center  NJMRC  and Comprehensive Health Services  CHS   to run the program     The expansion of the Former Worker Medical Screening program proves Secretary Bodman s commitment to the long term health of DOE workers   said John Shaw  DOE Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health     I m pleased by today s announcement by the Department of Energy that Oak Ridge Associated Universities has been selected to provide high quality medical screening to thousands of former DOE workers   said Frist   ORAU has proven itself as a world class medical association  and I m glad their resources and expertise will help provide former workers with the medical attention and care they deserve      This partnership is good news for the Oak Ridge Associated Universities and for the thousands of former employees of the Department of Energy who will have access to this new health screening program   said Senator Lamar Alexander  chairman of the Senate Energy Subcommittee   It is important that we give them and their families the peace of mind or assistance they need in dealing with health issues related to the important work they ve done for this country      ORAU has proven yet again that it is a center of excellence where research and education are truly balanced   said Congressman Zach Wamp  Vice Chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations subcommittee   The ORAU partnership with National Jewish Medical and Research Center enables Oak Ridge to take the lead on a nationwide program to provide additional options for health screenings and improve the lives of those who have worked to secure our homeland     This new cooperative agreement outlines a number of goals for this project  The ORAU team will be responsible for contacting and informing former workers about the supplemental program  employing an effective communications system to answer questions and arrange medical evaluations  providing medical evaluations  and communicating test results to the former workers with recommendations for follow up    This team will also be responsible for providing supplemental medical care services for those workers not served by regional programs  former workers who do not reside in close proximity to regional screening clinics  and former workers from any DOE site who would prefer to see their personal physician    The ORAU team will offer screening services for workers at the following locations         In Illinois  at the Fermi Lab        In Missouri  at the Kansas City Plant        In Florida  at the Pinellas Plant        In Illinois  Argonne National Laboratory        In New Jersey  the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory    The beauty of this program is that we will be able to serve former workers in all 50 states   said Dr  Joe Furman  one of the Principal Investigators on the project   This arrangement will better serve the workers and their specific needs     ORAU  a nonprofit corporation  has more than 26 years of experience in conducting epidemiologic studies and in managing medical surveillance programs  ORAU has managed DOE s Nationwide Former Beryllium Workers Medical Surveillance Program since 1998 and has completed more than 22 000 exams and tests in the past 14 years  ORAU operates one of only five laboratories in the U S  that can process the complicated beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test  Be LPT  The Be LPT is used to determine if patients have sensitivity to beryllium and are susceptible to chronic beryllium disease    National Jewish Medical and Research Center  based in Denver  Colo   provides state of the art consultation and medical surveillance services to industry  government  and labor  It has the largest academic program in Occupational Respiratory Disorders in the United States and is renowned for its expertise in the medical evaluation of beryllium sensitization cases for the determination of chronic beryllium disease  For the seventh consecutive year  NJMRC has been named the 1 respiratory hospital in the nation by U S  News   World Report  The ranking is part of the 2004  America s Best Hospitals  guide published by the weekly newsmagazine     The NJMRC ORAU teams have special experience in detecting the various lung disorders that are likely to be found in some of these former workers  said Dr  Lee Newman  one of the Principal Investigators for the program   Unfortunately  these workers are at potentially high risk for a number of lung diseases  such as chronic beryllium disease  asbestosis  silicosis  radiation injury  and cancer as a consequence of past occupational exposures    Established in 1975  Comprehensive Health Services  Inc  has created a national network of 10 000 facilities and 12 000 CHS certified physicians  With CHS facilities within 20 miles of any U S  ZIP code  the company is uniquely positioned to manage the occupational health of geographically dispersed employee populations nationwide    The new supplemental medical program is expected to be up and running as early as June of this year  While a timeline for the opening of the new Regional Medical Screening Programs is still being determined  the ORAU team expects have the program fully operational within nine months    Background    The 1993 National Defense Authorization Act tasked DOE with assisting workers with determining whether they had health issues related to their prior work with the department    Prior to 1993  DOE had initiated several medical surveillance programs including a beryllium medical surveillance program for former workers at Rocky Flats and the Y 12 Plant in Oak Ridge and a medical surveillance program for former radiation workers at the Rocky Flats Plant  Since 1993  DOE has initiated the Nationwide Former Beryllium Workers Medical Surveillance program and 15 other site specific surveillance projects at 12 DOE sites  These programs have been administered by a number of different contractors    In 2004  DOE planned to consolidate all its regional former worker programs into a single  nationwide medical screening program  Following a review of former worker needs  this earlier decision was reversed  All existing regional medical screening programs will remain in operation  and several new regional programs will be opened
