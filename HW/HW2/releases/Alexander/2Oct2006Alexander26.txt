       October 2nd  2006   For Immediate Release                                              Contact  Harvey Valentine 202 224 8816 Monday  October 2  2006   ALEXANDER URGES INTERIOR DEPARTMENT TO KEEP  AIR QUALITY GOALS PART OF STRATEGIC PLAN Absence From Plan Could Affect Air Quality in Smokies  WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  has written U S  Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne urging that the Department  s Strategic Plan for the coming years retain the air quality goals and performance measures contained in the existing Straegic Plan   The Strategic Plan now in effect  for the years 2003 2008  includes the goal of improving air quality in federal lands designated as especially scenic areas   such as the Great Smoky Mountains  Progress toward that goal is measured by tracking air quality and visibility objectives  The proposed Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 2012 contains no mention of air quality  and omits the two air quality performance measures contained in the current plan   Alexander said that as the Park  s federal land manager  the Department has an   affirmative responsibility    to protect all   air quality related    values in Class I scenic areas like the Smoky Mountains     In light of this clear mandate  and in the interest of effective stewardship of our public lands  it is important for the Interior Department to maintain specific strategic goals for protecting and improving air quality in especially scenic areas     Alexander said            Text of Sen  Alexander  s letter to Sec  Kempthorne follows      September 25  2006   The Honorable Dirk Kempthorne Secretary of the Interior U S  Department of the Interior 1849 C Street  N W  Washington  DC  20240 0001  Dear Secretary Kempthorne   I am writing to request that the Department of the Interior Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 2012  which is being prepared in fulfillment of the Government Performance and Results Act  include the air quality goals and performance measures that were contained in the Department  s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2003 2008   The Department  s Strategic Plan now in effect includes the goal of improving air quality in federal lands designated as Class I areas under the Clean Air Act   Progress toward that goal is measured  according to the plan  by tracking the percent of such lands that meet ambient air quality standards and visibility objectives   The proposed Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 2012 contains no mention of air quality  and omits the two air quality performance measures that are contained in the current plan   A recent National Park Service analysis shows that even as air quality is improving in some parks  45 of 51 Class I parks monitored for air pollution failed to improve  or got worse  with respect to one or more pollutants over the past decade   Much work remains to restore healthy air and ecosystems to our natural and scenic lands  including meeting the Clean Air Act goal of   the prevention of any future  and the remedying of any existing  impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I federal areas      For example  the Park Service analysis stated that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park   has the highest rates of nitrogen and sulfur deposition of any monitored location in North America   As a result  rainfall in the park is 5 10 times more acidic than natural rainfall  and 90 percent of clouds have been found to be unnaturally acidic   The Smokies also suffer from high levels of ozone pollution    among the highest in the Eastern U S   Since 1990  ozone levels have exceeded national ambient air quality standards on more than 300 days      The Park Service found no improvement in ozone  a slight improvement in visibility on clear days  an improvement in visibility on hazy days  no improvement in sulfate in precipitation  a slight improvement in nitrate in precipitation  and no improvement in ammonium in precipitation   Visibility in the Smokies on the worst days is 15 miles  much less than the estimate of natural visibility  77 miles      As the federal land manager designated under the 1977 Clean Air Act  the Department has an   affirmative responsibility    to protect all   air quality related values    in Class I areas   In light of this clear mandate  and in the interest of effective stewardship of our public lands  it is important for the Department to maintain specific strategic goals for protecting and improving air quality in Class I areas   While it may be an oversight that these air quality goals and performance measures were not included in the proposed Strategic Plan  a clear acknowledgement of Interior  s responsibility for protecting air quality in Class I areas should be a part of any strategic document guiding the Department  s activities   I therefore urge that the Department  s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Year 2007 2012 retain the air quality goals and performance measures contained in the existing Strategic Plan       Sincerely        Lamar Alexander     United States Senator
