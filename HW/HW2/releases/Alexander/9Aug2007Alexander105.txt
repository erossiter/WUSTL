America COMPETES Act into Law         August 9th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  today praised the signing into law of the America COMPETES  Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology  Education  and Science  Act  authorizing  43 billion over three years to double funding for science initiatives   This legislation is a culmination of over two years of work by Alexander and others to protect America  s brainpower advantage through math and science education and scientific research      This is the prime model of bipartisan cooperation on a massively important issue to every citizen of our country     said Alexander     The America COMPETES Act is a direct response to the challenge our country faces in keeping our brainpower advantage so our good jobs don  t go overseas to places like India and China   The President  the Senate Republican and Democratic Leadership  and Tennessee Congressmen Bart Gordon and Zach Wamp have joined me every step of the way to advance this important bill  and I join them in praising this final step        The bill is a legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies     Rising Above the Gathering Storm    report   Two years ago  this report was drafted at the request of Alexander and Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NM     with the encouragement of Senator Pete Domenici  R NM     when they asked    What are the top actions that federal policy makers could take to enhance the science and technology enterprise so the United States can successfully compete  prosper and be secure in the global community of the 21st century         The America COMPETES Act puts research programs at the National Science Foundation  the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Energy on a path to double their budgets during the next decade   It focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining and improving U S  innovation in the 21st century   1  increasing research investment   2  strengthening educational opportunities in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics from elementary through graduate school  and  3  developing an innovation infrastructure       Senator Bingaman and I asked the brightest Americans what we needed to do to stay competitive  and after two years we have done it     said Alexander     Now  we need to fund it       The America COMPETES Act  S  761  passed the Senate in April by a vote of 88 8   It was jointly introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  and ultimately attracted 69 bipartisan cosponsors   The bill was based on proposals in the Protecting America  s Competitive Edge  PACE  Act    which Alexander introduced last year with Senators Pete Domenici  R NM   Bingaman  D NM  and Mikulski  D MD   and which garnered 70 cosponsors evenly split between Republicans and Democrats    as well as another version of the bill that was sponsored last Congress by then Senate Majority Leader  Bill Frist  R TN    The House version of the America COMPETES Act    known as the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007  H R  2272     was introduced in May by Gordon  D TN 6    Alexander sits on the Senate  s Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee and is a former U S  Secretary of Education   Praise of the America COMPETES Act  President Bush    The bill I will sign today will help ensure that we do remain the most competitive and innovative nation in the world  I thank members of Congress from both parties who worked hard to secure its passage   I particularly want to thank Senators Pete Domenici  Jeff Bingaman  Lamar Alexander and John Ensign  as well as Congressman Bart Gordon and Vern Ehlers   You know  this bill shows that we can work together to make sure we re a competitive nation      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV     This is the end of a long haul to do a bill that  s extremely important   This is  a  bipartisan bill and there are a number of people who have worked extremely hard on this  but no one harder than Senators Bingaman and Alexander       Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY     Senator Alexander kept pushing others forward  but in fact we all knew who the real leader on our side was on this issue  He  in a very selfless way  helped move a bipartisan group together to form this important legislation  and I want to commend Senator Alexander in particular for the role that he played in all of this
