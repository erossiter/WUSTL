Scores of Tennesseans struggling with healthcare due to consent decrees blocking reforms        November 1st  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Sens  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and Mark Pryor  D Ark   today introduced legislation to slow down   democracy by court decree       the tendency of some federal courts to make decisions that should be left to elected state and local officials     The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act would provide relief to newly elected state and local officials who inherit overbroad or outdated consent decrees that limit their ability to govern and respond to the priorities and concerns of their constituents   The bill would make it easier for state and local governments to modify or terminate federal court consent decrees to which they are a party   These consent decrees can last for decades  locking in policies long after the officials who agreed to them have left office      This legislation would put decisions back in the hands of elected officials  who can be held accountable by the voters   That  s what democracy is all about     Alexander said     Instead of being free to make the policy choices they were elected to make  newly elected officials often find themselves restricted by the motions of plaintiffs   attorneys and the policy choices of a federal court        Since Alexander and Pryor introduced an earlier version of their bill in 2005  a growing coalition has endorsed the need for federal legislation to address consent decrees  including  the U S  Conference of Mayors  the National League of Cities  the National Association of Counties  the County Executives of America  the National Conference of State Legislatures  the American Legislative Exchange Council  the American Association of School Administrators  and the National Association of Police Organizations   Alexander  Pryor  and the groups supporting federal legislation cite examples from around the country where existing consent decrees have limited the actions of newly elected officials         In Tennessee  a U S  District Court judge ruled in 2005    citing several consent decrees    that the governor could not scale back benefits for 300 000 optional beneficiaries of the state Medicaid program  known as TennCare  in order to save health care programs for children and to more fully fund educational programs   The state prevailed in part on appeal  but the inability to fully implement the governor  s reforms resulted in thousands of TennCare beneficiaries having their health insurance limited or cut altogether         In Los Angeles  consent decrees have forced the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority to spend 47 percent of its budget on buses    leaving just over half the budget to pay for the county  s remaining transportation needs         In New York City  special education has been governed by a consent decree since 1979  thwarting efforts by successive mayors and schools chancellors to implement new reforms and updated policies for compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA    Alexander and Pryor emphasized that their legislation was intended to address weaknesses in current law while recognizing that consent decrees can be useful tools for averting prolonged legal battles  saving enormous court costs  and helping to ensure that federal rights are protected   The bill would only affect consent decrees to which state and local governments are a party  and would not affect consent decrees involving school desegregation or those resulting from litigation brought by the federal government     In the Senate  Alexander and Pryor were joined by the following cosponsors   U S  Senators Bob Corker  R Tenn    John Cornyn  R Tex    Ben Nelson  D Neb    Jon Kyl  R Ariz    Thad Cochran  R Miss    Kay Bailey Hutchison  R Tex    and Pete Domenici  R N M     Companion legislation in the House was introduced by Republican Whip Roy Blunt  R Mo   and Rep  Jim Cooper  D Tenn     Ten members of the Tennessee congressional delegation have signed on to the bill in the 110th Congress   Senators Alexander and Corker  and Representatives Cooper  David Davis  John L  Duncan  Zach Wamp  Lincoln Davis  Bart Gordon  Marsha Blackburn  and John Tanner   The attached one page summary provides additional details about the bill   Alexander Pryor   Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act Slowing Down   Democracy by Court Decree     The problem       Civil lawsuits filed against public schools  transit systems  and other state local government agencies often result in consent decrees    judicial orders resulting from agreements brokered between plaintiffs and the public officials being sued   These decrees are binding  legal agreements specifying how a particular problem will be remedied       Consent decrees can remain in place for decades  locking in policies that were agreed to by officials who are no longer in office       Newly elected officials often inherit overbroad or outdated consent decrees that limit their ability to govern and respond to the priorities and concerns of their constituents   Existing procedures discourage current state and local governments from trying to modify or terminate those decrees   The solution    the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act       Makes it easier for state and local governments to modify or terminate federal court consent decrees       Applies to federal court consent decrees to which a state or local government is a party   Does not affect decrees involving school desegregation or arising from lawsuits filed by the federal government       Provides a three pronged approach  o Creates   term limits    for consent decrees   After 4 years or after the state local official who provided consent leaves office  whichever comes sooner   a state or local government could ask a federal court to modify or vacate the decree  o Shifts the burden of proof   After a motion to modify or vacate a consent decree has been filed  the burden would shift to the plaintiff who filed the original lawsuit to demonstrate why continuation of the consent decree in its existing form is necessary to protect a federal right  o Provides guidance for future consent decrees   The bill sets out a series of findings to guide federal courts  based on a 2004 decision by the U S  Supreme Court suggesting that consent decrees should be narrowly drafted  limited in duration  and respectful of state local policy interests and concerns       Lead Senate sponsors   Alexander  R TN   Pryor  D AR   Kyl  R AZ   Nelson  D NE   and Cornyn  R TX          Companion bill in the House sponsored by Republican Whip Roy Blunt  R MO  and Congressman Jim Cooper  D TN    Why now        Overbroad or outdated consent decrees are a national problem  o In Tennessee  hundreds of thousands of residents are having their health insurance limited or cut altogether because a series of consent decrees prevented the state from implementing Medicaid reforms    approved by the governor and the legislature    that could have preserved their coverage  o In Los Angeles  consent decrees have forced the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority to spend 47 percent of its budget on buses    leaving just over half the budget to pay for the county  s remaining transportation needs  o In New York City  special education has been governed by a consent decree since 1979  thwarting efforts by successive mayors and schools chancellors to implement new reforms and updated policies for compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA        In 2004  the U S  Supreme Court expressed its concern that consent decrees may   improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers      Such circumstances may lead to   federal court oversight of state programs for long periods of time even absent an ongoing violation of federal law
