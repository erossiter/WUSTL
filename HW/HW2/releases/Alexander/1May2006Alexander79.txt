                                                                                                                   Sen  Alexander Introduces Senate Resolution on National Anthem         May 1st  2006   Washington  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  today introduced a Senate Resolution affirming that statements of national unity  including the National Anthem  should be recited or sung in English  Text of his prepared remarks follows     Mr  President  across the country today  thousands and thousands of immigrants    legal and illegal    are marching in a nationwide rally   Many are saying that they  too  want to be Americans       But  Mr  President  I  m afraid the message is  quite literally  getting lost in translation   As part of these demonstrations  a new version of our national anthem  the Star Spangled Banner  has been produced    in Spanish     According to an article in the Washington Post last Friday  at least 389 different versions of our anthem have been produced over the years  in many musical styles  including rock and roll and country   But  the Post also noted  never before has it been rendered in another language     It may be a first  but it is a big first step in the wrong direction   And it  s a mistake precisely because our nation is a nation of immigrants       Almost all of us are descended from immigrants from Britain  or Germany  or Italy  or France  or China  or Mexico  or some other country around the world   Our forefathers  who came from those many different countries  spoke many different languages   But in coming here  they agreed to speak one common language  one language to unify us as a nation  one language so we can all speak with one another   And that language is English     In fact  in order for a legal immigrant to become a citizen of the United States  one requirement is that he or she demonstrate at least an eighth grade level understanding of the English language     English is a part of who we are as Americans    it  s part of what unites us   Just as we are united by our history and our shared values  like liberty  equal opportunity  and the rule of law     I worry  Mr  President  that translating our national anthem will actually have the effect of dividing us   It adds to the celebration of multiculturalism in our society which has eroded our understanding of our common American culture       Ours is a diverse nation   But diversity is not our greatest accomplishment   Jerusalem is diverse   The Balkans are diverse   Iraq is diverse   What makes America unique is that we have taken all that magnificent diversity and turned it into one nation     Will translating our anthem into multiple languages also erode our sense of having a common language that allows us to speak with one another as one nation     Our national anthem is a symbol of all those things that unite us   It  s a product of our history     The Star Spangled Banner was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814   Our nation was then in the midst of the War of 1812   Our capital  Washington  DC  was invaded and burned by the British   Smoke was billowing from the White House and from this very Capitol building   And General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee was fast becoming a national hero     On September 13  1814  just a few weeks after the invasion of Washington  British forces began a 25 hour bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore   Through the day and all through the night  the rockets and bombs flew   And the next day  on September 14  standing aboard an American ship eight miles out from Baltimore  Francis Scott Key looked and saw that the stars and stripes were still waving over the fort  and the British were forced to withdraw   Our flag was still there     I went to see that very same flag  a few months ago  at the Smithsonian  s National Museum of American History   The museum is in the process of carefully preserving it so that our grandchildren  s grandchildren will be able to see the original flag that inspired our national anthem   It has 15 stars and 15 stripes for the 15 states of the Union at that time   It wasn  t until four years later  in 1818  that Congress and President Monroe decided the flag should always have 13 stripes  but a number of stars equal to the number of states     That flag and that song are a part of our history and our national identity   It declares some of our national ideals  in being the   land of the free and the home of the brave      That  s why in 1931 Congress declared the Star Spangled Banner our national anthem     That  s why we should always sing it in our common language  English   And that  s why today I am introducing a resolution that affirms that statements of national unity  especially the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem  ought to be recited or sung in English     We wouldn  t recite the Pledge in French  or German  or Russian  or Hindi  or even Chinese  which  after Spanish  is the second most spoken foreign language in the United States    And we shouldn  t sing the national anthem in Spanish  or any other foreign language     So  in this land of immigrants  let  s all sing it together  as one American nation  in our common language  English     Mr  President  on behalf of myself  Senator Frist  Senator McConnell  Senator Stevens  Senator Isakson  and Senator Roberts  I send this resolution to the desk for purposes of introduction      Related file
