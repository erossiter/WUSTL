                                                                                                                   Statement of Senator Lamar Alexander on the Senate Energy Bill          June 24th  2005   Last night the Senate finished most of its work on what I would call the Clean Energy Act of 2005    The first thing the bill does   and the most important in my opinion   is to stabilize and lower natural gas prices  We hear a lot of talk about the high cost of oil  and nobody likes to pay high prices for gasoline at the pump  but the bigger problem is the price of natural gas    Across this country  there are millions of blue collar workers who work in plants where the cost of natural gas is driving their jobs overseas  Farmers have experienced the cost of fertilizer going up from  200 to  500 per unit  That  s a big pay cut for our farmers  American home owners rely on natural gas to heat or cool their homes   natural gas heats or cools more homes than any other kind of fuel      so the cost of natural gas is costing home owners up to 50 percent more in bills  So for blue collar workers  farmers and home owners this energy legislation that we  ll be voting on Tuesday stabilizes and potentially lowers the price of natural gas  That  s one of the single most important things we can do for our country        The second thing the bill does that  s important is it recognizes that global warming is a problem  There  s not a complete consensus on that in the United States Senate but the bill has a different kind of consensus that makes more of a difference because the bill changes the way we produce electricity toward ways that are low carbon and no carbon    The completion of a clean energy bill in the Senate is by far one of the most important things we have done because it affects millions of Americans  Our final vote will be on Tuesday  and I anticipate it will be a strong bipartisan vote of support  just as the work that was done here was strong and bipartisan
