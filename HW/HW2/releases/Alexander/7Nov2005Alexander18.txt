Economy U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  chair of Senate Energy Subcommittee  joins local officials For ceremony held today in Nashville        November 7th  2005   NASHVILLE   USDA Rural Development State Director Mary  Ruth  Tackett was joined today by U S  Sen  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   as well as state  federal and community leaders at a funding announcement for Ethanol Grain Processors which received a  150 000 nationally competitive Rural Development grant to assist with the development and operation of an innovative value added business venture which transforms corn into ethanol fuel  The ethanol produced by Ethanol Grain Processors in West  Tenn   will be distributed throughout the United States       This federal investment is a big win for Tennesseans   said Alexander   By using ethanol produced in Obion County to fuel our cars and trucks  we can create hundreds of new jobs in West Tennessee  help ease our dependence on foreign oil  reduce air pollution across the state  and provide farmers a growing market for corn  I  m proud to be here today with Mary Ruth Tackett and other state and local officials to congratulate and support Ethanol Grain Processors      Studies have shown that ethanol production has been responsible for more than 40 000 jobs and directly and indirectly adds more than  4 5 billion to U S  farm income annually and  6 billion to the American economy each year by boosting surrounding economies       USDA Rural Development supports value added agriculture business ventures and President Bush s energy plan to develop clean  alternative renewable energy sources     said Tackett     This project will significantly impact Tennessee  s farm families through direct support of corn producers in our state  We are committed to working with rural farmers  agriculture producers  and entrepreneurs to increase their economic opportunities and expand their role in developing and marketing value added products      USDA Rural Development funds will be used to construct offices at Ethanol Grain Processors   ethanol facility and secure inventory on the plant site located near the Town of Obion  The construction will allow the company to produce ethanol and in turn  increase corn prices for farmers allowing them to better compete in domestic and international markets     Ethanol and other biofuels have enormous potential to impact Tennessee agriculture     said Flavius Barker  president of the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation     Tennessee can produce the products to feed these industries and the industries would contribute greatly to profitability of our farmers        On behalf of the Board of Governors of Ethanol Grain Processors  our Members and our community I would like to express my deep appreciation to the USDA Rural Development Office for this grant and the assistance it will provide to our project  s development     said Jim Patterson  CEO for Ethanol Grain Processors    We are excited to be a part of an ever growing movement to advance the use of alternative energy sources and  specifically  renewable fuels to help reduce our nation  s dependence on foreign sources for its energy needs       We have recently revised our business plan to increase the size of our plant  s annual production capacity from 50 to 100 million gallons   Studies show that the local economic impact of a plant of this size is  276 million       Ethanol Grain Processors is a producer based business venture  100 percent owned by 33 farmers predominantly from West Tennessee counties   They aspire to increase rural community income by increasing the market demand for corn by 36 million bushels through the transformation of corn into ethanol fuel  a premium liquid fuel that can extend petroleum imports   The Company plans to purchase corn in West Tennessee counties with Obion  Weakley and Gibson counties each producing over 7 5 million bushels of corn per year     This expansion is funded through Rural Development  s Value Added Producer Grant program   To date  the Bush Administration has funded nearly  20 million in value added development centers and over  100 million in value added grants  including over 80 energy projects   The renewable energy projects involve bio diesel  ethanol or wind energy production or the use of bio mass to generate energy   Grants are available to independent producers  agricultural producer groups  farmer or rancher cooperatives  and majority controlled producer based business ventures interested in a competitively awarded grant to fund one of the following two activities   1  planning activities needed to establish a viable value added marketing opportunity for an agricultural product  e g  conduct a feasibility study  develop a business or marketing plan   or  2  acquire working capital to operate a value added business venture that will allow producers to better compete in domestic and international markets    USDA Rural Development is committed to the future of rural communities by assisting with financial and technical assistance through various housing  community and business cooperative programs   Further information on
