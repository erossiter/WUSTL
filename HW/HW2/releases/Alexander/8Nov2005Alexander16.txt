                                                                                                                   Alexander  Frist  Wamp Applaud Funding to Fight Methamphetamine in Tennessee         November 8th  2005   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Bill Frist  R Tenn   and Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   today joined Congressman Zach Wamp  R Tenn   in applauding the completion of the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce  Justice and Science  CJS  Appropriations conference report   The report includes  4 million to assist Tennessee law enforcement officials in their ongoing battle against methamphetamine         3 million for a new statewide task force that will ensure all regions of the state have the training and equipment they need to address this crisis   Last year Frist and Alexander worked with Wamp to double funding for the South East Tennessee Methamphetamine Taskforce   That funding enabled the Taskforce to expand its training and support activities across the entire state   This year s additional funding will provide the necessary resources to support a statewide methamphetamine enforcement effort          1 million for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation  TBI  to develop a statewide crime tracking system   TBI will use the funding to equip and support a statewide methamphetamine intelligence and operational law enforcement computer database to assist the Tennessee statewide methamphetamine taskforce   The Hamilton County Sheriff s Department currently operates a database that will be expanded to ensure that regional methamphetamine task forces  TBI  and the Tennessee National Guard s Counter Drug Division can effectively work together to track repeat offenders    Last year Tennessee ranked second nationally among all states in the number of methamphetamine lab seizures  and local law enforcement officials across the country rank meth as our nation s number one drug problem   Each pound of meth leaves behind five to six pounds of toxic waste  and the cost of a single lab cleanup ranges from  2 000 to  10 000     Methamphetamine is rapidly tearing apart our neighborhoods  destroying our families  and stealing our children s futures     Frist said     In August I heard first hand from Tennesseans all across the state about the many ways in which methamphetamine is destroying their communities   I came back to Washington committed to finding the best way to assist state and local efforts to combat this addictive drug   By creating a statewide taskforce and providing meaningful funding  Tennessee  s law enforcement agencies can take the critical step of improving coordination in the fight against methamphetamine   This is just a first step  and I look forward to continuing my work with Senator Alexander  Congressman Wamp  and the entire delegation to put an end to this crisis         Methamphetamine is a critical problem in Tennessee where we have experienced the second highest number of meth lab seizures in the nation     Alexander said    Strong support and cooperation among Tennessee s law enforcement efforts is vital to combating this scourge on our communities   A statewide database and tracking system will help get dangerous criminals off our streets by making sure that methamphetamine producers and their labs don t elude arrest because of jurisdictional boundaries  I will continue to work with Sen  Frist and our Congressional delegation to address the methamphetamine problem in Tennessee        By creating the South East Tennessee Methamphetamine Taskforce  the U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee addressed a serious shortcoming in the drug war and sought to consolidate the law enforcement efforts and resources in his jurisdiction to focus on destroying labs and getting convictions instead of just arresting and re arresting offenders     Wamp said    The task force s results have been so impressive that they have been replicated across the state and now serve as a model to the entire nation   As the only Tennessean on the Appropriations Committee and at the joint request of the three U S  Attorneys representing Tennessee s meth fighters  I have fought to provide proper funding for the taskforce and with the forceful support of Tennessee s Senators we were able to secure their request of  3 million to continue taskforce operations      The U S  Department of Health and Human Services also awarded  17 8 million to Tennessee through the Access to Recovery Program last year   That funding will be distributed over three years to enhance substance abuse clinical treatment and provide recovery support services   In August  the state was awarded an additional  1 5 million over three years to support treatment in six rural counties that have been especially hard hit by methamphetamine    Both the Senate and the House must pass the conference report before sending it to the President for signature
