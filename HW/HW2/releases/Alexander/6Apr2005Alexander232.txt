                                                                                                                   Alexander Introduces Natural Gas Legislation   Bold and Aggressive steps    to lower record high gas prices        April 6th  2005   WASHINGTON    With natural gas prices at   record levels and the highest of any industrialized country     U S  Sens  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and Tim Johnson  D S D   today introduced legislation that takes   bold and aggressive steps    to lower the cost of natural gas      During a news conference on Capitol Hill  Alexander said    high natural gas prices are threatening our jobs  our farms and hurting Americans who are trying to heat and cool their homes  Only an ambitious  comprehensive approach that both increases supply and controls demand can lower the price of natural gas and keep our growing economic recovery from becoming recent history       This is not a question of tweaking our natural gas policy  It is time to aggressively revamp it  We need aggressive conservation  aggressive use of alternative fuels  aggressive research and development  aggressive production  and for the time being  aggressive imports of liquefied natural gas      1   Energy Efficiency and Conservation       Consumer Education   Creates an aggressive four year national consumer education program on actionable measures to reduce the demand for energy       Efficiency Standards   Sets higher appliance and equipment standards for natural gas efficiency   For example  a commercial air conditioner will cool the same while using less natural gas to do it       Cogeneration   Creates tax incentives and regulatory relief to enable manufacturing facilities to more easily produce their own power and steam from a single source    which saves money and energy while also reducing pollutants       Efficient Electricity Generation   Provides incentives for utilities to utilize their natural gas plants based on efficiency       Oil Savings   Sets a bold target for demand reduction of 1 75 million barrels per day of gasoline by 2015   This is almost twice the amount of anticipated production from the Artic Wildlife National Refuge     2   Alternative Fuels       National Coal Gasification Strategy   Supports the deployment of six coal gasification plants by 2013 in order to fully commercialize coal gasification   Similarly supports aggressive use of coal gasification for industrial applications   Provides streamlined permitting for coal gasification facilities       Solar Power   Provides tax incentives for aggressive investment in solar power generation     3   Research and Development       Hydrogen Fuel Cell Initiative   Invests in research and development of technologies and infrastructure to use hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles   In the long term  this will reduce our dependence on foreign oil   Senator Alexander introduced President Bush  s hydrogen initiative in the Senate in 2003       Gas hydrates    Invests in gas methane hydrates research  which holds tremendous potential to provide abundant supplies of natural gas  Estimates indicate the U S  resource base contains one quarter of the world  s supply           Other R programs    Invests in solar energy technologies  distributed generation  biofuels  and biomass    4   Production       Off Shore Production  Provides Department of Interior with the legal authority to issue   natural gas only    leases   Instructs Department of Interior to draw the state boundary  according to established international law  between Alabama and Florida regarding Lease 181 and lease portions which are not in Florida by December 31  2007   Allows states to selectively waive the federal moratoria on off shore production and collect significant revenues from such production   A conservation royalty would also be established   The conservation royalty would be shared equally by the Federal land and water conservation fund  state land and water conservation fund and wildlife grants   None of these payments would be subject to appropriations   5   Importing Liquefied Natural Gas       LNG Terminal and Pipeline Siting  Streamlines the permitting of facilities for bringing liquefied natural gas  LNG  from overseas to the United States   Gives Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  exclusive authority for siting and regulating LNG terminals  while still preserving states   authorities under the Coastal Zone Management Act and other acts   Requires that FERC grant or deny a terminal or pipeline application within one year   Clarifies the permitting process for pipelines and natural gas storage facilities     The bill raises revenues that are expected to provide  4 to  6 billion to pay for the initiatives outlined in the proposal   Alexander was joined for the announcement by James Ray  vice president and general manager of Eastman Chemical Company  s Texas Division  Robert Hardie  plant manager of DuPont  s New Johnsonville  Tennessee plant  and Henson Moore  president of the American Forest and Paper Association
