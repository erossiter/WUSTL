                                                                                                                   Alexander Proposes Amendment to Include Governors in Certifying Border as Secure   Cites Need for Certification by Officials   Outside Washington             June 7th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander has proposed an amendment to the immigration bill that would prevent other elements of the legislation from being implemented unless three out of four governors on the U S    Mexico border certify the border is secure      After 20 years of mismanagement  Americans have zero confidence in the federal government  s willingness to control the border     Alexander said    The way to restore that confidence is to first  pass a strong border security bill  second  to fund it  and third  require the federal government to get sign offs from governors on the border that it is secure before triggering other changes to the immigration system  No one will know better than the governors when their borders are secure           Alexander said this amendment will help ensure the borders are secured and certified   by someone the American people can trust     As currently written  the bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to certify that it has established and demonstrated operational control of the entire U S    Mexico border once certain conditions are met  Those conditions include the hiring and training of 20 000 Border Patrol agents  300 miles of vehicle barriers  105 radar and camera towers and 31 500 detention beds  Without that certification that the border is secure  other changes to the immigration system contained in the bill could not go into effect   Alexander  s amendment would build on those border security provisions by also asking the governors of California  Arizona  New Mexico and Texas to weigh in on whether these conditions have been met and that all illegal entries into the United States are being prevented      The borders are not secure  and the current system is not working     Alexander said    Involving the southern border governors is the only way to be sure we have plugged the gaps that today allow a million immigrants to come here illegally each year
