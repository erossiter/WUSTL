                                                                                                                   Statement of Senator Lamar Alexander   At Press Conference On Energy Bill Passing Committee         May 26th  2005   I hope that this bill is called the Clean Energy Act of 2005 and by the time it gets through the whole process that it deserves that title  I believe Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have provided a real service to the country by creating this piece of legislation so far  September 11 was a big surprise for this country  but the next big surprise will be to our pocket books if we don  t fix our energy policy  We have the highest natural gas prices in the industrialized world  that  s a bigger problem than prices at the pump  This is a bill for blue collar workers  it  s for American homeowners  it  s for American farmers  It includes aggressive conservation  For example  just the appliance efficiency standards in this bill will avoid building 45 new 500 megawatt gas power plants  that  s a lot  And secondly  it changes the way we think about producing energy  It focuses again on nuclear power  which produces 70 percent of our carbon free electricity  on clean coal   that  s half of our power   and on finding a way to reduce the price of natural gas  It  s a great step forward  and I look forward to the floor debate
