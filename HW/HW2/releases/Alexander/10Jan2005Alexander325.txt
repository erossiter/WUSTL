                                                                                                                   Senator Lamar Alexander And Labor Department Official Deliver Check          January 10th  2005   KNOXVILLE  Tenn    Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment Standards Victoria A  Lipnic joined Senator Lamar Alexander in Knoxville today to make one of the first payments under the new Part E Program of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA   The check for  125 000 was presented to Christine Case  surviving widow of Wayne Wallace Jr   who worked as an electrician at the Y 12 facility in Oak Ridge  Tenn   from 1953 to 1971     Thousands of workers like Mr  Wallace sacrificed to keep our country safe   said Lipnic   It is our responsibility to ensure these workers and their families are well served by the new energy workers  compensation program     Part E  administered by the Labor Department  replaces the Part D program formerly run by the Department of Energy  DOE   In October of 2004  the President signed into law an amendment to the EEOICPA that created Part E to provide federal compensation and medical benefits to contractors and subcontractors  or their survivors  who worked at certain DOE facilities and sustained an occupational injury as a result of exposure to toxic substances     Compensation for Christine Case and other Cold War veterans  families is long overdue   said Alexander at the check presentation   The DOL currently runs several similar programs and is well equipped to handle these claims  I am glad to see that the legislation I co sponsored in the Senate has made it possible for 4 800 families in Tennessee to receive payment and medical benefits much sooner     While many Part E entitlement provisions are not yet set forth in final regulations  the published preliminary procedures allow the Labor Department to process the most straightforward claims and issue payments  In addition to Mrs  Case s claim  there are nearly 100 more claims that have been approved for payment  Checks for those claimants will be distributed within the next month  The department is expected to publish final regulations on Part E in late spring    Over the past four years  the department has successfully administered the Part B program of the EEOICPA and has issued more than  1 billion in compensation and medical payments to approximately 12 800 claimants  Part B provides a lump sum payment of  150 000 in addition to medical expenses for current and former DOE employees who became ill as a result of their exposure to radiation  beryllium or silica  DOE contractor employees  and certain survivors  are also potentially eligible  Covered conditions include radiogenic cancers  beryllium diseases and chronic silicosis  Qualified survivors of deceased covered employees may also be eligible for the lump sum compensation of  150 000
