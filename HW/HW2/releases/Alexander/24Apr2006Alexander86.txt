                                                                                                                   Alexander Discusses Support for the President s Nuclear Proposal With India         April 24th  2006   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  made the following remarks at an April 13 press conference in New Delhi  India in support of the President  s civilian nuclear power proposal with India  If fully implemented  the proposal would allow cooperation and trade efforts between the U S  and India which would support nuclear power in India    Alexander  a member of the Foreign Relations Committee  is a cosponsor of S  2429 which would make changes to existing law that are needed to fully implement the U S  India agreement   In remarks to press in New Delhi  Alexander said       I believe President Bush has shown real vision by recognizing that in this new century there may be no more important two country relationship than the one between the United States and India   And the rest of the country  including the rest of the Congress  is quick to catch up with our President   He has broad support in understanding this   That  s the first thing     We recognize that we have a strategic interest   You  re facing the same sort of energy and environmental issues that we are   And our two countries are unique in the world because we each have formed one nation from many different cultures and that  s hard to do and a great accomplishment     Second on education  we heard earlier from the Foreign Minister about the contribution that land grant universities have paid to agriculture here   I hope as we look to the future that our great land grant universities in the United States  which include colleges of agriculture  can form partnerships here to assist with agriculture   And I hope our universities as well as our companies can help to train more engineers and scientists here as well as in the United States     While we have been out sourcing jobs in the United States  we have been in sourcing brain power and much of that brain power comes from India  and we  re grateful for it because it helps create good jobs in the United States  We have 80 000 Indians who are students in the United States out of about 572 000 foreign students who study in the United States   India has more students studying in the United States than any other country     Finally  Senator Enzi mentioned that I  m on the Foreign Relations Committee   I support and am a cosponsor of the President  s civilian nuclear power proposal with India   It has growing support as we consider it   I hope that it can pass this year   It  s important for our two country relationship   Nuclear power is essential if we  re going to have clean air and low cost energy in this country and in the United States  I look forward to working with the President and with other senators as we consider it  and I hope that it is enacted this year   It will help us enact it without amendment and more rapidly if India can negotiate safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Association before the Senate acts on the agreement   That would help       When asked about the   realistic chances of the deal going through the Senate before the summer recess     Alexander said        I never predict the United States Senate because there are 100 members  and it operates literally by unanimous consent   It is possible that the Senate could act before August   I would hope that it would   As I mentioned earlier  India moving  ahead with negotiations on the safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency and showing at least initial progress on the negotiations that have to do with the United States being able to be a commercial supplier are important steps that will accelerate the Senate consideration     But moving by August would be moving rapidly given the Senate schedule   It  s already receiving accelerated attention and the President is strongly for it   I participated in a hearing just last week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in which Secretary Rice made a forceful presentation   It was a well attended hearing       Alexander participated in the April 13 press conference during a congressional delegation trip to India  Europe and the Middle East led by Sen  Mike Enzi  R WY   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  The congressional delegation s primary focus was learning more about foreign educational systems and the implications to U S  competitiveness in the emerging world market  Sen  Johnny Isakson  R GA  and U S  Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings were also part of the delegation
