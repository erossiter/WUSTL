                                                                                                                   Alexander  Climate Change Bill s One Size Fits All Approach Too Risky  Costly  Offers amendments to protect American jobs and taxpayers while reducing emissions        December 5th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  said today at a meeting of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  EPW  that the Lieberman Warner Climate Security Act of 2007 now before the committee may be too risky  too costly and likely to cause unintended consequences     Climate change is a problem  and I have been ready to take a giant step on climate change since the first year I became a senator     said Alexander  a member of the EPW Committee that is responsible for climate change legislation    But I think there is a wiser approach          Alexander said that legislation tailored to effectively reduce emissions from key sectors  rather than an economy wide approach  would be more likely to address climate change without having detrimental economic impacts    Tailoring our approach to just power plants and transportation would cover about two thirds of U S  greenhouse gas emissions     Alexander said    That would be a lower cost  simpler approach with fewer surprises that would have a better chance of getting 60 votes on the Senate floor       Since Alexander  s first year in the Senate in 2003  he has introduced legislation during each 2 year Congress to put a cap on carbon emissions from electricity power plants  In April  Alexander and Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  introduced legislation to reduce air pollution and the threat of global warming by enacting strict standards on four major pollutants from power plants   Alexander s legislation would strengthen and put into law new Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  rules on sulfur  nitrogen and mercury pollutants  and establish the first ever caps on carbon emissions from power plants   Alexander said he will broaden his own legislation by including   1  a low carbon fuel standard requiring transportation fuels to decrease gradually the amount of carbon in the gasoline or diesel that they contain  Transportation produces one third of America  s greenhouse gases    2  an aggressive approach to building energy efficiency      After signaling his intention to offer another amendment on the Senate floor designed to provide tax relief for low income taxpayers  Alexander intended to propose amendments to improve the Climate Security Act during Wednesday  s committee meeting  including ones    1  To research and develop cleaner biofuels   The amendment would authorize Sun Grant Centers to receive grants from the EPA to conduct research and development on the ability of biofuels to reduce air pollution emissions from transportation fuels  The Sun Grant Initiative is a national network of land grant universities  including the University of Tennessee  and U S  Department of Energy laboratories that are partnering to build a bio based economy consisting of biomass electricity plants and biofuels  Alexander said the EPA could use the centers to enhance the nation  s energy security and to promote diversification and environmental sustainability in America  s rural communities        2  To effectively reduce emissions from the transportation sector  The amendment would establish a carbon fuel standard for the transportation sector that sets targets of five percent less carbon per unit of energy in 2015 and ten percent less carbon in 2020 from current levels  Alexander said using domestic low carbon fuels reduces oil consumption  lowers expenditures on oil imports and saves consumers dollars    It is time to put performance standards into place that will guarantee that new choices at the pump will be cleaner and more sustainable     Alexander said       Alexander said his tax relief amendment  which he will offer during full Senate consideration of the bill  would help mitigate the increases in energy costs for low income taxpayers   The Lieberman Warner Climate Security Act includes an auction of allowances to emit greenhouse gases that is essentially a tax on electricity  Alexander said  because companies would have the added cost of purchasing energy credits that they likely will pass this cost on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices     If we are to raise taxes we ought to give relief to the people who need it the most     said Alexander     As we work to combat climate change and clean our air  we need to make sure the legislation we put forth doesn  t have unintended consequences
