                                                                                                                   Statement Of Sen  Alexander On The Environment And Public Works Committee  s Inaction On Clean Air Legislation         March 9th  2005   I am very disappointed the committee did not report out strong clean air legislation  Americans  and Tennesseans especially  need it   The Great Smokies has become our country s most polluted national park   Knoxville is at the top of the asthma lists   Three fourths of Tennesseans live in counties in which the air violates federal standards   This dirty air threatens our health  our ability to recruit good jobs  and the scenic beauty of our state   I am co sponsor of the Carper Alexander legislation that goes farther  faster than the president s proposal to control sulfur  nitrogen and mercury pollutants  It also puts modest controls on carbon   Senator Voinovich s latest version of the president  s Clear Skies proposal is a substantial improvement   Specifically  his willingness to tighten controls on sulfur dioxide to a national cap of 2 5 million tons per year would help Knoxville and the Smokies more than any other part of our country   For the good of our country and of Tennessee  I hope Chairman Inhofe  Senator Voinovich  Senator Carper and the other committee members will continue working   I will continue to support the Carper Alexander legislation  but the Voinovich version of the president s proposal is becoming the kind of strong legislation that our country needs and that I can support
