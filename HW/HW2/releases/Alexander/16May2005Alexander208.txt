                                                                                                                   Senators Alexander  Landrieu Honor Teddy Roosevelt  s Conservation Legacy   Reintroduce Americans Outdoors Act Bill marks most significant federal commitment of resources to conservation ever         May 16th  2005   WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and Mary L  Landrieu  D La   visited the Teddy Roosevelt Memorial on Virginia  s Roosevelt Island today to honor the president  s lasting legacy of conservation and to announce the recent reintroduction of the Americans Outdoors Act  AOA    The Americans Outdoors Act  S  964  is a landmark  multi year commitment to conservation programs that will directly benefit all 50 states and hundreds of local communities   It creates conservation royalties earned from the offshore production of oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  and directs them towards the restoration of coastal wetlands  preservation of wildlife habitat and the building and maintenance of local and state parks       The Great American Outdoors is an essential part of the American character     said Sen  Alexander     Italy has its art  Egypt has its pyramids  England has its history  And we have the Great American Outdoors  This legislation looks ahead for a generation to make sure we have places to enjoy our outdoors  This bill would fully fund already existing programs for wildlife conservation  which will benefit hunters and fisherman  birdwatchers  walkers  bikers and all Americans who enjoy outdoor recreation  It would fully fund city parks  so children can have decent  clean places to play  It would also protect wetlands        With this legislation  we can make the most significant dedication of resources to conservation this nation has ever made and ensure a positive legacy of protecting and enhancing our cultural  natural and recreational resources for generations to come     Sen  Landrieu said    Although the federal government has time and again said it would fully fund these initiatives  these programs have instead been shortchanged  under funded or left out altogether  It is time to move past that kind of thinking and provide reliable  steady and significant funding for the urgent conservation and outdoor recreation needs of our states and cities      The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 already shares with states 50 percent of revenues from mineral production on federal lands within each state  s boundaries   These funds are distributed to states automatically  outside the budget process and not subject to appropriations   But there is no similar provision for states to share offshore oil and gas revenues generated on the OCS     The Americans Outdoors Act would be paid for by what I think of as a   conservation royalty       Sen  Alexander said     It is modeled after the state royalty for onshore drilling that has been in existence since the 1920  s  in which 50 cents of every dollar goes to the state in which drilling occurs  In a similar way  this would create a conservation royalty of about 25 percent for revenues collected from oil and gas drilling on offshore federal lands        In supporting the production and transportation of 80 percent of our nation  s offshore oil supply  Louisiana  s coast has a tremendous national impact     Sen  Landrieu said     Our coast is truly America  s Wetland    and America faces a national emergency  Returning a portion of OCS revenues to Louisiana and other coastal producing states is a crucial first step to restoring and preserving our vital wetlands and the billions of dollars in energy investments they protect       AOA dedicates assured funding for four distinct programs   They include    Coastal Impact Assistance    This program acknowledges the impact to and contribution of the states that provide the bulk of our nation  s energy   It directs  450 million to oil and gas producing coastal states without moratoria off their coasts to provide for wetland restoration and mitigate the various impacts of serving as the platform for developing offshore energy resources               Land and Water Conservation Fund  LWCF     AOA would provide greater revenue certainty for state and local governments by allocating  450 million for the state side of the LWCF to fund the planning and development of parks and recreation facilities   Of this funding  60 percent would be divided equally among all 50 states and 40 percent would be distributed relative to population     Wildlife Conservation  Education and Restoration     350 million would be allocated to all 50 states through the successful Pittman Robertson program for the conservation of non game and game species  with the principal goal of preventing species from becoming endangered or listed under the Endangered Species Act     The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program  UPARR      125 million in matching grants  70   would provide direct assistance to our cities and towns so they may focus on the need to provide more green spaces  playgrounds and athletic fields for our youth in the more densely inhabited areas of the country   Sen  Alexander  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee  served as chairman of President Reagan s Commission on Americans Outdoors  which recommended many of these programs  including offshore oil drilling to fully fund federal and state conservation programs  Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Senate Energy Committee  has championed direct and dedicated federal funding for coastal restoration and conservation efforts since being elected in 1996    She has been a passionate voice for her state and a strong advocate for a common sense approach to our nation s energy needs     Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   said last week    The legislation builds on an effort made during the 106th Congress that was supported by governors  mayors and a coalition of more than 5 000 organizations throughout the country                 Research has shown that accessibility to trails and recreation opportunities are directly related to increased physical activity and thus healthier Americans     said Frank Hugelmeyer  president of Outdoor Industry Association  which last month honored Sens  Alexander and Landrieu with its Friend of the Outdoor Industry Award for their work on AOA     We stand united to endorse the power and promise of this major legislative vehicle to reduce inactivity and promote health and wellness through increased access to quality parks and recreation
