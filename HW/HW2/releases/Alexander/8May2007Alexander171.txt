Recognition of Music Education        May 8th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Today Senator Chris Dodd  D CT  and Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  sent a letter to David Walker  the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office  GAO   requesting that the GAO conduct a study on access to music and arts education in the American public school system since passage of the No Child Left Behind Act   This week  Senators Dodd and Alexander also introduced a resolution recognizing the benefits and importance of school based music education   Senators Dodd and Alexander are members of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP   and are Chairman and Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Children and Families       No child should be deprived of the chance to explore his or her creativity in a nurturing educational environment     said Dodd     Picking up a musical instrument  a paint brush  or a script can allow a child to discover a hidden talent and can serve as a much needed positive influence in the midst of the many difficult decisions that young people face today   I am hopeful that the GAO will act quickly to deliver findings about the current condition of arts education in American public schools so that we can seek to improve it during the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act            Added Alexander     Music Education is important   I had some great teachers  but my piano teacher  Miss Lennis Tedford was the best   From age five until my high school senior recital  I spent thirty minutes with her each week     Don  t play that monkey business    she would say  as she could always tell when I  d been playing too much Jerry Lee Lewis   From Miss Tedford I learned more than music   She taught me the discipline of Czerny and the metronome  the logic of Bach  the clean joy of Mozart   She encouraged me to let my emotions run with Chopin and Rachmaninoff   She made sure I was ready for the annual piano competition  and that I performed completely under control   I still thank her for the discipline and love of music she gave me each time I sit at the piano today         A companion resolution    introduced by Reps  Jim Cooper  D TN  and Jon Porter  R NV     passed the House of Representatives on April 26 by unanimous consent   The full text of the letter is below  and the resolution is attached   The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street N W   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Walker   We write to request the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on access to music and arts education in our public schools since passage of the No Child Left Behind Act  with a specific focus on any disparities in access between minority and low income students and their non minority  more affluent peers   The study should investigate evidence of the possible link between participation in music and arts education and increased student engagement  positive behavior  high school graduation rates and academic achievement for all students  as well as for minority and low income students and students with disabilities   As Congress moves toward reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  we continue to examine the goals of educating the whole child and the positive impact of rigorous instruction in all areas of the curriculum   These policy decisions are based on sound research and driven by systematic data collection relating to the condition of education  the practices that improve academic achievement  and the effectiveness of federal education programs  Of particular interest are the effects  since its implementation  of the No Child Left Behind Act on access to music and arts education in our nation s public schools     Specifically  we request the Government Accountability Office to design and implement a study that determines the following with regard to K 12 academic instruction in our public schools    1     Any changes in access to music and arts education since passage of the No Child Left Behind Act    2     Access to music and arts education for minority students relative to non minority students    3     Access to music and arts education for low income students relative to non low income students    4     Any disparities in access to music and arts education  since passage of the No Child Left Behind Act  between schools with high percentages of minority and low income students and students with disabilities and those schools with low percentages of such students    5     Any link between participation in music and arts education and increased student engagement  positive behavior  high school graduation and academic achievement for all students  as well as any such link for minority and low income students and students with disabilities    6     Descriptions of highly effective music and arts education programs that promote increased student engagement  positive behavior  high school graduation and academic achievement    7     Identification of any barriers actively imposed by Federal law  regulations  or guidance that prevent schools from engaging students in a rich curriculum that includes music and arts   Because consideration of the No Child Left Behind Act reauthorization has already begun  the need for this information is immediate   We request that you meet with representatives of our offices as soon as possible to discuss the proposed scope of this study  an appropriate methodology  and a timetable which would establish an interim reporting schedule and completion date   We look forward to hearing from you regarding this request and your availability to meet as soon as possible to set forth plans for receipt of this information which will provide relevant insights into the impact of No Child Left Behind on access to music and arts education  especially for those students who have the fewest opportunities and greatest need   Thank you for your assistance
