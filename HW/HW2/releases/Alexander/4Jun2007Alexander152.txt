Compensation for Sick Nuclear Workers           June 4th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  today in a letter urged Health and Human Service Secretary Michael Leavitt and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to fix budget shortfalls that are causing backlogs in a critical program to provide compensation for nuclear weapons workers facing illnesses   Tennessee has more than 23 000 health claims from more than 9 000 individual workers under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  The EEOICPA is responsible for identifying former nuclear weapons workers suffering from workplace related illnesses who are eligible for compensation     We have twice the number of claims than any other state  so this is very important to Tennessee     said Alexander    We have to be a leader on this  The EEOICPA was created to process these claims quickly and effectively  its time for it to fulfill that promise       Under the EEOICPA system nearly 7 000 Tennessee claims are still waiting for a final decision     We should be treating our cold war veterans at the Y 12 plant at Oak Ridge and other facilities with the same respect they have treated our country     Alexander said    In a second letter signed by 15 senators  Alexander requested that the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  to hold hearings on the administration of the EEOICPA by the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services     In 2000  Congress created EEOICPA to provide appropriate compensation and medical benefits to workers who contracted radiation induced cancers  beryllium diseases or silicosis during the course of their work for the Department of Energy or its contractors     Senator Alexander cosponsored legislation that became law in 2004 that transferred the responsibility of claims processing from the Department of Energy to the Department of Labor in order to enhance and speed up the processing of these claims     The letter to Leavitt and Chao    signed by 16 senators and the second to Chao from Alexander this year concerning EEOICPA    calls attention to serious funding shortfalls and continues to urge that these shortfalls be   quickly corrected      The letter to HELP Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Ranking Republican Mike Enzi  WY  requests congressional oversight and hearings into the problems of implementation of EEOICPA    Alexander is the lead Republican on both letters  Copies of both letters are below            June 4  2007   The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt   The Honorable Elaine L  Chao   Secretary                                                                    Secretary U S  Department of Health and   U S  Department of Labor Human Services    200 Constitution Avenue  N W  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  DC 20210 Washington  DC 20201     Dear Secretary Leavitt and Secretary Chao   We are writing to request that the Administration provide sufficient funding for Part B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  EEOICPA  in Fiscal Year 2007   It has come to our attention that critical components of EEOICPA face a serious funding shortfall and program offices have already taken steps to cut back on claims processing   In particular  we understand that the Office of Compensation Analysis and Support  OCAS  within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH     which conducts activities to assist claimants and support the role of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the EEOICPA Program    is not receiving the funds necessary to perform dose reconstruction activities and process Special Exposure Cohort petitions at full capacity  and it is our hope that your two Departments will work together to solve this problem   This news is extremely troubling to us   In establishing the EEOICPA program  Congress intended our Cold War Heroes and their families to be compensated as quickly as possible   Delays resulting from insufficient programmatic funding are unacceptable   The NIOSH funding shortfall must be quickly corrected   Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter        Sincerely   Lamar Alexander     Claire McCaskill   Sherrod Brown    Jeff Bingaman   Charles Schumer    Harry Reid   Bernard Sanders    Maria Cantwell   Barack Obama    George Voinovich   Richard Durbin    Barbara Boxer   Christopher Bond    Lindsey Graham   Bob Corker    Patty Murray    June 4  2007  The Honorable Edward M  Kennedy Chairman  Senate Committee on Health  Education   Labor and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington  DC 20510   The Honorable Michael B  Enzi Ranking Member Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions 379A Senate Russell Office Building Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi    We are writing to request that the Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions hold a hearing on the Administration  s implementation of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000  EEOICPA       Congress created EEOICPA to provide appropriate compensation and medical benefits to workers who contracted radiation induced cancers  beryllium diseases  or silicosis during the course of their work for the Department of Energy or its contractors   However  implementation of EEOICPA by the Department of Labor  DOL  and the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has come under significant scrutiny in recent months due to delays in processing cases  denial of a high percentage of workers   claims  and allegations that the Administration has limited payouts as a means of cutting costs   As a result  nuclear weapons workers with work related diseases in 20 states are not being compensated  although they have filed claims      EEOICPA was designed to fairly compensate sick energy workers   Where radiation dose cannot be estimated due to the government  s inability to maintain or create records of workers   radiation exposure levels  EEOICPA allows workers with cancer to petition to receive   special exposure cohort     SEC  status and secure compensation  without dose reconstruction  if their cancer is among a list of cancers specified within the original law   Energy workers from at least 13 sites from 11 states  representing thousands of workers  have petitions for SEC status pending   The Department of Health and Human Services has been slow to consider petitions and places high burdens on petitioners seeking to be added to the SEC      A front page story from the May 12  2007 Washington Post highlighted these problems   We have enclosed a copy of this article for your reference   We strongly urge the Committee to hold a hearing on the implementation of EEOICPA during this legislative session and we offer our support in finding solutions to the problems identified above       Sincerely   Sherrod Brown     Lamar Alexander   Harry Reid      Charles Schumer   Bernard Sanders     Maria Cantwell   Claire McCaskill     Barack Obama   George Voinovich     Richard Durbin   Hillary Rodham
