                                                                                                                   Senators Salazar   Alexander to Introduce Bipartisan Iraq Study Group Implementation Bill as   New Way Forward           May 10th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    United States Senators Ken Salazar  D CO  and Lamar Alexander  R TN  announced their plan today to introduce legislation in the coming weeks titled the    Iraq Study Group  ISG  Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007     The bill would make the ISG recommendations the basis for future U S  strategy in Iraq and will be introduced in the coming weeks    Senators Salazar and Alexander also sent a   Dear Colleague   letter to Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to gather support for the proposed bill   A copy of the letter is available by clicking here   The ISG was created in March of 2006 at the request of a bipartisan group of members of Congress and was co chaired by former Secretary of State James A  Baker  III and former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Lee H  Hamilton   The ISG released their recommendations in December of 2006 that built a bipartisan approach to bring a responsible conclusion to the Iraq war   Specifically the bill sets a   new way forward   by establishing as United States policy                A new diplomatic offensive in the region that includes the creation of the Iraq International Support Group                Giving the highest priority to training  equipping and advising the Iraqi military and security forces                 Assessing the full budgetary and personnel impact of the war in Iraq on the United States Military                Accelerating and increasing oil production and accountability including equitable distribution of oil revenues in Iraq                Implementing and oversight of economic reconstruction programs in Iraq with the creation of a new Senior Advisor for Economic Reconstruction                Ensuring that the President includes the cost of the war in his annual budget request  and               Setting conditions that could lead to redeployment of United States combat brigades not needed for force protection as early as the first quarter of 2008 if diplomatic  infrastructure and security benchmarks are met       I believe that the work of the Iraq Study Group is a model for how Congress and our Nation can come together in good faith to develop a new way forward in Iraq     said Senator Salazar     Their recommendations provide a roadmap for transitioning our troops from a combat role to a support role  for how we can continue to strengthen and support our own military and for specific milestones the Government of Iraq needs to meet   At the end of the day the Iraqi people are ultimately responsible for their future  this bill that implements their recommendations ensures we have a plan to help them        We owe it to our country and our troops to find a bipartisan consensus to support where we go from here     said Alexander     We need a political solution in Washington  DC  as much as we need one in Baghdad   And we need to get out of the combat business and into the support and training business as soon as we honorably can   I have spoken to Secretary Baker and Congressman Hamilton  and they have confirmed this legislation accurately reflects the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group report      Regarding the proposed legislation  Iraq Study Group co chair  Mr  Lee Hamilton said   Any U S  effort in Iraq will fail without unity of effort between our political parties  and between the President and the Congress  The Iraq Study Group forged a bipartisan consensus behind a comprehensive political  economic and military way forward in Iraq which allows for a responsible transition of U S  forces out of Iraq  I commend this effort to embrace the spirit and substance of the Study Group Report  and for seeking the bipartisan unity of effort that this country needs to move forward responsibly     Last week President Bush  at the Associated General Contractors of America Convention  said the United States should   seriously consider the recommendations of the ISG   I m asked all the time about strategies  I liked what James A  Baker and Lee Hamilton reported back after a serious investigation of Iraq  I liked their ideas  And it s something that we should seriously consider  And their idea was  is that at some point in time  it makes sense to have a U S  presence configured this way  embedded with Iraqi forces  training Iraqi forces  over the horizon presence to provide enough security to know that people will have help if they need it  but put the    more onus on a sovereign government of Iraq  a presence to keep the territorial integrity of Iraq intact  a special ops presence to go after these killers who have got their intentions on America  It s an interesting idea
