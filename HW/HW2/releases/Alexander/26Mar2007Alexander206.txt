Urges Colleagues to Move On to Iraq  Terrorism  Health Costs        March 26th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander today urged his colleagues to put aside   excessive partisanship   in the controversy over the recent firing of eight U S  Attorneys  and move forward on to more pressing issues facing the nation   He cited his personal experience with state and federal attorneys who put principle above politics in his early swearing in as governor of Tennessee               Alexander  s statement  as prepared for delivery on the Senate floor  is below               Mr  President  my late friend Alex Haley  the author of Roots  lived his life by six words     Find the Good and Praise It      I thought of those six words in connection with the current discussion about the firing of eight United States Attorneys               The Democrats are making political hay out of these firings at a time when the Senate should be focused on Iraq  terrorism  health care costs  excessive federal spending  energy independence and keeping our brainpower advantage so we can keep our good jobs here instead of seeing them move overseas                U S  Attorneys have always been political appointees serving at the pleasure of the president   President Clinton fired them all on his first day in office   Such partisanship is nothing new   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell recently said that the custom once was for U S  attorneys simply to vacate their offices on the day a new president was inaugurated  knowing that new political appointees would soon arrive to take their desks               In the summer of 1963  in between my first and second year at New York University Law School  I worked in Attorney General Robert Kennedy s office as an intern   I was so impressed that  after graduation  I drove to Chattanooga to apply for a job as an Assistant U S  Attorney   The interview went fine until the U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee asked about my politics                    I m a Republican     I said                Sorry     he said    We only hire Democrats                    But the Attorney General said the administration of justice was non partisan     I replied                That word hasn t gotten down here     the U S  Attorney said               Yet the historic political nature of these appointments is no excuse for the excessive partisanship  amateurishness and bumbling exhibited by the firing of these eight U S  Attorneys in the  middle of the president s term   The best way to put in relief what is wrong with these firings is to remember Alex Haley s admonition    Find the Good and Praise It     and point to an example of how political appointees can by their courageous action earn respect for the administration of justice               I have a personal interest in the example I offer   Nearly thirty years ago    on January 17  1979    I was sworn into office three days early as governor of Tennessee in order to prevent the incumbent governor from issuing 52 pardons and commutations to prisoners the FBI believed had paid cash for their release               The U S  Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee  Hal Hardin    a Democrat appointed by President Carter    telephoned to ask me to take office early   Hardin was working with the state attorney general  William Leech  another Democrat  to arrange the unprecedented early swearing in   Because Hardin and Leech were able to rise above partisanship  the Speakers of the Senate and House and Chief Justice as well as the Secretary of State    also all Democrats    participated in my early swearing in and the ouster of a Democratic incumbent governor               As it turned out  I was the only Republican in the group               As then Speaker of the House and later governor Ned McWherter said    We are Tennesseans first      The story of January 17  1979 was recently retold by Judge William C  Koch  a member of the Tennessee Court of Appeals  in the March 2007 issue of the Nashville Bar Journal   Judge Koch was on the staff of the state attorney general at that time and later was counsel when I was governor               In the spirit of   Find the Good and Praise It     I offer for the record Judge Koch s article as an example of how our system of political appointment of U S   Attorneys can and should operate  in contrast to the example of the eight firings and the response to those firings we are discussing today   The article referenced above can be found at http   www nashbar org NBJ
