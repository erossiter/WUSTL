                                                                                                                   Alexander  Lieberman Introduce Bill To Improve U S    China Relations         May 26th  2005   WASHINGTON    With the United States at the threshold of a new era in foreign policy  with the People  s Republic of China emerging as a major economic and military superpower  U S  Sens      Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Joe Lieberman  D CT   have introduced the United States China Cultural Engagement Act as a step to improve relations between the two nations      Senator Alexander and I are convinced that this investment will have big payoffs by smoothing the exchange of commerce and culture between our great nations and reducing misunderstandings into the future     Lieberman said        The rise of China comes with a whole set of challenges  But the ability to talk to and understand each other should not be among them      Providing our children with the opportunity to understand the Chinese language and culture will help ensure they have a better chance of succeeding in the global economy       There will be challenges in the United States   relationship with China as it grows and we seek to maintain our position in the world and our standard of living   said Alexander during a news conference on Capitol Hill   But it  s my hope that the United States will spend some of our time and money getting to know China better  and that Chinese citizens will spend time getting to know us  History has shown that the modest dollars we  ve spent on education programs have done far more good than hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid  We can argue  we can send diplomats  we can build up our defenses  we can assert our position  we can spend money on foreign aid  but we all know there  s only one thing that  s worked best and that is when we get to know each other better  I appreciate Senator Lieberman  s leadership and am delighted to join him in this important and far seeing undertaking    The legislation authorizes  1 3 billion in federal funds over five years to provide for Chinese language instruction in American schools  increase American consular activity supporting American commercial activity in China and provide for physical and virtual exchanges among a broad spectrum of individuals in the two nations   Lieberman and Alexander
