Tennessee Study  Toxin Tends to Settle Near Coal Fired Power Plants        May 29th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  today urged Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen to establish state rules that exceed federal rules curtailing mercury pollution in Tennessee from coal fired power plants     The more I learn  the more strongly I feel that the State of Tennessee should establish a stricter rule than the federal government  s limit on the amount of mercury coal fired power plants can emit     Alexander stated in a letter to the Governor released today    There is good reason to believe that significant levels of mercury are being deposited in the Smokies and surrounding areas because they are downwind of coal fired power plants        Alexander said a recent study in Ohio showed that mercury emitted from a power plant stack   hits and sticks    within a relatively short distance     Grocery stores in America now post warnings from the Food and Drug Administration stating women of child bearing age and children should not eat certain types of fish because of potential high levels of mercury     Alexander said   Sen  Alexander  said state action is necessary because the  national mercury rule    requiring coal fired power plants to get rid of 70 percent mercury emissions by 2018 does not go far enough and legislation he has introduced with Connecticut Sen  Joe Lieberman     to remove 90 per cent of mercury emissions  by 2015 has not yet been enacted   Alexander  s letter is a follow up to a letter he sent to the governor last fall commending his efforts to examine the impact mercury emissions may be having in and around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park    In his letter  Alexander praised the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation  the EPA  the National Park Service  TVA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory for studying the source and levels of mercury deposits in the Smokies   Alexander sits on the Senate  s Environment and Public Works committee and is a co chair of the Congressional TVA Caucus     May 29  2007  The Honorable Phil Bredesen Governor State of Tennessee 7th and Charlotte Avenues Nashville  TN   37243  Dear Phil   Last November  I wrote to commend your efforts to examine the impact mercury emitted from coal fired power plants may be having in and around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park   I am writing again to reiterate that the more I learn  the more strongly I feel that the State of Tennessee should establish a stricter rule than the federal government  s limit on the amount of mercury coal fired power plants can emit   There is good reason to believe that significant levels of mercury are being deposited in the Smokies and surrounding areas because they are downwind of coal fired power plants   That is why I have introduced legislation that would require coal fired power plants to reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2015  but that legislation is not yet federal law   The mercury rule issued by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  would require coal fired power plants to get rid of 70 percent of the mercury they emit by the year 2018   This mercury rule is the first time the federal government has ever limited mercury from coal fired power plants and is a good start   But it is not enough   Grocery stores in America now post warnings from the Food and Drug Administration stating that women of child bearing age and children should not eat certain types of fish because of potential high levels of mercury     I am glad to learn that Tennessee  s Department of Environment and Conservation is working with EPA  the National Park Service  TVA  Oak Ridge National Laboratory  and conservation groups to study how much mercury is being deposited in the Smokies and from where it is coming   I understand that Dr  James Weiner of the University of Wisconsin  an expert on the effects of mercury on wildlife  and Dr  Gerald Keeler of the University of Michigan  an expert on mercury deposition and its sources  have been asked to design the study   Recently  I met with Dr  Keeler in my Washington office   He explained the results from his three year study of mercury deposition in Steubenville  Ohio   His study shows that more than 70 percent of the mercury found at the study site comes from nearby coal fired power plants   His research demonstrates that mercury emitted from a power plant stack   hits and sticks    within a relatively short distance of the power plant   Dr  Keeler advised that  based on the Steubenville results  significant deposits of mercury in the Smokies and the surrounding areas are likely because they are downwind of coal fired power plants   The people and natural resources of Tennessee are facing a significant problem from coal fired power plant mercury emissions  and the federal mercury rule is inadequate to address that problem   I commend you for the steps you have taken so far and encourage you to initiate the study     Sincerely     Lamar Alexander U S  Senator
