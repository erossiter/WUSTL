October 30th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Bob Corker  R TN  today praised the announcement by NuStart Energy    the nation  s largest consortium of nuclear energy companies and TVA    the nation  s largest public power utility    that they have filed an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license that would allow for the future construction and operation of an advanced reactor design      Climate change may be an inconvenient truth     Alexander said     A second inconvenient truth is that  if we want to deal with climate change in this generation  conservation and nuclear power are the only real alternatives   Nuclear power today produces 70 percent of our nation  s carbon free electricity        I am very proud of the role Tennessee and TVA are playing within the nuclear industry to make our country more energy secure     Corker said     The volatility of other energy resources and increased concern over carbon dioxide emissions creates a tremendous opportunity for greater focus and development of nuclear power      Senator Alexander is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Co Chairman of the TVA Caucus   Senator Corker is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee        NUSTART   TVA SUBMIT   FORWARD LOOKING    REFERENCE APPLICATION Washington D C     October 30  2007    NuStart Energy  the nation  s largest consortium of nuclear energy companies  and TVA  the nation  s largest public power utility  today submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license that would allow for the future construction and operation of an advanced reactor design that is also being considered by other utilities in the U S  The material submitted to the NRC will serve as the reference combined Construction and Operating License  COL  application for a Westinghouse dual unit AP1000     design at TVA  s Bellefonte site in northern Alabama   As a result of the industry  s commitment to plant standardization  most of the content of the application can be used by other nuclear utilities planning to use the AP1000 technology to develop their own site specific license applications more efficiently  In addition to the TVA COL application  NuStart is working with Dominion on developing the reference application for the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy  GEH  Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor  ESBWR    Dominion will be submitting later this year  the reference ESBWR application for a single unit at its North Anna Power Station site in Louisa County  Virginia    The Department of Energy s NP2010 initiative has paved the way for the industry to work together as never before to develop technical  regulatory  and other opportunities that can renew nuclear energy in the United States   said NuStart President Marilyn Kray     NuStart has been at the forefront of these efforts and prominent in establishing standardized license applications using the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  s design centered review approach        Submittal of this application is the next key step in the process     said TVA Chief Operating Officer Bill McCollum     The NRC  s thorough and comprehensive review will help build certainty into the regulatory schedule for this and future applications   That will help minimize regulatory and financial risks if TVA and other utilities decide to pursue construction      Currently  four other utilities  which are also members of NuStart and helped prepare the Bellefonte application  have selected the Westinghouse AP1000 design and have informed the NRC that they plan to reference the TVA application in their own COL applications during the coming year   Similarly  Dominion  s North Anna reference application for the ESBWR will be used by Entergy in the development of two proposed COL applications for its Grand Gulf and River Bend sites   These applications are expected to be submitted in the first and second quarters of 2008  respectively   The reference applications have been developed using a design centered review concept that focuses the industry  s engineering and technical expertise on the specific reactor design that utilities are pursuing  The design centered working group for the Westinghouse AP1000 is comprised of TVA  Progress Energy  Duke Energy  Southern Co   South Carolina Electric and Gas  and Westinghouse  each of these companies is a member of the NuStart consortium   GEH  s ESBWR design centered working group includes Dominion  Entergy  and GEH  The TVA reference COL application consists of 7 000 pages and required more than 100 000 work hours over a two year period   The application was completed on schedule and according to the budget allocated for the work   In addition  the Westinghouse design team has expended over one million engineering work hours since 2004 to develop the standardized design information that is referenced in the TVA COL application  While today  s submittal of the Bellefonte application is an important milestone  it marks the midway point in the overall objectives of NuStart and the Nuclear Power 2010 Program   NuStart acknowledges the significant workload ahead for the NRC staff as it begins to review the first wave of applications submitted under the revised licensing process   The regulatory review schedule for the Bellefonte application will be established by the NRC and will include many opportunities for public involvement  more  Members of NuStart Energy consortium are

Say About the Application for Bellefonte License   Nuclear energy is clean  safe  and efficient  and it is important that we tap into this source of power to help meet the growing energy needs of our country   Last month we celebrated the first application for a nuclear power plant in close to thirty years  and I am pleased to now be celebrating another   If America wishes to get serious about reducing carbon emissions  then we must increase the use of nuclear energy    U S  Sen  Pete Domenici of New Mexico   I am pleased that NuStart and TVA are moving forward with this historic license application   The NuStart consortium saw three big plusses for choosing the Bellefonte site in Alabama    TVA  an attractive pre existing site  and a community that welcomes a future with nuclear energy   As a nation  we must commit ourselves to a greater usage of nuclear power  our best source of clean  reliable and safe energy   Applying for a new nuclear license puts TVA in a leadership position within the nuclear industry  and we  re proud that Alabama may be home to one of the first new plants in decades    U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions of Alabama   Climate change may be an inconvenient truth   A second inconvenient truth is that  if we want to deal with climate change in this generation  conservation and nuclear power are the only real alternatives   Nuclear power today produces 70 percent of our nation  s carbon free electricity    U S  Sen  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee   I applaud NuStart  s and TVA  s decision to formally apply for a Combined Operating License for the Bellefonte Nuclear Facility   I have worked with Jackson County and TVA officials for years to complete Bellefonte   This is a major move in the right direction for North Alabama to utilize the next generation of nuclear power technology    U S  Rep  Bud Cramer of Alabama   What Members of Congress Say About the Application for Bellefonte License   I am proud to see that Alabama is a leader in the effort to diversify our energy resources through the expansion of nuclear power  I believe that nuclear power is safe and environmentally sound and should continue to be part of a long term energy plan for Alabama and the nation    U S  Sen  Richard Shelby of Alabama   I am very proud of the role Tennessee and TVA are playing within the nuclear industry to make our country more energy secure   The volatility of other energy resources and increased concern over carbon dioxide emissions creates a tremendous opportunity for greater focus and development of nuclear power    U S  Sen  Bob Corker of Tennessee   Nuclear power production is an essential component to help meet our country s future energy demands while reducing our fossil fuel use   The rebirth of nuclear power may be our best approach to climate change because it produces zero carbon emissions  and TVA is leading this effort    U S  Rep  Zach Wamp of Tennessee   The United States must aggressively pursue a comprehensive  long term energy policy that protects our environment  lowers prices and promotes energy security   Nuclear power must be part of that solution   The Tennessee Valley Authority continues its commitment to find the best way to meet growing customer energy demands   Increasing our ability to generate nuclear power is a critical step to providing affordable base load power that Tennessee s growing economy requires    U S  Rep  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee
