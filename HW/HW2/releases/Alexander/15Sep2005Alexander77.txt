                                                                                                                   Alexander Praises Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act         September 15th  2005   Washington  D C     U S  Sen  Lamar Alexander  R TN   original cosponsor of the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act  S 1369   praised the bill and its sponsors Sen  Jim Talent  R MO  and Christopher Dodd  D CT  on the Senate floor Wednesday evening after the bill was added by voice vote as an amendment to H R  2862  the Commerce Justice Science Appropriations Bill     The bipartisan legislation creates the Unsolved Crimes Section within the Civil Rights Division of the U S  Department of Justice to focus specifically on unsolved Civil Rights era murders  The Unsolved Crimes Section will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting pre 1970 cases that resulted in death and still remain unsolved in coordination with state and local law enforcement officials    The Commerce Justice Science Appropriations Bill is expected to pass the Senate today   In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday evening  Alexander said      Mr  President  I am here this afternoon to salute Senator Jim Talent from Missouri for his tireless work on this piece of legislation and to applaud also Senator Christopher Dodd from Connecticut who has been a leader for civil rights legislation in this country for a long time   I thank them both not only for their initiative  for thinking of this  but also for pushing it and being persistent about it   I can remember when the senator from Missouri came to me on the floor months ago talking about it   I thank them both for giving me a chance to be an original cosponsor and for their hard work on shepherding it through the Senate in this way       The senator from Connecticut pointed out that it has not been that long since these crimes have happened  In my lifetime  it has not been that long   I was a student in the South in the 1950s   I was a college student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville when it was still segregated   I helped to try to desegregate it     successfully   In that same year  in the early 1960s  Congressman John Lewis was trying to sit in  He could not get a seat for lunch   In that same year  the judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans for whom I worked a few years later  Judge John Minor Wisdom  had ordered Ole Miss to admit James Meredith       In those years  when African American families drove through Nashville  if they were sick  they could not be admitted to many of the hospitals  if they needed a place to sleep  they could not be admitted to many of the motels  if they needed a place to eat  they could not go to many of the restaurants   That was the life then   That was not that long ago   Many families throughout the South  as well as other parts of the country  but throughout the South  lived in fear because of that climate      The Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act will help heal some of the scars that have been left on our society in the wake of the civil rights struggle       This past June  shortly after Edgar Ray Killen was convicted for the 41 year old murder of three civil rights workers  the Nashville City Paper ran an editorial that summed up why resolution of these cases is so important  and why this legislation by Senator Talent and Senator Dodd is so important   The editorial concluded    As long as Civil Rights era killers are still alive and free  justice has not yet been fully served   Hunting them down and bringing them to account for their actions is far and away the best apology any of us can make for their crimes       This is not leadership by lament   This is leadership by action   I commend the Senate for taking such positive steps toward recognizing and rectifying these injustices       This action is a reflection of one of those aspects of our nation s character that distinguishes us in the world   We dedicate ourselves to high ideals   We have since our very beginning   Sometimes we have failed to live up to those ideals   But when we do  we have most often recommitted ourselves and taken action to correct our shortcomings   Therefore  we abolished slavery   Therefore  we granted women the right to vote  even though it was after many years   Therefore  we desegregated our schools   Today we shall add to that litany that we have taken steps to bring to justice criminals of the civil rights era   Justice delayed is justice denied   Today we see to it that justice will be delayed no longer       I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation  and I look forward to the day when this new office opens its doors in the Department of Justice
