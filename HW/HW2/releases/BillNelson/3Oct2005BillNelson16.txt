LADY LAKE - U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson wants the federal government to give seniors more time to be able to enroll in the new prescription drug benefit plan.  
Nelson said legislation is needed because the new plan is confusing many seniors, and if they donât sign up by May theyâll pay substantially higher premiums if they later decide to join the program.  
âWe have to make sure seniors are not forced into making a detrimental or hasty decision that they may later regret,â said Nelson.  
Nelson said heâll introduce legislation, with a number of other senators, to extend the time seniors have to enroll in the plan by six months. The proposal will be filed after the Senate finishes its work on measures aimed at rebuilding the Gulf Coast after Katrina and Rita.  
Nelson also said his bill is needed because many seniors who were displaced by the hurricanes donât have permanent addresses and arenât able to receive the materials needed to enroll in the program.
