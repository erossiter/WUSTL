â This is a victory Senator [ Mel ] Martinez and I, and a bipartisan group of Florida members in the House, have fought hard for.  Itâs a victory for the little guy over big oil companies.  Itâs a victory for those in Congress who wish to see our country pursue an energy policy of developing synthetic and alternative fuels that will make us independent of foreign oil.  And itâs a victory for those who want to protect our nationâs coastal environments, and Floridaâs tourism-based economy, from ruination caused by oil drilling. â?
