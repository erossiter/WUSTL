Payday loan provision clears last big hurdle

WASHINGTON, D.C. â A Pentagon-sought provision that will crack down on unscrupulous lenders who rip off military borrowers will soon become law after receiving approval from House and Senate negotiators.  The payday loan measure â authored by U.S. Senators Bill Nelson and Jim Talent and included in a broader bill to authorize military spending â emerged from conference committee today and, thus, is expected to easily clear both chambers of Congress later today.    
Talent, a Republican from Missouri, and Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, crafted the bipartisan provision that changes federal law to better protect service members, including a proposed 36 percent cap on interest rates for loans to service members and their immediate families.    
Their provision came shortly before a Pentagon report that found financial naivetÃ© and regular paychecks made young enlisted troops perfect targets for a growing industry of lenders who bet that high-interest, short-term loans cannot easily be repaid.  The report â required by legislation Nelson pushed last year â stated that these predatory lending practices are currently hurting troop-readiness.    
âThis will help prevent many young men and women from becoming victims of huge interest rates and unmanageable debt,â? Nelson said after the provision emerged from conference committee fully intact.   Among the additional financial protections Nelson secured during conference committee is language to strengthen borrowersâ rights and toughen loan disclosure requirements.  
Various military and consumer groups had called for the passage of this 36 percent interest-rate cap on payday loans for military personnel, including the Military Coalition, the Military Officers Association of America and the Consumer Federation of America.  
After receiving approval from the conference committee, final approval by the House and Senate is normally considered a formality.  The House and Senate are expected to vote later today.
