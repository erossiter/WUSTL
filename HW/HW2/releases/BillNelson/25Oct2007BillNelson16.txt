WASHINGTON, D.C.  Two lawmakers on a key Senate aviation panel called on NASA to provide information that could shed light on the safety of traveling on commercial airplanes.   In a joint letter sent Tuesday to NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, Sens. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) wrote, Safety data developed at taxpayer expense is not being freely communicated to those who would benefit from such dataand an aviation safety program was cancelled before completion after initial results appeared unfavorable to the aviation industry.    The Senators letter was prompted by reports that NASA is in possession of data from a multi-year survey of roughly 24,000 commercial and private pilots and has refused to release the survey results to the public. Nelson and Lautenberg are members of the Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee.
