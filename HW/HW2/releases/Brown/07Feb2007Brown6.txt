            Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing On Predatory Lending                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing On Predatory Lending February 7  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Preserving the American Dream  Predatory Lending Practices and Home Foreclosures Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling todays hearing  We continue to hear from some quarters about how wonderful the economy is performing  but it is hard to square this view with what is happening in the housing market in Ohio  Our state is faced with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country  and cities like  are being particularly hard hit  Instead of living out the American Dream  thousands of Ohioans are facing a housing nightmare There is no question that some of this problem stems from the loss of jobs or other reasons external to the home lending industry  But in far too many cases  homeowners have been lured into loans they had no business taking out  Over the past decade  foreclosure filings have increased almost fourfold in Ohio  And in one Ohio survey  two thirds of county sheriff departments cited predatory lending as the top contributor to foreclosures   The result is that in 2005  there was one foreclosure filing for every 71 Ohio households  It is not hard to see how this can happen  A homeowner might take out only one or two mortgages in his or her life  Doing so is an unfamiliar and daunting process  It is only natural to rely on somebody who deals with mortgage products every day and seems to have the borrowers interests at heart But the unscrupulous actors have only their own interests at heart  We need to provide greater protections for consumers  who may not be sophisticated about the proliferation of mortgage products and the many tricks that can be used to disguise the true cost of a mortgage  We need to act to ensure not just full disclosure  but ethical behavior on the part of all the participants in the lending process For the vast majority of mortgage brokers and lenders  enacting common sense consumer protections will not have much impact on the way they go about their business  No longer will they lose customers to competitors whose deals really are too good to be true  And no longer will the dreams of Ohioans and homeowners across the country fall victim to the fine print  Thank you Mr  Chairman
