            Brown Urges Full Compensation For Nuclear Workers From Fernland And Mound Plants In Ohio                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Urges Full Compensation For Nuclear Workers From Fernland And Mound Plants In Ohio  January 9  2008  Washington  DC  As the Federal Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health holds hearings this week  U S    D OH  called for full compensation for former nuclear workers at the Fernald and Mound Plants in southwest Ohio  The cold war heroes are petitioning for federal compensation through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000  EEOICPA   Former nuclear workers should not have to scale a mountain of red tape or prove the un provable before receiving assistance  Brown said  Many former nuclear workers became dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait another day for help Work in nuclear facilities during the Cold War often required handling poisonous and radioactive materials and as a result workers were sometimes unknowingly exposed to dangerous levels of toxins  In Hamilton and Butler Counties  Fernald produced uranium for nuclear weapons  In Miamisburg  the Mound Laboratory was a top secret research center involved in the processing of polonium and plutonium  In letters to be read at this weeks hearings  Brown wrote  The lack of information about their exposure is especially troublesome as  under EEOICPA  it is the claimants responsibility to demonstrate exposure levels and prove the relationship between exposure and illness For many employees  the exact exposure amount is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to determine  and so they cannot obtain benefits  Special Exposure Cohorts  SECs  were created so that workers and their survivors would not be denied benefits due to incomplete information  Because much of the necessary Cold War era information is imprecise  inaccurate  or simply nonexistent  the former employees of Fernald and Mound Plant should be granted SEC status The EEOICPA has come under scrutiny due to delays in processing cases  its denial of a high percentage of workers claims  and allegations that the Bush administration has improperly acted to limit payouts  In December of 2006  the Office of Management and Budget produced a memo outlining steps to reduce benefit payments under the program  including making it harder for employees to receive SEC status  Eight years after enactment of the EEIOCPA  the vast majority of cases has been either denied or awaits a determination  Nuclear weapons workers in 20 states have not received compensation  even though their claims have been filed At Browns request  the Senates Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee held a hearing last fall on the effectiveness of the EEOICPA  Throughout the hearing  both claimants and program administrators noted how the lack of available information prevents full and accurate dose reconstructions  Shortly after the hearing  the Government Accountability Office released a report which cited unavailable or incomplete radiation monitoring records as a reason for increased program costs During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled highly radioactive materials and helped create the nuclear arsenal that served to deter the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer or died  The EEOICPA was created by Congress in 2000 to compensate workers sickened as a result of their service in radiation facilities directly managed or financed by the federal government  This law was designed to compel the government to find the fastest  most humane way to speed compensation to victims  Where radiation dose could not be estimated due to the governments failure to maintain or create records of workers radiation exposure levels  EEOICPA allows workers with cancer to petition to receive SEC status and secure compensation without dose reconstruction  Energy workers from at least 13 sites from 11 states  representing thousands of workers  have pending petitions for SEC status
