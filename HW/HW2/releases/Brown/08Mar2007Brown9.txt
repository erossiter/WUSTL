            Statement of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs March 8  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Joint Hearing of the Committees on Veterans Affairs with presentations from the Paralyzed Veterans of America  Jewish War Veterans  and Blinded Veterans AssociationsThank you  Mr  Chairman  I want to thank all the members of the groups here today  Your work on behalf of Americas veterans provides an invaluable service to the men and women who served our great country  Thank you  In 1992  the State of Ohio began the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame  Today there are over 890 veterans in the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame and they are as diverse as the groups here today  Members of the Hall of Fame include John Glenn  Neil Armstrong  Clark Gable  Paul Newman  the great baseball pitcher Bob Feller  employment and civil rights activist Harry Meschel and six U S  Presidents  Other members include Alex Boudreaux of the Army Air Corps  who later became the first African American Air Traffic Controller with the Civil Aeronautics Administration  and numerous Congressional Medal of Honor Awardees like John Fox  who earned the Medal of Honor in Italy in 1944  The diverse group of heroes at this hearing today highlights what is right about America and why we must ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs does everything it can to honor its commitments to the ones who we owe so much  I want to make it very clear that taking care of our veterans is a part of the cost of war  The president just asked for an additional  100 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  Why wont he ask for a few more dollars to make sure that our warriors and national heroes are taken care of when they return home I know there are many different opinions and perspectives in this room regarding our current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  My views on the wars and on President Bushs escalation have been very clear from the start  While some of you may disagree with me on the war itself  we are all in agreement that we must be prepared to care for the increasing numbers of servicemen and servicewomen coming home who will need our help for a very long time  Before we send more troops off to war  we must be prepared to protect the ones that are currently there as well as provide for the ones coming home injured and disabled We are sending troops to war that are not provided with the proper body armor  These same men and women are traveling around in combat vehicles that are not adequately equipped to handle the IEDs and RPGs and EFPs  The results of this policy will impact an entire generation of veterans and their families  The costs associated with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  as well as the more traditional injuries and scars associated with war  must be included in our accounting for the costs of the current war  We will be paying for  and caring for  the soldiers from action in Iraq and Afghanistan well into the middle of this century   And  while the VA has some of the best health care in the world  we know we can do better  Walter Reed Medical Center was caught off guard by the influx of war wounded heroes and we all saw the results of its poor planning and misallocation of resources in providing for these returning servicemen and servicewomen  Walter Reed is a military hospital and many of its patients will eventually end up in the VA system  We must ensure that the VA is prepared to handle the current surge of troops coming home wounded  There can be no more Walter Reeds We must work for assured funding of the VA  We cannot have delays in planning and programs in VA facilities across the nation  because the folks in Washington cannot get the money to them in adequate amounts and in a timely fashion  Whether this is greater diligence in the appropriations and budgeting process or whether it is a form of mandatory funding  something must be done  Delays set back programming and planning as well as increase costs on the VA that are eventually passed on to the American taxpayer Lastly  the presidents plan for increased fees and co pays is a non starter  We have asked enough of our veterans  We do not need to nickel and dime them  I am appalled that the president would try to tax veterans in order to meet his own budget priorities  many of which are tax cuts for the wealthy  Lets honor our pledge to provide and care for the men and women who have served this country  It is our duty to make sure they are provided with the care they have earned and deserve  Thank you Mr  Chairman
