            Brown  USW Launch  Stop Toxic Imports  Campaign To Protect Kids                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown  USW Launch  Stop Toxic Imports  Campaign To Protect Kids  September 26  2007  Washington  DC  In response to the recent influx of contaminated imports  U S    D OH  today joined with the United Steelworkers  USW  to launch a new Stop Toxic Imports campaign to raise public awareness and protect families from contaminated imports Recent news reports of tainted foods and toxic toys reveal another hazard of ill conceived and un enforced trade rules  Brown said  They subject American families to products that can harm them  Our trade policy should prevent these problems  not invite them   Part of the effort will include distribution of lead screening kits to parents throughout the county  Coalition partners in the campaign include the Public Health Institute and the Center for Environmental Health  Brown was joined today by USW President Leo W  Gerard  Marilyn Furer  a Chicago grandmother who found lead in her grandchildrens bibs  Executive Director for the Blue Green Alliance David Foster  and Founder of the Public Health Institute Les Leopold Tainted imports from China and other countries have  in recent months  led to the recall of hundreds of thousands of toys  tires  food products  and pet food products  Last year the U S  imported more than  288 billion in Chinese goods  and this year that number is expected to top  300 billion  Brown noted that while China is at the forefront of import concerns  U S  trade policy is to blame Despite the real and present danger from Chinese imports  we must not focus solely on import safety and consumer threats from China  The real threat is our failed trade policy that allows recall after recall  The real threat is our failure to change course and craft a new trade policy  The real threat is this administrations insistence on more of the same  Brown said Congress is currently debating proposed free trade agreements with Peru  Panama  Colombia  and South Korea based largely on the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  model  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  inspectors have rejected seafood imports from Peru and Panama  major seafood suppliers to the U S  However  the current trade agreements  as written  limit food safety standards and border inspections and would force the U S  to rely on foreign inspectors to ensure our safety Brown asserted that more job killing trade agreements with unreliable standards would continue to increase toxic imports into the U S  He emphasized that U S  trade rules attract toxic imports  repel good paying jobs  and encourage the exploitation of workers throughout the world It is time for a new direction in our nations trade policy  It is time for a trade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen tables and toys in our childrens bedrooms  We must protect the safety and health of our families  Brown added Brown introduced legislation today that would make country of origin labeling  COOL  mandatory for processed foods   The bill would give the Secretary of Agriculture one year from enactment to implement regulations to apply the provision to processed foods  This would be an expansion of provisions in the 2002 Farm bill that established country of origin labeling for fruits  vegetables  meat  and seafood  After repeated statutory and regulatory delays  the new labeling requirements are scheduled to go into effect in September  2008 Today  Brown also joined with a group of bipartisan Senators to urge Senator Tom Harkin to include compromise language on COOL in the farm bill in the Agriculture Committee  The compromise language establishes three labeling options for meat  including beef  lamb  pork  and goat  It would clear the way for a common sense and long awaited implementation of COOL which would benefit Ohios livestock producers  Brown is the first Ohio Senator to serve on the Agriculture Committee in 40 years Last week  Brown introduced the Food and Product Responsibility Act of 2007  with Senator Bob Casey  D PA   which would require U S  Customs and Border Protection to develop a program to ensure distributors are able to cover the costs associated with both product recalls and all personal and property damages  In addition  it would grant the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to require recalls of meat  poultry  and egg products and the FDA the authority to require recalls for fruits  vegetables  and other products it regulates In July  Brown and Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced the Imported Food Security Act of 2007  which would mandate that foreign imports meet the same or better standards as those of the U S  and give the FDA the authority to approve and disapprove countries eligible to import
