            Senate Passes Stupak Brown Amendment To Help Bring Fallen Troops Home                                                                                                                               Press Release    Senate Passes Stupak Brown Amendment To Help Bring Fallen Troops Home  October 1  2007  WASHINGTON  U S    D OH  and Congressman Bart Stupak  D Menominee  announced that the Fallen Service Member Respectful Return Amendment has been included in the Senate Department of Defense Reauthorization Bill  which passed the Senate today  The amendment would require the Department of Defense  DoD  to deliver the remains of fallen military personnel to the military or civilian airport nearest to the final destination chosen by the family  When our soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country  it is unthinkable to inflict more needless emotional  financial  and physical hardship on these families  said Senator Brown  a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee  The very least we can do is to ease the path for these families as they confront the loss of their loved one  The Department of Defenses practice of flying service members remains to major airports is especially hurtful to rural families  who often live a great distance from a major airport  Rep  Stupak said  Rural America is disproportionately represented in our Armed Forces and it does not make sense for military families to be forced to drive a great distance to meet the remains of their loved one Currently  the Department of Defense is free to use any combination of air  rail  or road transportation to bring a body of a fallen soldier home  leaving some rural families to drive hours if they want to meet the remains of their loved one when they arrive at the airport  The Stupak Brown amendment would relieve this burden on the families by assisting rural military families  who often live in areas that are served by regional airports but are many hours away from a major airport hub   Stupak crafted the legislation after hearing from families in his district whose loved ones were killed in Iraq and who had difficulty persuading the DoD to transport the service members remains to smaller airports  After Stupaks amendment was included in the House Department of Defense Reauthorization bill  Stupak asked for Browns leadership to help pass the measure through the Senate  Stupak and Brown said they will work together to ensure the amendment remains in the final conference report I am pleased to see that my legislation has been included in the Department of Defense re authorization bills for both the House and Senate  Stupak added   While I regret that I even had to bring this legislation to the attention of lawmakers and the American people  I look forward to seeing this provision signed into law
