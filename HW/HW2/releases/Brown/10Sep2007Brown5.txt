            In Response To Import Safety Report  Brown Calls On Administration To Fix U S  Trade Policy                                                                                                                               Press Release    In Response To Import Safety Report  Brown Calls On Administration To Fix U S  Trade Policy September 10  2007  Washington  DC  In response to the Presidents Interagency Working Group on Import Safety  U S    D OH  today called on the administration to fix U S  trade policy which he said facilitates the influx of unsafe food and products  Tainted imports from China and other countries have  in recent months  led to the recalls of hundreds of thousands of toys  tires  food products  and pet food products  The administration is proposing trade agreements with countries such as Peru and Panama  who already have been cited for food safety concerns As dangerous as the toys coming out of China are  the problem does not stop there  Brown said  The real threat is our failed trade policy that limits safety standards and sends jobs overseas  It is time for a new direction To address the current import safety crisis  Brown has proposed that the U S  Government 1      Review and fix existing trade deals that limit the ability of safety agencies to inspect imported food and products 2      Require importers of record to post a safety bond to ensure accountability for recalls and defective products 3      Give authority to the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  to examine and approve the regulatory systems of our trading partners as meeting U S  safety standards before imports from a country can enter the U S  market  and ensure that CPSC has the adequate authority to effectively halt imports  4      Place food and product safety inspectors in every U S  embassy to increase cooperation with foreign regulatory authorities to improve their abilities to regulate and enforce safety standards 5      Implement country of origin labeling  COOL  on meat  fruits and vegetables and require COOL on processed foods and ingredients  6      Authorize FDA mandatory recall authority 7      Improve the collection  analysis  sharing and delivery of all pertinent import information with respect to all relevant sources 8      Impose meaningful civil penalties for violators Everyone agrees on one thing  We want more trade with countries around the world  Brown said  But we must protect the safety and health of our children and our families first Below is a copy of a Floor Speech delivered today by Senator Brown on Imported Food and Product Safety Mr  President  last week Mattel  the maker of Barbie  Elmo  and Barney toys  issued its third recall of tainted products from China in the last month  Toothpaste  tires  and toys  when made in China becomes a warning label  somethings very wrong  Our trade policy should prevent these problems  not invite them  Clearly  our trade policy has failed  Yet  anyone who disagrees with Americas trade experts is labeled a protectionist  As if thats a bad word It is not only our moral obligation to protect our communities  our families  and our children from contaminated  possibly deadly products  as members of Congress its our duty  Last year  the United States imported from China  288 billion in goods  much of it food  toys  vitamins  and dog food  Not only is China weak in unenforced health and safety regulations  as The Washington Post revealed recently  it aggressively foists on vulnerable nations contaminated food and products  China sends Formaldehyde laced childrens candy  mercury laced makeup  and fungus infested dried fruits to Indonesia  Malaysia  and Hong Kong  nations largely reliant upon the Communist China for trade and for aid  Our country has worked hard to build safe working places  a reliable healthy food supply and pure drinking water  For one hundred years  workers and community leaders  elected officials and advocates  took on some of the worlds most powerful corporations to make our food and products safer  Unrestricted  unregulated free trade with China threatens these gains and jeopardizes our public health  As of now  there is little interest among the Chinese in changing the way we and they do business  Our trade deficit with China topped  800 billion last year  As the saying goes  if it aint broke  why fix it  Clearly our trade policy is working  working for China  So what is to be done Since the Chinese Communist forbids third party inspectors on Chinese soil  we either buy less  much less  from China  or we hold importers responsible for the safety of the products they bring into the country  We must also increase the number of food and product inspectors  Today  less than one percent of all imported vegetables  fruits  seafood  and grains are inspected at the border  Less than one percent  Mattel is to be commended for taking the proactive step of an internal investigation and recall of products  But such action should be the rarity  not the norm  Which is why we cannot  in our nations best interest  focus solely on consumer threats from China  The real threat is our failed trade policy that allows recall after recall  The real threat is our failure to change course and craft a new trade policy  The real threat is this administrations insistence on more of the same More trade pacts that send U S  jobs overseas  More trade pacts that allow companies  and countries  to ignore the rules of fair trade  More trade pacts that will lead to more recalls The administration  and its free trade supporters in Congress  are gearing up for another trade fight   They want to force on our nation  a nation that in November demanded change  trade agreements with Peru  Panama  Colombia  and North Korea  all based on the same failed trade model  FDA inspectors have rejected seafood imports from Peru and Panama  major seafood suppliers to the U S  And yet  the current trade agreements  as written  limit food safety standards and border inspections  Adding insult to injury  the agreements would force the U S  to rely on foreign inspectors to ensure our safety Weve seen how well THAT worked with China  More of the same in our trade policy will mean exactly that  more contaminated imports and more recalls  It is time for a new direction in our nations trade policy  It is time for trade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen tables and toys in our childrens bedrooms Everyone agrees on one thing  We want more trade with countries around the world  But we must protect the safety and health of our children and our families first
