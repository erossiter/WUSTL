            Brown Announces Final Passage of Energy Bill  Fuel Efficiency Standards                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Announces Final Passage of Energy Bill  Fuel Efficiency Standards  December 13  2007  WASHINGTON  U S   today announced final Senate passage of the energy bill  The bill would increase fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks for the first time in 32 years  The bill includes a Brown amendment that would provide grants for the manufacturing of alternative energy components and systems  In addition  the Brown amendment puts pressure on the Department of Energy  DOE  to launch a long delayed alternative energy loan program and ensure that small manufacturers have access to the funds  This legislation offers new opportunities for Ohios manufacturing base and will accelerate our nations progress toward energy independence  Brown said  Our nation needs to shake itself loose from the grip of multinational oil companies and foreign energy sources  This bill invests in our independence The bill will increase the fleet wide fuel economy standard for all cars by about 40 percent  achieving a combined average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 In the last five years  Ohio has lost nearly 19  of its manufacturing base  Seventy seven of Ohios eighty eight counties have had a loss of manufacturing jobs since 2001  with the remainder experiencing job stagnation  Regions hurt the most by manufacturing job loss also have the most potential to take advantage of supplying the components required by the alternative energy sector To realize this potential  Brown authored the Renewable Energy Innovation Manufacturing Partnership amendment which was included in the final bill  The amendment would provide competitive grants to non profit institutions and private manufacturers that work together to develop renewable energy manufacturing technologies  Multi year grants would be used for research  development  and demonstration projects for advanced manufacturing technologies  In addition  it would allow private manufacturers to conduct studies of market opportunities for component manufacturing of renewable energy systems  Grants will help organizations take innovative alternative energy concepts and develop products for the marketplace  The amendment also calls on DOE to end the delays in offering loan guarantees to companies that employ innovative energy technologies and ensure those guarantees accommodate small manufacturers   The energy bill includes provisions to increase the production of ethanol  Brown also successfully pushed for an amendment authorizing  80 million over four years for the research and development of lightweight vehicle manufacturing materials  including metal and carbon composites  The importance of this funding was one of the topics discussed at a roundtable on composites held by Brown in October at the University of Dayton Research Institute Brown expressed disappointment that the legislation did not include a rollback of tax breaks to big oil nor the extension of incentives for alternative energy like wind and solar  It is expected these issues will be taken up again next year We still have a long way to go  but this is a meaningful step  Brown added
