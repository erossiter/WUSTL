            Brown Joins Senate Hearing To Examine Whether  Free Trade  Policies Are Working                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Joins Senate Hearing To Examine Whether  Free Trade  Policies Are Working April 18  2007  WASHINGTON United States   D OH  today joined Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND  during the Senate Commerce Trade Subcommittee hearing examining whether U S  free trade policies are working for the United States  This was the first in a series of scheduled trade hearings Weve had more than ten years under a trade model that has wreaked havoc on the U S  economy  Brown said  When I first ran for Congress  our trade deficit was  38 billion  Our trade deficit figures for 2006 topped  800 billion  During this series of hearings  we will discuss what works and what doesnt in US trade policy Brown  who has championed fair trade policy in Congress for nearly 15 years  traveled across Ohio last year and heard workers and businesses demand a new direction for trade  In Ohio  more than 185 000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2001  In 2006  the U S  trade deficit reached a record  836 billion  the fifth straight record year  while over the past six years  the U S  lost 3 million manufacturing jobs Brown emphasized the need for future trade agreements to have enforceable labor  environmental and anti counterfeiting standards  as well as safeguards against currency manipulation  and that they should reward businesses that produce and create jobs in the U S   and lift up workers in the U S  and in developing nations Todays hearing included testimony by John Johnston  a business owner from Akron  Ohio who explained how unfair trade practices put American manufacturers at competitive disadvantage Along with Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Lindsey Graham  R NC   Brown introduced legislation earlier this year that would ban sweatshop labor and legislation to rescind Permanent Normal Trade Relations  PNTR  status granted to China in 2000  Brown has introduced legislation that would make it illegal for federal contacts to be awarded to any company doing business with state sponsors of terrorism or that reincorporates offshore  and he plans to reintroduce legislation that would require national security reviews of all trade agreements The trade polices we set in Washington  and negotiate across the globe  have a direct impact on places like Toledo and Steubenville   and Hamilton  as well as in Mexico  Korea  and Bangladesh  The current system is not sustainable  We want trade and plenty of it  but under new rules  We want fair trade  I am pleased to say that this Congress is already hard at work building a better trade policy  Brown said Witnesses at todays hearing included Leo Hindery  managing partner of InterMedia Partners  a major private equity firm and a member of the faculty at Columbia Business School  John Johnston  a member of the U S  Business and Industry Council  Christopher Wenk  Senior Director for International Policy at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  Edward Gresser  Director of Trade and Global Markets Project at the Progressive Policy Institute  Lori Wallach  Director of Public Citizens Global Trade Watch  Note to editors  bellow is  transcript of yesterdays floor speech with Senator Dorgan and Senator Brown    Not an official transcript of the senate proceedings  Mr  Dorgan  My colleague  Senator Brown  has worked on this issue for a long  long while in the U S  house and now in the U S  Senate  And I really appreciate seeing new voices come to the United States Senate demanding that we move towards fair trade relationships  We can compete  but the competition has to be fair  and thats not been the case with any of these trade agreements  Id be happy to yield the floor so that my colleague  Senator Brown  can gain the floor  Mr  Brown  I thank Mr  Dorgan  and I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business  Mr  President  The presiding officer  without objection  Mr  Brown  and I will only speak for five or so minutes  I want to echo what Senator Dorgan said and thank him for his leadership on these issues  I came to the House of Representatives in 1992  Our trade deficit was fairly large in those days  we thought   38 billion  Today  as he said  depending on whether you count services in addition to manufactured products  it exceeds  800 billion  And interestingly  if you add the aggregate trade deficit from 1992 through 2006  that means the amount of exports  the amount of imports weve brought into our country versus the amount of exports  weve had a  4 trillion trade deficit  Thats  4 trillion of wealth having gone out of our country  And to understand what  4 trillion  because you really cant  I mean nobody really can understand that  if you had  1 000  if you spent  1 000 of every second of every minute of every hour of every day  if you spent  1 000 of every second of every minute of every hour of every day to spend  4 trillion  it would take you 135 years  Thats the kind of trade  thats the kind of wealth weve seen go out of our country  But to understand that in more human terms  let me share a story  Mr  President  for a moment if I could  After the North American free trade agreement unfortunately passed the House and Senate  Senator Dorgan voted against it in the senate and I voted against it in the House back a few dozen years or so  I rented a car and went across the border with a couple of friends and visited Renosa  Mexico  to see what NAFTA had brought to the border areas and to the country of Mexico  at least that part of Mexico  I went to the home of two general electric workers  General Electric  Mexico  Both made about 90 cents an hour  both worked 60  pretty much 60 hours a week 10 hours a day  six days a week  They lived in a home about 15 feet  20 feet by 15 feet  no running water  no electricity  dirt floors  When it rained hard  the floors turned to mud  When you went outside their home  these were people who worked 60 hours each for an American company  a Mexican subsidiary of an American company  300 miles from the United States of America  Renosa  Mexico  If you went outside  there was a ditch behind their house  maybe four feet wide  two by fours across the ditch  waste went along the ditch  human waste and who knows what went through  The American medical association said the Mexican U S  border is the most toxic place in the western hemisphere and these children are playing in whatever this human and industrial waste is in this neighborhood  As you walk through this neighborhood  you could tell where the workers worked by the construction materials from which their homes were built  Packing materials and cardboard boxes from the companies for which they worked or the suppliers of the company for which they worked  they used that as roofs and walls to build their shacks  Again  these are people that hold full time work for general electric  Mexico  three miles from the United States of America  Then nearby within a mile  I visited an auto plant  an auto plant that looked just like an auto plant in Lordstown  Ohio  or Avon Lake  Ohio  modern technology  even more modern than what we have in auto plants in Ohio  unfortunately  Clean floors  hard working workers  very productive  There was one difference between the Mexican auto plant and the auto plant youd see in   and the difference was there was no parking lot in the Mexican auto plant because  simply put  the workers are not sharing in the wealth that they  that they produce for their company  You could go halfway around the world  You go to a Motorola plant in Malaysia  the workers arent paid enough to buy the phones that they make  You could come back around the world  halfway around the world to Costa Rica to a Disney plant and the workers dont make enough money to buy the toys for their children  Or go back halfway around the world to China and the workers at the Nike plant  the workers dont make enough in that plant  arent paid enough to buy the shoes that they make  The difference in their economy and ours and these trading partners where we have huge trade deficits is that the workers arent sharing in the wealth they create  But thats starting to happen in the United States  In the last 30 years  the wealthiest 20  in our country  the wealthiest 5   the wealthiest 1  are seeing their wealth go up while middle  while wages are stagnant for the rest of the country  Thats why the middle class is shrinking because people that are working hard and playing by the rules simply arent sharing in the wealth that they create  Theyre more productive than theyve ever been  were setting productivity records in this country  yet wages are stagnant or worse  Companies are outsourcing  companies are going overseas  As Senator Dorgan said  those same companies are getting tax breaks and all kinds of advantages as this body and across the capitol  the House of Representatives  continue to pass these job killing trade agreements that outsource our jobs  that betray our middle class  that mean layoffs of police and fire and teachers and people that make our communities healthier  as families are hurt by these layoffs or as families are hurt by stagnant wages  Thats why we need a very different trade policy  whether its with Japan  whether its with Mexico  a trade policy that lifts up the middle class and helps to strengthen the middle class  a trade policy that will help workers in the developing world instead of this trade policy that outsources our jobs  betrays our communities  and hurts our families  Mr  Dorgan  Would the senator yield for a question   Mr  Brown  The senator  Mr  Dorgan   described automobiles as part of his discussion  I wonder if the Senator from Ohio knows  for example  with respect to South Korea  we imported about 700 000 automobiles from South Korea in the last year  We were able to export about 4 000 American cars to South Korea last year  Why the imbalance  99  of the cars driven on the streets of South Korea made in South Korea  Thats the way they want it  Once in a while we have a little burst  The Dodge Dakota pickup  All of a sudden it looked like they were going to sell Dodge Dakota pickups in South Korea  Just like that  the government shuts that down  Oh  they do it very subtly  but just like that  China  Chinas a good example  We did a trade agreement with china  And heres what we said to China  And Chinas now creating an automobile export market  They want to be a big automobile exporter  and they intend to export to this country  Heres what we said to China  a country with whom we have a giant trade deficit  When you ship your Chinese cars to the United States  we will impose a 2 5  tariff on your cars that you ship to the United States  and we agree that any United States automobiles we would sell in China you may impose a 25  tariff  So a country with whom we have a giant deficit  now a  230 billion trade deficit with china  weve said its ok for you to impose a tariff that is 10 times higher than we would impose on your cars  That is unbelievably ignorant in my judgment  ignorant of our own economic interests  And if Ill make one additional point  in Ohio  they used to make huffy bicycles  Ive spoken about that at some length on this floor  They paid people  11 an hour to make huffy bicycles  huffy bicycles are 20  of the bicycle market in America  buy them at Wal Mart  sears  K mart  people loved making bicycles for over a century  Well  they all got fired  You can still buy a huffy bicycle  theyre all made in China  But the last day at work when they were fired  these bicycle workers when they left the plant  they all left a pair of empty shoes where their car used to sit in the parking lot  And it was their way of saying to this company you can ship our jobs overseas  but by god  youre not going to fill our shoes  It was a way for  a poignant way for workers to say this job mattered to me  We worked here for a century making bicycles as American workers and now its gone  I mean its unbelievable when you hear these stories and see what the consequences are of American companies who have decided  you know what  the new economy says lets produce where we can pay people 30 cents an hour  and incidentally  thats how much workers get for now producing huffy bicycles  Theyre paid 30 cents an hour  they work seven days a week  12 to 14 hours a day  and thats what the Ohio workers were told  you cant compete against that  so you lose  In my judgment  our country  this Senate  Senator Brown and I and others  have to begin standing up for the economic interests of our country and our workers  If we dont  we will surely see a shrinking of the middle class and a dramatic impact on the economy and future growth in this country  Thats why this is such an important issue  And again  let me just say how impressed I am with not only Senator Brown  but especially Senator Brown and some others who have joined us here in the senate who will be very strong voices on behalf of a sane  thoughtful  approachable  pro trade policy that is pro fair trade and stands up for this countrys economic interests  I thank the senator from Ohio for yielding to me  Mr  Brown  I re emphasize what Senator Dorgan says so often  and that is  we want trade  plenty of it  we just want it with different rules  fair trade  And plenty of countries around the world practice trade  as South Korea does  for their own national interests  And we practice trade according to some economics textbook some days  and other days we practice trade according to whats in the interests of these large corporations that outsource  But these companies  again  I use the word betray  They betray our families  they betray our communities when they do what huffy bicycle did  because those were good paying union jobs in Shelby County  Ohio  western Ohio  that has been there for 100 years  Theres a company called the Ohio art company  The Ohio art company makes something that almost everyone thats  that grew up in this country knows about  they make the etch a sketch  Some years ago Wal mart went to the Ohio art company and said we want to sell etch a sketch for under  10 and the Ohio art company couldnt make them for that price  so they pretty much moved most or all of their production to China that kind of betrayal by these corporations with the concurrence of our government  because our government writes the rules for these trade agreements  our government has consistently practiced trade and allowed our largest companies to practice trade not according  unlike other countries that dont practice it according to our national interests and its time that we do  Senator Dorgan  Mr  Dorgan  I would like to ask the senator from Ohio to yield for one more point  The governor from Pennsylvania  Governor Rendell  tried very hard to keep a company in Pennsylvania   Pennsylvania house furniture  They make fine furniture  Pennsylvania wood  a very special kind of Pennsylvania wood  They make a top line furniture did for a long  long time I think over a century as well  And then they were purchased by lazy boy and lazy boy decided that Pennsylvania house furniture would be outsourced to china  and at that point Governor Rendell and folks in Pennsylvania got involved in trying to save Pennsylvania house furniture  but they couldnt do it  The jobs all went to china  Incidentally  they now ship the wood from Pennsylvania to china  put the furniture together and then ship it back to be sold as Pennsylvania house furniture  Theres somebody in this country that has a piece of furniture that they dont understand the value of  The last day of work at this plant where they had made furniture  these craftsmen who make a top end    top of the line furniture these craftsmen at the last day of work on the last piece of furniture that came off the assembly line in Pennsylvania  they turned it over and they all signed it  Someone has a piece of furniture with the signature of all the craftsmen at that plant who on their last day at work decided they wanted to sign as a note of pride in the work they had just completed and then the jobs were gone  all gone to china  Because the Pennsylvania workers could not compete with those who will work for 25 cents  30 cents  35 cents an hour  And they shouldnt have to Mr  Brown  our government needs to come up with a manufacturing policy  If we dont    if our trade laws and our tax laws continue to encourage outsourcing  continue to contribute to this erosion of the middle class we will be a country with less and less men    fewer and fewer manufacturing jobs  less and less of an ability to protect our national interests  It is a question of national security  to be able to have a strong manufacturing component to our economy  And it is a question of economic security and for families in places like Dayton  in places like Steubenville and Disainsville in   Ohio  places where people have built middle class lifestyles  bought holes  sent their children to college  worked hard and played by the rules and manufactured goods that the people in our country use and its important that I think as we move forward with Senator Dorgan and people like senator white house whos also very interested in this from Rhode Island that we move forward on developing this manufacturing policy on trade  on tax law and on helping    particularly our small manufacturers complete in this global economy  I thank the president
