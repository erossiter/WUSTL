            With Holiday Shopping Season In Central Ohio In Full Swing  Brown Announces New Six Point Plan To Combat Toxic Toys                                                                                                                               Press Release    With Holiday Shopping Season In Central Ohio In Full Swing  Brown Announces New Six Point Plan To Combat Toxic Toys  November 28  2007  Columbus  Ohio  In the wake of thousands of toy and food product recalls due to lead contamination and other hazards  U S    D OH  today announced a new six point plan to combat toxic toys produced in countries like China  At City Center mall in Columbus  Brown highlighted the need for more proactive leadership at the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   a more coordinated recall system to better protect parents and children against contaminated toys during the holiday shopping season  and using trade policy to prevent such problems While the holidays are a time for family and good cheer  toxic toys have put a whole new spin on  The Grinch Who Stole Christmas  Brown said  It is an unfortunate reality that families in Central Ohio and across the country are forced to question the safety of what we give our children  This is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed immediately In several advertisements distributed on Black Friday and in Sunday newspapers  previously recalled toys  including Aqua Dots  remained advertised despite the fact that they are coated in a chemical date rape drug  which is dangerous if swallowed  Brown warned parents to use caution while shopping for their children this holiday season  According to the CPSC  since the beginning of November 2007  more than 6 million toys ranging from Fisher Price Laugh  Learn Learning Kitchen Toys  to Marvel Toys Curious George Plush Dolls  and Nikes Football Helmet Chin Strap have been recalled due to lead paint and other hazards In October  at Browns request  Dr  Jeffrey Weidenhamer  Chairman of Ashland Universitys Chemistry Department  tested Halloween items purchased at Family Dollars stores in Ohio  Three products  about one in seven  were found to contain high lead levels  Numerous recalls prompted Brown to inquire about the safety of Halloween products imported from China  Last year the U S  imported more than  288 billion in Chinese goods  and this year that number is expected to top  300 billion Since 1974  the year the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  went into operation  U S  imports have quadrupled  The CPSC is responsible for overseeing more than 15 000 types of products  including toys  While 80 percent of the toys Americans buy are imported from China  in recent months more than 20 million toys manufactured in China were recalled because of lead paint and other hazards  However  the CPSC operates with approximately 400 staffers  fewer than half the number of staff when the agency was established  In fact  the CPSC has only one toy tester and a tiny force of 15 inspectors to check millions of toys at hundreds of ports of entry Today  Brown unveiled a new six point plan to address the current product safety crisis Brown called on President George W  Bush to appoint a qualified leader at CPSC  and to nominate members to fill all five Commissioner positions  There are currently only two commissioners appointed to the CPSC  including Acting Chairman Nancy Nord  Brown has called for Nords resignation after she actively fought against strengthening the CPSC and accepted trips paid for by the toy manufacturing industry  About one third of the recalls issued in the CPSCs 30 year history have occurred this year   Strengthen the CPSC by passing the CPSC Reform Act of 2007  S  2045   Brown has worked with Senator Mark Pryor  D AK  on this legislation which would increase funding for the CPSC by 58 percent over the next seven years  increase CPSC staff to at least 500 employees by 2013  and require Third Party Certification of Childrens products   Require distributors of food and consumer products to demonstrate the financial capacity to cover risks associated with recalls and product safety  Brown introduced legislation with Senator Bob Casey  D PA  to have U S  Customs and Border Protection  in conjunction with other agencies  develop a program to ensure distributors are able to cover the costs associated with both product recalls and all personal and property damages that may occur as a result of a defective product  Distributors would demonstrate that they possess product recall and liability insurance or have sufficient financial resources to afford a recall and any subsequent damage claims  In addition  this bill would give mandatory recall authority to the CPSC  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   and the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA    Ban lead in all childrens products  Brown worked with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  on legislation to ban lead in toys  which has been included in the CPSC Reform Act of 2007  Any childrens product containing lead would face civil penalties up to  250 000 per violation   Better labeling of toys by requiring manufacturers of childrens products to place a label on the product or its packaging that would show consumers the source  date  and cohort of production of the product  In addition  manufacturers or distributors would be required to have the product tested by a qualified  non governmental  independent third party  Products would be certified that they conform to consumer product safety standards and do not include a banned  hazardous substance   Elevate product safety in trade negotiations  In future trade deals  Brown urged Congress to give a mandatory negotiating objective that a country will allow U S  safety inspectors to assess their food and product safety systems and determine whether their systems provide the same safety level or better  As a penalty  the U S  would prohibit the importation of food and products from countries whose regulatory systems have not been determined to provide the same or better level of safety   These six steps can lower the risk of tainted imports  and better ensure the safety of our kids toys  Brown said  We need a new approach to trade policy  and to import safety  We need to give consumers full information about the products they are purchasing  We need to protect the safety and health of our children and our families first Brown was joined today by Morgan Keenan  the Ohio Consumers Rights Advocate for the Ohio Public Interest Research Group  PIRG  and Linda Tvonik  Coordinator for Safe Kids Central Ohio
