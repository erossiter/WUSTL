            Dem  Senators Wary Of New Trade Deal                                                                                                                               Press Release    Dem  Senators Wary Of New Trade Deal  May 17  2007  Washington  DC  At a Capitol Hill news conference today  U S    D OH  said the inclusion of labor and environmental standards in a new trade policy proposal was an historic step  but expressed deep concerns over emerging details Joined by Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   Bernie Sanders  I VT   and Bob Casey  D PA   Brown said enforceability questions and potential side deals cast a shadow over the outline negotiated by Congressional leadership and the White House   Voters in Ohio  and across the country  sent a message loud and clear in November that they want a new direction for U S  trade policy  Brown said  They forced the administration to publicly acknowledge that trade matters to working men and women in this country  The demand was for real change  not symbolic gestures While the text of pending trade agreements has not yet been made public  an outline of the trade deal released late last week drew criticism from labor and small business groups  However  the head of the U S  Chamber of Commerce praised the deal saying he had been assured by the White House that the standards would not be strictly enforced  News accounts this week report that House Republicans and United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab want to offer the labor and environmental standards as a side deal to the Peru Free Trade Agreement  instead of as part of the text of the agreement If the plan is to offer side deals  then nothing new is on the table except a  5 Rolex  said Brown  The key here is enforceability  This administration has an abysmal record enforcing labor and environmental laws in our own country  We certainly cannot count on it to protect our interests abroad  It looks like the Jordan agreement all over again Enacted in 2000  the Jordan Free Trade Agreement received initial support from fair traders because of the inclusion of labor and environmental standards In 2001  former USTR Robert Zoellick sent a letter to Jordan expressing little desire to enforce the standards  Despite reports of rampant human trafficking and slave labor conditions in Jordan  the White House has not filed any complaints  Seven years later Jordan is on its way to becoming the sweatshop capital of the Middle East because the administration abdicated its duty to enforce standards  Brown said  The fact is the new proposal does not appear to address fundamental problems in our trade policy s also discussed creating benchmarks for future trade deals to ensure that these deals live up to their promises  If history is any guide  we cant trust the rhetoric around these trade deals  we need to measure the results and act accordingly  Brown said
