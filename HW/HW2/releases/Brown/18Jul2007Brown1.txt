            In Wake Of Recent Import Crisis  Brown Testified At Hearing On Safety Of Chinese Imports                                                                                                                               Press Release    In Wake Of Recent Import Crisis  Brown Testified At Hearing On Safety Of Chinese Imports July 18  2007  Washington  DC  With recent news of contaminated products being imported from China  U S    D OH  today testified at the Senate Commerce Committee Hearing titled Safety of Chinese Imports  Oversight and Analysis of the Federal Response  Last week  Brown joined Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  to introduce new legislation to strengthen the Food and Drug Administrations  FDA  ability to monitor and inspect goods that enter the United States from abroad  We have an obligation to protect the American people from dangerous products and ensure food imports meet U S  health and safety standards  Senator Brown said  In the absence of strong US oversight  food safety problems in China and other countries become our problems  too  Thats a needless burden and a serious risk With 76 million Americans sickened each year from food borne illnesses  consumers are demanding stricter food safety laws  According to a recent Consumer Reports study  92 percent of Americans want to know which country produced the food they buy Food imports constitute a growing share of what Americans eat and what is sold on grocery shelves across the country  Shipments of food into the United States are more than four times what they were in 1996  when the U S  had an agricultural trade balance of over  27 billion more exports going out than imports coming in  Today  that balance has dropped to only  8 billion  Individual shipments of food from China have recently been quoted as going from 82 000 shipments in 2002 to 199 000 in 2006 Just last week  the Office of Management and Budget cleared a new rule proposed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  that eases the importation of certain new foreign fruits and vegetables into the U S  The Office of Management and Budget  OMB  approved the rule within just one week  When it comes to imported food safety and this administration  the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing The Durbin Brown Imported Food Security Act of 2007 would mandate that foreign imports meet the same or better standards than those of the U S   and would give the FDA the authority to approve and disapprove of countries eligible to import  It would establish a certification system for foreign governments or food establishments seeking to import food to the U S  It would require the FDA to collect user fees on imported food products  and the revenues generated would be used for imported food inspection and food safety research Under the current food import system  any country or company can export food products to the U S  if they notify regulators of the shipment  The FDA does not ensure that trading partners have equivalent standards or inspect overseas plants when problems arise  When there is an outbreak  the FDAs investigation can be delayed by uncooperative foreign governments  Last year  less than 1 percent overall shipments of food coming into the United States were sampled for inspection  During the recent pet food recall  U S  regulators were delayed three weeks in their request for visas to inspect Chinese facilities  In addition to China  many other countries are experiencing problems with their exports  In 2006  the FDA has listed more than 300 foreign products  including seafood from Vietnam  green onions from Mexico  cottage cheese from the Philippines  and on and on and on   In Ohio  at Krogers or Heinens  much of the apple juice on shelves comes from China  But unlike Ohios apple growers who use real apples or apple concentrate to make apple juice and applesauce  China uses a chemical called inulin that tastes just like real apple juice  The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has not been able to identify the chemical in all juice bottles  even if the label says 100 percent apple juice Or  take the wheat bread our kids eat at lunch which might contain wheat from the United States  But  it most likely also contains wheat gluten  the ingredient that makes the bread chewy  and 80 percent of wheat gluten in the world comes from China  So these compounds go into products that might  in the end  be manufactured in the United States  It may even say Made in the USA on the label  But it is most likely that these compounds are coming from foreign countries  What concerns me  and families in Ohio and throughout the country  is that the FDA cannot protect our food supply given its current structure and authority  and given its resources  This administrations imported food safety plan is to roll the dice and take our chances with more free trade  As we will hear from the panel this morning  it is certainly not just imported food that we need to address  Last month  when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  told the importer of imported defective tires  Foreign Tire Sales  FTA   to recall the tires  the company said it would have to file bankruptcy if it issued the recall  This unfortunate incident highlights a growing concern  namely  who is held to account for producing these products that put the lives of Americans in danger  When American distributors rely on imports for their sales  we must ensure that they can afford a recall and ensure that there is liability  on our shores   for products that  while likely cheaper  may not meet the same standards consumers have grown accustomed Right now I am writing legislation that requires a safety recall bond that guarantees if a domestic distributor of tire and auto parts has a safety defect  that there is a system set up that guarantees by a third party that the distributor can afford the recall  The situation we saw last month with Foreign Tire Sales must be prevented in the future
