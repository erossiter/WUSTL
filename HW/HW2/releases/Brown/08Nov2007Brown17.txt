            Brown   Hutchison Introduce Motorcoach Safety Legislation                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown   Hutchison Introduce Motorcoach Safety Legislation November 8  2007  WASHINGTON  DC Eight months after five Bluffton baseball players were killed during a bus crash in Atlanta  U S  Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH  and Kay Bailey Hutchison  R TX  today introduced a new motorcoach safety bill  The legislation is designed to reduce deaths and injuries caused by motorcoach accidents   In the wake of the Bluffton bus crash  one thing is clear  we need stronger safety regulations  Sen  Brown said  This bill takes the lessons learned from the tragic events of the Bluffton University baseball teams motorcoach accident  and aims to correct them for future riders  It will ensure that motorcoaches are built  equipped  and operated to be as safe as possible A tragic motorcoach accident during Hurricane Rita evacuation efforts in 2005 cost 24 Houston nursing home residents their lives  The sad truth is that this accident could have been prevented  I am pleased to cosponsor new legislation that will enhance federal safety guidelines governing motorcoaches  With an eye toward prevention  we can help avert future motorcoach accidents and make the roads safer for everyone  said Sen  Hutchison  who serves on the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee Within an hour of identifying my sons body at the Fulton County Morgue in Atlanta  I made a promise to the rest of the Bluffton University players who were at Grady Hospital  because David Joe was so good  something good will come out of this tragedy  Since then  there have been many positive things that have come from the Atlanta bus crash tragedy which honor Tyler Williams  Cody Holp  Scott Harmon  Zack Arend  David Joseph Betts  and the Bluffton University baseball team  In my familys estimation  none of those honors compare to that of introducing and passing this bill in its current form  This bill will absolutely save lives in the future  which is a great legacy  I thank Senator Brown on behalf of our family and every person who will utilize motorcoaches in the future for this much needed  long overdue  and incredibly important bill  said John Betts Legislation to improve motorcoach safety is long overdue  said Jacqueline Gillan  Vice President of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety  Advocates   The legislation introduced by Senators Brown and Hutchison directs the U S  Department of Transportation to implement a common sense and cost effective safety agenda with reasonable deadlines to ensure the safety of motorcoach passengers  Too many people are needlessly injured and killed in motorcoach crashes and too few safety measures are being implemented  We know what the problems are  we have the technological solutions  and this bill directs a plan of action for the federal government to complete On March 2  2007  the Bluffton University baseball team was traveling from Ohio to Florida for a tournament  Early in the morning on Interstate 75 in Atlanta  their chartered bus  attempting to exit the highway  fell off an overpass and landed on its side on the road below  The crash resulted in the deaths of five members of the baseball team  the driver and his wife  and many of the other 33 passengers were treated for injuries In 2006  there were more than 630 million passengers taking trips in motorcoaches  according to the American Bus Association  with up to 59 occupants on board for any given trip  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA  reports that 3 700 interstate motorcoach companies are registered with the agency  with the number increasing by 900 each year  However  the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  does not require that motorcoaches have basic occupant protection safety features  Over the years  the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  has made numerous safety recommendations to improve motorcoach safety  including promoting such critical safety features as safety belts  occupant advanced glazing on windows and other ejection prevention countermeasures  protection against dangerous motorcoach interior impacts  crush resistant roofs  and protection against fires  These recommendations have languished for years without federal agency attention and action  The Brown Hutchison legislation  The Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act of 2007  would require DOT to upgrade federal safety standards applicable to motorcoaches and take action to improve the operational requirements of drivers and companies  The legislation would lead to the adoption of available safety technologies  result in stronger oversight and compliance with federal safety rules  and encourage better training of motorcoach operators to protect passengers from death and injury due to ejection  rollover  roof crush  and fires Specifically  the bipartisan legislation would require Safety belts and stronger seating systems to ensure occupants stay in their seats in a crash  Anti ejection glazing to prevent passengers from being easily thrown outside the motorcoach  Strong  crush resistant roofs that can withstand rollovers  Improved protection against fires by reducing flammability of the motorcoach interior  and better training for operators in the case of fire   Improved commercial driver training  Currently  no training is required by federal regulation  National Commercial Motor Vehicle Medical Registry ensure that only medically qualified examiners conduct physical examinations of drivers and a medical certificate process to ensure that all certificates are valid and no unqualified operator is allowed to drive  Strengthened motorcoach vehicle safety inspections including roadside inspections  safety audits  and state and motor carrier programs for identifying vehicle defects  Electronic On Board Recorders  EOBRs  with real time capabilities to track precise vehicle location  and recorded data not accessible to manipulation by a driver or motor carrier
