            Farm Bill Slated To Move In The Senate Wednesday Brown Details Priorities For Final Legislation                                                                                                                               Press Release    Farm Bill Slated To Move In The Senate Wednesday Brown Details Priorities For Final Legislation October 23  2007  Washington  DC  With the 2007 Farm Bill slated to be voted out of the Senate Agriculture Committee this week  U S    D OH  today held a news conference call detailing his priorities for the final legislation  Browns goals for the Farm Bill included strengthening Ohio agriculture by improving the safety net  promoting renewable energy  improving nutrition programs and encouraging healthy diets  supporting Ohios rural communities  and protecting natural resources  Brown is the first Senator from Ohio in forty years to serve on the Agriculture Committee Ohio agriculture has a rich history and a bright future  Brown said  I am working to help write a forward looking Farm Bill that supports Ohio farmers and rural communities  The 2007 Farm Bill needs to simultaneously provide new incentives for next generation biofuels  develop local markets for family farmers  and promote healthy diets for all Americans  Reforming Farm Programs to Better Protect Ohio FarmersThis year  Ohio farmers faced devastating weather  including frost and freeze conditions in early April that damaged fruit and vegetable production  drought and extreme heat that hurt crops and pasture from mid April to mid August  and severe flooding in late August that ruined crops for many farmers  Brown conducted a statewide farm tour earlier this year to hear directly from local farmers  Brown visited Mark Schwiebert  a Henry County corn farmer  who introduced the idea that Congress should consider a broad reform of our nations farm safety net  In response  Brown and Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation in July that provides farmers with a revenue protection program called the Average Crop Revenue  ACR  program  The ACR has the support of the National Corn Growers Association  which represents the interests of more than 30 000 farmers  and was developed by Carl Zulauf  a professor of agricultural economics at Ohio State University The ACR program represents a significant shift from traditional farm policy  By tying the federal farm safety net to actual farm revenues rather than merely price as the current system does  the ACR will provide better protection for farmers while saving taxpayers an estimated  3 5 billion over five years  ACR provided one of the final  key pieces to the Farm Bill compromise that will be considered by the Senate Agriculture Committee Encouraging Farm Based Clean Renewable EnergyRural communities in Ohio and across the country would benefit substantially from the farm based  renewable energy provisions in the bill that promote sustainable energy production  Demand for the programs in the 2002 Farm Bill outpaces the current  limited funding  leaving many energy development opportunities unrealized  Accelerating research and development of technologies  such as methane digesters  for on farm production of renewable energy  increases U S  energy security  improves the environment  and creates new economic opportunities for farmers and communities  In particular  these provisions would assist farmers looking to transition to the production of sustainable biomass crops and provide government backed loans to next generation cellulosic ethanol plants Increasing Consumption of Fruits and VegetablesIncreasing the availability of healthy and fresh foods in schools and underserved communities can improve overall health while helping local farmers develop profitable new markets  The increase in diabetes  heart disease  and other diet related diseases in the U S  are in part the result of a lack of fresh food consumption  including fruits and vegetables  In response  Brown introduced a measure in May with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  to help deliver fresh food from farms to underserved communities  The Food Outreach and Opportunity Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act would increase the supply and availability of locally produced foods by creating markets for small and midsized family farmers and ranchers  Specifically  it would promote locally led food access initiatives that increase access to healthy foods  increase fruits and vegetables in school meals  improve access to fresh foods for low income individuals  remove barriers that keep local farmers from selling products to schools  and support farmers markets and road side stands  particularly in underserved areas Brown also supports the Specialty Crop Competition Act  which would promote the economic role of specialty crops  fruits  vegetables and other crops that account for  34 billion in revenues a year nationwide  This provision would assist farmers in growing crops that are more economically viable and environmentally friendly  finding new markets  including access to foreign markets  providing research funding to combat pests and disease  and providing school nutrition programs with more fruits and vegetables  Increasing Benefit Levels for Food and Nutrition ProgramsIn Ohio  the Food Stamp Program provides more than one million people with food assistance  More than half of those Ohioans are children  making the Food Stamp Program the nations single largest nutrition program for low income children  The Food Stamp Program also serves more than 64 000 elderly Ohioans and more than 132 000 disabled Ohioans  It is a critical part of the countrys hunger safety net  but its purchasing power has eroded  Benefit levels are low and many people who need help are not eligible and cannot complete the complicated application process  In Ohio  Food Stamp benefits last two and a half weeks each month and provide about  1 per person per meal  In the 2007 Farm Bill  Brown is working to end the erosion of Food Stamp benefits by increasing benefit levels and indexing benefits to inflation  Brown is also fighting to provide critical deductions for child care expenses and military pay  Improving and Expanding Critical Conservation ProgramsFarmers are among the best stewards of the land and natural resources  Good farming practices provide clean water and air  reduced soil erosion  restoration of wetlands  and protection of wildlife habitat  Federal conservation programs  such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  and the Conservation Security Program  CSP   help farmers produce these environmental benefits  However  many farmers have been turned away due to lack of funding for conservation programs  In 2004  three out of every four applications were denied  Brown is looking to expand and improve conservation programs in the 2007 Farm Bill  thus providing additional support to farmers committed to improving natural resources  Brown is pushing for an increase in funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program to protect Ohios wetlands and an increase in funding for programs that help farmers protect water quality  expand wildlife habitat  and preserve endangered farmland Investing in Rural CommunitiesRural communities are the backbone of Ohio  However  the infrastructure in many small towns is failing and good paying jobs are scarce  Brown seeks to use the 2007 Farm Bill to boost funding for rural infrastructure and healthcare by increasing federal support for rural wastewater systems and rural hospitals  Brown plans to bridge the gap to higher paying jobs by providing grant and loan programs that will expand access to rural broadband to all Ohioans
