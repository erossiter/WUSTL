                                                  Press Release    With Toledo Hard Hit By Manufacturing Job Loss Brown Calls For Action On WARN  TAA  And New Direction  For Trade  November 26  2007  Toledo  Ohio  With Toledo hard hit by manufacturing job loss  U S    D OH  today in Toledo called on Congress to move on a stronger Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  WARN  Act and Trade Adjustment Assistance  TAA   Since 2000  Toledo has lost 11 900 manufacturing jobs  with Ohio seeing 200 000 manufacturing jobs lost  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Recent layoffs have underscored the need for action in Washington Job killing trade agreements shut down our factories  hurt our communities  and send toxic toys into our childrens bedrooms  Brown said  Job loss does not just affect a worker or a workers family  Job loss devastates entire communities and local economies  It is absolutely critical that the government step up and help our middle class families Today  Brown called on Congress to pass a substantial TAA bill  including his amendment to better protect workers by strengthening the WARN Act  This amendment  which is based on Browns bill  The Federal Oversight  Reform  and Enforcement of the WARN Act  FOREWARN   S 1792   would better protect workers by notifying them earlier of mass firings or plant closings  According to estimates by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   24 percent of all layoffs are subject to WARN requirements  Of those layoffs  employers provided notice approximately one third of the time  The FOREWARN Act would give the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  and state attorneys general the authority to enforce the WARN Act  and would increase penalties to double back pay plus benefits  In addition  it would reduce the mass layoff figure from 50 to 25  reduce the employer size from 100 to 50 employees  and lower the mass layoff trigger  The lower thresholds would protect employees in many smaller manufacturing firms  It would also lengthen the notification period from 60 to 90 days and require employers to provide written notification to the Department of Labor The TAA program was created in 1962 by President John F  Kennedy to assist workers hurt by trade  Since 2003  more than 30 000 Ohioans have benefited from TAA  The current version of the legislation  which is slated to pass out of the Senate Finance Committee next month  would expand the program to include service workers and increase assistance to entire industries and communities  While the bill would improve the Health Care Benefit subsidy to 85 percent  Brown is working with Senator Jay Rockefeller  D WV  to increase it to 95 percent  Brown also discussed legislation that would increase funding for job training and education  This fall  Congress passed legislation restoring funding and support to labor agencies that provide services to millions of Americans  This bill included  12 billion for labor initiatives  which was  1 billion more than the administrations budget request  The Labor Appropriations bill made investments in job training programs  including adult  youth  and dislocated worker training and Job Corps  and worker protection efforts at the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  and the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH   While the president vetoed this legislation  Brown plans to go back to Washington next week and fight to maintain the funding increase Congress is currently debating a new round of free trade agreements that Brown says will exacerbate Ohios job loss  Brown has called for a new direction for U S  trade policy  The U S  faces a growing trade deficit  which reached a record high last year  with a  765 262 billion deficit  Meanwhile  Ohio lost 242 000 manufacturing jobs since July 2000  including over 34 000 in just the last two years  Yet manufacturing supports two thirds of all private sector U S  research and nearly 80 percent of U S  patents  The Senate is slated to vote on several proposed trade agreements in the coming months  including an FTA with Peru  Brown has called for a strategic pause from NAFTA modeled free trade agreements  during which the US should pass strong currency and trade enforcement legislation  He is working to develop a new model for negotiating fair trade deals  American workers and manufacturers want trade rules that promote real competition  not wage deflation  unsafe products  and outsourcing  Brown said  We want trade  and more of it  But we want trade that grows our economy  rather than undercutting it
