            Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Meeting The Global Challenge Of Aids  TB and Malaria                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Meeting The Global Challenge Of Aids  TB and Malaria December 11  2007  WASHINGTON  DC U S    D OH  today released the following opening statement from todays Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee hearing on Meeting the Global Challenge of AIDS  TB and Malaria This hearing is about our commitment to global health  It is also about our commitment to political stability  to economic development  and to walking our talk  We care about our friends and our families  Do we care about people weve never seen and will never meet HIV AIDS  TB  and Malaria are diseases that kill millions of people each year  They kill children  they orphan children  they tether children to lifelong drug regimens  We care about our children  Do we care about these children HIV AIDS  TB  and Malaria rob families of their breadwinners  communities of their institutions  and developing countries of their resources    resources already stretched paper thin  These children  these families  these communities  and these countries dont look like ours  but crisis is crisis  suffering is suffering and death is death   It could be next door or on another continent Compassion demands action  And in this case  common sense demands it  too  If we are complacent about forces that foment helplessness  hopelessness  and despair  then we are ushering in a future rife with conflict  extremism and violence   History doesnt lie  it repeats itself In 2006  65 percent of new HIV cases occurred in Africa  a continent where unrest is endemic  72 percent of all HIV related deaths were also in Africa  And in the case of TB and HIV  they work together  Get infected with one and youre more vulnerable to the other  And the symptoms are worse in combination Ive met with patients with drug resistant TB in jails in Moscow and in a prison colony in Siberia  Ive also seen people living with AIDS who have overcome TB in rural Haiti  With the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  PEPFAR   America told the world that we would not just sit by and watch these epidemics rage out of control  We made a huge investment in services and prevention of these diseases  Ambassador Dybul has been particularly responsive in scaling up PEPFARs funding for TB HIV cotreatment strategies  Under Ambassador Dybuls watch  funding for co treatment of TB and HIV has increased from  18 8 million in 2005 to  120 million in 2007  Think about how many lives that scale up has saved  Thank you  Ambassador Dybul With PEPFAR  America told the world that we would not just sit by and watch these epidemics rage out of control  We made a huge investment in services and prevention of these diseases  Our witnesses today will no doubt outline all of our successes so far  But we must continue to lead  PEPFAR has been integral to providing antiretrovirals  testing  and prevention of HIV  But it has gone even further than that as well  it helps countries build critical public health infrastructure  But we need to do more Right now  only 10 percent of HIV positive pregnant women get the drugs they need to prevent fetal transmission  16 percent of new infections each year occur in children  But children make up only 9 percent of all those treated with antiretrovirals  Without treatment  75 pecent of children infected at birth will die by age 5  Seventy five percent  That is tragic  We can do better  We must do better We are here today to learn from the past and to plan for the future  We need to listen to the experts  The Institute of Medicine released a report last March providing an evaluation of PEPFARs progress  In it  several recommendations were made  A major one was that we need to transition the focus of PEPFAR from emergency relief to long term sustainability  The report also said that we need to determine the most appropriate prevention interventions needed and elevate the standing of women and girls if we want to address HIV effectively  This means supporting women and girls legal  economic  educational  and social status  Living in poverty in a developing country  people may not have transportation to make it to clinics for testing or treatment  In many parts of the developing world  girls get married at age 14  15  or 16  Other issues include building workforce capacity by educating new health care workers and paying them a living wage  We also have to expand what we do for orphans and vulnerable children  We have made a good start  but this is just the beginning  Lets move forward with the lessons weve learned and save more lives  Because that is what this is about  Its about saving lives I hope that all of us here will keep in mind that people in Rwanda  South Africa  Vietnam  Haiti  and all the countries that benefit from PEPFAR  are real people with hopes and dreams for themselves and their children  just like us  They are not numbers  They want safety  economic stability  and healthy bodies  just like we do  They dont want to die from HIV  TB  or malaria  leaving their children in the care of the community or out on the streets  losing opportunities for education and at risk for dangerous situations  And they are surviving these diseases under the most difficult of circumstances  They may not have enough food or drinking water for themselves or their childrenfood and water that is needed to recover from HIV  TB  or malaria  How can we help young girls empower themselves and protect themselves from HIV despite such difficult circumstances I hope we can keep in mind the real situation of people in these countries and that doing so will drive us to take a holistic approach when considering PEPFAR reauthorization  We need to think about how our funding will affect the lives of people directly  in ways we may never fully understand  And in keeping in mind the real people    who are struggling to survive  we need to draw on our deepest compassion and generosity  We are the worlds superpower with some of the greatest wealth in history  There is no reason that we cant do our part to help those in countries where access to basics like food and safe drinking water  or hospital care is not the norm and where people travel  often walking  long distances to get help  I hope we can imagine the lives of the real people behind these diseases as we walk through this reauthorization
