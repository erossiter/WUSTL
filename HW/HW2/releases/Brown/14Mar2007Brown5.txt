            Democrats Introduce Bill To Offer Simple  Expanded College Tax Beneft                                                                                                                               Press Release    Democrats Introduce Bill To Offer Simple  Expanded College Tax Beneft  March 14  2007  WASHINGTON  United States Senator Charles Schumer  joined by Senators Maria Cantwell  Debbie Stabenow  Sherrod Brown  Claire McCaskill  Evan Bayh  Ken Salazar  Jon Tester  and Bob Casey  today introduced the Higher Education Opportunity Act to overhaul college tuition tax provisions to create one streamlined  easy to understand credit  which combines the best parts of the existing benefits The Higher Education Opportunity Act would combine the existing HOPE and Lifetime Learning credits and the above the line college tuition tax deduction into one  2 500 credit  greatly simplifying the current cumbersome system of benefits  which includes a variety of rules and regulations that are confusing for families trying to get tax relief to help shoulder the mounting costs of college education  The last thing families struggling to pay the rising costs of college education need are confusing tax credits  This bill will offer families a simple  straightforward way to claim a tax credit to help pay for their kids tuition and books  This long overdue measure will provide real relief to families trying to help their kids get ahead  Schumer said  And unlike many simplification proposals  which have little to offer the middle class  this one will have real meaning to millions of middle income taxpayers The new credit offers a maximum of  2 500 will cover 100 percent of the first  1 000 in expenses  50 percent of the next  2 000  and 20 percent of the next  2 500  for a maximum credit of  2 500   The credit begins to phase out for individuals earning  70 000 and for a couple earning  140 000   The credit reaches zero when family income exceeds  90 000  single  and  180 000  married  The bill is structured to ensure community college students do not lose tax benefits  Under this bill  a community college student paying  2 500 in tuition would receive a credit of  1 750  The consolidated credit will also extend tuition benefits to cover four years of undergraduate or graduate education per student  Under the existing Hope Act  only the first two years are covered Additionally  the consolidated credit will cover some textbook expenses  covering up to 50  of the cost of textbooks  for a maximum of  250  The credit can be claimed for both graduate and undergraduate education and can be claimed for up to three students in a household each year In 2004  3 4 million families claimed the HOPE credit  taking tax credits of  4 2 billion   3 3 billion in credits were given out to 4 1 million families in 2004 for the Lifetime Learning credit  The college tuition deduction benefited 4 6 million families  who deducted  10 6 billion in 2004   The deduction expires at the end of 2007  The simplified tax credit in the Schumer bill would take effect starting in 2008 With todays sky high tuition rates  making college more accessible and affordable must be one of our top priorities  said Cantwell   Turning our complex web of credits and deductions into one easy to understand tax credit will help millions of Americans take better advantage of critical higher education incentives   Parents and students need these incentives  but right now theyre just too confusing Higher education provides a path to a successful future for our children and fuels our economy  said Stabenow   We need to make it easier  not harder  for hard working American students to attend and afford college  and this bill will do just that The cost of college tuition at a public school in Ohio has jumped 89 percent since 2000  Brown said  All students  if they want to  should have the opportunity to go to college  Expanding and simplifying college tax credits are important steps toward supporting middle class families throughout the nation We need real tax relief to help average American families afford sky rocketing college tuition rates  McCaskill said   This bill does just that by providing college tax breaks that makes sense  are user friendly  and give real hope to those currently struggling to pay for college The American Dream is founded on the idea that anyone who is willing to work hard and sacrifice will be able to create a better life for themselves and their children  Bayh said  However  the rising cost of higher education is putting that dream out of reach for many Middle Class Americans   This legislation will provide much needed tax relief for hardworking families and help ensure that the benefits of a college degree are available to all Americans   This is a common sense way to make college more affordable for every American  a simpler tax code  real tax relief for middle class families  expanded opportunity for a college education and a real shot at the American Dream  said Salazar Education is key to the economic development of our communities and this measure makes college education possible for more American families  Tester said   A vibrant middle class that places a premium on an educated workforce will benefit from a simpler tax code College tuition costs continue to rise and outpace stagnant income levels for most Americans  said Casey   If we want to complete in a global market we must give our students the opportunity to receive the best education possible without having to worry about making ends meet   Our families need more help in sending their kids to college and this bill will help provide some relief to those families who are struggling
