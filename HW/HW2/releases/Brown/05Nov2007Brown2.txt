            Brown Urges F R A  To Investigate Last Week s Train Derailment In Erie County                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Urges F R A  To Investigate Last Week s Train Derailment In Erie County  November 5  2007  WASHINGTON  DC U S    D OH  today urged the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  to investigate a train derailment that occurred in Erie County last week  Over the past ten years  Erie County has experienced 78 train incidents  58 of which involved hazardous materials  Local communities are concerned by the increase in train incidents and the number of trains transporting hazardous materials through the region  Federal investigators shouldnt wait for a tragedy to investigate recurring incidents like this one  If there is a systemic problem behind these derailments  we need to identify it  Brown said  Late last week  the FRA announced that the train derailment  including car overturning  in Erie County did not meet the established threshold for a serious accident  and therefore would not warrant an investigation  However  the number of train incidents in Erie County has increased every year for the past three years  As of October 30 of this year  FRA data showed nine train incidents have occurred in Erie County  up from seven in 2006 and five in 2005  In a letter to Joseph Boardman  Administrator for the FRA  Brown wrote  With improved safety standards and proper oversight  the number of incidents should certainly not be rising  These numbers demonstrate that something is not right in Erie County  It is true that this particular incident did not cause injuries nor did it involve hazardous materials  however  we cannot just hope that next time we will be as fortunate  I ask that you reconsider your decision and investigate why and how train derailments and other rail incidents are on the rise in this area of Ohio  Brown is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Rail Security Act of 2007  which would authorize  1 2 billion dollars for rail security  The legislation would establish a grant program to encourage security enhancements by the freight railroads  Amtrak  shippers of hazardous materials  and local governments with responsibility for passenger stations  It also directs the FRA to set standards for rail and tank car safety improvements
