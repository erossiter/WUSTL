            Brown Amendment Passes As Part Of Military Construction Legislation                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Amendment Passes As Part Of Military Construction Legislation  September 6  2007  Washington  DC  With the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  sidestepping rules and outsourcing jobs held by veterans  U S    D OH  today announced passage of his amendment requiring the VA to play by the rules and show a good reason before displacing government workers  There is a culture of privatization in the administration that leads to bad contracts  misused funds at the taxpayers expense  and lack of accountability  Brown said  Federal agencies are required to follow fair competition rules to ensure that privatizing jobs improves on the status quo  The VA has been bypassing the fair competition rules when outsourcing jobs  While Browns amendment does not change current law  it reinforces that the VA is required to abide by fair competition rules  The amendment passed with bipartisan support  52 to 39 Its bad enough that the VA is moving forward without actually figuring out what is in the best interest of taxpayers  Brown said  But making matters even worse  four fifths of the blue collar jobs targeted for outsourcing are held by veterans  Sidestepping rules to eliminate veterans jobs is bad business and bad policy According to fair competition rules  federal agencies must allow the in house workforce to submit its best bid  and the contractor must prove to be more efficient and cost effective in carrying out the competition in order to outsource the jobs  In bypassing the fair competition rules  the VA is preventing its employees  many of them veterans  from fighting for their jobs  This practice is particularly evident in blue collar jobs  including laundry  maintenance  and landscaping  The Brown Amendment passed as part of the FY08 Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Appropriations Bill Floor Statement Of U S  Mr  President  this amendment does not change current law  it simply reminds the Veterans administration to abide by it All federal agencies are bound by certain rules when they outsource jobs   While the DoD has its own set of rules  every other federal agency  including the VA  is required to take the same straightforward steps to ensure that when outsourcing occurs  it actually improves upon the status quo If any federal agency should be required to show a good reason before displacing government workers  it should be the VA  Thats because many VA employees are veterans themselves Arbitrarily firing veterans is not only wrong  its short sighted   The obstacles to employment are steep enough for veterans without throwing unjustifiable outsourcing into the mix  But even if we put that aside  taxpayers arent well served when government contracts are handed out without regard to the costs or benefits that result Thats one of the many lessons we should have learned from Katrina   Its a lesson we are learning over and over again in Iraq  These lessons dont seem to be sinking in with the Administration  The VA is firing many of its blue collar workers  and replacing them with private contractors without going through the competition process that Congress has called for again and again Its bad enough that the VA is moving forward without actually figuring out what is in the best interest of the taxpayers   But making matters even worse is that four fifths of the blue collar jobs targeted for outsourcing to private contractors are held by veterans These are more than a paycheck   Theyre a path to independence  Sidestepping the rules to eliminate their jobs is bad business and bad policy  I urge my colleagues to give it their support
