            Statement of  From Today s Veterans Affairs Hearing On VA DOD Cooperation And Collaboration On Health Care                                                                                                                                Press Release    Statement of  From Today s Veterans Affairs Hearing On VA DOD Cooperation And Collaboration On Health Care  March 27  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement at todays Veterans Affairs  VA  Committee Hearing on VA and Department of Defense  DOD  cooperation and collaboration on health care issues Thank you Mr  Chairman  I am glad we are having this hearing today because the needs of our men and women in uniform coming home from the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan must be addressed and must be addressed immediately  This meeting should have been unnecessary  The VA should have been prepared to meet the needs of our newest veterans  But  just as the administration rushed to war without a plan  there was no plan for those coming home wounded   There have been other times in our nations history when this country has failed its veterans  Following the Civil War  many of Ohios disabled and wounded veterans could not get the long term care they needed  Soldiers and veterans from the Grand Army of the Republics Department of Ohio had to lobby for a state operated veterans home  The state government and the community came together and  with donated land from area residents  founded what would be become the Ohio Veterans Home  This was 1888  The home continues to serve veterans today  The people of Sandusky banded together and made serving veterans a priority  They saw it as a moral obligation The lack of care for wounded coming home from the Civil War was at least understandable  The nation was broke from many long years at war and the medical sciences were far less advanced than they are today  Today  there is no excuse  The fact is that the administration did not prepare  Our veterans from the Vietnam era suffered many of these same problems  Its an all too familiar pattern with this administration  and unfortunately  our brave men and women in uniform are paying the price The cost of these wars must include the cost of caring for our returning wounded  This week  the Senate is debating the administrations  100  billion supplemental  Yet  the same administration was  4 billion short on in its budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs  Fortunately  this committee and this Congress listened to the Veteran Service Organizations and have brought the funding in line with the Independent Budget The Department of Defense says there are nearly 2000 wounded with TBI  The VA is not prepared for this number of patients and TBI and PTSD have long latency periods in many sufferers  The VA must be prepared to care for many  many more  In addition  it must look back and see how many soldiers from our other wars are suffering today from TBI and PTSD  It must then care for these men and women as well as those coming home wounded today and in the future  The administration must be serious about learning what our soldiers coming home are facing when they walk through the VAs door for the first time  On March 6  2007  the president directed VA Secretary Nicholson to establish an Interagency Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes  This Task Force must be more than in name only  And I am concerned that already it is less substance and more for show  For example  the task force only receives snail mail  email and faxes  The VA needs to be serious when it looks into what our returning heroes are facing  If it cannot afford a phone line  a way to let our soldiers actually talk to someone  let us know  This Committee will be more than happy to allocate the funds  We can do it today  The task force needs more than a fancy name  It needs to listen to the people it serves The same moral obligation the folks in Sandusky  Ohio felt in 1888 to veterans of the Civil War exists today  That community came together because caring for the men and women who fought bravely for their country and suffered dearly for it deserved the best care possible  It is our moral obligation to care for those who are returning today
