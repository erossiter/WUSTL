            Brown Urges Congress To Pass Substantial Housing Reforms To Help Families Facing Foreclosure  Calls President s Plan Inadequate                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Urges Congress To Pass Substantial Housing Reforms To Help Families Facing Foreclosure  Calls President s Plan Inadequate December 6  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH   a member of the Senate Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee  today urged Congress to pass substantial housing reforms to help middle class families facing foreclosure  Brown called President George W  Bushs proposal today inadequate  Presently  a weakening U S  housing market threatens the overall economy Families across Ohio have known for a long time that we are in a housing crisis  but this administration told us that it was largely contained  Brown said  So long as it was largely contained to the Midwest  it didnt require any response  But once Wall Street started to feel the pain  this administration jumped into action   Mortgage lenders and loan servicers should establish a systematic approach to working out loans because trying to do so one by one has proven woefully inadequate  But we need to do much more  Instead of filibusters and veto threats  we need to work together to help homeowners and the communities they live in  Brown said Brown has been working hard in the Senate to pass real reforms to stem the tide of the housing crisis  200 Million in Federal Foreclosure Prevention Funds Over the next two years  nearly 2 million homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages will experience payment shocks as their loans reset in a weakening housing market  a harbinger of more foreclosures to come   Even with the proposed changes by mortgage servicers  many homeowners will require one on one counseling to navigate the system  To enable organizations to successfully accommodate increasing caseloads  Brown secured  200 million in the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations conference report for HUD certified nonprofit organizations to conduct foreclosure prevention counseling  Additional funding will allow non profits to increase training and capacity to focus on default and foreclosure prevention counseling  to outreach to homeowners for early intervention  to improve the communications between homeowners and servicers lenders  and to negotiate modified loan agreements or refinances  The fund would be administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   Brown first requested this funding in May  The conference report has passed the House of Representatives and is awaiting final approval in the Senate  Efforts to take up the conference report are being blocked by the Republicans in the Senate and the president has issued a veto threat against this bill Legislation to Hold Mortgage Brokers and Originators Accountable  In May  Brown and Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY  and Robert Casey  D PA  introduced the first major legislation addressing the current subprime foreclosure crisis  The Borrowers Protection Act of 2007 would upgrade standards that mortgage brokers and originators must abide by when making new loans to borrowers  The bill seeks to regulate mortgage brokers and originators under the Truth in Lending Act  TILA  by establishing on behalf of consumers a fiduciary duty and other standards of care  In addition  the legislation outlines standards for brokers and originators to assess a borrowers ability to repay a mortgage and holds lenders accountable for brokers and appraisers  The enforcement mechanism applied to this new section is those that currently apply under TILA  In June  the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on Browns legislation Specifically  The Borrower s Protection Act of 2007 Establishes a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers and other non bank mortgage originators  Requires originators underwrite loans at the fully indexed rate  Requires originators to create escrow accounts to pay taxes and hazard insurance  Prohibits steering  i e  brokers may not direct or counsel a consumer to rates  charges and principal amount or prepayment terms that are not appropriate or suitable for them   and Assigns liability to lenders for actions of their associated appraisers and brokers    Legislation to Reform Federal Housing Administration Loans As a member of the Senate Banking Committee  Brown supported the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  Modernization Act of 2007 which would revitalize the FHA loan program and provide a fair and affordable financing option for many borrowers  Among other things  this legislation would increase FHA single family loan limits  lower and streamline downpayment requirements and set the maximum loan amount at 100 percent of the appraised value of the home  and enhance counseling by creating a pre purchase counseling demonstration to test the usefulness of a variety of counseling options   Majority Leader Reids efforts to consider this legislation prior to the Thanksgiving recess were blocked by a Republican objection  Urge the Federal Reserve to Curb Predatory Lending Practices In April  Brown joined with Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee in urging Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to curb predatory lending practices in subprime markets  Under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act  HOEPA  of 1994  the Fed Chairman is required to take action against unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market  Brown recommended the Fed require mortgage originators evaluate borrowers ability to repay prior to making a loan  designate the failure to escrow taxes and insurance as an unfair and deceptive practice  and restrict the use of low  and no documentation loans  Brown met with Bernanke in October to underscore his support for strong regulatory action to help middle class families facing the housing crisis Legislation to Permit Primary Home Loans to be Written Down to the Fair Market Value in Bankruptcy Brown is a sponsor of The Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act  introduced by Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   which would help prevent foreclosures and prevent surrounding homes and neighborhoods from being negatively impacted  Virtually every type of personal debt  including vacation homes and family farms  can be restructured in bankruptcy with the exception of mortgages on a primary residence  This exception dates to the 1970 s  when most mortgages were fixed rate  long term agreements  The mortgage market has changed considerably since then  This legislation would Eliminate a provision of the bankruptcy law that prohibits modifications to mortgage loans on the debtors primary residence  Extend the time frame debtors are allowed for repayment  to support long term mortgage restructuring  Combat excessive fees that are sometimes charged to debtors in bankruptcy  Enact a higher homestead floor for homeowners over the age of 55  to help older homeowners who are fighting to keep their homes as they go through bankruptcy but live in states with low homestead floors  Legislation to Prevent the IRS From Colleting Taxes On Foreclosed Loans Brown is a sponsor of the The Mortgage Relief Act  introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow  D MI   which would change current law that forces individuals to pay income tax when they have had a part of their mortgage loan forgiven due to their inability to pay their mortgage  Declining home prices have left some families having to sell their homes for less than the debt they owe on them  a so called short sale  The Internal Revenue Service  IRS  currently taxes any loan forgiveness as income  The Mortgage Relief Act would relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence
