            Brown Senate Floor Speech on CAFTA and Costa Rica                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Senate Floor Speech on CAFTA and Costa Rica October 1  2007  I RISE TO SPEAK IN THIS CHAMBER ABOUT A STORY UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW IN COSTA RICA  THIS COUNTRY OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IS HAVING A NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON OCTOBER 7  NEXT WEEK  ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT  THE TRADE DEAL THIS CONGRESS PASSED BY A NARROW MARGIN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO  IT STIPULATES THAT THE LAST SIGNATORY COUNTRY MUST APPROVE THE DEAL NO LATER THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE FIRST SIGNATORY IMPLEMENTS THE AGREEMENT  FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS  THE UNITED STATES  EL SALVADOR  HONDURAS  GUATEMALA AND NICARAGUA ENACTED  COSTA RICA HAS RESISTED  MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN NEWS REPORTS ABOUT A MASSIVE RALLY OF FAIR TRADERS  WHO WANT TRADE BUT UNDER DIFFERENT RULES   AGAINST CAFTA TESTIMONY IN COSTA RICA  SOME 150 000 CITIZENS IN A COUNTRY OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE SPOKE OUT EXPRESSING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE AGREEMENT  150 000 PEOPLE AND MOST THOUGHT THAT A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE  THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUED PROTESTS INCLUDING A TWO DAY GENERAL STRIKE LAST OCTOBER  THEIR STRONG OPPOSITION TO A NAFTA STYLE AGREEMENT IN FACT  THE ISSUE OF WHETHER TO APPROVE CAFTA CAUSED SUCH UPHEAVAL THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO GO TO A PUBLIC REFERENDUM  LEGISLATORS  NOT UNLIKE OURS IN CONGRESS  DID NOT WANT TO FACE VOTERS IN THE HOME DISTRICTS IF THEY VOTED FOR THE PACT  THE AGREEMENT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED AS DOMESTIC LAW  MEANING COSTA RICA HAS TO ENACT NEW LAWS IN ORDER FOR THE TRADE AGREEMENT TO TAKE EFFECT AND THAT BOTHERS HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF COSTA RICANS BECAUSE THEY PLACE STRONG LAWS ON HEALTH  ON THE ENVIRONMENT  ON EDUCATION  ON GENERIC DRUGS    ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE HELPED TO BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN COSTA RICA  MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR LAND IS PROTECTED IN NATIONAL PARKS  MORE THAN 90  OF ELECTRICITY COMES FROM RENEWABLES  THEIR HIGHLIGHT REAL ESTATE RATES ARE WELL KNOWN WITH A STRONG HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THE LIFE EXPECTANCY IS NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN IN THIS COUNTRY THE CITIZENS HAVE SEEN WHAT NAFTA    THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT    DID TO MEXICOS MIDDLE CLASS AND TO MEXICAN FARMERS  SMALL PEASANTS FARMERS  THIS HAS CREATED STRONG RESISTANCE TO ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT CAN HANDCUFF POLICYMAKERS FROM SETTING PRO GROWTH PRO DEVELOPMENT POLICIES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY  AS THIS CHAMBER KNOWS THE DEALS ARE ABOUT MORE THAN JUST TARIFFS AND QUOTAS  THEY ARE TOP DOWN PACTS THAT LOCK IN NEW RULES ON INVESTMENT  ON FOOD SAFETY  ON SERVICES  ON PROCUREMENT  THIS MONTH THE U N  ISSUED A REPORT WARNING DEVELOPING COUPS TO BE WARY OF BILATERAL REGIONAL FREE TRADE DEALS WARNING THEM AGAINST SIGNING THESE AGREEMENTS  THE U N  CITED NAFTA AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AGREEMENT THAT MAY HAVE SHORT TERM BENEFITS BUT IN THE LONG TERM  DOES HARM  THERE IS LOTS OF TALK FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THAT FREE TRADE IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS POVERTY  YOU HEAR THAT THE PEOPLE  AS THEY SAY  OF THESE MOSTLY POOR COUNTRIES  WANT TRADE DEALS LIKE NAFTA  BUT WHAT WERE SEEING IN COSTA RICA RIGHT NOW IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING AROUND THE GLOBE WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE DEALS  GIVING TOO MUCH POWER TO MULTIWORLD CORPORATIONS  WE SEE IT IN W T O  NEGOTIATIONS THAT FALTER AS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES RESIST W T O  EXPANSION  WE SEE IT IN OHIO  IN MANS FIELD AND YOUNGSTOWN AND LIMA  WHERE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE AMERICA THE STRONGEST NATION IN THE WORLD ARE BETRAYED BY WASHINGTONS TRADE POLICY PRESIDENTS FROM BOTH PARTIES HAVE ENTERED INTO TRADE AGREEMENTS LIKE NAFTA PROMISING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS IN A RICH COMMUNITY  INSTEAD  TOO MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS  TOO OFTEN  HAVE COST MILLIONS OF JOBS AND DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES  TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I SERVED IN THE HOUSE WE CREATED A BIPARTISAN COALITION AGAINST THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT  RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS  LABOR UNIONS  ENVIRONMENTALISTS  SMALL BUSINESSES  HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES  SMALL MANUFACTURING COMPANIES  WERE PART OF THIS BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION  THEOPPOSITION THAT WAS EVIDENT IN WASHINGTON AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AROUND THE COUNTRY CAUSED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE DEALS AND PROMISES AND IN THE WORDS OF ONE SYMPATHETIC LAWMAKER TO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HELP SO THAT WE TWISTED ARMS UNTIL THEY BREAK INTO 1 000 PIECES  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION GOT WHAT IT WANTED WHEN IT PUSHED CAFTA BUT WE WON THE DEBATE  TODAY IN COSTA RICA WE SEE SIMILAR SCARE TACTICS TAKEN BY THE REFORM CAFTA ADMINISTRATION WITH A MEMO LEAKED CAUSING UPROAR  IN THE MEMO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OUTLINED A PLAN TO THE PRESIDENT THAT USES FEAR  THREATS TO LOCAL OFFICIALS  AND ATTACKS ON CAFTA OPPOSITION AS TACTICS TO WIN THE REFERENDUM  THE SECOND VICE PRESIDENT HAD TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE WHILE OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE WHETHER ANY LAWS WERE BROKEN  THE MEMO STATES    QUOTE    THE JURISDICTION WILL NOT GET A PENNY FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS   THE MEMO SAYS THE GOVERNMENT THEN NEEDS TO       QUOTE      UNQUOTE    STIMULATE FEAR AMONG CREAKS  STIMULATE FEAR  CREATE FEAR OF THE LOSS OF JOBS IF CAFTA IS NOT APPROVED  STIMULATE A FEAR OF VIOLENCE IN CIVIL STRIFE  STIMULATE A FEAR OF CHAVEZ AND CASTRO IF COSTA RICA DOES NOT APPROVE CAFTA  SPECIFICALLY  THERE HAS BEEN AN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN COSTA RICA THAT IF THIS AGREEMENT FAILS THEN THE UNITED STATES WILL PUNISH COSTA RICA BY REVOKING THE EXISTING TRADE BENEFITS THAT COSTA RICA HAS UNDER THE CARIBBEAN BASIN INITIATIVE  THAT IS SIMPLY PATENTLY FALSE  COSTA RICA WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM C B I  BECAUSE ITS THE LAW  ITS A PERMANENT PROGRAM  ITS EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON THE U S  CONGRESS  NOT AN EDICT FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION  THESE TACTICS SHOULD SOUND FAMILIAR TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO RECALL THE CAFTA DEBATE  THOSE TACTICS MADE IT CLEAR WHAT WAS AT STAKE IN COSTA RICA THIS WEEK AND WHEN THIS CHAMBER TAKES UP ISSUES OF TRADE AND NEGOTIATION  THERE IS THE NAFTA IDEOLOGY AND THE FAIR TRADE IDEOLOGY  THE DEFEAT OF THIS REFERENDUM MAY ACTUALLY  I BELIEVE  DO MORE TO IMPROVE KOREAN AND U S  RELATIONS BECAUSE ITS CLEAR THERE IS A FAIR TRADE MOVEMENT ON THE RISE HERE IN THIS CHAMBER  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  AND SURELY ACROSS THE LAND    LOOK AT ELECTIONS LAST YEAR    AND IN THE PRESIDING OFFICERS STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA AND MISSOURI AND  MINNESOTA AND VIRGINIA AND MONTANA  BECAUSE ITS CLEAR THERE IS A FAIR TRADE MOVEMENT ON THE RISE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN COSTA RICA  WE HAVE REASON TO HOPE  IF THE REFERENDUM IS DEFEATED  WE CREATE A    WE CAN CREATE A NEW TRADE AGREEMENT THAT BENEFITS WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES  SMALL BUSINESSES  PEOPLE   RELIGIOUS FOLKS  PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR MORE OF US  THAT HELPS US TO CREATE A SOLID  STRONG MIDDLE CLASS  NOT JUST SUPPORTING MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS  WE HAVE A CHOICE HERE  THE PEOPLE OF COSTA RICA HAVE A CHOICE THERE THIS WEEK  WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THE FAIR TRADE MODEL OR WE CAN REJECT THAT NAFTA CAFTA MODEL    NAFTA AND CAFTA MODEL AND WORK TOGETHER ON A NEW TRADE DEAL  A FAIR TRADE DEAL  MR  PRESIDENT  I YIELD THE FLOOR AND I NOTE THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM
