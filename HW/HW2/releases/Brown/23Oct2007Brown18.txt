            Brown Announces Senate Passage Of Labor  Health And Human Services  And Education Spending Bill                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Announces Senate Passage Of Labor  Health And Human Services  And Education Spending Bill  October 23  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   U S    D OH  today announced Senate passage of the FY 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Bill  The legislation includes three amendments proposed by Brown  Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program supports the research  exhibition  interpretation  and collection of artifacts related to the history of the Underground Railroad  Since 1998  institutions throughout the country have leveraged these dollars to educate hundreds of thousands of school children  The grant program assists both the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in  and the Underground Railroad Tour in Lorain   The Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural program provides funding to museums and educational centers to shed light on one of the most important and courageous social movements in our history  Brown said Upward Bound programs across the county are currently being evaluated by the Department of Education  Upward Bound serves low income  first generation  students at risk of not completing high school or pursuing higher education  Under the current evaluation process  students are recruited for Upward Bound and promised services that are never delivered so as to serve as a control group  Not only does this give students false hope  but serious questions remain on the effectiveness of educational research designs based on control groups  Browns amendment would halt the evaluations while an alternative method to assess performance is developed  One hundred Upward Bound programs across the country have been selected for this evaluation  ten of which are in Ohio Upward Bound programs are critically important to our nations youth and we should evaluate their effectiveness  But we should do it in a fair  ethical  and valid way  Brown said The Measure To Prevent School Violence was prompted by the tragedy in  this month  In 2002  the Department of Education and U S  Secret Service compiled a comprehensive guidance document to help schools respond appropriately when faced with a potentially dangerous student  This document has not been updated since its initial implementation  Following the Virginia Tech shooting last spring  a report of recommendations to prevent and address school violence was released  Browns amendment instructs the Department of Education to update and distribute within three months the 2002 guidelines based on findings on the Virginia Tech shooting Parents send their children to school every day trusting they will be safe  Brown said  While the risk of violence cant be eliminated  it must be minimized  By equipping schools with better information  we can help anticipate and prevent school violence  This is a simple step with enormous implications  it can save lives   In addition  the Senate 2007 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Bill would Expand Head Start services with an increase of  200 million  which is  300 million more than the presidents budget request  Make college more affordable by supporting a Pell Grant maximum award of  4 800  Enhance U S  competitiveness with a  4 8 billion dollar investment in job training  career  and technical education programs  Ensure a continued commitment to critical research at the National Institutes of Health  NIH  by increasing funding by  1 billion from last year  This is nearly a  1 3 billion increase from the presidents budget request  which had called for cutting NIH funding by  279 million  Allocate  2 24 billion for the Community Health Centers program in the Health Resources Services Administration  HRSA   This is an increase of  250 million above the presidents budget request  Begin to restore workplace protections by requiring OSHA to issue quarterly reports with timetables and benchmarks for safety and health standards  and Require the Department of Labor to report to Congress on the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement   Today  the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Bill passed the full Senate  The bill will now proceed to the House Senate Conference Committee  before final passage in both chambers  President George W  Bush has threatened to veto the legislation
