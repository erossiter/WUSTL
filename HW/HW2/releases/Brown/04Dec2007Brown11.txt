            Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Food Safety                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Food Safety December 4  2007  WASHINGTON  DC U S    D OH  today released the following opening statement from todays Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee hearing on Developing a Comprehensive Response to Food Safety Thank you  Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi for holding this hearing  This is an important topic that affects all of us in this country  When each of us goes to the market to buy our groceries  we are assuming that the food we buy is safe for our families  But over 76 million Americans are sickened each year from food borne illnesses Much of our food supply is grown in other countries  Food imports make up more and more of the food that Americans eat  But very little of this food is inspected to see if it meets safety standards  Trade policies that are poorly crafted and laxly enforced are part of the problem  Tainted imports from China and other countries have  in recent months  led to the recalls of hundreds of thousands of toys  tires  food products  and pet food products  There are a number of steps we can and should take to better ensure the safety of our food products  For one  we need to fix existing trade deals that limit the ability of safety agencies to inspect imported food and products  We also need a stronger Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Just last week  a draft report was released detailing how under resourced that agency is  The report  written by three members of the FDAs Science Board  found that the FDA does not have nearly the funds needed to perform its responsibilities  We expect the FDA to do more and more  yet we dont provide the financial backing it needs to be successful  The report suggests that as a result  the lives of Americans are at risk  This is unacceptable  In this day and age  with the wealth we have in this country  we should be confident that the food we eat is safe   We want more trade with countries around the world  but we also must protect the safety and health of our children and our families  FDA has been relying on an import plan that was developed in the 1970s when imports were low  They have risen exponentially since then  Today  trillions of dollars of goods are imported from hundreds of thousands of importers  Thousands of overseas food manufacturers are shipping to the U S   yet the FDA has little data about what happens in overseas facilities and supply chains  Congress needs to give the FDA the resources it needs to conduct inspections of foreign facilities and import operations to make sure our food supply is safe  It is not only our moral obligation to protect our communities  our families  and our children from contaminated  possibly deadly products  as members of Congress  its our duty  Our country has worked hard to build safe work places  a reliable  healthy food supply and pure drinking water  Current trade agreements  as written  limit food safety standards and border inspections  And we cant rely on foreign inspectors to ensure our safety  We need to give the FDA the resources so it can  This year  I have introduced with my Senate colleagues various bills that will boost the safety of our food supply  One bill would require country of origin labeling for processed foods  I believe that our families in Ohio and across the country have the right to know where their food comes from I also introduced the Food and Product Responsibility Act of 2007 with Senator Bob Casey  This bill would grant the FDA the authority to require recalls for fruits  vegetables  and the other food products it regulates Senator Durbin and I also introduced the Imported Food Security Act of 2007  This bill would mandate that foreign imports meet the same or better standards as those of the U S  And it would give the FDA the authority to approve and disapprove countries eligible to import  It would also establish a certification system for foreign governments or food establishments seeking to import food to the U S  Lastly  it would require the FDA to collect user fees to pay for inspections of imported food products and food safety research I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get these bills passed so we can have a safer food supply for all Americans
