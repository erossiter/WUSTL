            Opening Statement Of  At Today s Banking Committee Hearing With Chairman Bernanke                                                                                                                               Press Release    Opening Statement Of  At Today s Banking Committee Hearing With Chairman Bernanke February 14  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following opening statement at todays Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee hearing with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke entitled The First Monetary Policy Report to the Congress for 2007 Chairman Bernanke  I appreciate your joining us today to share your thoughts on the direction of monetary policy in the months ahead  I also appreciate your comments on other topics before other groups  and the steps you have taken toward greater transparency  I think it serves all of us if the Federal Reserve operates in as open a manner as possible Im sure you can appreciate that for most families in Ohio and elsewhere  many of the issues we discuss today are far removed from their day to day lives  The uncertainties they face are not those that economists worry about  They are uncertain where the money will come to pay the mortgage or the rent or the overdue utility bill  I traveled the length and breadth of the State of Ohio over the past several months  I can tell you that robust economic growth is the exception rather than the rule  And I dont think that Ohio is much different from the rest of the country So I must say that I do not share your view of the health of the American economy  Too many jobs and homes have been lost  and too many families have had their lives uprooted  I know you have acknowledged the widening gap in income in our society  and I commend you for adding your voice to this discussion  I agree with you that we should look at ways to improve the education and training of our citizens  But I dont think this is nearly enough I think globalization has had a tremendous impact on workers in this country  There is no question but that good paying manufacturing jobs have gone offshore  Of course we must trade with the world  The question is not if we will trade with other countries  rather  it is how we will trade with them and who will benefit  If the beneficiaries are limited to those with investment capital  and the losers are workers and their communities across the country  we wont have a very sustainable trade policy  We devote substantial time and effort to protecting intellectual property in our trade negotiations and enforcement  We need to do this   I certainly dont want an Ohio inventor to be ripped off by someone overseas  But we exert almost no effort to protecting the rights of our workers and their counterparts overseas  That has to change  Chairman Bernanke  I do thank you for your attention to these issues  and look forward to discussing them with you further
