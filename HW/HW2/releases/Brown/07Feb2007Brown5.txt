            Opening Statement Of  From Today s Farm Bill Hearing                                                                                                                               Press Release    Opening Statement Of  From Today s Farm Bill Hearing February 7  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following opening statement from todays Farm Bill hearing with Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns Thank you  Mr  Chairman   And thank you for joining us this morning  Secretary Johanns  The farm bill is more than a piece of legislation  it is a set of decisions that will help shape our nations future  Will the family farm survive  I cant envision a United States without family farms  I dont want to envision it  But if we are not responsible stewards of our nations agriculture sector  the family farms that are the heart of our nation will be paved over  and we will regret it   Will U S  agriculture exports flourish or will they languish  stifled by European subsidies and U S  acquiescence  Is alternative energy development a well worn sound bite or a real commitment  Will our country continue to allow children and the elderly to go to sleep hungry or will we finally patch the gaping holes in our nutrition safety net Is conservation a true priority  Will we capitalize on the opportunity to foster conservation while strengthening our agriculture sector  or will we under invest and forsake that opportunity  The farm bill is a set of decisions Some of the decisions set forth in the presidents farm bill make sense  some of them make me wonder  It makes sense to close payment limitation loopholes that benefit mega farms at the expense of the family farmer   No one but a multimillionaire wants a multimillionaire to get farm subsidies However  the devil is in the details  Farmers in my state want to make sure that subsidy changes dont inadvertently harm smaller farms  We need to make sure that any changes to the commodity program truly target enterprises for which the subsidy is gravy and still reach farmers for whom the subsidy is a lifeline I am concerned that the administrations farm bill does not sufficiently reflect concerns raised by farmers in my state about the need for stable  widely accessible crop insurance and other forms of disaster relief   One Ohio farmer told me he wasnt eligible for crop insurance because he produces apples and there is insufficient apple production in his county  We need to do something about that  Another farmer asserted that farmers dont want a hand out  they simply wants access to insurance that truly delivers on its promises  That makes sense to me   I appreciate that the president envisions increasing funding for renewable energy development  but his proposal is a drop in the bucket  We cant get to energy independence unless we truly commit to energy independence  and that means increasing and diversifying our investment in it     more Farmers in my state absolutely support alternative energy development  but they urge us to keep an eye on the big picture  Alternative energy should complement other agriculture enterprises  not undermine them  We need to be cognizant of the impact of alternative energy development on feed costs  on land costs  and on commodity prices   The same holds true of conservation programs  The administrations bill would invest enough in conservation to say he invested in it  but not enough to enable the CSP and other conservation programs to actually work Of all the titles in the presidents farm bill  the nutrition title  in conjunction with the presidents budget  is the one that perplexes me most  The president has proposed cutting 250 000 low income Americans off of food stamps in order to pay for others to gain access   Taking food stamps away from some people in need in order to give them to other people in need   Thats not progress  Its patronizingWas any moral litmus test applied to the presidents budget before he let it go out the door  Theres scant evidence of it  The president would not only cut people from food stamps  he would eliminate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program  which provides nutritious food to low income seniors  The president claims that the CSFP duplicates food stamps  Low income seniors in my state and the caring individuals who advocate for them tell a much different story  According to Lisa Hamler Fugitt  who directs the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks  the average monthly income of CSFP participants in Ohio is  600 or less a month  They receive a 45 pound box of food through the CSFP program  Some of these seniors are eligible for food stamps  but they receive only  10 a month  Wheres the duplication Under the presidents proposal  these seniors would be kicked off the CSFP  They would then receive transitional food stamps worth  20 a month  for the next six months  Let me repeat the amount they will receive  Its  20 a month  Think about what you spend on food  They receive  20 a month   I need to ask again  was any moral litmus test applied before the president OKd this budget  Our nation is the wealthiest in the world  yet we turn the other way as children to go to bed hungry night after night   Our nation is the wealthiest in the world  yet we allow working moms like Rhonda Stewart  who testified before this committee last week  to pretend shes not hungry so her son wont worry when theres no food on her plate  Our nation is the wealthiest in the world  yet we would kick some low income Americans off food stamps so others can receive them Thats not going to fly with the people I represent in Ohio  Ohioans are far more compassionate than that  We need to enhance the food stamp program  not cannibalize it  Only about half of all eligible families actually receive food stamps   We need to simplify enrollment and increase public awareness and outreach  Benefits are woefully insufficient and are declining in purchasing power  As it stands  beneficiaries receive  on average   1 per person per meal  We need to increase the benefit so that food stamps do what food stamps are supposed to do  foster nutrition and prevent hunger  The farm bill is a set of decisions that will help shape our nations future  Those decisions should reflect our values   Thank you  Mr  Chairman
