            With Veto Override Vote Expected This Week  Ohio Congressional Delegation Urges Colleagues To Vote For Children s Health Care                                                                                                                               Press Release    With Veto Override Vote Expected This Week  Ohio Congressional Delegation Urges Colleagues To Vote For Children s Health Care October 16  2007  Washington  DC  With both the Senate and House expected to vote this week on over riding the presidential veto of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  legislation  U S    D OH  and Representatives Stephanie Tubbs Jones  Tim Ryan  and Betty Sutton came together on a news conference call to urge their colleagues to vote in favor of childrens health care  The CHIP legislation would provide  35 billion in additional funding for the program over the next five years  In its first year  Ohio would receive an additional  93 million to insure children  an increase of 43 percent  The additional funds would not only maintain coverage for the children already enrolled in the program  but would reach millions more children nationwide who are eligible for the program but are not yet enrolled  The beauty of the Childrens Heath Insurance Program is it works  Senator Brown said  This helps millions of children to receive preventive care in the doctors office instead of acute care in the emergency room  Before he vetoed the legislation  I wish the president met the children and parents I talked to in Ohio  Republicans and Democrats must unite around this goal  as we did in 1996 when the program was created  and override the veto This week  we will have an opportunity to expand one of the most effective government programs implemented in the last decade  the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  by overriding President Bushs veto  said Rep  Tubbs Jones  We must expand this program if our society truly wishes to bridge the divide between the Haves and the Have Nots and ensure that our children receive the much needed healthcare they deserve It is morally unacceptable for the President to have vetoed legislation that would cover 10 million children with healthcare  said Rep  Ryan  It is time that our colleagues who are on the fence to decide once and for all if it is more important to protect our children  or protect this Presidents failed policies The SCHIP bill we passed would allow 122 000 uninsured Ohio children to have health coverage  said Rep  Sutton  It was worked out between members of both political parties  and in both chambers of Congress   It represents a continuation of a program started under a different president and in a different Congress   Its supported by an overwhelming majority of this nations governors  including our Governor Ted Strickland  and it is supported by the vast majority of this nations citizens   Yet  despite this broad consensus for this legislation  the president insists he knows better and that it has to be his way or no way   Our children deserve better Currently  50 million Americans have no health insurance  including more than 9 million children  Being uninsured means going without needed care  It means minor illnesses become major ones because care is delayed  Tragically  it also means that one significant medical expense can wipe out a familys life savings  This legislation will preserve coverage for 6 million children currently covered by SCHIP and extend coverage to nearly 4 million uninsured children  according to the nonpartisan CBO
