            Statement Of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs On Disabled American Veterans                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs On Disabled American Veterans February 27  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Joint Hearing of the Committees on Veterans Affairs on Disabled American Veterans Thank you Mr  Chairman  Thank you Commander Barton for speaking with the Veterans Affairs Committee today and thanks to all members of the Disabled American Veterans here with us today  The nation is grateful for all the work you do on behalf of Americas veterans Two weeks ago  I met with a group of very young  very proud veterans who had recently returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  They were from Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  I was very impressed  Not only were they highly intelligent  well spoken and proud  but they were incredibly organized and savvy public opinion and public policy operatives dedicated to serving veterans of the current wars overseas  Several of these young men are also members of Disabled American Veterans  I couldnt help thinking about how the DAV came about and how it continues to serve and inspire veterans today Eighty seven years ago  in my home state of Ohio  the DAV began  s Robert S  Marx saw that the Great Wars returning doughboys were terribly neglected  There were few government support agencies then and those that did exist were woefully underfunded  So Captain Marx took action and began a new fight  He joined with a small group of recently returned veterans and helped establish the Disabled American Veterans of the World War  DAVWW   Within a year  250 veterans met in  and created what would become todays Disabled American Veterans  Today  the DAV is needed more than ever  I know the DAV has an extensive list of legislative priorities this year  Im familiar with them and I know I do not have time to discuss them all today  I wanted to highlight a few of the key DAV initiatives and concerns that this Committee will be working on over the coming year The Department of Veterans Affairs needs to be fully funded and funded on time  We need to ensure that the VA gets the money it needs to provide for all veterans whether 18 or 108  I understand that the administrations proposed budget is short in nearly every category from the independent budget  We must find out why this is so  But that is step one  because we must do this in a timely fashion   The VA needs to get its funding on time so it can adequately prepare  Plans for construction and programs cannot be delayed because the VA doesnt have a budget  Not only does this handcuff the VA  it ends up costing taxpayers more in the long run as budgets change and cost rise over time  I am not a lawyer and but I am concerned about the possible implications of Public Law 109 461 that would permit lawyers to charge for services in the preparation  presentation  and prosecution of claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs  Like most everyone in this room  if I need legal help I get a lawyer  but a veteran shouldnt need a lawyer to get the care and benefits he or she has earned and deserves  While this is the law  the VA is still formulating the regulations so there is still time to work to ensure that veterans arent denied earned benefits or put in the position to be exploited by an unethical lawyer The Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have put a new and troubling strain on the VA  There are nearly 550 amputees from the current conflicts  We must make sure that the VA is prepared to care for these brave men and women  At the same time  we must ensure that current disabled veterans arent forgotten or neglected and that funds and resources arent shifted  but are augmented to meet the needs of these new veterans  The VA must plan and be prepared for more disabled veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan The VA must care for the veterans suffering from PTSD and other mental disorders  The VAs specialized health care programs like the ones for mental health care and blind rehabilitation services must be fully funded  More and more returning veterans are suffering from PTSD  As we learn more and more about the latency period in some sufferers and its impact on families  we must ensure that the VA is prepared and has the resources to care for current and future sufferers of PTSD and similar disorders I look forward to working with the DAV as we address the challenges the Department of Veterans Affairs faces today  Lets honor the legacy of Captain Robert Marx and all the members of the DAV by ensuring that the resources and tools necessary to provide the care needed and earned are delivered with honor and respect  Thank you Mr  Chairman
