            Senate Passes Measure By Schumer  Brown And Casey To Grant  100M To Housing Nonprofits To Help Prevent Foreclosures                                                                                                                               Press Release    Senate Passes Measure By Schumer  Brown And Casey To Grant  100M To Housing Nonprofits To Help Prevent Foreclosures  September 12  2007  WASHINGTON  DCThe U S  Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a measure proposed by U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Sherrod Brown  D OH   and Robert P  Casey  D PA   to grant  100 million in funding to housing non profits on the front lines of the fight to prevent a national foreclosure crisis from the subprime lending fallout   The measurewhich would provide resources to government approved agencies that help negotiate between borrowers and lenders to keep families in their homeswas contained in the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development  HUD  spending bill that passed the full Senate this morning  For the millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes  these nonprofits can provide shelter from the foreclosure storm  said Schumer  the Chairman of both the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing  This investment will pay for itself many times over  through the avoidance of foreclosures and the pain and suffering they cost this country  both in economic and non economic terms  But government alone cannot solve this problem   It will require a major commitment by others as well  particularly those banks and mortgage servicers which have the ability  through loan modifications and refinancings  to help homeowners avoid foreclosures  These funds will help thousands of families stuck in bad subprime loans  but there is much more work to be done  Senator Brown said  It is not just the economy and speculation that are behind todays crisis  but deceptive marketing by too many unethical mortgage brokers  We need tougher regulation of the industry  and we needed it yesterday  I have heard the heartbreaking stories of Pennsylvanians who have had the American dream turn into a nightmare as they lost their homes in the subprime mortgage crisis  said Senator Casey  By helping those who are trying to keep people in their homes  this bill can have a profound effect on millions of families The funding will benefit HUD certified nonprofit programs that perform one on one counseling with homeowners and perform negotiations with a variety of mortgage industry stakeholders  Specifically  the  100 million in funding will allow these non profits to Increase training and capacity to focus on default and foreclosure prevention counseling  Seek out and engage homeowners to ensure early intervention Improve the communications between homeowners and servicers lenders  and  Negotiate modified loan agreements or refinances       The measure is particularly timely given the 2 million homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages who are expected to experience payment shocks as their loans reset in a weakening housing market  Acting to prevent these foreclosures is not only important from the perspective of protecting entire communities  but it also makes good economic sense  Foreclosures can cost up to  80 000 for all stakeholdershomeowners  neighbors  cities and local governments  lenders  and loan servicers  Meanwhile  estimates suggest that foreclosure prevention counseling can cost as little as  1 000 per household  The initiative by Sens  Schumer  Brown  and Casey has been welcomed by the nonprofit entities  which have seen demand for their services soar in recent months  Among the groups supportive of the effort are  National NeighborWorks Association  Center for Responsible Lending  Consumer Federation of America  CFA   National Community Reinvestment Coalition  NCRC   and Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  ACORN   Schumer  Brown and Casey first proposed the measure last May  at the same time they introduced the Borrowers Protection Act that would impose first of its kind controls on the largely unregulated broker industry  Because there are so many distressed homeowners right now  the non profits are overwhelmed   Theyve already received more calls for help this year than they did all of last year  and things are likely to get worse before they get better   The non profits simply do not have the resources to deal with this crisis  Schumer said    In a letter to federal financial market regulators last month  Schumer sought the regulators help in jawboning industry players from mortgage lenders to loan servicers to contribute still greater resources to the nonprofit groups  In addition  in a personal meeting with Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo last week  Schumer urged the company to consider committing  250 million in funding to the groups  Both the Bush administration and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke have both expressed support for the work that these nonprofits are doing to prevent foreclosures
