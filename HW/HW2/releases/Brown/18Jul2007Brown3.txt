            Testimony Of  From Today s Commerce Committee Hearing On Safety Of Chinese Imports                                                                                                                               Press Release    Testimony Of  From Today s Commerce Committee Hearing On Safety Of Chinese Imports July 18  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  released the following testimony from todays Senate Commerce Committee Hearing titled Safety of Chinese Imports  Oversight and Analysis of the Federal Response Thank you  Mr  Chairman for the opportunity to be here today  Thank you to the witnesses for their testimony  which I look forward to reading  Not long ago  when Americans made food  or used ingredients like sugar  salt  and vinegar  the products used tended to be made locally  The products and ingredients were known to those who used them  and to those who ate them  Today  it is nearly impossible for American consumers to know where their food comes from  How did this happen First  food scientists have found ways to use manufactured ingredients to cut costs  as well as preserve the shelf life of food and prevent mold  And second  as we have seen with industrial and high tech manufacturing  ingredient manufacturing has also moved to other countries  These jobs have moved for the same reason  the labor is cheaper  and the materials are cheaper  In Ohio  at Krogers or Heinens  much of the apple juice on shelves comes from China  But unlike Ohios apple growers who use real apples or apple concentrate to make apple juice and applesauce  China uses a chemical called inulin that tastes just like real apple juice  The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has not been able to identify the chemical in all juice bottles  even if the label says 100 percent apple juice Or  take the wheat bread our kids eat at lunch which might contain wheat from the United States  But  it most likely also contains wheat gluten  the ingredient that makes the bread chewy  and 80 percent of wheat gluten in the world comes from China  So these compounds go into products that might  in the end  be manufactured in the United States  It may even say Made in the USA on the label  But it is most likely that these compounds are coming from foreign countries  It is not just China either  In just 2006  the FDA has listed more than 300 foreign products  including seafood from Vietnam  green onions from Mexico  cottage cheese from the Philippines  and on and on and on  Food imports constitute a growing share of what Americans eat and what is sold on grocery shelves across the country  Shipments of food into the United States are more than four times what they were in 1996  Last year  less than 1 percent overall shipments of food coming into the United States were sampled for inspection  Individual shipments of food from China have gone from 82 000 shipments in 2002 to 199 000 in 2006 What concerns me  and families in Ohio and throughout the country  is that the FDA cannot protect our food supply given its current structure and authority  and given its resources  This administrations imported food safety plan is to roll the dice and take our chances with more free trade  Last week  the Office of Management and Budget cleared a new rule proposed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  that eases the importation of certain new foreign fruits and vegetables into the United States  OMB approved the rule within just one week  When it comes to imported food safety and this administration  the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing As a step towards addressing this serious  long term problem  Senator Durbin  a leader on food safety issues  and I introduced the Imported Food Security Act  The bill gives FDA the authority to approve or disapprove of countries eligible to import into the United States  It requires the FDA to collect user fees on imported food products and uses that revenue to fund inspectors and to fund new  cutting edge food safety research  as we confront the ever increasing threats posed to our food supply As we will hear from the panel this morning  it is certainly not just imported food that we need to address  Last month  when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  told the importer of imported defective tires  Foreign Tire Sales  FTA   to recall the tires  the company said it would have to file bankruptcy if it issued the recall  This unfortunate incident highlights a growing concern  namely  who is held to account for producing these products that put the lives of Americans in danger  When American distributors rely on imports for their sales  we must ensure that they can afford a recall and ensure that there is liability  on our shores   for products that  while likely cheaper  may not meet the same standards consumers have grown accustomed Right now I am writing legislation that requires a safety recall bond that guarantees if a domestic distributor of tire and auto parts has a safety defect  that there is a system set up that guarantees by a third party that the distributor can afford the recall  The situation we saw last month with Foreign Tire Sales must be prevented in the future  Over the last several years we have heard more Americans express a demand for a new trade policy different than the NAFTA model  that allows workers to compete on a level playing field  The trade policy this government has chosen over the past decade has decimated manufacturing  and with that choice  we must adapt to our consumption of an ever increasing number and variety of products that do not meet the standards we expect from American manufacturers   Americans  if theyre so fortunate  eat three meals a day  We have a wealth of products that make our lives easier  For food and product safety inspection  there is no opportunity for downtime  Food and product safety is not an option  its an imperative  American families no more need to accept questionable imports today than they accepted adulterated meat from our own stockyards one hundred years ago  It is time once again for Congress to act
