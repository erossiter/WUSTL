            Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Follow On Biologics                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s HELP Hearing On Follow On Biologics March 8  2007     WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Hearing with on Follow on Biologics Thank you  Mr  Chairman  And thanks to Senator Schumer and our other witnesses for joining us this morning  Todays debate about follow on biologics is rooted in a much larger issue  It reflects the fundamental tension between forces propelling health care costs upward  and those compelling  or trying to compel  them downward  Americans want access to safe and effective cures for disease and disability  they want longer and healthier lives  The health care industry wants to deliver those cures  and make a lot of money in the process  So the demand for health care is strong and the supply of health care is exploding  at least for those who can afford it  Those forces are working together to push costs sky high American employers want to remain competitive in a global marketplace  while still offering employer sponsored health insurance  As the costs of insurance grow  their ability to fulfill both goals is being severely tested  Policymakers at the federal  state and local level  or at least most of them  want to help ensure that every American  regardless of income  can get the health care they need  They also want to balance their respective budgets Thats where the tension is  Reliable demand  ever increasing supply  and limited dollars to pay for it all  Something has got to give  We need to either figure out a way to grow our economy faster than the existing pace of health care spending  or somehow bring spending under control without compromising access  quality  or innovation  And thats why were here this morning  Biologics that cost between  10 000 and  100 000 per patient per year are the elephant in the room  They typify the economic opportunity  the life saving potential  and the bank breaking price of modern health care By getting follow on biologics into the market  we can apply the invisible hand of price competition to bring the costs of biologics down  It makes sense along all three fronts  Competition creates new economic opportunities  competition breeds innovation  and competition drives prices down  Bringing follow on biologics to the market wont  in and of itself  prevent a health care train wreck  but it will undoubtedly expand access to lifesaving drugs and save public and private health care dollars that are scarce  It would be irresponsible not to pursue a path to follow on biologics  And it would be irresponsible not to do it now I commend Senators Schumer and Collins  who introduced the Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  and Mr  Waxman and Mrs  Emerson  who have introduced a similar bill in the other body  These bills lay out a framework that would enable FDA to evaluate and approve comparable and interchangeable biologics  Knowing the authors of these bills  I am completely confident that there has been no intention to cut corners on safety so as to secure more or faster approvals of follow on biologics  In fact  these authors are dedicated drug safety advocates  It is far more likely that they would err on the side of safety than place a single patient at risk  The reason I am not yet a cosponsor of S  623 is that I wanted the opportunity to hear from those who have concerns about this bill  in case there are unintended gaps in safety that need to be addressed  In the process of gathering information  Ive heard a good deal about the European Model for biologic follow on access  Id like to hear more  One thing to keep in mind  though  Most European countries negotiate the prices they pay for medicines  Price competition plays a less important role in affordability there than it does in our country  where we are passive price takers  Ultimately  the European timeframe for approval of follow on biologics may be longer than ours for reasons other than safety I am looking forward to our discussion today and to working with Senator Schumer  Chairman Kennedy  Ranking Member Enzi and other interested members to put a process in place that will enable patients to obtain biologics at a more affordable price  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
