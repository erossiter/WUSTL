            Brown Statement From Commerce Subcommittee Hearing On U S  China Trading Relationship                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Statement From Commerce Subcommittee Hearing On U S  China Trading Relationship July 25  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  released the following testimony from todays Senate Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce  Trade and Tourism on the U S   China Trading Relationship Thank you  Mr  Chairman for the opportunity to be here today  Thank you to the witnesses for their testimony  which I look forward to hearing  The United States most imbalanced trade relationship is with China  When proponents of Chinas entry into the WTO argued that Congress should grant it permanent normal trade relations  they told us this would assure Chinas move to be more of a market economy  They said that it would help promote growth and opportunity for the people of both our nations  Unfortunately  on both counts  that theory has been proven dead wrong    Experts  including James Mann of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies  have stated that the argument used to pass the China trade deal was a false paradigm  Eating at McDonalds and wearing blue jeans does not mean China has become a vibrant democracy  Yet Chinas economy grew last year at more than a 10  rate  proving that China has a successful manufacturing plan  something we lack today  We have a  235 billion trade deficit with China alone  The Economic Policy Institute recently reported nearly 2 million U S  jobs lost since Chinas entry into the WTO  66 000 of those jobs lost in Ohio  When Chinas efforts to promote their own interests come at the expense of ours  when they engage in predatory and exclusionary trade practices  we do have a right and  indeed  a duty  to speak out and take action  China subsidizes its industries to make its products less expensive in the marketplace  Often  China gives bank loans with no obligation to repay them  and then says it cannot float its currency because the banks are too weak Congress will soon consider legislation that addresses currency manipulation  It is now widely accepted that China manipulates its currency to make our exports more expensive for their consumers  by pegging its currency to the dollar with fluctuations allowed only with a narrow band  Best estimates show currency misalignment is in itself a 40 percent subsidy As if American manufacturing could even compete against these forces  Chinas workers are denied basic human rights and its governments disregard for health and environmental oversight has turned China into a cauldron of pollution and environmental waste  This hurts our workers and it hurts their people  too  Misguided U S  trade policies have saddled every American with a tremendous burden and put control of our own economic destiny at risk Industrial BaseThe decimation of our defense industrial manufacturing base poses threats to our national security  With the increasing globalization of supply and the offshore outsourcing of production to China by more and more companies  we open ourselves to tremendous risk that  in my view  has not been addressed by this administration  I look forward to comments this panel may have about this area of our trade relations with China  Unsafe importsAmerican manufacturing is in a crisis  and we are seeing that not just in jobs  but increasingly in the quality and safety of imported food and products  We have seen it with pet food  toothpaste  toys like Thomas the Tank  tires and this trend is deadly  Last year a Chinese family that lost their daughter because of a tainted antibiotic she was prescribed for her tonsil infection  We learned this week that the Chinese manufacturer of that antibiotic also exports Vitamin C to the U S   As we have seen with industrial and high tech manufacturing  ingredient manufacturing has also moved to other countries  These jobs have moved for the same reason  the labor is cheaper  and the materials are cheaper Many of the ingredients and compounds that go into products might  in the end  be manufactured in the United States  It may even say Made in the USA on the label  But it is most likely that these compounds are coming from foreign countries  Individual shipments of food from China have gone from 82 000 shipments in 2002 to 199 000 in 2006 We have more food and food ingredients to inspect  and fewer inspectors to do it  It is free trade on the cheap  if you will The trade policy this government has chosen over the past decade has decimated manufacturing  and with that choice  we must adapt to our consumption of an ever increasing number and variety of products that do not meet the standards we expect from American manufacturers  Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today  and I look forward to the discussion
