            In Wake Of National Student Loan Scandal  Brown Unveils New Legislation To Cut Student Loan Costs  Key Senate Panel Passes Higher Education Bill                                                                                                                               Press Release    In Wake Of National Student Loan Scandal  Brown Unveils New Legislation To Cut Student Loan Costs  Key Senate Panel Passes Higher Education Bill  June 20  2007  WASHINGTON  In the wake of the national student loan scandals this year  U S    D OH  today unveiled new legislation addressing increasing student loan debt  Also today  the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee passed the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Amendments of 2007  which would increase student aid  reform the student loan industry  and save taxpayer dollars The price of college is skyrocketing  and more and more students and their families are forced to use student loans to pay for their college expenses  Brown said  We need to make the commitment that everyone who wants to go to college can To address increasing student loan debt  Brown will introduce legislation this week that would create a new federal student loan program at no cost to taxpayers  The interest rates would be set by the Secretary of Education and would likely be significantly less than the 12 19 percent students face for the same type of loans today in the private sector  The loans would be available to all students through the Department of Education  and potential savings to borrowers could be in the tens of billions of dollars  In the past 20 years  the cost of college has tripled nationally  However  federal financial aid has not kept up  forcing families to rely on student loans  both federal and private  Thousands of recent Ohio high school graduates and their parents are buried by complex student loan applications  These applications typically contain pages of fine print  often hiding fees and features that are not adequately explained  Meanwhile  recent investigations show lenders and even some financial aid officers exploit the student loan system  with students paying the price   Under current law  student lenders provide an estimate of how much a student will have to pay in total  including interest  in order to pay off the loan  but only after the student has graduated  This leaves students without any real concept of their total long term payments when they sign up for a loan Nationally  nearly two out of every three students have student loan debt  up from less than one half in 1993  and the actual amount of debt from undergraduate loans also has soared  Over the past decade  debt levels for graduating seniors climbed from  9 250 to  19 200  a 58 percent increase after accounting for inflation Earlier today  the Senate HELP Committee passed the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Amendments of 2007  which included provisions to assist college affordability  The legislation would increase access for low income students by raising the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 and increasing it to  5 400 by 2011  protect borrowers by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income  protect students from being penalized for working while in school  and encourage public service by providing loan forgiveness for public service employees  To reform the student loan system  the legislation would ensure that colleges recommend lenders that would be most beneficial for students  eliminate conflict of interest by prohibiting payments to school officials from lenders  and cut subsidies to lenders  Finally  the legislation would simplify the seven page Free Application for Federal Financial Aid  FAFSA  by creating a new 2 page EZ FAFSA for low income students  and phase out the current 7 page FAFSA for all applicants within five years Brown also authored three initiatives in the legislation that came out of Committee today     The Early Childhood Education Professional Development and Career System  Browns legislation  S  1431  co sponsored by U S  Senator George Voinovich  R OH   which would authorize competitive grants to help states attract  train  and retain high quality early childhood educators  States chosen to receive a grant would form a task force to develop strategies and would be required to look at all aspects of the early childhood profession      Reauthorization of the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program  Browns legislation  S  1592  co sponsored by Senator Voinovich  which would continue a competitive grant program through the Department of Education to research  display  interpret  and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad      Provisions authorizing Project GRAD nationally   GRAD is a nonprofit education reform program that began in Houston in 1992 and currently is helping more than 132 000 low income and minority students attend college  GRAD is the only Kindergarten through college program that delivers research based results on a significant national scale  In Ohio  there are three GRAD sites located in Lorain  Akron  and
