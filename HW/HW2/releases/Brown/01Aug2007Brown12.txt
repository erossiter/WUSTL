            Brown Statement On Legislation Addressing Currency Manipulation                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Statement On Legislation Addressing Currency Manipulation August 1  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  released the following statement from todays Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs executive session considering legislation addressing currency manipulation by China and other counties Mr  Chairman  I want to thank you and Ranking Member Shelby for your leadership in giving our workers and manufacturers a fair shake in international trade  Almost twenty years ago this Committee played an integral role in shaping the Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988  Among the contributions this Committee built into that legislation  which I think guides our work in this Congress  is requiring the Treasury Department to identify countries that manipulate their currency in order to gain competitive advantages Currency manipulation has been a major contributor to our nations trade imbalance  now exceeding  800 billion and more than  233 billion with China alone  Each month when the Census Bureau releases trade deficit numbers  its like the movie Groundhog Day  One record after another  Chinas RMB is undervalued by at least 40 percent  due to the governments strong efforts to keep it artificially low  Our economic relationship with China is one of critical importance to the working men and women of Ohio  where we have lost 180 000 manufacturing jobs since 2001including more than 66 000 jobs to China since we passed PNTR  The dramatic influx of Chinese manufactured products  aided by an artificially low currency  has clearly contributed to the loss of jobs in Ohio  Hundreds of small contract manufacturing businesses in our state have been forced to close since 2001 due to unfair trade practices in China and other non market economies We need to think carefully about where these trends are leading us  Manufacturing is not only important to our economy  its essential to our national security  What is happening in Ohio and in other manufacturing states has dramatic implications for our nation as a whole I remain disappointed that the administration so actively opposes any meaningful effort to address this enormous imbalance  The administrations approach to currency imbalances is to procrastinate  to leave it to another administration  The administration talks about the complex challenges China faces in moving towards a responsible stakeholder  It talks about reforms through forums like the Strategic Economic Dialogue  Well  even if it will be another president who takes a more proactive approach  it is evident that this Congress is taking action Im proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation that we are marking up today  I am also a supporter of the Fair Currency Act  which has been introduced by Senators Stabenow and Bunning  which designates exchange rate misalignment as an export subsidy  and therefore subject to countervailing duty law  While we may not tackle that issue today  it is essential that we do so when this issue reaches the Senate floor  Our manufacturers cannot and should not have to battle Chinese currency manipulation and they cannot and should not lose out to unfair competition from firms in China that are propped up by this heavy government support  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
