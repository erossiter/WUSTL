            Brown  Harkin  Durbin Secure Language In The Farm Bill To Create New Revenue Protection Program For Farmers                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown  Harkin  Durbin Secure Language In The Farm Bill To Create New Revenue Protection Program For Farmers  October 25  2007  Washington  DC  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Sherrod Brown  D OH   and Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that the committee passed version of the 2007 Farm Bill contains language creating an optional revenue counter cyclical program designed to improve the safety net for farmers by replacing current price support programs with a comprehensive revenue protection program   The program  called Average Crop Revenue  ACR   is based in large part on legislation introduced by Senators Durbin and Brown in late July called the Farm Safety Net Improvement Act   The ACR was originally included in the Chairmans Mark of the 2007 Farm Bill   The program would have provided farmers with a state based revenue counter cyclical program to protect against losses in both yield and price   In lieu of direct payments  farmers opting into the program would be provided with a fixed payment of  15 per acre   The program also would have been integrated with farmers crop insurance policies to reduce duplicative payments and provide producers with relief on the cost of crop insurance   During todays Senate Agriculture Committee action  an amendment was accepted that weakened the original language by removing a provision that allowed farmers to reduce their crop insurance premiums   I am proud that the 2007 Farm Bill will offer farmers much needed choice  Farmers can either stay with the traditional programs that do little to protect against drops in revenue  or switch to a forward looking policy that better protects against volatile crop prices  natural disasters  and rising production costs  This is true reform for farmers and taxpayers  Unfortunately  changes made in committee will not allow farmers to take advantage of reduced crop insurance premiums that the Durbin Brown bill originally envisioned  I will continue to work on behalf of Ohio farmers to strengthen the program as it moves to the floor of the Senate  said Senator Brown  the first Senator from Ohio in 40 years to serve on the Agriculture CommitteeAlthough the average crop revenue program was weakened in committee  the inclusion of an optional revenue based counter cyclical program is a positive step forward for Illinois farmers and the future of agriculture policy  said Durbin    The proposal included in Chairman Harkins bill is a significant step forward and it will help us make our support programs work better for both producers and taxpayers    While I am disappointed that the Committee failed to include the whole ACR package  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the program provides producers with a real choice   Under the ACR proposal  the federal government would provide a payment when a farmers actual revenue falls below 90 percent of the forecasted revenue for a specific crop   Previously  the program integrated private insurance with the state program  however  this element was removed during todays markup   The optional ACR program in the Farm Bill would replace existing counter cyclical payments and loan deficiency payments with a state level revenue protection program which will save taxpayers more than  3 billion compared to the current program  The benefits of this program are          Better protection for farmers by protecting revenue rather than merely price as the current system does  Revenue protection fixes many of the holes in the existing safety net  Currently  farmers fail to receive assistance even though they face real losses in revenue when prices are high but yields are low  By protecting farmers yields  this program also reduces the need for ad hoc disaster assistance          Less production distortions by using a revenue target that adjusts with the market rather than politically set target prices and loan rates  Current programs discourage farmers to plant for market demand  This revenue protection program reduces the incentive to overproduce on marginal land and helps reduce production distortions          Equitable treatment across crops resulting in planting decisions being made based on market signals not the government program  All commodities are given equal protection based on market risk rather than federally set targets     Savings to taxpayers because of the efficiencies created by the program
