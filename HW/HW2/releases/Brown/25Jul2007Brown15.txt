            Statement Of  From Today s Joint Economic Committee Hearing                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Joint Economic Committee Hearing  July 25  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  released the following statement from todays Joint Economic Committee entitled A Local Look at the National Foreclosure Crisis   Families  Neighborhoods  Economy Under Siege Mr  Chairman  I am pleased that you have called todays hearing to look more closely at the current mortgage crisis and the toll it is taking on a single community   I also want to thank your staff for all of their hard work  Mrs  Sweet and Ms  Anderson  I appreciate your traveling here to join us to tell their stories  People should not have to go through what you have been through  I also want to thank Mr  Wade  Councilman Brancatelli  and Jim Rokakis for joining us as well  Each of them has been working hard on this problem for years and we are indebted to them Thanks to its location on the shores of Lake Erie  during the industrial age  helped build America   Iron ore came down by barge from Minnesota  while railroads carried coal from the south  Steel mills sprang up throughout Northeast Ohio  manned by immigrants  new and old  from around the world  Many of the Poles and Czechs who worked in the steel mills settled in a neighborhood of  that came to be known as Slavic Village  a solid  working class neighborhood  Most of the steel mills have been shuttered  but the neighborhood lived on  As our witnesses will testify  today Slavic Village and communities like it are fighting for their lives   The economy is certainly a big part of Ohios problems  but the steel mills shut down years ago and a stagnant economy is unfortunately nothing new  Unemployment has actually been falling slightly over the past two years in Ohio  while the number of sub prime loans in delinquency has climbed steadily  And whats true for Ohio in general is also true for the  area and Slavic Village  Both have been rebuilding over the past several years  And if you look at the state of Ohio on a county by county basis  there doesnt seem to be much of a relationship between jobs and foreclosures  Counties with low unemployment rates have high rates of delinquency  and vice versa Delinquency rates today approach those in the last recession  But we are told our economy is doing great  Wall Street may not agree  The biggest mortgage lender in the country lost 10 percent off its stock price yesterday and the markets were down 2 percent because of worries about sub prime loans  But market swings only tell half the story  Sure  hedge fund investors have lost money and credit has tightened  But there are a lot of people in Washington  DC who do not fully understand what lies behind these numbers  Behind these numbers are thousands and thousands of people like Mrs  Sweet and Ms  Anderson  communities like Slavic Village  and counties like Cuyahoga  Thats why todays hearing is so important I know some people want to dismiss the mortgage crisis as merely a problem for part of the Midwest  Even if that were the case  it would demand our nations attention just as much as a flood or tornado  A man made disaster is still a disaster  is the canary in the coal mine  What has happened there is beginning to happen in New York and California and Florida and Nevada and Colorado  Millions of people across the country have been sold these loans that are designed to default  putting their life savings at risk In the face of this crisis  Congress needs to act  We shouldnt have to wait for this to become a crisis for investors on Wall Street  when our witnesses are living through a crisis every day in the streets of Slavic Village and communities throughout Ohio  We shouldnt have to wait for the regulators to act  because every day we wait thousands of families will have their exploding loans reset to unaffordable levels  And we shouldnt have to wait for the market to self correct  That correction costs a lot more than a hit to a hedge fund or a lenders stock  it costs the hopes and dreams of homeowners who were guilty only of trying to make a better life for their families Communities like Slavic Village need our help now  They have been robbed of too much already  while the federal government has turned its head away  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
