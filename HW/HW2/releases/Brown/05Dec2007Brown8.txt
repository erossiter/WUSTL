            Nearly 2 2 Million Ohioans Are In Families That Will Spend More Than 10 Percent Of Their Pre Tax Income On Health Care Costs in 2008                                                                                                                               Press Release    Nearly 2 2 Million Ohioans Are In Families That Will Spend More Than 10 Percent Of Their Pre Tax Income On Health Care Costs in 2008 December 5  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH   Congresswoman Betty Sutton  D Copley Township   Ron Pollack of Families USA  the national organization for health care consumers  and Cathy Levine of Universal Health Care Action Network of Ohio today held a news conference call to release a new report on Ohio families that will spend more than 10 and 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs in 2008  While much national attention has focused on the uninsured  there is an almost invisible but growing crisis among insured families  as rising health care costs devour an ever growing portion of their pre tax income  More than 7 million Ohioans  some insured and some not  are living one health care crisis away from financial disaster  this is a national embarrassment  said Senator Brown  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee  The government needs to take steps to bring health care costs down and cover the uninsured In Ohio alone  2 195 000 people under the age of 65  86 2 percent of which are insured  are in families that will spend more than 10 percent of their pre tax family income on health care costs in 2008  according to a report issued today by the consumer health organization Families USA  In addition  there are 589 000 Ohioans in families that will spend more than 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs in 2008 Health care is the top domestic concern among voters in the upcoming elections  This new report is designed to project how significant health care costs will be for family budgets when voters go to the polls in 2008   The Families USA report is the first of its kind to document these costs on a state specific basis  The key findings in the report show that high health care costs are not just a problem of the uninsured  More and more families with insurance are affected by rising health care costs  and  for many  the burden of these costs has become too great to bear  The key findings in the report look at the number of people in families that spend more than 10 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs           In 2000  1 829 000 non elderly Ohioans were in families that spent more than 10 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs            Between 2000 and 2008  the number of people in families spending more than 10 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs will have increased by 365 000  This increase is greater than the population of            Nearly nine out of ten people  86 2 percent  in families spending more than 10 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs are insured           1 891 000 non elderly Ohioans with insurance are in families that will spend more than 10 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs in 2008  The report also looks at the number of people in families that spend more that 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs           In 2000  484 000 Ohioans were in families that spent more than 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs            Between 2000 and 2008  the number of people in families spending more than 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs will have increased by 105 000  This increase equals half the population of Akron           More than four out of five people  80 3 percent  in families spending more than 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs are insured           473 000 Ohioans with insurance are in families that will spend more than 25 percent of their pre tax income on health care costs in 2008 As the Families USA report demonstrates  thousands of Ohioans are in families that face high health care costs  A number of factors have driven this phenomenon  First and foremost  health insurance premiums are increasing  As premiums rise  employers are forced to make tough decisions about the coverage they offer to their employees  some drop coverage  others increase the share of the premium that employees must pay  and more offer insurance that covers fewer services and or requires high out of pockets costs  As a result  Ohio families must shoulder a greater portion of health care costs  Ohio families are hit hard in the pocketbooks due to skyrocketing health costs  said Ron Pollack  Executive Director of Families USA  As a result  Ohioans are spending much larger portions of their family incomes on health care costsand health care is becoming less and less affordable  There is no doubt we must find a way to be smarter about the roughly  2 trillion we spend as a nation each year on health care  Yet  for too many years  I have listened to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about the rising cost of health care and the growing number of uninsured  And for too many years  I ve seen little progress here at the federal level  said Senator George V  Voinovich  R OH   co author of the bipartisan Heath Partnership Act  HPA   Yet  states are moving ahead with reform strategy  HPA aims to break the logjam and allow states and local governments to further experiment with health care reform options  Our hope is the bill will provide a platform from which we can have a thoughtful conversation about comprehensive health care reform here in Washington Ensuring that all Ohioan s have access to quality and affordable healthcare is one of my top priorities in Congress  Today s report highlights just how broken our health care system is  We often talk about the plight of families who lack insurance  but even families with insurance are getting hammered  To spend more than 10 percent of your family s income on health care is frightening economics  The report released today by Families USA only reinforces the need for Congress to act quickly in finding solutions to address this growing problem  said Representative Charlie Wilson  OH 6  According to the report  these fast rising health care costs are forcing increasing numbers of people to look for new ways to pay for care  With the majority of doctors offices and hospitals now accepting payment by credit card  paying for health services via credit card is becoming increasingly common   Recent data shows that more than one in four people with insurance report having trouble paying their medical bills or say that they are in the process of paying off medical debt  If this troubling trend continues  the health care affordability crisis will get much worse and many more Ohioans will become uninsured and underinsured  said Pollack  The high health care costs faced by families are a clear indication that insurance simply no longer offers the protection that Americas families need To determine how many Ohioans are in families that face health care costs in excess of 10 and 25 percent of pre tax family income in 2000 and 2008  Families USA asked The Lewin Group to analyze data from the U S  Department of Health and Human
