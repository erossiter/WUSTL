            New JEC Report  Subprime Crisis To Cost Billions In Family Wealth  Property Values  And Tax Revenue Unless Action Is Taken To Prevent Foreclosures                                                                                                                               Press Release    New JEC Report  Subprime Crisis To Cost Billions In Family Wealth  Property Values  And Tax Revenue Unless Action Is Taken To Prevent Foreclosures  October 25  2007  Washington  D C   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee  JEC   Amy Klobuchar  D MN   and Sherrod Brown  D OH  released a report today analyzing the greater financial impact of the subprime foreclosure boom  The JEC report entitled  The Subprime Lending Crisis  The Economic Impact on Wealth  Property Values and Tax Revenues  and How We Got Here reveals that families  neighborhood property values  and state and local governments will lose billions of dollars as  two million subprime mortgage homes are foreclosed   The subprime fallout report argues in favor of foreclosure prevention  which can save the economy billions in housing wealth and ease falling housing prices  The JEC report is the first of its kind to project economic costs on a state by state basis from the third quarter of 2007 through 2009   Schumer said  State by state  the economic costs from the subprime debacle are shockingly high   From New York to California  we are headed for billions in lost wealth  property values  and tax revenues   The current tidal wave of foreclosures will soon turn into a tsunami of losses and debt for families and communities   The administration must act quickly to save financially strapped families from drowning in this flood of subprime foreclosures  In the world of subprime lending  the chickens have come home to roost  said Klobuchar   If we are to contain the economic spillover effect of the subprime lending disaster  we must act now Since January  Ohio foreclosure filings were almost double what they were last year  100 000 through September  This fall will probably be worse  and next year could be even higher  We need to act  and act now  The problems Ohio is facing are spreading across the country  from New York to Florida to California  We should apply the same attention to Main Streets problems that we do to Wall Streets  said Brown The JEC report found that the subprime catastrophe is likely to accelerate the downward spiral of house prices   Based on state level data  the report estimates that by 2009 2 million foreclosures will occur by the time the riskiest subprime adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  reset over the course of this year and next  Approximately  71 billion in housing wealth will be directly destroyed because each foreclosure reduces the value of a home  More than  32 billion dollars in housing wealth will be indirectly destroyed by the spillover effect of foreclosures  which reduce the value of neighboring properties  States will lose more than  917 million in property tax revenue as a result of the destruction of housing wealth caused by subprime foreclosures  The ten states with the greatest number of estimated foreclosures are California  Florida  Ohio  New York  Michigan  Texas  Illinois  Arizona and Pennsylvania   But there are several others that are close behind in the rankings  On top of the losses due to foreclosures  which this report examines  a 10 percent decline in housing prices would lead to a  2 3 trillion economic loss   The full report can be found at www jec senate gov   Nationally  house prices began to decline in 2006 and are now down approximately 3 2 percent from their peak in the second quarter of 2006   Inventories of unsold new homes have increased  and the monthly supply of new homes has risen   With housing prices no longer rising  subprime borrowers cannot refinance their homes to pay off loans before they reset to higher and often unaffordable rates   Loan delinquencies are soon followed by foreclosures One study on housing values in Philadelphia found that an abandoned property lowered values on homes located within 150 feet of the abandoned property by an average of 10  and lowered values on homes located within 450 feet by an average of 5  The JEC report outlines several policy proposals to combat additional foreclosures and prevent this crisis from happening again Foreclosure prevention counseling   There is a broad consensus that the role of housing counselors as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders loan servicers is critical in helping prevent foreclosures  Housing counseling agencies across the country are helping struggling borrowers to negotiate safe and affordable loan modifications and refinancings in an effort to prevent foreclosures where possible   The Senate approved a  100 million appropriation targeted to HUD approved foreclosure avoidance nonprofits and  100 million in loss mitigation funding for both nonprofits and private entities   Nonprofits that specialize in foreclosure prevention have been highly effective in acting on behalf of borrowers to explore their options with their lenders  but theyre inundated and more resources are needed   Temporarily increase portfolio caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac   Both of the government sponsored enterprises  GSEs  are currently constrained by portfolio limits imposed upon them by their regulator   Temporarily raising the GSE portfolio limits so they can focus on subprime ARMs could provide much needed funding to mortgage lenders who will be able to refinance struggling borrowers in safe and sustainable loan products Increase FHAs ability to refinance subprime borrowers   Modernizing the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  would increase their capacity and flexibility to insure subprime mortgages that can be refinanced   The proposal currently in Congress is designed to make FHA insured loans a more attractive option to lenders and borrowers by increasing allowable loan limits and lowering down payment requirements   Amend the bankruptcy code to protect families from foreclosure   Bankruptcy could be a highly effective tool for helping families recover from subprime loans  but todays bankruptcy code prevents courts from providing relief on mortgage loans and many have loans that are greater than the value of their homes  meaning that foreclosure will not extinguish their debts  In fact  federal law singles out the home mortgage loan as the one debt the courts are not permitted to modify   Amending the bankruptcy code to either temporarily or permanently exclude primary home loans from the remedies that are available on other  less important debts  would allow borrowers to pay the liquidation value of their home and to keep that home  rather than seeing the home sold to a third party for its liquidation value   Encourage more loan modifications and refinancings  The most effective way to help prevent foreclosures for hybrid ARM borrowers that cannot afford their payments after the rate reset is to modify the terms of their loan to make them affordable   The federal regulators have issued guidance to lenders and servicers to engage in loss mitigation efforts prior to pursuing foreclosures  and lawmakers must continue to pressure lenders and loan servicers to step up their efforts to help subprime ARM borrowers before their loan resets   Policymakers may also consider requiring specific loss mitigation efforts prior to any foreclosure filing by creating an affirmative duty for lenders and servicers prior to foreclosure Waive tax liability on forgiven debt in restructured loans   Legislation is currently pending in Congress to temporarily change the tax law to let homeowners avoid paying taxes on any forgiven debt in loans being restructured by financial institutions Reform mortgage lending and ban predatory lending practices   Predatory lending helped fuel the volume of risky subprime loans and was enabled by a patchwork of federal and state regulations that was all too easily evaded by subprime mortgage brokers and lenders   Federal laws are needed that would offer predatory lending protections to homeowners  restore common sense underwriting practices and ensure a borrowers ability to pay   The federal government should require lenders to determine that the borrower has the ability to repay a loan at the fully indexed rate and assume fully amortized payments  Federal regulation needs to rein in lenders and originators that escape regulatory guidance requiring depository banks and their affiliates to underwrite loans at the fully indexed interest rate  Policymakers should also require lenders to verify a borrowers income using tax documents or other reasonable documentation Policymakers may also want to combat predatory lending practices by Requiring mortgage lenders to escrow for taxes and insurance on all mortgage loans   Failing to escrow for taxes and insurance on a subprime loan is an unfair and deceptive practice that contributes to high rates of foreclosure   Eliminating prepayment penalties and yield spread premiums on subprime loans  Regulating mortgage brokers and originators under the existing Truth in Lending Act  TILA  by establishing a fiduciary duty between brokers and their customers  and a duty of good faith and fair dealing standard for all originators   Making sure all borrowers understand the terms of their mortgages  requiring that all mortgage lenders disclose the basic facts about the mortgage loan that they underwrite for the borrower  This one page form should be easy to understand and should indicate the amount of the loan  the propertys appraised value  the term of the loan  the payments at each reset date  and todays estimate of how much the rate will increase  the fully indexed rate   as well as the maximum possible rate on the loan   Other disclosures would include  in plain language  any prepayment fees and other estimated costs and fees due at closing   The JEC report also highlights the underlying causes of the subprime mortgage crisis  Unregulated Mortgage Companies   Most subprime loans are made by companies that specialize in mortgage lending  Because they are not deposit taking institutions  the independent mortgage companies and bank subsidiaries are not subject to the safety and soundness regulations that govern federal or state banks   Nor are they subject to other federal regulatory regimes such as the Home Owners Equity Protection Act  HOEPA  or the Community Reinvestment Act  leaving the door open for fraud and abuse Slicing and Dicing of Loans into Mortgage Backed Securities  The lack of oversight during the lending process is exacerbated by the fact that lenders hold only a fraction of the subprime loans they make in their own portfolios   Most loans are sold  in whole or in part  to the secondary market  where they become the underlying assets for residential mortgage backed securities  Lenders sell the securities to a wide array of financial players spread throughout the world   The slicing and dicing of the original loans makes it difficult to value them and complicates refinancing Perverse Incentives for Mortgage Brokers  Lenders  such as Countrywide  sometimes pay brokers so called yield spread premiums  when they sell loans with interest rates above the minimum acceptable rate for the loan  Some brokers may also receive higher fees for selling mortgages with prepayment penalties   Moreover  since mortgage brokers bear little or no risk when a borrower defaults  they have no economic incentive to originate loans that a borrower can afford in the long term   Brokers also lack strong legal incentives to act in the interest of borrowers   Under state law brokers are not fiduciaries  who must put the interest of their clients first   Nor do they have a duty to sell their clients products which are at least suitable to their circumstances  as registered securities brokers do Predatory Lending by Lenders and Brokers  Given the financial incentives for brokers and lenders to provide an increasing volume of high yield mortgages  it is no surprise that tactics were invented to meet the demand   Common practices included          Expansion of 2 28 and 3 27 hybrid adjustable rate mortgages in which mortgages reset to a higher rate after the second or third year  making it more likely that a subprime borrower will need to sell  refinance  or default          Imposition of prepayment penalties  which are frequently imposed on all types of subprime loans at a very high relative and absolute rate  have the potential to strip the housing equity from subprime borrowers and increase the likelihood of default         Rapid rise in no document loans that appear affordable even when they are not        Deliberate targeting of the most vulnerable segments of society  including but not limited to  Hispanics and the elderly
