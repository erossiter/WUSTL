            Statement Of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs On Veterans Of Foreign Wars                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Joint Hearing Of The Committee On Veterans Affairs On Veterans Of Foreign Wars March 6  2007   WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Joint Hearing of the Committees on Veterans Affairs on Veterans of Foreign Wars  VFW    Thank you  Mr  Chairman  I want to welcome Commander Kurpius to this hearing  Thank you for speaking with us today    The VFW serves an important role in pushing for legislation that improves the lives of those who have served this great nation  The VFW also performs vital community service for veterans and for communities throughout America  Whether it is the VFW Post 1079 rebuilding a ball field in Elyria  Ohio or providing money for scholarships or an honor guard color guard at ceremonies and funerals throughout my state  the VFW is true to its service mission  Thank you  I am proud that the American Veterans of Foreign Service was founded in Columbus  Ohio  This group eventually became what today is the Veterans of Foreign Wars    On Friday evening September 29  1899  13 veterans of the Spanish American War met in Francis Dubiels tailor shop on Main Street in the heart of America  They met to establish a way for needy veterans of their regiment  who were suffering from disabilities they had acquired during the war  to get the care they deserved  At that time veterans were unable to get adequate health care and many could not work because they were disabled from their service  Ever since that day  the VFW has continued to serve this nation  and in many ways  its work is needed now more than ever   I know the VFW has an extensive list of legislative priorities and we do not have time today to discuss of all of them at this hearing  I realize each of these priorities is very important  but I wanted to touch briefly on a couple of them today  I know there are many different opinions and perspectives in this room regarding our current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  My views on the wars and on President Bushs escalation have been very clear from the start  While some of you may disagree with me on the war itself  we are all in agreement that we must be prepared to care for the increasing numbers of servicemen and servicewomen coming home who will need our help   Before we send more troops off to war  we must be prepared to protect the ones that are currently there as well as provide for the ones coming home injured and disabled  We are sending troops to war that are not provided with the proper body armor  These same men and women are traveling around in combat vehicles that are not adequately equipped to handle the IEDs and RPGs and EFPs  The results of this policy will affect an entire generation of veterans and their families    The costs associated with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  as well as the more traditional injuries and disabilities associated with war  must be included in our accounting for the costs of the current war  We will be paying for  and caring for  the soldiers from action in Iraq and Afghanistan well into the middle of this century    And  while the VA has some of the best health care in the world  we know we can do better  Walter  Reed Medical  Center was caught off guard by the influx of war wounded heroes and we all saw the results of its poor planning and misallocation of resources in providing for these returning servicemen and servicewomen  Walter Reed is a military hospital and many of its patients will eventually end up in the VA system  We must ensure that the VA is prepared to handle the current surge of troops coming home wounded  There can be no more Walter Reeds   We must work for assured funding of the VA  We cannot have delays in planning and programs in VA facilities across the nation  because the folks in Washington cannot get the money to them in adequate amounts and in a timely fashion  Whether this is greater diligence in the appropriations and budgeting process or whether it is a form of mandatory funding  something must be done  Delays set back programming and planning as well as increase costs that are eventually passed on to the American taxpayer   Lastly  let me make this very clear  the presidents plan for increased fees and co pays is a non starter  We have asked enough of our veterans  We do not need to nickel and dime them  And the presidents plan to use some of these fees for the general fund  rather than re investing them into the VA is outrageous  I am appalled that the president would try to tax veterans to meet his own budget priorities  including tax cuts for the wealthy   I look forward to working with the VFW in the coming years  Lets honor the legacy of those 13 veterans who met 108 years ago in Francis Dubiels tailor shop  by honoring and providing for veterans today with the quality care and assistance they deserve and that they have earned  Thank you Mr  Chairman
