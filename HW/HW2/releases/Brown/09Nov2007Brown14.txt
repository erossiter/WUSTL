passage of the Defense Appropriations bill  Brown secured  35 2 million for Ohio projects in the legislation  There is a renewed focus on projects and efforts that directly support our troops at home and abroad  Brown said  This bill provides opportunities for Ohio to lead the way in developing better equipment for the military and expand renewable fuels and alternative energy so we can become less reliant on Middle East oil  I am proud Ohio is at the forefront in supporting our troops and our national security The Ohio State University in Columbus would receive  1 000 000 for The Indiana University   Ohio State University Center for Traumatic Amputation Rehabilitation Research  This would address the lifelong rehabilitation needs of war related amputees to beneficially impact the future health and welfare of returning military personnel from the Iraq and Afghan conflicts  No database currently exists in the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other federal or state agency to inform health care personnel or policy makers regarding the long term life experiences of military personnel  This data will assist the Department of Defense and the VA health care personnel to transition the soliders who sustatained traumatic amputations into civilian life   Arteriocyte in  would receive  800 000 for Arteriocyte Cellular Therapy for Battlefield Medical Care  which would improve wound healing and cardiovascular care for the men and women injured on the battlefield  Arteriocyte Cellular Therapy would provide improved therapeutic blood flow  result in more rapid tissue healing  significant reduction in infection risks  better patient recovery  and less long term medical costs The Sherwin  Williams Company would receive  1 000 000 for the Life Shield Blast Resistant Panels to develop and produce large Anti Terrorism panels that will greatly enhance protection to affected personnel by offering blast  fire and fragmentation resistance  which can be adaptable to buildings  shelters and vehicles  Sherwin Williams would also receive  1 600 000 for the development of a novel interior paint formulation  PaintShield  which would kill airborne biological threats caused by terrorist  sources   University of Dayton would receive  4 000 000 for the Military Legal Assistance Clinic to provide enhanced legal services to members of the U S  Armed Forces who cannot otherwise afford it  The Clinic would provide consumer  landlord tenant and reemployment related assistance Battelle in Columbus would receive  2 000 000 for the Alternative Energy Fuel Cell Power Generation to improve fuel efficiency  advance noise reduction  produce safe emissions  increase water production  and enhance flexible deployment configurations  Alternative Energy Fuel Cell Power

Fully Integrated Solar Powered Interior Lighting Technology  This project brings together the Bowling Green State University  University of Toledo  and Wright Patterson Air force Base to create an interdisciplinary research program focused on fully integrated solar powered interior lighting technology for use in temporary structures such as tent cities in overseas military bases QBase in Dayton would receive  1 600 000 for the Imaging Tools for Human Performance Enhancement and Diagnostics for the Air Force and Department of Defense to conduct comprehensive studies of the precise human responses to battlefield stresses   This project contributes toward continued preeminence of the Air Force Research Labs Human Effectiveness Directorate research programs and will build on research areas identified by BRAC to move to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Beryllium Supply Industrial Base would receive  3 200 000 to assure the continuous long term domestic supply of beryllium  Beryllium is a strategic metal  critical to many advanced weapons systems currently in use by the transformational Armed Services  Its unique combination of light weight  stiffness  and thermal properties makes it the material of choice for components and structural applications in systems ranging from surveillance satellites to hand held infra red target designators used by ground troops Energizer in Westlake would receive  2 400 000 for Thin Lithium Iron Disulfide Primary Batteries  This would increase the specific energy of lithium iron disulfide battery on high power drains even at low temperatures to provide troops with an improved high power ultra lightweight battery that will operate reliably under harsh conditions while significantly reducing the heavy burden carried by our soldiers in the field The Advanced Materials and Processes for Armament Structures  AMPAS  Program would receive  5 600 000 to provide significantly lighter components for military equipment resulting in ease of use and transport of equipment  This program would develop new methods of producing light metals such as titanium  Ohio is home to titanium melt facilities  and these innovations will help to improve productivity TechSolve  Inc  would receive  3 000 000 for the Smart Machine Platform Initiative   As the Army moves toward lighter and more agile vehicles  it is critical that components can be fabricated domestically in a timely and affordable manner  The next generation of machinery must execute instructions  possess complex internal sensing  and control systems to create instructions and integrate them into manufacturing processes Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation at Wright Patterson Air Force Base would receive  2 400 000 for the Advanced Geospatial Intelligence  AGI  Exploitation Tools to develop sophisticated  state of the art algorithms and analysis tools to exploit data from next generation Advanced Geospatial Intelligence sensors Steris
