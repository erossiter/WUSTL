            Brown And Clinton Introduce New Legislation Connecting Farms And Underserved Communities                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown And Clinton Introduce New Legislation Connecting Farms And Underserved Communities  May 17  2007  WASHINGTON  With many Americans lacking access to affordable  healthy food contributing to such health problems as obesity and diabetes  United States Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today introduced new legislation to help deliver fresh food from farms to underserved communities  Currently  more than 35 million Americans cannot meet their own food needs  The Food Outreach and Opportunity Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act would increase the supply and availability of locally produced foods by providing innovative financing for small and midsized family farmers and ranchers   This bill brings together family farmers who produce healthy food and working families who need healthy food  It will create new markets for our farmers to sell their goods and give families in communities across Ohio access to the fresh produce they need to stay healthy  Senator Brown said The FOOD for a Healthy America Act is based on a simple idea  families need greater access to healthy locally grown foods and family farmers need access to a greater variety of markets  This is a win win bill for our families and our farmers  said Senator Clinton The price of fresh fruits and vegetables increased nearly 40 percent between 1985 and 2000  with other healthier foods experiencing similar price increases  Increasing the availability of healthy and fresh foods in schools and underserved communities is an important aspect of improving the overall health and food security in the United StatesThe Healthy Food  Healthy Communities report from 2005 cites the increase in diabetes  heart disease  and other diet related diseases are in part the result of a lack of fresh food consumption  including fruits and vegetables  According to the Trust for Americas Health  childhood obesity levels have nearly tripled since 1980 to 2004  from 5 to 17 percent  In 2004  7 8 percent of Ohioans were struggling with diabetes  and 25 percent were obese  By growing and distributing fresh foods locally and regionally  Brown and Clintons proposal would create profitable markets for small and midsized family farmers and ranchers  help to preserve farmland  and protect the environment with more sustainable farming practices  According to the Northeast Midwest Institute  when food is produced  packaged  and distributed closer to it is sold and consumed  farmers earn a higher share of the food dollar  Local food production and distribution works hand in hand with community led efforts to reduce hunger and provide affordable foods needed for good nutrition  especially in communities underserved by retail food stores  Brown and Clintons new legislation would promote locally led food access initiatives that increase the availability and affordability of healthy and fresh foods  increase fruits and vegetables in school meals  improve access to healthy foods for low income individuals  remove barriers that keep local farmers from selling products to schools  and support farmers markets and road side stands  particularly in underserved areas Brown and Clinton are also co sponsors of the Specialty Crop Competition Act of 2007  S 1160   This legislation  sponsored by Senator Debbie Stabenow  D MI   would strengthen the economic role of specialty crops  fruits  vegetables and other crops that account for  34 billion in revenues a year nationwide  The Specialty Crops bill would assist farmers in developing crops that are more economically viable and environmentally friendly  finding new markets  including gaining access to foreign markets  providing research and administrative funding to combat pests and disease  and providing school nutrition programs with more fruits and vegetables  The Brown Clinton legislation includes nine financial and technical support
