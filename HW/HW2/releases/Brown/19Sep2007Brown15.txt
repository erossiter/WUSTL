            Brown Statement On Housing Legislation In Banking Committee                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Statement On Housing Legislation In Banking Committee September 19  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  submitted the following written statement as part of todays Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee consideration of the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2007 and the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  Modernization Act of 2007  Both pieces of legislation were voted out of committee Mr  Chairman  I want to commend you and Senator Shelby for your work on the bills before us today  The FHA loan program is one important tool we can use to combat the mortgage crisis we face across the country By providing fair loans at a fair price  the FHA program can give tens of thousands of families an alternative to the decidedly unfair loans they are caught in today  But we need to act quickly  Some of the biggest cohorts of these predatory loans are about to reset at rates that will quickly become unaffordable to more and more families Last month  there were close to 18 000 foreclosure filings in Ohio  a third more than the month before and almost 140 percent more than in August of 2006 Needless to say  this legislation is only part of the solution  We need to ensure that the additional resources for counseling that were included in the housing appropriations bill are retained through conference and are signed into law by the president  We need to enact reasonable protections for borrowers so they are not preyed upon when it comes time to refinance these loans  And we need to explore additional avenues for helping borrowers The stock market was clearly buoyed by the Federal Reserves decision to put in place rate cuts of 50 basis points  and there were congratulations all around   But I have to wonder if the huge swings we have seen in the stock market  and the troubles in the housing and other credit markets  would have been as severe if the Federal Reserve had attended to its role as regulator  If the Fed had curbed some of the excesses in the sub prime market by exercising its regulatory powers  the resulting crunch would have been far milder  I hope that the Fed will act quickly to do its part  and I hope Congress will do the same A lot of families cannot even afford the teaser rate of a bad mortgage  Unfortunately  a growing shortage of affordable rental housing and a simultaneous increase in poverty has lead to an increased incidence of homelessness in the United States When people fall on difficult times  they often must choose between food  shelter  and other basic needs  In Ohio  I have witnessed this on many accounts While the programs under the McKinney Vento Act have helped alleviate the suffering of individuals faced with homelessness  much work still remains to be done   The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act takes into account important measures that simplify the process of giving aid to communities to address homelessness  and strengthens prevention efforts    Again  Mr  Chairman  I thank you and Senator Shelby and all the members involved for your work on these bills  and I look forward to their quick consideration by the Senate as a whole
