            Senate Energy Committee Holds Hearing On Brown Legislation To Clean Up Piketon Uranium Enrichment Plant                                                                                                                               Press Release    Senate Energy Committee Holds Hearing On Brown Legislation To Clean Up Piketon Uranium Enrichment Plant November 15  2007  Washington  DC  The Senate Energy Committee today held a hearing on U S  s  D OH  legislation to continue the clean up of Piketons uranium enrichment plant  The authority for the Uranium Enrichment Decommissioning and Decontamination  D  D  Fund of the Department of Energy  DOE   which currently funds clean up efforts  is set to expire this year  Browns legislation would continue funding for the cleanup program for ten more years Brown released the following testimony  which was submitted for the record Thank you Chairman Bingaman and members of the Committee  I appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony on behalf of the people of Pike County  Ohio and McCracken County  Kentucky  for whom a stable and fully funded Decontamination and Decommissioning  D  D  Fund is critically important  We need to ensure we clean up our nuclear legacy sites and we need to do this as part of our future policy regarding nuclear energy  If we dont clean up our nuclear waste  we cant in good faith consider a future for nuclear energy in this country In 1992  Congress created the D  D fund  The program was to clean up the old gaseous diffusion enrichment plants in Tennessee  Kentucky  and Ohio  The fund was designed as a partnership between the nuclear industry and the federal government  The commercial nuclear power industry has long benefited from its partnership with the federal government  The government transferred domestic nuclear technology it had invented to private companies for domestic electricity production  As part of this partnership  the nuclear industry has and continues to purchase enriched uranium from the old enrichment plants After nearly 50 years of operation  these enrichment plants are some of the most contaminated areas in our country  Since Paducah and Piketon are both within the Ohio River Basins watershed  without the proper cleanup  contamination from these facilities could endanger the entire population from  to New Orleans  The D  D fund has worked  But  as we all know  much more needs to be done  Decades of cleanup remain   We can debate the numbers and the amount of money it will cost to clean up the sites  but we all know that the current account of the fund is woefully short  After 15 years  the D  D fund was supposed to expire  In those 15 years  weve learned that the cleanup is going to cost much more than originally thought S  2203  the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund Reauthorization Act of 2007  is a straight reauthorization  It simply extends the D  D fund for 10 more years  We know after these 10 years there still might not be enough money to complete the cleanup  but this is a fair amount of time to start the work and after a decade  we can better determine how to go forward S  2203 also calls for a study by DOE to look into how best to use the uranium tails at Piketon and Paducah for the benefit of the sites  This provision will permit all parties to come together and determine how best to use a federal government asset for the betterment of its people For too long  policies have pitted the people of the Appalachian cities of Paducah and Piketon against one another  This has to end  This bill works with  rather than dictates to  the people of the enrichment communities  S  2203 aims to bring everyone to the table to figure out how to go forward These communities helped the United States win the Cold War and have supplied the commercial nuclear power industry for decades  We cant turn our backs on them  The need for the D  D fund is just as great today as when it was created  S  2203 is a fair and forward looking bill that will help clean up our nuclear past  If we do not plan for this clean up in a responsible manner  that breach of trust will surely compromise support for nuclear power in the future  Thank you Mr  Chairman
