            Statement Of  From Today s Appropriations Committee Hearring On Tuberculosis                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Appropriations Committee Hearring On Tuberculosis June 6  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Committee on Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies  Hearing titled Cracks in the System  An Examination of One Tuberculosis Patients International Public Health Threat Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter  I would like to begin by thanking you for convening this important hearing this morning  Im grateful for your interest in this issue and your commitment to addressing it  Ive been working to bring attention to the global tuberculosis epidemic for the last decade  because of the magnitude of this problem and our collective failure to adequately address it  I have met with patients with drug resistant TB in jails in Moscow and in a prison colony in Siberia  Ive seen people living with AIDS who have overcome TB in rural Haiti  Andrew Speaker  the Atlanta attorney recently found to have an extensively drug resistant strain of tuberculosis  has certainly sounded an alarm  His case has garnered the attention of media around the world  Id like to make just a few comments as to what I believe we can and should do in response to this story  Id like to start by making what I believe is the central point of all of this  XDR TB  and the global health risk illustrated by one patient on an aircraft  is a marker of decades of our chronic under investment in TB efforts domestically and globally  It should come as absolutely no surprise  Weve tried to do TB on the cheap and now were paying the price of our neglectunder resourced programs in the U S  and much of the world  paltry investment in new diagnostics  drugs and an effective vaccine  and recently a flatlining of domestic control efforts  Weve been down a similar road before  not even 20 years ago  Cuts to domestic TB funding in the 1970s and 1980s led to a resurgence of TB in the late 80s and early 90s  And New York City alone spent over a billion dollars in the years following to control a few hundred cases of MDR TB  We need to learn from the past  TB is one of humanitys oldest diseases  and today it kills over 1 6 million people a year  Its history can be traced back to the dawn of history  MDR TB and XDR TB  however  are entirely human made  They emerge when patients with normal TB fail to receive complete treatment  most often due to weak programs and inadequate drug supplies  We have failed to provide the basic elements of TB control domestically and globally that prevent drug resistance from emerging in the first place  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is central to our efforts to control TB abroad and at home  providing critical technical support worldwide  But it needs the resources to launch a response thats commensurate with the need  TB is the worlds leading infectious killer after HIV AIDS  and the leading killer of people with AIDS  CDC should be funded to fight TB at a level on par with the work conducted by its Global AIDS Program  The  300 million in the Presidents budget for the Global Fund within the Labor HHS budget is also critical   CDC and NIH need to increase their research and development efforts to find new drugs  diagnostics and vaccinesall of which are antiquated  The standard TB diagnostic tool is over 100 years old  The newest TB drug came to market 40 years ago  And even though TB afflicts 9 million people worldwide  and a third of the worlds population harbors the bacteria that causes the disease  no effective vaccine exists    Ive introduced legislation with Mrs  Huchison  the Comprehensive TB Elimination Act  that would invest in the tools and infrastructure needed to confront TB in this country  I am also an original cosponsor of legislation introduced by Mrs  Boxer and Mr  Smith  the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act that invests in global TB control  We know what to do  the American public is looking for our response  With your leadership  we can avoid a global catastrophe and lead a global response
