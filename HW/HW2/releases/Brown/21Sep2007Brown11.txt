            Senators Astounded By Administration Response To Violence Against Union Leaders In Colombia                                                                                                                               Press Release    Senators Astounded By Administration Response To Violence Against Union Leaders In Colombia  September 21  2007  Dear Secretary Gutierrez We were astounded by your recent statement that violence against union leaders in Colombia is not a problem  On the contrary  there is overwhelming evidence that Colombia remains the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a labor leader  Over the past several months  since the administration negotiated and signed a free trade agreement with Colombia  both the administration and the Uribe government have made various statements about strengthening the rule of law in Colombia and protecting civilians  However  there is ample evidence that the Colombian government has not taken the steps necessary to ensure prompt and proper investigation and prosecution of murders and those engaged in criminal actions against workers exercising their basic rights   In recent testimony before Congress  a former Colombian military officer stated clearly that soldiers continue to be taught to view union leaders as guerrillas and targets for government assaults   Current investigations into violence against labor leaders have implicated numerous individuals who have had close ties to the Uribe government  1  Even according to official Colombian government numbers  in 2006 there was actually an increase in the number of trade unionists killed over the total in 2005  Through five years there have been more than 400 trade unionists murdered  and only ten convictions for those murders   Only a handful of the more than 2 200 murder cases since 1991 have been investigated  and in only 37 cases have prosecutions led to prison sentences  There have been just two convictions in the 236 trade unionist murders in the last three years 2 Indeed  Colombia continues to have one of the worlds highest rates of trade unionist killings  and the Uribe government recently announced a proposal to release from prison all politicians linked to paramilitary groups 3 In view of all this  it was deeply troubling to read your comments suggesting that while there is a problem with violence in Colombia  there is no specific problem relating to violence against labor leaders  It is difficult to contemplate a trade deal with Colombia given its continuing record of violence against labor leaders     We hope you will reconsider your position on this matter                                                                                     1  Unionists Murders Cloud Prospect for Colombia Trade Pact  Washington Post  April 10  2007   2  US Leap analysis of records provided by the Colombian Ministry of Social Protection 3 Testimony of Maria McFarland  Human Rights Watch  June 28  2007  before joint hearing of Subcommittee on International Organizations  Human Rights and Oversight  Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee on Health  Employment  Labor and Pensions
