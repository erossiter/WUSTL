            Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing On Private Student Lending                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing On Private Student Lending June 6  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following statement from todays Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Paying for College  The Role of Private Student Lending Mr  Chairman and Senator Shelby  I want to thank you for calling this mornings hearing  And I want to thank all of the witnesses who are joining us to lend us their expertise  free of charge  Private student loans have some of the same characteristics as mortgages  another topic we have been looking at recently  Borrowers often come to the table with little idea of what they are agreeing to when they sign a promissory note  and place their trust in the parties around the table  whether the financial aid officer or broker or lender Having been part of many reauthorizations of the Higher Education Act  the Chairman knows better than any of us how much time and attention has gone into ensuring that there are substantial protections for borrowers in the federal loan programs  from rate caps to low fixed rates to forbearance and deferments to discharge for death or disability to income contingent repayment options  Most private loans have none of these features  This is not a criticism of lenders  since the federal government is not picking up the tab  but it is awfully easy to see why an 18 year old borrower would be confused when faced with multiple loans and all the other paperwork that comes at the outset of college  And like the mortgage industry  the student loan industry has undergone significant changes in the past few years  with a decreasing role for the local bank and an increasing role for new entrants that rely on direct to consumer marketing  The same low interest rates that fueled the housing boom also fueled a boom in the refinancing of student loans over the past several years As those booms fade  where does the money go  Well  many student lenders are trying to scramble from the consolidation loan business to the preferred lender lists of colleges across the country  leading to some of the abuses we have read about in the papers  At the same time  there are increased efforts to market private student loans  This academic year will probably be the first when private loans exceed all federal grant programs Private student loans are a necessary evil  But if students are convinced to take out these loans ahead of Stafford or Perkins loans  they are just plain evil  It is hard enough for a student to graduate with  20 000 in debt at 6 8   The last thing we want is for students to needlessly be paying interest rates that are double that amount Congress need to make sure that this does not happen  We need to greatly improve the disclosure on these loans  and we need to ensure that the financial aid office functions as a buyers agent  not a sellers  We do not want any yield spread premiums in the student loan market  Thank you Mr  Chairman  and I look forward to the testimony
