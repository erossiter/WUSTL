            Brown Supports Plan To Lower Drug Costs Senate Republicans Obstruct Medicare Drug Negotiations                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Supports Plan To Lower Drug Costs Senate Republicans Obstruct Medicare Drug Negotiations  April 18  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  today supported Senate passage of legislation to allow Medicare to bargain for lower drug prices  however Senate Republicans prevented debate on this legislation  The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 would allow the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices  A new report released by Families USA revealed consistent increases in drug prices for Medicare recipients over the last year  Of the 1 8 million Ohio seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  nearly 700 000 are enrolled in Medicare Part D The authors of the Medicare drug law claimed that there would be no need for Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on drug prices  because private insurers would secure dramatically lower prices on their own Brown said  Those same prices are rising about four times faster than inflation  Something is wrong with this picture  Everyone who opposed the legislation this morning chose to protect drug industry profit margins at the expense of our seniors  The Families USA report released today analyzed the prices for 15 of the drugs most frequently prescribed to seniors and showed that prices negotiated by the largest Part D plans increased dramatically last year  Prices for these drugs increased nearly four times faster than overall consumer prices  Most troubling  seniors Social Security payments only increased by 3 3 percent this year  which is just over one third of the increase in Part D drug prices  According to the study  Part D drugs are becoming less affordable for seniors who depend on Social Security or those who fall into the doughnut hole Under the current system  drug plans pay 75 percent of patients drug costs between  250 and  2 250  but zero percent of the total costs between  2 250 and  5 100  with beneficiaries paying 100 percent of costs in the doughnut hole  Coverage does not resume until the beneficiarys costs reach  5 100  In a 2006 study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation  a non profit health care research organization  one in four Medicare drug plan beneficiaries reached the doughnut hole last year Last year I traveled throughout Ohio and heard first hand from seniors across the state how high drug prices can devastate their lives  Congress is allowing the drug industry to impose the highest prices in the world on individuals who simply cant afford it  and thats unconscionable  We must cure Washington of its addiction to the drug companies  This is a betrayal of 44 million seniors who depend on Medicare and need access to affordable drug costs  Brown said The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 would allow the Secretary to directly participate in price negotiations  as the Department of Veterans Affairs does today
