            With Heating Bills Expected To Be 10  Higher This Winter  Brown In Youngstown Proposes Steps To Bring Down Costs                                                                                                                               Press Release    With Heating Bills Expected To Be 10  Higher This Winter  Brown In Youngstown Proposes Steps To Bring Down Costs  November 29  2007  Youngstown  Ohio  With heating bills expected to be 18 percent higher this winter  U S    D OH  today proposed steps to bring down heating costs in Youngstown  Joined by Jamira Ellis  HEAP Coordinator  Brown called for an increase in federal funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP  and the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP   In addition  he discussed efforts to restore funding for the Community Services Block Grant  CSBG   which helps agencies like Mahoning Youngstown Community Action Partnership provide assistance to local residents With energy prices out of control  we have to help people pay for soaring heating costs this winter  Brown said  More and more people qualify for LIHEAP assistance  Yet every year  the program runs out of funding   Thats a breach of public safety and a lapse in compassion for those in need  We need to do something about it The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio reported that the average consumer in Ohio uses approximately 80 thousand cubic feet of natural gas during the winter heating season  Last year the average price per thousand cubic feet between November and April was  11 33   This years price could be as high as  12 23  According to the Energy Information Administration  Ohio consumers used more than 120 000 gallons of home heating oil last year  The average U S  household is likely to spend  977 to heat their homes between October and March  according to forecasts released by the Department of Energy  That is an average increase of  88 per household over last winters heating bill  The expected increase in heating costs reflects predictions of colder weather this year  requiring households to consume more energy to heat their homes  The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration is expecting this winter to be 4 percent colder in the U S  than last year  As a result  the Department of Energy expects that heating costs this winter will be 10 percent higher than last year  The prices of heating fuels are expected to rise this winter as well  according to estimates by the Joint Economic Committee  Heating oil prices are expected to be 16 percent higher this winter relative to last  The prices households can expect to pay for propane heating is 12 9 percent higher than last winter  Increases are expected this winter for the price of natural gas  6 3 percent above last winter  and electricity  2 3 percent above last winter  Brown today called for the preservation of the requested FY 2008  2 2 billion allocation for LIHEAP which helps eligible low income households meet their home heating needs  While that is  400 million over the presidents request  Brown called on Congress to fund the full authorizing level of  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in FY 2009  Heating oil prices in Ohio have risen 48 cents per gallon since October of this year  Last year   687 392 went to LIHEAP Assistance in Mahoning County  but because of higher energy costs  fewer families could receive funding this year or families will receive a lower percentage of their heating bills  Under the vetoed FY 2008 federal request for LIHEAP of  2 2 billion  Ohio was slated to receive more than  100 million  These funds would help LIHEAP recipients cover the gap between their existing LIHEAP benefit and their projected high heating bills  Next week Brown will be joining Senate colleagues to introduce legislation to provide an additional  1billion in emergency LIHEAP funding   Current funding levels have left some states without the means to provide LIHEAP funding year round   In Ohio  when LIHEAP funds run dry  the state is forced to pull funds from other places in the budget  At todays event  Brown also called for Congress to fund WAP at  245 6 million  which is  101 6 million more than the administrations budget request  WAP reduces household energy use and costs by improving the energy efficiency of participants homes  The program has provided services to more than 5 5 million low income families nationwide  and on average reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  358 per year  Weatherization technologies address the whole spectrum of energy consuming systems in low income homes including insulation  air sealing  windows  heating  water heaters  air conditioning  and warm climate weatherization measures  and electrical appliances and weatherization base load measures  The WAP is funded through the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill  which is slated to be considered by the full Senate in December Finally  Brown is working to restore  735 million in funding for the CSBG program  which the president eliminated in his budget request  CSBG provides funds for community action agencies to alleviate the causes and conditions of poverty in communities  The funds provide a range of services and activities to assist the needs of low income individuals including the homeless  migrants and the elderly
