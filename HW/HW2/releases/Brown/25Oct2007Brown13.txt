            Brown  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Inclusion Of Healthy Food Priorities In 2007 Farm Bill                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Inclusion Of Healthy Food Priorities In 2007 Farm Bill  October 25  2007  Washington  DC  U S  Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today announced that a key Senate panel has included provisions of their Food Outreach and Opportunities Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act in the 2007 Farm Bill   Brown  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  was instrumental in securing the programs in the legislation  The Brown Clinton measures  first introduced in May  will help deliver fresh food from farms to underserved communities by increasing the supply and availability of locally produced foods  Following todays approval by the Senate Agriculture Committee  the farm bill will go to the full Senate for consideration in November    This bill brings together family farmers who produce healthy food and working families who need healthy food  It will create new markets for our farmers to sell their goods and give families in communities across Ohio access to the fresh produce they need to stay healthy  Senator Brown said   I am pleased that the farm bill includes needed measures to improve the overall health and food security in our country by providing families greater access to healthy locally grown foods and family farmers access to a greater variety of markets   I have seen first hand how this kind of targeted and creative effort can help farmers and local communities through the Farm to Fork program I helped launch in New York   Taking this approach nationwide will help farmers in New York and across the country access new markets for their products and aid in the fight against diet related heath conditions like obesity and juvenile diabetes   I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure these provisions remain a priority in the final 2007 Farm Bill  said Senator Clinton  The price of fresh fruits and vegetables increased nearly 40 percent between 1985 and 2000  Increasing the availability of healthy and fresh foods in schools and underserved communities is an important aspect of improving the overall health and food security in the United States  The Healthy Food  Healthy Communities report from 2005 found the increase in diabetes  heart disease  and other diet related diseases is partly the result of a lack of fresh food consumption  including fruits and vegetables  According to the Trust for Americas Health  childhood obesity levels have nearly tripled since 1980 to 2004  from 5 to 17 percent  The Brown Clinton provisions in the 2007 Farm Bill create profitable markets for small and midsized family farmers and ranchers   Also  the provisions promote locally led food access initiatives that increase the availability and affordability of healthy and fresh foods  increase fruits and vegetables in school meals  improve access to healthy foods for low income individuals  remove barriers that keep local farmers from selling products to schools  and support farmers markets and road side stands  particularly in underserved areas  According to the Northeast Midwest Institute  when food is produced  packaged  and distributed closer to where it is sold and consumed  farmers earn a higher share of the food dollar  Local food production and distribution works hand in hand with community led efforts to reduce hunger and provide affordable foods needed for good nutrition  especially in communities underserved by retail food stores   The Brown Clinton FOOD for a Healthy America Act provisions in the farm bill include  Providing affordable access to healthy foods Expanding usage of Electronic Benefit Transfer  EBT  cards at farmers markets Creating a new Healthy Food Access Center with sub granting authority and  7 million mandatory funding through the U S  Department of Agriculture Expanding the Farmers Market Program for seniors by  50 million over 5 years Allowing the National School Lunch Program to purchase locally produced food for school meals Expanding the Farmers Market Promotion Program from  5 million over 5 years to  30 million over 5 years Creating pilot projects to evaluate Health and Nutrition Promotion in the Food Stamp Program Expanding the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to more schools  and to every state in the country
