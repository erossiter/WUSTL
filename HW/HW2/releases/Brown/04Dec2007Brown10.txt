            Casey  Brown  Dodd  Schumer Urge Paulson To Address Key Concerns With Administration s Subprime Package                                                                                                                               Press Release    Casey  Brown  Dodd  Schumer Urge Paulson To Address Key Concerns With Administration s Subprime Package December 4  2007  WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senators Bob Casey  D PA   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Chris Dodd  D CT   and Charles Schumer  D NY  today wrote to Henry Paulson  U S  Secretary of Treasury pressing him to ensure that the exact terms of the subprime agreement help as many borrowers as possible    Secretary Paulson is expected to announce the White House proposal later this weekWe applaud your willingness to alter your approach to this issue  and hope that you will show a similarly open mind towards the initiatives some of us have proposed to aid homeowners  they wrote   We believe that this broad modification effort  if done correctly  is an important piece of addressing the subprime crisis and hope that you will consider some specific concerns we have as you work out the final details In particular the Senators asked Paulson to negotiate rigorous terms and outlined five specific points to Paulson Eligibility for modification must not be too narrow  and people must be afforded every opportunity to ensure that they remain in their home  Loan modifications must be long enough to ensure the long term affordability of mortgages  not merely delay foreclosure  All prepayment penalties must be waived  The guidelines must guarantee the fair treatment of families who will not be able to avoid foreclosure  even with modification  The modification program must be transparent to allow for independent monitoring   s went on to write  all of these matters are extremely important to the economic well being of millions of families and the country as a whole   These issues are also evolving very quickly and we understand you may be entering the final stages of negotiating the loan modification plan Senators Casey  Brown  Dodd  and Schumer have together secured a combined  200 million for foreclosure prevention counseling in the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations conference report   The House of Representatives passed the conference report last month   The funding was first requested by Casey  Brown  and Schumer last spring   The conference report will now go to the Senate for final approval   Full text of the letter is below Dear Secretary Paulson We are writing today in regards to your effort to encourage a systemic approach to avoiding foreclosure over the next few years for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are saddled with unaffordable subprime loans  We applaud your willingness to alter your approach to this issue  and hope that you will show a similarly open mind towards the initiatives some of us have proposed to aid homeowners  We believe that this broad modification effort  if done correctly  is an important piece of addressing the subprime crisis and hope that you will consider some specific concerns we have as you work out the final details   First  the extent to which this effort will help borrowers will be entirely dependent upon the criteria used to identify who will qualify for help   Your statements have made it clear that lenders or servicers will establish selection criteria in determining who will have access to relief and who will not   It would be a sad irony if this attempt to correct the damage done by poor underwriting standards that extended too much credit to too many borrowers was undone by criteria that made loan modifications and workouts available to too few borrowers now  In your remarks you have divided households into several categories  including those who will not be able to afford to remain in their homes even with modification  and those who do not need modification to remain in their home and continue to meet their mortgage obligations   Whatever selection criteria are established will undoubtedly leave some borrowers on the margins of eligibility   We believe that lenders and servicers must afford borrowers every opportunity to ensure that they remain in their home and have access to loan modification Second  it is important that whatever loan modifications are provided ensure the long term affordability of the respective mortgage   A temporary solution which merely delays the point at which a borrower cannot afford their mortgage is insufficient   Both homeowners and financial markets are desperate for predictability and stability   The modifications negotiated must leave sufficient time for borrowers to build equity  solidify their financial position  and if necessary  refinance into a fixed mortgage or other appropriate alternative   Third  we are increasingly concerned that prepayment penalties will form a significant barrier to borrower refinancing   These prepayment penalties are a particularly pernicious aspect of subprime lending which we believe is abusive and in many cases prevents homeowners from seeking more equitable loans   Many of these loans were made with little equity  and falling home prices have exacerbated the problem of low or negative loan to value ratios among subprime borrowers   In addition to offering loan write downs to borrowers  we hope that you will insist that lenders and servicers waive all prepayment penalties Fourth  we hope that your modification and assistance guidelines will include provisions to mitigate the costs and trauma experienced by families who will face foreclosure   As you have noted in your public remarks  some borrowers have been extended credit which they cannot afford  even at the introductory rate   Many of these borrowers have already lost their savings as well as their creditworthiness   We believe that there must be guidelines in place to minimize the costs and disruption of foreclosure whenever a lender or servicer determines that such a family cannot afford to keep their home Fifth  servicers and lenders must apply these modification programs in a transparent manner and provide enough timely data to allow for their efforts to be independently monitored   Opaque practices have been a hallmark of this crisis  and sunlight is a necessary component of finding a solution   As President Bush remarked in another context  the best way to determine whether you get good results is to measure Finally  we note that you have asked Congress to undertake a number of steps  from providing funding for foreclosure prevention counseling to passing both temporary and permanent legislative remedies to some of the legal barriers to helping current homeowners and preventing this crisis from recurring   We welcome your assistance in achieving these goals  and believe that you could play an important role in passing this legislation   For example  a number of us were able to include a total of  200 million for foreclosure prevention counseling in the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill   Unfortunately  the President has threatened to veto a number of Congressional spending bills  making final passage of all of the bills more difficult   We believe that you could be of great assistance in convincing the President to remove these veto threats and ask that you endeavor to do so   Additionally  some of our colleagues remain unconvinced that strong legislative action is needed   Majority Leader Reids efforts to pass the reform of the Federal Housing Administration prior to the Thanksgiving recess were frustrated by an objection from Senate Republicans   Just as you have adjusted your position over time and begun to see the need for actions we have been advocating for some time  we hope that you will join us in impressing upon our colleagues the dire need for action  All of these matters are extremely important to the economic well being of millions of families and the country as a whole   These issues are also evolving very quickly and we understand you may be entering the final stages of negotiating the loan modification plan   In light of these circumstances  we would be delighted to discuss this matter as well as our thoughts in further detail   We would benefit from a better understanding of your efforts  and would like to share with you our opinions on what legislative action is necessary  Sincerely Bob Casey  D PA   U S  SenatorSherrod Brown  D OH   U S  SenatorChris
