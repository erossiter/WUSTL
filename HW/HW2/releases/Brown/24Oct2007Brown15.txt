            Senate Vets Committee Holds Hearing On Brown Legislation To Reimburse Rural Hospitals                                                                                                                               Press Release    Senate Vets Committee Holds Hearing On Brown Legislation To Reimburse Rural Hospitals  October 24  2007  WASHINGTON  The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee today held a hearing on U S  s  D OH  legislation to reimburse rural hospitals who serve veterans  The Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act of 2007 was written based on a joint field hearing held in May by Brown and Congressman Zack Space  D Dover  Rural hospitals will often stabilize veterans who come into the emergency room and then transfer them to a Veterans Affairs  VA  hospital for treatment  But this process can sometimes take days  as rural hospitals provide care for the patient until a bed opens up at a VA facility  Under current law  the VA is required to pay for the stabilization  but not for the care that takes place while the community hospital is waiting to transfer the patient  The Brown Space legislation would require the VA to reimburse for all care before a veteran is transferred   Brown released the following opening statement from todays hearing Thank you  Mr  Chairman  And Id like to thank our witnesses for joining us this morning  There are several important pieces of legislation on todays agenda  but in the interests of time  Id like to focus on S  2142  the Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act    Early this year  I received a letter from Terry Carson  the CEO of Harrison Community Hospital  Harrison is a 25 bed community hospital in rural Cadiz  Ohio  Terry alerted me to a reimbursement problem with the VA that was taking a financial toll on his hospital In Late May  Representative Zack Space and I held a joint field hearing on issues facing Veterans in the Rural Areas of Appalachia  and we invited Terry to be a witness  He spoke of his experience serving veterans coming to the hospital for emergency treatment Often  after the veteran has received the initial urgent care  the hospital encounters problems when it attempts to transfer the veteran to an appropriate VA facility for further treatment  Mr  Carson testified that the hospital can wait days for transfer approvals and in some instances  those approvals are withdrawn during the actual transfer of the veteran  Current law does not take this into consideration   Under current law  non VA facilities are reimbursed for the costs of stabilizing a veteran who needs emergency care  and then they are expected to transfer the patient to a veterans facility  If no Veterans facility is available  there is a coverage gap  The Veteran still needs care  the hospital still provides care  but the VA is not required to cover the associated costs  This anomaly in the law is unfair to veterans and hospitals alike My bill closes this loophole  It requires the VA to cover the cost of care provided while a transfer is pending  as long as the hospital documents reasonable attempts to complete that transfer I want to thank Chairman Akaka  Ranking Member Burr  and the Veterans Administration for working with me on this legislation  I look forward to hearing the witnesses views on this and the other bills before us  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
