            Brown Delivers Senate Floor Speech On Progress Of Farm Bill                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Delivers Senate Floor Speech On Progress Of Farm Bill October 25  2007  Washington  DC United States   D OH  delivered the following floor speech Wednesday evening on the 2007 Farm Bill  which was voted out of committee today Mr  President  I appreciate seeing the senator from Pennsylvania in the chair  We were in the agriculture committee today  and I want to thank him for his leadership for dairy farmers and for nutrition  The 2007 farm bill is a chance for congress to make historic strides in agriculture  in alternative energy  and to literally help improve the lives of millions of families across the country  families that are struggling from Harrisburg to Erie  to Lima and to Toledo  In a state like Ohio with a long and rich agriculture history  this bill means a bright future for agriculture for family farmers and for all families  I applaud the leadership of Senator Harkin  Im proud as Ohios first senator to sit on the agriculture committee in four decades to be part of this process  This bill could mean that low income families will have better access  more access to better nutrition by increasing food stamp programs and access to affordable  healthy foods  That means more fruits and vegetables into the schools in Hamilton and Middletown and Akron  It means more fruits and vegetables grown by local farmers to go into farmers markets in Columbus and in Zanesville and all over our state  Earlier this year Mr  President  I and others were gathered in the committee  we heard from Rhonda Stewart of Hamilton  Ohio  perhaps in her early 30s  with I believe a 9 year old son  A single mother  struggling  working full time  probably Im guessing making  8   9   10 an hour  working hard  played by the rules but every month she struggled  At the beginning of the month she told the committee back in February that she would serve her son pork chops once or twice that first week  That was his favorite meal  By the middle of the month she might take him to McDonalds or a fast food restaurant once or twice but almost invariably by the end of the month as times got tough and she struggled financially  she would almost invariably at end of the month sit at the dinner table or the kitchen table with her son  he would be eating  she wouldnt  Whats wrong  Mom  Arent you hungry   No  I dont feel well  The simple reason  she was out of money  We are helping people that work hard  that play by the rules  that do everything we ask them to do in the workplace and in their homes and as a citizen of our community and country  This bill can be a new direction for farmers in Ohio  The 2007 farm bill reflects the values of farmers across Ohio  forward thinking  responsible  working to protect our natural resources and our rural communities  This bill will help family farmers in my state and in Pennsylvania and across the country by strengthening the farm safety net  one that will provide better protection for farmers against disasters  either low yield or low prices  And either one can be obviously devastating to farmers  In the average crop revenue program which senator Durbin and I introduced  Now its part of the farm bill  mended into the farm bill by Chairman Harkin  The average crop revenue program offers a much needed choice to farmers  It represents significant reform for farmers in huge savings  literally  3 5 billion for taxpayers  Farmers can stay in the current program  the old program that really does little to protect against drops in revenue or for the first time ever  farmers will have a choice  be able to switch to a forward looking policy that better protects against volatile crop prices  against natural disasters and rising crop prices  So if farmers are doing well  if prices are good  yield is well  farmers wont get tax dollars generally  But if times are bad  they either yield for some reason  floods or tornadoes or whatever causes major crop yield drops or if the price is low  then the farmer will get help  And thats the way that agriculture should be  And thats the way  frankly  most farmers that I find in northwest Ohio and all over my state want to do too  This spring  I traveled throughout Ohio  I conducted town meetings in Chillicothe  talked to fruit and vegetable and specialty crop farmers in Montgomery County  not too far from Troy and Piqua near Dayton to talk to talk to farmers there  And near Wooster  Ohio  to talk to dairy farmers and Wayne County to talk to farmers that do landscaping and greenhouses and that kind of thing  And then in northwest Ohio to talk to farmers who grow corn and soybeans  I met with a corn farmer in Henry County who will be supplying corn to the first ethanol plant in Ohio  I met with a hog farmer from Montgomery County who uses wind turbines to provide on farm energy   This farm bill makes a commitment to move beyond antiquated energy sources and wean ourselves from Middle Eastern oil and prepare American agriculture to lead the world in renewable energy production  With the right resources  the right incentives  farmers can help decrease our dependence on foreign oil and produce cleaner  sustainable renewable energy  In a state like Ohio  with a talented labor force and a proud lead the nation manufacturing history  that just doesnt mean stronger farms and more prosperous farmers  It means a stronger economy  Rural communities across the nation will benefit from additional federal assistance in this farm bill in small towns  places not far from where I grew up in Lexington  Ohio  and places like Bellville  Small towns will benefit from funding for infrastructure and hospitals while expanding access to broadband for all of my state  especially southeast Ohio  which does not nearly have the access to broadband that it needs  This bill will provide more than  4 billion in additional funding for conservation programs to help farmers protect our water quality  and preserve endangered farmland  While Im pleased with the bill overall  it can be improved  The publics perfectly willing to help family farmers where they need it but taxpayers wont support massive payments to farms that have substantial net incomes  We shouldnt be sending tax dollars to Florida real estate developers  to city farmers that live in New York  to NBA players  to media personalities  Those arent the people that should benefit from the farm bill  I regret we have not funded the McGovern Dole international feeding program  I hope as this legislation progresses that we will do so  Agriculture in Ohio is expected  It has experienced unprecedented changes in recent years but the values of Ohio farmers    hard work  stewardship of the land  caring for their families    the values of Ohios farmers have remained steadfast  We  too  must be steadfast in our support for farmers  We must change how we go about providing that support  I applaud the proposal put forth in the agriculture committee today  I hope we can even improve upon it in the weeks ahead
