            Opening Statement Of  From Today s Veterans Affairs Committee Budget Hearing                                                                                                                               Press Release    Opening Statement Of  From Today s Veterans Affairs Committee Budget Hearing February 13  2007  WASHINGTON  United States   D OH  released the following opening statement at todays Veterans Affairs  VA  Committee Budget hearing Thank you Mr  Chairman  One hundred and eight years ago in a tailor shop on Main Street in the downtown of what was then the small city of Columbus  in my home state of Ohio  13 recently returned veterans of the Spanish American War met to share memories  honor their fallen comrades and to discuss issues facing veterans of foreign wars returning home These veterans were concerned that many of their fellow servicemen had come home wounded or sick  At that time there was no medical care for veterans  no pensions  and they were pretty much left to care for themselves  In that small tailors shop  they formed what would become the Veterans of Foreign Wars  the VFW We have come a long way since then  Much of this improvement can be credited to veteran service organizations  including the many that are here today  as well as the dedication of all Americans to ensure that our veterans are given the treatment and care they have earned  Today  the Department of Veterans Affairs provides some of the best medical care in the world as well as managing a nationwide network that cares for over 24 million veterans We still have a long way to go  I can recite the long litany of challenges  and quite frankly  failures of the Department of Veterans Affairs  but weve already heard many of them  and most of you are familiar with the rest  Within the four volume budget submission  there are thousands upon thousands of line items covering billions and billions of expenditures  so let me highlight just a few of my concerns regarding the Administrations current budget request First  VA medical care funding still lags behind what is needed to meet the growing numbers of veterans  In addition  the administration doesnt account for inflation in its budget submission  The Administrations proposal is a scant  14 percent more than last years  when adjusted for inflation and increased patient utilization costs Second  I am outraged that not only is the VA charging Priority 7 and 8 veterans additional health fees  it is seeking authority to redirect over  310 million in revenues that would be generated from these fees to the Department of the Treasury  Instead of reinvesting this money back into the VA  so less wealthy veterans can get better medical care  the administration wants to use these additional funds for anything it wants  including things like tax cuts for the rich  This money should stay with the VA Third  veterans should not have lengthy waits for health care and they should not be excluded from enrolling for care  The VA health care system needs to be fully funded  and on time  to provide for all veterans seeking care Lastly  the budget is important  but we must not forget that it isnt only what the government spends  but how it spends it   We are in a new era of oversight and I want to make sure that whatever the final budget numbers are  this committees work will not end  Budgets in many ways are promises  this committee continue to ensure that those promises are delivered upon The work of those 13 veterans in 1899 on Main Street  Columbus  Ohio remains unfulfilled  Since then  the VFW has been joined by numerous other groups dedicated to serving Americas veterans  Many of those groups are represented here today including the Paralyzed Veterans of America  the Disabled American Veterans  The American Legion  AMVETS  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  and the Vietnam Veterans of America  Thank you all for your hard work on the budget and thank you for your continued service to this great country We must honor these men and women and the veterans they represent by providing the Department of Veterans Affairs with the funds and oversight that it needs to do its job  I look forward to continued involvement  not only in crafting a budget  but in working by with the Department to ensure that the money spent is not only spent but spent wisely  Thank you Mr  Chairman
