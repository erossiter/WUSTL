                                        Press Release    Mayors Coleman And Anderson  Senator Brown And Local Leaders Tour Columbus  First  Green  Neighborhood September 13  2007  Columbus  OH   In just the past year  an 11 acre site off of Woodland Avenue on Columbus north side went from an abandoned former housing project known as Woodland Ridge Apartments and transformed into GreenView Estates  the citys first energy efficient and environmentally friendly green neighborhood   Today  Mayor Michael B  Coleman took residents  local leaders  U S   and Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson to tour several of the first 13 completed homes We are building neighborhoods in innovative ways no one thought possible a few years ago  and were teaching the private sector that sustainable  energy efficient homes in urban areas can sell  said Mayor Coleman   Theres a growing awareness and demand for green products in America  and Im proud that Columbus is moving ahead on projects like the 30 homes at GreenView Estates and the 74 new condos being built at Jeffrey Place   Families want to live in homes that are affordable and save money by cutting energy bills GreenView Estates is located at 1940 Woodland Avenue is being developed by Sovereign Homes who is using the latest techniques in energy efficiency design  construction and appliances  homeowners can save an estimated  900 a year on utility bills per year   Examples of Green building concepts include water conserving appliances and fixtures  such as low flow toilets  showerheads and faucets  the use of Energy Star Appliances as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions  the use of Energy Star lighting that uses two thirds less energy and lasts 6 10 times longer than traditional lighting   We have the tools necessary to make Ohio the Silicon Valley of Alternative Energy  said Senator Brown  GreenView Estates brings Ohio and the nation one step closer to energy independence Because the homes are green built  Sovereign Homes receives a tax credit from the IRS and plans to pass those on to new residents by paying their utility bills for a year   Additionally  because the development is in a designated Neighborhood Investment District  homeowners will receive a 15 year property tax abatement estimated to save buyers an additional  51 000 over the life of the abatement This is another part of the fulfillment of MiraCits vision to rebuild our community  said Dr  Edgar Posey  of MiraCit Development Corporation   We had been looking at this site for several years after the old Woodland Ridge apartments were torn down   It was our hope  along with that of the neighborhood residents  to rebuild new homes there   When the City presented the possibility of green building  we felt it would be of benefit to homeowners as well as improve the quality of housing available in our area Mayor Coleman also hosted special guest  Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City  Utah   Mayor Anderson is in town to deliver the keynote address to the third annual Columbus Green Building Forum Expo   Mayor Anderson will be discussing Leadership in Climate Protection at noon on Thursday   Under his leadership  Salt Lake City has made dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions   31  to date   Mayor Anderson has received several environmental awards  including the Climate Protection Award from USEPA and the Distinguished Service Award from the Sierra Club Buildings are responsible for forty three percent of the global warming pollution emitted in the US annually  said Mayor Anderson   If we want to effectively combat global warming  we need to take meaningful action to improve the efficiency of our buildings  I am honored to visit the Columbus Green Building Forum and GreenView Estates  which indicate such a positive direction for sustainable design The Citys investment in the GreenView Estates project includes the donation of the 10 92 acre site  new infrastructure that will include streets with decorative lighting  sidewalks  curbs and gutters  and landscaped buffering  as well as a two acre storm water regional detention
