            Brown Testifies At International Trade Commission Hearing On Steel                                                                                                                               Press Release    Brown Testifies At International Trade Commission Hearing On Steel  July 31  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  today testified at an International Trade Commission  ITC  hearing on the five year reviews of Hot Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from 11 nations  including China  Indonesia  and Thailand  Brown emphasized that with American manufacturing in crisis  retaining trade remedy orders on these steel products is essential in order for American steel producers and workers to remain competitive  Brown  a champion of fair trade policies in Congress for nearly 15 years  has called for a new direction for trade  including enforceable environmental and labor standards in trade agreements  rewarding businesses that create jobs in the U S   and bolstering enforcement of existing U S  trade laws  The ITC has found in the past that these counties have dumped steel and hurts U S  workers In 2006  the U S  trade deficit reached a record  836 billion  the fifth straight year with a record  In the past six years  the U S  lost 3 million manufacturing jobs  and Ohio lost more than 180 000 In Ohio  nearly 97 000 jobs are tied to steel production  and Ohio companies have increased production to  6 2 billion in 2005 after sinking to  2 6 billion in 2003  These orders have helped the U S  steel industry to both recover from a steel crisis six years ago  and ensure the continued growth and strength of U S  hot rolled industry  Brown released the following testimony from todays hearing Good morning Chairman Pearson and members of the Commission  I am pleased to testify here today on behalf of a number of hot rolled steel producers in Ohio  including AK Steel and Mittal Steel USA  I am also here to speak on behalf of the workers at those mills who have overcome years of unfair trade to become the most efficient and competitive producers in the world  The orders on hot rolled steel have prevented producers in the covered countries from undermining the ability of our hot rolled companies to remain competitive  If the orders are revoked  I am very worried that many of the foreign producers will again be in a position to gain market share and U S  customers via unfair trade practices of dumping and government subsidies    I have testified before this Commission several times in the past  and have previously expressed my deep concern about the need to preserve the manufacturing base in this country  As you know  the production of hot rolled steel is one of the pillars of that industrial base  Hot rolled steel is used to produce a variety of flat products as well as pipe and a host of other products  It is imperative that this country continue to produce the building block materials that are the basis for much of the rest of our manufacturing sector   U S  producers of hot rolled steel have undergone tremendous transition over the past several years  There has been significant consolidation and rationalization  and today  with continued investment in capital upgrades and new products  the industry is highly competitive  New work rules  and job descriptions have reduced the number of employees required per ton of steel  However  enormous challenges remain  including escalating raw material and energy costs  and increasing environmental regulation  It is imperative that our companies be able to compete in our own market without the threat of renewed dumping and subsidization of hot rolled imports   I  like many others of my colleagues here today  am deeply concerned about the threat to domestic hot rolled producers if the AD and CD orders are removed  The Department of Commerce has already found that 10 of the 11 countries at issue in this review were likely to again engage in unfair trade if the orders are lifted  In fact  the threat from increases in unfairly traded imports from covered countries is in some sense even more significant than it was in the original investigations China has increased its hot rolled capacity by an astonishing 90 percent since 2001  from 28 8 million short tons to 54 5 million short tons last year  Of significant concern is that China has become a net exporter  and is building up production capacity far faster than the increase in demand in China  Imports from China across all steel categories not covered by AD orders such as hot rolled sheet are exploding  Moreover  there is no end in sight to these increases as the state owned steel hot rolled producers in China continue to benefit from a host of government subsidies that provide them with a huge unfair advantage     We have also seen troubling events in India  where the government has committed itself to becoming one of the largest steel producers in the world  and is providing significant government support to make this a reality  Similar evidence exists for other exporting countries   The steel industry is incredibly important to Ohio  where nearly 97 000 Ohio jobs are tied to steel according to the Ohio Steel Councils 2006 Annual Report  Mittal Steel USA currently employs about 2 000 people in my state  more than half of whom work at the steel mill in   Just six years ago  following successive waves of unfair imports  that plant was shut down completely  Today  that plant is one of the most efficient in the world  shipping some 2 000 tons of steel per employee annually  It is imperative that we enforce our trade laws to create and maintain a fair environment for our domestic manufacturers   We owe it to the companies and workers that have sacrificed a lot  to ensure that the unfair competition does not wreck havoc on the social and economic fiber of our steel states  Thank you for the opportunity to be here
