            Energy Bill Offers Renewal For Ohio s Manufacturing Base   Brown Unveils Amendments To Promote Alternative Energy And Reduce U S  Reliance On Foreign Oil                                                                                                                               Press Release    Energy Bill Offers Renewal For Ohio s Manufacturing Base   Brown Unveils Amendments To Promote Alternative Energy And Reduce U S  Reliance On Foreign Oil  June 21  2007  WASHINGTON  Since 2001  Ohio has lost more than 185 000 manufacturing jobs  however  the Senate Energy Bill offers renewal for Ohios manufacturing base  U S    D OH  today unveiled several amendments to the Energy Bill  which is currently being debated on the floor  Through Browns amendments and a national commitment to alternative energy  Ohio is poised to create thousands of new jobs in the research  development  and the manufacturing of components for the alternative energy sector This legislation is a series of first steps on the journey towards Ohios future  Brown said  This will bring us one step closer to more good paying green manufacturing jobs  stable energy prices  and a healthier environment  This will make a real difference in rebuilding the middle class in Ohio and across this country In the last five years  Ohio has lost nearly 19  of its manufacturing base  Seventy seven of Ohios eighty eight counties have had a loss of manufacturing jobs since 2001  with the remainder experiencing stagnation  However  regions hurt the most by manufacturing job loss also have the most potential to take advantage of supplying the components required by the alternative energy sector To realize this potential  Brown introduced the Renewable Energy Innovation Manufacturing Partnership which would take the first step in creating manufacturing jobs by providing competitive grants to non profit institutions and private manufacturers who work together to develop renewable energy manufacturing technologies  These multi year grants would be used for research  development  and demonstration projects for advanced manufacturing technologies and allow private manufacturers to conduct studies of market opportunities for component manufacturing of renewable energy systems  This amendment also calls on the Department of Energy to include small manufacturers when providing loan guarantees to companies that employ innovative energy technologies   While Brown intends to support raising CAFE standards to push the auto industry to meet the challenges of the future  he introduced three amendments to assist the industry meet these standards  First  Brown introduced the Federal Fleet Conservation Requirements which would require the federal government to be a leader in procuring hybrid and flex fuel vehicles  Specifically  it would require that by 2009  5 percent of the federal governments fleet of vehicles be hybrid or flex fuel  by 2015  15 percent and by 2020  the amendment requires that 25 percent of the federal fleet to be hybrid or flex fuel   The federal fleet is over 650 000 vehicles Second  Brown introduced the Minimum Fuel Economy Target for Passenger Automobiles Manufactured in the United States which would provide for an alternative minimum fuel economy standard that would separately apply to domestically manufactured automobiles and foreign manufactured automobiles  The standard for the combined domestic and foreign manufactured passenger cars would not change  This would ensure that the domestic passenger car fleet and foreign passenger car fleet each meet at least 92 percent of the entire  industry wide passenger car CAFE number  providing a strong incentive for companies to continue domestic production of small passenger cars  thereby protecting the jobs of 17 000 American workers who currently assemble compact cars in this country  along with tens of thousands of workers who produce parts for these vehicles Third  Brown introduced an amendment on lightweight materials research and development which would direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a research and development program to determine ways in which the weight of vehicles may be reduced  develop new materials with a higher strength  reduce the cost of lightweight materials  and improve the efficiency of automated manufacturing processes We have the opportunity now to bring tomorrows technologies to market today  Brown added  Other amendments Brown introduced include     Establishment of Carbon Capture and Storage direct loan program      Preference to existing DOE facilities for Carbon Capture and Sequestration  CCS  Technology and Demonstration       Making Colleges and Nonprofit Hospitals eligible for EPA Grant Program     Non road spark ignition Amendment     Study on Carbon Labeling System      Tax Credit for Anti corrosion Technology     Tax Credit for the Development of advanced technology motor vehicles and Components
