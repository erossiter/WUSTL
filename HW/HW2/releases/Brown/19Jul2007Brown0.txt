            Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing                                                                                                                               Press Release    Statement Of  From Today s Banking Committee Hearing July 19  2007  Washington  DC  U S    D OH  released the following statement from todays Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Second Annual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress Chairman Bernanke  thank you for joining us this morning  Im particularly pleased that your testimony describes Congress as prescient in the trend toward transparency  Its not often that you see the words Congress and prescient in the same sentence  As you note  we need to encourage transparency in both central banking and in financial services  and particularly in the mortgage business  I appreciate your devoting much of your testimony to the work of the Federal Reserve in promoting better disclosure for mortgage borrowers  and hope you and your colleagues will approach this task with great urgency   As you know  the loans of close to 2 million sub prime borrowers will reset in the next two years  Every day of inaction means another two to three thousand families mortgages will reset without sufficient protections  If they are lucky  many of these families will be able to take out another lousy mortgage  If they are unlucky  they may lose their lifes savings The Federal Reserve must act and it must act quickly  both to mitigate the damage that has already been done  and to prevent a continuation of the abusive practices and products that have characterized too much of the mortgage industry over the past few years  I understand why a lender needs to price for risk  But I dont understand why the structure of mortgage products is so different in the prime and sub prime markets  Most of the people in this room dont have a prepayment penalty on their mortgage  Most of us have our property taxes and hazard insurance escrowed By contrast  the loans in the sub prime sector  like the 2 28s  seemed almost designed to deceive  They are sold to borrowers at teaser rates  with dangerous features  and with the smooth pitch that there is no need to worry about the reset because good things might happen  a better job  a better loan  winning the lottery  But betting on the outcome is not a sound banking practice  It is possible that I will play like Grady Sizemore in next years Congressional baseball game  but the Indians would be well advised not to put him on waivers You obviously need to take the broad view in your position  But the very dispersion of risk that makes the sub prime problem less of a worry from an economic standpoint makes it a greater problem for homeowners trying to work out an unaffordable loan  We all know that it makes economic sense for a lender to mitigate losses  but just try getting the right person on the phone in a timely fashion  especially if the owner of the loan sits in Shanghai One mans junk is another mans treasure  What may look like triple B debt to an investor on Wall Street is really the hopes and dreams of thousands of families on Euclid Avenue and across the country  Those hopes and dreams diminish with every day we delay  So I would urge you take action quickly and comprehensively   You need to bring an end to the deceptive practices in the sub prime sector  not just for banks and their affiliates  but for all mortgage brokers and all types of lenders  Thank you  and I look forward to your testimony
