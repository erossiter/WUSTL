SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement on the Flag Protection Amendment:  
   "I feel strongly that our flag is a symbol of the spirit, principles, and system of government on which this nation is founded. We should view the flag as a national monument and treat it with respect and protect it. 
   I am a co-sponsor of this resolution. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass this resolution by one vote. Sixty-seven votes are needed to amend the Constitution and we only had sixty-six. I believe the amendment is necessary to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. 
   As the son of a World War II veteran, I was honored to have the opportunity in May to tour the American military cemeteries in Europe and North Africa. I was able to locate the graves of young soldiers from North Carolina and pay my respects by placing our great flag graveside. When I see our flag flying I often think of those who have given so freely of themselves so we can enjoy the liberties and freedoms our nation offers."
