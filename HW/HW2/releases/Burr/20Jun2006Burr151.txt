SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $2.1 MILLION FOR NORTH CAROLINA FERRY SYSTEM
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $2,166,332 in federal funding for the North Carolina Ferry System. The grant will be used to help construct a new 220-foot Sound Class ferry for service between Cedar Island and Ocracoke. The United States Department of Transportation awarded the funds.  
   "The ferry system is vital to coastal North Carolina. It serves both the tourism industry and the residents of communities like Ocracoke," said Senator Burr. "These funds will ensure an efficient ferry system between Cedar Island and Ocracoke." 
   Each year, North Carolina's ferry system transports over 2.5 million passengers and over 1.1 million vehicles to and from the Outer Banks. The new Sound Class ferry will hold up to 300 passengers and 50 vehicles, and will also carry goods to residents and businesses in the water-locked Ocracoke community.
