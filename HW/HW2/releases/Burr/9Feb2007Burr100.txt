SEN. BURR CONGRATULATES JOHN QUEEN FOR HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Richard Burr today congratulated John Queen, a native of Waynesville, North Carolina, for his election as president of the National Cattlemen's Association. Since its inception in 1898, the association has only had two other presidents from the southeastern United States.  
   "John will be a grassroots champion for cattlemen and North Carolina's agriculture community," Burr said. "I congratulate him and look forward to working with him." 
   Queen was elected President of National Cattlemen's Association last week at the 2007 Cattle Industry Annual Convention in Nashville. More than 6500 cattlemen from across the nation attended. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) is the largest organization representing America's cattle industry.
