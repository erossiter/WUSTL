SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $15 MILLION GRANT FOR PIEDMONT TRIAD REGION
 Sen. Richard Burr today announced $15,000,000 in federal funding from the United States Department of Labor (DOL) for the Piedmont Triad Region.  
 The funding will be used to expand employment, advance opportunities for North Carolina's workers and create high-skill and high wage jobs in the region. The following counties will benefit from the funding: Alamance, Caswell, Davidson, Davie, Forsyth, Guilford, Montgomery, Randolph, Rockingham, Stokes, Surry, and Yadkin. 
   "I am proud North Carolina will get a WIRED Initiative grant," said Senator Burr. "This funding will be a great economic boost to the region." 
   The WIRED Initiative is focused on labor markets that have multiple jurisdictions within a state. The Piedmont Triad Region was one of twelve economic regions selected from across the country by the U.S. Department of Labor to receive funding. The grant will be distributed over a period of three years and will be used to expand employment and advancement opportunities for American workers and focus on the creation of high-skill and high-wage jobs in regional economies. 
   The WIRED Initiative is part of President Bush's Competitiveness Agenda.
