SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $5.35 MILLION FOR JOHNSTON COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $5,350,000 in federal funding for the Little River Water District to provide water service to 470 new users in Johnston County.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program approved a loan of $4,350,000 and awarded a grant of $1,000,000 to the district for the construction of 48 miles of water lines, 78 fire hydrants and a master water meter station. 
   "Clean drinking water and proper waste disposal are essential for rural North Carolina," said Senator Burr. "These funds will help Johnston County expand access to clean water." 
   USDA Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal loans and grants improve the quality of life and promote economic development in rural areas. Residents in the Little River Water District rely on private wells many of which do not currently meet Johnston County health standards. The continued construction of this project, which received $3,092,000 from Rural Development in FY 2005, expands access to clean drinking water to this district. 
   The loan was approved at a rate of 4.25 percent over 40 years.
