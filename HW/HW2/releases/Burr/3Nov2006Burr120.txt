SEN. BURR APPLAUDS GUILFORD COUNTY SCHOOLS FOR RECEIVING OVER $8 MILLION IN EDUCATION FUNDS
  Sen. Richard Burr today applauded Guilford County schools for receiving $8,000,005 in federal funding. The grant was awarded through the United States Department of Education's Teacher Incentive Fund, which aims to improve student achievement by increasing the number of effective teachers for minority and disadvantaged students.  
   "I believe investing in education is one of the best ways to secure a bright future for North Carolina. A good education ensures that North Carolina's students are better prepared for the work force. I applaud Guilford County for rewarding teachers for doing a good job," Burr said. "These funds will help recruit and retain more teachers which will ultimately help students achieve academic success." 
   The grant will be used to expand Guilford County Schools' Mission Possible teacher incentive program to additional schools. Mission Possible was developed to attract and retain teachers for select schools and to reward teachers for outstanding results. Teachers and administrators in the program are placed in high-need, disadvantaged schools, where teacher and administrative turnover has often been high and which are not making ABC or AYP academic standards.
