SENS. DOLE, BURR CALL FOR INCREASED REPRESENTATION ON FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr called for increased North Carolina representation on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In a letter to President Bush, the Senators urged the White House to increase the number of North Carolinians on the Fourth Circuit.  
   "As you know, states generally are represented on the federal appellate circuits in proportion to their populations," wrote Dole and Burr. "Based upon this guidepost, one would expect North Carolina--the most populous state in the Fourth Circuit--to be assigned four or five of the circuit's fifteen judicial seats. North Carolina, however, has historically been significantly underrepresented on the court and presently can claim only one Fourth Circuit judge, the Honorable Allyson Duncan?.We believe that this is tremendously unfair to the residents of our great state." 
   A second North Carolinian, Judge Terrence Boyle, has been nominated to the Fourth Circuit but awaits confirmation by the Senate. Boyle currently serves on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
