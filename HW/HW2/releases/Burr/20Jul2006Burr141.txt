SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement on the Voting Rights Act:  
   "I supported the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate voted unanimously to reauthorize the Act without amendments. 
   I believe our democratic process in which citizens elect those who will govern is a cornerstone of America. Voting rights ensure the integrity of our electoral process and guarantee all Americans have the opportunity to participate in this process. It is this process which has contributed greatly to making our nation stable, resilient, and a leader in the World. 
   Voting rights for all American citizens regardless of race, is granted by the 15th Amendment and enforced by the Voting Rights Act."
