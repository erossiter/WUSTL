SENS. BURR, DOLE RE-INTRODUCE SCOTT GARDNER ACT
  Today Sens. Richard Burr and Elizabeth Dole re-introduced the Scott Gardner Act. The legislation requires the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). The bill is named for Scott Gardner, a Gaston County native, who was killed by a drunk driver while traveling on vacation with his family in 2005. The driver was an illegal immigrant with four previous DWI convictions. Rep. Sue Myrick introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives.  
   "Thousands of Americans are killed by drunk drivers every year," Burr said. "This legislation will ensure illegal immigrants that drive under the influence will be deported and will not have the opportunity to repeat such reckless behavior." 
   "Our DWI laws should be vigorously enforced, whether the offender is an illegal immigrant or a U.S. citizen, and when the offender is in this country illegally, he or she should not be allowed to remain here," said Dole. "I am proud to join Richard Burr, and Sue Myrick in the House, in working to address this important issue." 
   The bill also improves collaboration between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies through training and information sharing. In addition, the legislation mandates the construction of federal detention centers in areas with a high population of illegal immigrants. 
   Senator Burr introduced the Scott Gardner Act last year during the 109th Congress.
