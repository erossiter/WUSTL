  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $29,310,000 in federal funding to North Carolina. The funding will be used to assist state and local governments in their ability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded the funds through its Homeland Security Grant Program.  
   "Homeland Security funds help North Carolina improve its ability to prepare for and respond to national threats, whether they are accidental, deliberate, or Mother Nature," Burr said. "These funds help make sure we are better prepared to respond in an emergency on all levels from local government to the state government." 
   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) awarded North Carolina $10,780,000 in federal funding to enhance the capability of state and local government to prevent, deter, respond to, and recover from incidents of terrorism and other catastrophic attacks. 
   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) awarded North Carolina $9,560, 000 in federal funding to assist law enforcement and public safety officials in the prevention of terrorist attacks through activities such as intelligence gathering, information sharing, and target hardening. 
   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) awarded North Carolina $8,970,000 in federal funding to fund designated high-threat, high-density urban areas against acts of terrorism and catastrophic events. 
    In 2006, the United States Department of Homeland Security's Grant Program will award approximately $1.7 billion to states, territories, and urban areas to enhance homeland security preparations.
