SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FEDERAL GRANT FOR WESTERN PIEDMONT COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,000,000 in federal funds for Western Piedmont Community College (WPCC) in Morganton. The money will be used to build a new workforce training facility, which will enhance the college's health care education programs. The funds were awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce through its Economic Development Administration.  
   "I applaud Western Piedmont Community College for taking the lead in preparing Burke County residents for work in our changing economy," Burr said. "These funds will enhance the quality of health care in the area and generate economic growth." 
   "President Bush believes one way to create jobs is to grow the economy by encouraging investments in local communities," said U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Sandy K. Baruah. "This EDA investment will help attract $120 million in private investment and create 220 jobs for local citizens." 
   The million dollar investment will be used to renovate a former manufacturing plant to accommodate WPCC's growing health care education programs. The new facility is expected to train more than 500 students annually in health care occupations, creating 220 jobs and generating more than $120 million in private investment in the region.
