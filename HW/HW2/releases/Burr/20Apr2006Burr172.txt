SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES NASA FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $358,137 in federal funding to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The funding will be used to assess the impact of vegetation structure and physiology on biodiversity. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awarded the funds.  
   "I am pleased with UNC-Chapel Hill's advanced research in this field," Burr said. "This funding and research will help NASA improve its space and aeronautics programs." 
   NASA's Terrestrial Ecology and Biodiversity program addresses changes in the Earth's carbon cycle and various ecosystems using space-based observations. It focuses on land-based ecosystems and how their functions support human life and maintain planet Earth's habitability. This funding will be used to gain a better understanding of our ecosystems. Eventually NASA hopes to apply this research to create better life support systems for their space and aeronautics programs.
