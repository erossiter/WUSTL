SEN. BURR: OVER $74 MILLION IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDS FOR NORTH CAROLINA INCLUDED IN HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced that over $74 million for North Carolina-designated transportation projects have been included in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The Senate is scheduled to consider the legislation later today.  
   "These transportation projects are vital to our state's infrastructure and good examples of the federal, state and local government working in partnership," said Senator Burr. "These projects will benefit those who use our roads and highways throughout the state and encourage economic expansion and job growth. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to vote for the bill." 
   In addition, North Carolina's rate of return for federal highway funding, under the legislation, will increase from 90.5 percent to 92 percent by 2008, meaning North Carolina will see a return of 92 cents for every dollar paid into the Highway Trust Fund. This will mean over $1 billion annually for improvements for North Carolina's federal-aid highways. 
   "The increase in North Carolina's rate of return to 92 percent is an improvement over the last highway bill. Millions of dollars North Carolinians pay into the federal trust fund every year will now stay in our State," Senator Burr added.
