SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR MONROE FIREFIGHTERS
 Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,175,290 in federal funding for the Monroe Fire Department. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, which aims to increase the staffing and deployment capabilities of fire departments.  
   "I applaud the Monroe Fire Department for using these funds to better prepare our communities for an emergency," Burr said. "Local fire departments are one of the first to respond in a time of need. The additional firefighters provided by this grant will improve the City of Monroe's emergency response times." 
   The Monroe Fire Department will use the funds to hire twelve additional firefighters. The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program is part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which supports firefighters and the services they deliver.
