   "Clean drinking water and proper waste disposal are essential for rural North Carolina," said Senator Burr. "These funds will help Halifax County expand access to clean water." 
   USDA Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal loans improve the quality of life and promote economic development in rural areas. Halifax County will extend access to clean water to 270 new households and one school with this loan.
