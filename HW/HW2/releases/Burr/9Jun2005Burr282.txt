SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES PLANS TO DRAFT BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS LEGISLATION
  Sen. Richard Burr laid out his vision today on upcoming biodefense legislation and outlined plans to draft legislation to increase bioterrorism preparedness.  
   Senator Burr, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness, made his remarks at a Georgetown University conference entitled "Preparing for the Inevitable: Bioterrorism and Emerging Infectious Diseases." The conference, sponsored by Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute and School of Foreign Service, brought together bioterrorism experts from across the country to discuss the future of biodefense issues. Senator Burr was a keynote speaker to the conference. 
   "I believe that we can, and must, draft a biodefense preparedness bill to address these preparedness issues and doing this is a top priority of my subcommittee this summer. I know working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, we can make improvements that will benefit all Americans," Burr said. 
   "The detection of disease outbreaks is only the beginning of what needs to be done. We need to prepare for a possible flu pandemic and we need to make more progress in our ability to mobilize a response to a smallpox attack," he added.
