SENS. BURR, LINCOLN INTRODUCE HELPING SOLE COMMUNITY HOSPITALS ACT OF 2006
  Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) today introduced the Helping Sole Community Hospitals Act of 2006. The legislation would provide Sole Community Hospitals (SCH) monetary relief by waiving the 12 percent cap on disproportionate share hospital payments.  
   Approximately 156 Sole Community Hospitals nationwide would benefit from the legislation including four hospitals in North Carolina. The hospitals in North Carolina that would benefit from the legislation are: Spruce Pine Community Hospital in Spruce Pine; Ashe Memorial Hospital in Jefferson; Roanoke Chowan Hospital in Ahoskie; and Halifax Regional Medical Center in Roanoke Rapids. 
   "It is important that residents in rural North Carolina who depend on Sole Community Hospitals receive the best care possible. This legislation provides Sole Community Hospitals in North Carolina and across the country financial relief," Burr said. "These hospitals provide health care services to many North Carolinians. I want to ensure these hospitals are able to keep their doors open to serve citizens." 
   "It is critical that people living in rural America have access to quality health care," Lincoln said. "Our rural hospitals play an important role in providing care to our most vulnerable citizens - seniors, sick and disabled individuals, and those without health insurance. I will fight hard for this legislation which provides substantial relief to several rural hospitals throughout Arkansas." 
   A hospital is eligible to be classified as a Sole Community Hospital if it is located more than 35 miles from another hospital or if it is determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be the sole source of inpatient hospital services in a rural area.
