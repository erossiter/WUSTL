SEN. BURR SETTLES ORANGE BOWL BET WITH REPUBLICAN LEADER MCCONNELL
  Sen. Richard Burr today honored his bet with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) by delivering an authentic North Carolina barbeque lunch to McConnell's Washington office. Sen. McConnell's alma mater, Louisville beat Burr's Wake Forest Demon Deacons 24-13 in the Orange Bowl on January 2. Prior to the game, the senators placed a friendly wager - a Kentucky Fried Chicken lunch for North Carolina barbeque on the outcome of the game.  
   "I am proud of the successful season the Demon Deacons had this year. They played hard against a great Louisville team in the Orange Bowl," said Senator Burr. "Coach Grobe and his team represented the university and the Atlantic Coast Conference well and I am looking forward to another exciting season next year." 
   After Burr delivered the barbeque to McConnell, the two senators enjoyed an authentic barbeque lunch with all of the proper fixins.
