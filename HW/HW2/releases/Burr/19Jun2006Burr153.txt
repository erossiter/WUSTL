SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $2.3 MILLION FOR NORTH CAROLINA STATE SHIPYARD
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $2,363,271 in federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The grant will be used to renovate the North Carolina state shipyard, also known as the Manns Harbor Maintenance Facility in Dare County. The United States Department of Transportation awarded the funds.  
   "North Carolina's ferry system is an important part of our coastal communities," Burr said. "This funding will increase the shipyard's productivity as well as ensure a more environmentally friendly facility." 
   The shipyard is responsible for maintaining the state's twenty-seven ferries. The funding will be used for demolition and construction of an indoor shipyard, which will prevent paint from potentially contaminating the surrounding wetlands. The building will also increase productivity in the shipyard since the new facility will be indoors and bad weather will not affect maintenance work schedules.
