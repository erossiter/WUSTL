SEN. BURR CONTINUES WORK TO PROTECT NORTH CAROLINA'S OFFSHORE DRILLING MORATORIUM
  Sen. Richard Burr today voted for an amendment which would have removed a provision from the energy bill allowing an inventory of oil and natural gas reserves off the coast of North Carolina.  
 Burr co-sponsored the amendment. As a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Sen. Burr voted last month against allowing the inventory. 
   "North Carolina's coasts are precious resources in our environment and for our state's economy that must be protected," said Burr, a long-time opponent of lifting North Carolina's moratorium. "North Carolina has a history of protecting our coasts and I will continue my efforts to honor the moratorium and care for North Carolina's coasts." 
   As a Member of the House of Representatives, Burr voted to honor the moratorium off the state's coast five times and twice signed onto letters opposing efforts to lift the moratorium. Additionally, in February of this year, Senator Burr joined a bipartisan group of Senators in a letter in support of the moratorium. 
   The debate was part of the Senate's consideration of bipartisan, comprehensive energy legislation that conserves energy usage, while reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil.
