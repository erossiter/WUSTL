SEN. BURR'S VETERANS HOMELESSNESS BILL APPROVED BY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE VETERANS PACKAGE
  Today Sen. Richard Burr's Services to Prevent Veterans Homelessness Act, S. 1991, was approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee as part of Committee Chairman Sen. Larry Craig's (R-ID) Veterans Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act of 2006, S.2694. Burr's legislation provides supportive services to keep low-income veterans in permanent housing so they do not become homeless. It will increase veterans' access to assistance for housing, physical and mental health services, health insurance, and vocational and financial counseling.  
   "Our veterans have given the ultimate sacrifice so we may live in freedom. We must ensure their service is honored and they are not forgotten when they return home," Burr said. "Many of our veterans find themselves living in extreme poverty and some are homeless. This legislation will help ensure our veterans receive access to the benefits they deserve." 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 1.5 million of our Nation's veterans live in poverty. North Carolina is home to over 770,000 veterans. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it is estimated that there are over 40,000 North Carolina veterans living below the national poverty level. 
   The Veterans Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act of 2006 expands services for veterans and focuses on the national goal of ending homelessness among veterans by 2011 and for the first time creates programs designed to prevent veteran homelessness before it occurs, expands services for veterans. 
   "I hope the U.S. Senate gives this legislation full consideration in a timely manner," Burr added. 
   Burr serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the U.S. Senate. He introduced his Services to Prevent Veterans Homelessness legislation in November 2005.
