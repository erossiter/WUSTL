SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES NORTH CAROLINA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUMMIT
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced he will cosponsor a North Carolina Economic Development Summit to focus on access to federal grants for community colleges throughout the state.  
 The summit is the first in a series Sen. Burr has developed to make North Carolina more competitive in the federal arena. This summit aims to enhance community college personnel's knowledge of the federal grants process so they will be better able to share the information with their communities. 
   "Community colleges play a vital role in North Carolina's economy. This first summit is designed to share more information with community college leaders about how to increase their competitiveness for federal grants which stimulate economic development in their communities," said Senator Burr. "In the coming year my office will host additional opportunities to share information with North Carolinians about how to access federal resources." 
   This year, additional events will include summits addressing health care and education related to economic development in the Tar Heel state. In addition to the summits, Senator Burr will host workshops in both Washington, D.C. and North Carolina. The workshops will concentrate on accessing federal resources and more effective grant writing skills for small businesses and county, city, and town managers. 
   Federal officials from the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, Homeland Security and Labor will facilitate Monday's session discussions. In addition, representatives from Wake Forest University, North Carolina Community College System and state government officials will also actively participate in the workshops and sessions.
