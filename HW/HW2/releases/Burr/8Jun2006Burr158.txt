SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $2.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL EDUCATION FUNDING
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $2,871,016 in federal funding for the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The funding will be used to study the effectiveness of the Early College High School (ECHS) Model by comparing the achievement, behavior, attitudes, and dropout rates of students attending these high schools to students attending more traditional high schools. The United States Department of Education awarded the funds.  
   "It is important we do all we can to encourage students to stay in school. This funding will be valuable in determining the best methods to use for comprehensive high school reform," said Senator Burr. "This study will help us better understand the effects of different education methods used by North Carolina's high schools." 
   The grant will assist UNC-Greensboro's study of the effectiveness of the Early College High School Model, a method of high school reform being widely implemented across America but the results of which have not been thoroughly examined. 
   Burr serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
