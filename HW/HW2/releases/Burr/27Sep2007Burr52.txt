REP. BURR APPLAUDS NEW VA CLINIC IN FRANKLIN
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today applauded the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for beginning construction of a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Franklin. The clinic will be located in a building donated by retired Gen. F.P. Bodenheimer, Jr. The 7,500 square foot facility is scheduled to open in mid-2008 and will serve the area's 14,000 veterans.  
   "I applaud the Department of Veterans Affairs for improving the lives of Western North Carolina veterans by opening this facility," Burr said. "The VA must respond to North Carolina's growing veterans population by opening new facilities and expanding existing ones. The Franklin CBOC will bring VA services closer to the veterans and enable the VA to treat more veterans than before," Burr added. 
   The new Franklin CBOC will provide primary and preventative health care to an expected 3,800 veterans who would otherwise have to visit the Asheville VA Medical Center. Veterans who visit the Franklin facility will be able to receive physicals, disease screening, patient education, routine lab work, and immunizations. Veterans requiring specialized care will continue to receive treatment at the Asheville VA Medical Center. 
   Burr serves as acting ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.
