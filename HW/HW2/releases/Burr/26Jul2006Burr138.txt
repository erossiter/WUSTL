SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRIME MINISTER MALIKI'S ADDRESS TO JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement on Prime Minister Maliki's joint address to Congress:  
   "I applaud Prime Minister Maliki's determination and commitment to defeating terrorism and creating a free and stable democracy in Iraq. His visit to the United States demonstrates his desire to bring stability and security to his country. 
   The Prime Minister made clear that withdrawing American troops from Iraq before his government can effectively protect its people could undermine the new Iraqi democracy. I believe it is in the best interest of the Iraqi people, the United States, and global security that we remain committed to finishing the job in Iraq. 
   Prime Minister Maliki has a strong vision for his country and under his leadership it is my hope Iraq becomes a beacon of peace and prosperity in the troubled Middle East region. America is a partner with Iraq and we are committed to supporting Iraq's constitutional democracy and will continue to assist Iraq in its effort to establish peace for its citizens."
