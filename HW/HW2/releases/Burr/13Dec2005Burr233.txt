SEN. BURR MEETS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE ALITO
 Sen. Richard Burr today met with Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel A. Alito.  
 During the 30-minute meeting, Sen. Burr and Judge Alito discussed Alito's background, judicial experience and his views on judicial activism. 
   "Clearly, Judge Alito has the qualifications and experience necessary to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court," said Senator Burr. "I look forward to closely following Judge Alito's confirmation hearing. Given that he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 1990 to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals, I remain hopeful that Judge Alito will receive a fair hearing and receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor."
