SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON NAVY'S OLF SITE SELECTION ANNOUNCEMENT
  Senator Richard Burr today made the following statement regarding the Navy's announcement that it will consider two North Carolina sites for an Outlying Landing Field (OLF):  
   "It has always been my hope that the Navy and the State of North Carolina could find a location for an OLF that was acceptable to both the military and the local community. It was clear that some of the previously proposed sites were opposed by North Carolinians and I am pleased that those sites are no longer under consideration. The Navy has announced it will now evaluate potential sites suggested by North Carolina and the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is crucial the Navy listen to the local community when considering these sites. This lengthy process has been difficult on many North Carolinians, and I hope that the Navy can follow the siting process and find a resolution to this matter."
