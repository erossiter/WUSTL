SEN. BURR APPLAUDS DECISION TO COMMISSION U.S.S. NORTH CAROLINA IN WILMINGTON
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today applauded the U.S. Navy's decision to commission the U.S.S. North Carolina in Wilmington during the spring of 2008. The newest Virginia class submarine will be able to attack targets ashore with state-of-the-art Tomahawk missiles as well as conduct covert long-term surveillance and reconnaissance and special forces missions.  
   "I am so pleased the U.S.S. North Carolina will be commissioned in North Carolina," Burr said. "The North Carolina name is one rich in history and accomplishment. I look forward to seeing our nation's newest submarine bearing the name of our nation's most military friendly state." 
   Three other Navy ships have borne the state's name. The most recent U.S.S. North Carolina served during World War II and earned twelve battle stars before being retired and moved to Wilmington where it serves as a memorial to soldiers who gave their lives during World War II.
