SEN. BURR REINTRODUCES 'SERVICES TO PREVENT VETERANS HOMELESSNESS ACT'
  Today Sen. Richard Burr reintroduced the Services to Prevent Veterans Homelessness Act, S. 874. Burr's legislation provides supportive services to keep low-income veterans in permanent housing so they do not become homeless. It will increase veterans' access to assistance for housing, physical and mental health services, health insurance, and vocational and financial counseling.  
   "I am grateful to the veterans who have given so much to our country. While we can never fully repay them for their service on behalf of our Nation, it is important that we remember their sacrifices and provide services for them," Burr said. "Many of our veterans find themselves living in extreme poverty and some are homeless. This legislation will help ensure our veterans receive access to the benefits they deserve." 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 1.5 million of our Nation's veterans live in poverty. North Carolina is home to over 770,000 veterans. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it is estimated that there are over 40,000 North Carolina veterans living below the national poverty level. 
   "I hope the U.S. Senate gives this legislation full consideration quickly," Burr added. 
   Burr serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the U.S. Senate. He introduced his Services to Prevent Veterans Homelessness legislation in November 2005 and in June 2006 the legislation was passed by the Senate as part of the Veterans Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act of 2006 but was not included in the final legislation negotiated with the House of Representatives.
