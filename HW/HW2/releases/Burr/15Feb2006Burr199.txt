SEN. BURR APPLAUDS UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT ON TRADE WITH CHINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today praised the decision by United States Trade Representative Rob Portman to increase enforcement of our trade laws with China.  
   Ambassador Portman's announcement, which came following a top to bottom review on U.S.-China Trade Relations by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), would increase trade enforcement by: 
   * Expanding USTR trade enforcement capacity to better ensure China's compliance with trade obligations 
   * Establishing a China Enforcement Task Force at USTR, to be headed by a Chief Counsel for China Trade Enforcement 
   * Increasing the focus on regulatory reform in China 
   * Launching an initiative to evaluate, assess and engage on China's subsidies issues, expanding initiatives led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
   "I'm pleased the Bush Administration and Ambassador Portman have identified the need to increase the enforcement of our trade laws with China," said Senator Burr. "This is a good step. There's no question that failing to enforce these agreements has had an impact on North Carolina's economy, especially in our manufacturing sector. By creating a new chief counsel to deal directly with China trade enforcement, I'm hopeful this increased attention to enforcement issues will further protect our economy from additional job losses."
