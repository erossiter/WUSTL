SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $23 MILLION IN RYAN WHITE CARE ACT FUNDING
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $23,923,444 for Ryan White CARE Act funding. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded the funding to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.  
   The funding will assist the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) and the Emerging Communities program. ADAP helps impoverished HIV and AIDS patients get their necessary medication. The Emerging Communities program allows North Carolina to address urban communities highly impacted by HIV/AIDS patients. 
   "Ryan White CARE Act funds provide life-extending care, counseling, and help to the individuals who need it most," said Senator Burr. "This funding will help North Carolina's health care system better serve its HIV/AIDS patients." 
   Ryan White CARE Act Title II funding may be used to provide a variety of services including: ambulatory health care, home-based health care, insurance coverage, medications, outreach to HIV-positive individuals who know their HIV status, and early intervention services. 
   The Ryan White CARE Act provides medical care, antiretroviral treatments, counseling, and testing for those in greatest need of HIV/AIDS assistance. This legislation must be reauthorized every five years. Senator Burr is a member of the Senate HELP Committee and is working on the Ryan White CARE Act Reauthorization in the committee.
