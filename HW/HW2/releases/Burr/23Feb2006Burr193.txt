SEN. BURR CITES NEED TO LEARN LESSONS FROM HURRICANE KATRINA RESPONSE
  "The White House report on the federal response to Hurricane Katrina is a straightforward review of what went wrong, and, more importantly, the lessons learned. This report outlines 125 specific recommendations to improve disaster response. And of specific concern to North Carolinians, it also includes eleven actions to be completed by the first day of the upcoming hurricane season, June 1st. 
   Hurricane Katrina showed us the public health risks associated with the aftermath of a major natural disaster. As the Senate Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness Subcommittee continues its work to improve public health preparedness in the Public Health Security and Bioterror Preparedness and Response Act, we will look carefully at the recommendations contained in the report. 
   "Having experienced disasters such as Hurricanes Hugo, Floyd and Ophelia, North Carolina is a leader in emergency preparedness. I'm hopeful that other states can learn from our experiences to better coordinate emergency planning and disaster relief and that North Carolina might learn lessons from this disaster, as well." 
   The report specifically praised the efforts of North Carolina, stating that, along with Florida, "their State and local emergency managers better understand what non-governmental assistance is available before, during and after a disaster." (The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned, page 115). The full report can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned.
