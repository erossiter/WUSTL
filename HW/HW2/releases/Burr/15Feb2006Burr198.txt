  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $30,240 United States Department of Homeland Security grant for the Brasstown Fire Department. The grant, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of expanding its fire prevention program to middle and high schools.  
   "Firefighters give so much of themselves to help others in our communities," said Senator Burr. "This grant will help Brasstown expand its successful fire prevention program." 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
