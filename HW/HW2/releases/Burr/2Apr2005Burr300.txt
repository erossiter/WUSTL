SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Statement by Sen. Richard Burr Regarding the Death of Pope John Paul II   
   "There is no question that for nearly three decades, Pope John Paul II was a leader on the world stage. He was a tireless advocate for the cause of freedom, helping to liberate Eastern Europe, including his native Poland, from communism. While doing so, Pope John Paul II traveled the world to remind all of humanity that our freedoms come with important responsibilities - not the least of which is recognizing the dignity of human life. Today is a very sad day, not only for Catholics, but for all people. It is also a time to remember the profound and positive impact Pope John Paul II made on our world."
