SEN. BURR APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF ROBERT CONRAD TO FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today applauded the nomination of Robert J. Conrad to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Conrad currently serves as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte.  
   "Bob Conrad has a long history of public service and an excellent reputation as a knowledgeable and fair judge," Burr said. "North Carolina can be proud of Bob's record as a judge and his integrity. I look forward to Bob's quick confirmation by the United States Senate and to having another North Carolinian on the Fourth Circuit bench." 
   Conrad graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1983 and entered private practice. In 1989 he became an Assistant United States Attorney in Charlotte. President Bush appointed Conrad to serve as United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina in 2001. In 2003, he was nominated by the President for his current job as a federal district court judge. Mr. Conrad has twice been unanimously confirmed by the Senate. 
   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, located in Richmond, Virginia, hears federal appeals from cases filed in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. While North Carolina is the most populous state in the Fourth Circuit, the state can presently claim only one judge on the fifteen judge bench. 
   The nomination will be referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which is responsible for holding confirmation hearings and reporting nominees to the full Senate.
