SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $4 MILLION TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $4,296,152 in federal funds to help prevent homelessness, and feed and shelter North Carolina's homeless. The money was awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency through their Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program.  
   "Organizations across North Carolina work hard every day to prevent homelessness and feed and shelter the homeless in their communities," Burr said. "I am pleased these FEMA funds will be used to support the social service agencies in our state." 
   Congress appropriated $151 million for the EFS Program for FY 2007. This funding will support social service agencies in cities and counties across the country to help feed and shelter the Nation's hungry and homeless. EFS funds are used to supplement food, shelter, rent, mortgage, and utility assistance programs for people with non-disaster related emergencies. 
   In June, Burr introduced the Services to Prevent Veterans Homelessness Act. This legislation provides supportive services to keep low-income veterans in permanent housing so they do not become homeless. It increases veterans' access to assistance for housing, physical and mental health services, health insurance, and vocational and financial counseling. Burr is also an original co-sponsor of the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act, which aims to reduce homelessness by providing supportive housing to chronically homeless individuals and families.
