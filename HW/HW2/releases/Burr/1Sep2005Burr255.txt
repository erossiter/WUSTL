SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE KATRINA
  "As we work to help the Gulf Coast recover from Hurricane Katrina, I know the thoughts and prayers of all North Carolinians are with those directly affected by the Hurricane, especially those who have lost loved ones, homes and businesses.  
 The federal government will do all it can to provide disaster relief to the affected region in the wake of this terrible natural disaster. 
   I urge all North Carolinians to reach out to organizations providing assistance related to this disaster, or to contact local churches, charities or civic groups which have information on relief efforts. For more information on how to help, please visit my webpage at http://www.burr.senate.gov."
