SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S REMARKS ON IRAQ
 Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement regarding the President's remarks on Iraq:  
   "I have always believed we must succeed in Iraq. Failure is not an option. We owe it to our troops and to the Iraqi people to remain committed to supporting a free and stable Iraq. 
   The Iraqi leadership must rise to the challenge - the world is watching. It is critical for the Iraqi government to take immediate steps to disband the sectarian militias and death squads, pass key oil sharing legislation, and hold provincial elections. 
   I saw firsthand the need for security and stability in Iraq while visiting Baghdad and Balad in September. I believe it is essential we first end the violence that has escalated in the streets of Baghdad if the Iraqi people are to live in peace and freedom. 
   I support a temporary surge in U.S. troops provided those troops are given a clearly defined mission and achievable military objectives. 
   Our success in Iraq will define the security of our children as well as generations to come."
