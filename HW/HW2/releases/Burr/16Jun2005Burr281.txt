SEN. BURR APPLAUDS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF JUDGE TERRENCE BOYLE
  Sen. Richard Burr applauded the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today for approving the nomination of Judge Terrence W. Boyle for the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  
 The nomination had been held up for many years. Judge Boyle was nominated for the post by President George W. Bush on May 9, 2001. President George H.W. Bush first nominated Judge Boyle for the post in 1991. 
   "Judge Boyle has earned the respect of his peers thanks to his long and impressive record of public service," said Senator Burr. "I am pleased the Senate Judiciary Committee moved his nomination forward in the confirmation process. I urge my colleagues to give his nomination an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor so North Carolinians can have another voice on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals." 
   In February, Burr signed the Senate "blue slip" necessary to advance Judge Boyle's nomination forward, and in March, he testified in support of Judge Boyle's nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Burr, joined by six of his Senate Freshmen colleagues, also sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid seeking a bipartisan solution to repair the judicial confirmation process.
