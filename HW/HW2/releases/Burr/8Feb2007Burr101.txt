SEN. BURR RAISES CONCERNS OVER LACK OF FUNDING FOR BASE REALIGNMENT, CLOSURE MILITARY TRANSITION
  Sen. Richard Burr today on the Senate floor raised concerns about lack of funding in the Continuing Resolution for the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. The lack of funds may affect a wide-ranging list of military construction and quality of life projects such as barracks, family housing, child care centers, and military training. The Continuing Resolution is a budget measure to fund the government for the remainder of the 2007 fiscal year. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation next week.  
   "During this critical time for our troops and their families, this lack of funding is unacceptable. It is essential we take care of our troops, our bases, and our military communities," Burr said. "A lack of funding will delay military projects throughout North Carolina." 
   In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure process was reshaped to optimize military readiness, while also reducing excess capacity among military bases.
