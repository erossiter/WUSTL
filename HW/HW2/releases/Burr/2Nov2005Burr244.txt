SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $998,101 IN FIRE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $998,101 in United States Department of Homeland Security grants for North Carolina firefighters.  
 The grants, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's "SAFER" initiative, will provide for the recruitment and retention of full-time and volunteer firefighters.
   "Firefighters provide our communities with an invaluable service in responding to emergencies," said Senator Burr. "By helping to recruit and retain firefighters, these funds will make communities throughout North Carolina safer."
   Six North Carolina fire departments will receive "SAFER" federal grants. They are as follows:
   * Beaufort Fire Department will receive $283,759.
   * Asheville Fire and Rescue will receive $271,471.
   * North Carolina State Firemen's Association in Farmville will receive $237,011.

   * Cedar Mountain Volunteer Fire will receive $42,980.
   * Alarka Volunteer Fire Department in Bryson City will receive $16,520.
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
