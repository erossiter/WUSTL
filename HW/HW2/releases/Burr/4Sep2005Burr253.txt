SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST
  Statement by Sen. Richard Burr on the Death of Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist  
   "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Rehnquist family during this very sad time. 
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist served our country and the Supreme Court with honor and distinction. His contributions to our system of justice will guide the Court for years to come. America has lost a great Chief Justice. He will be missed. 
   I believe the Senate will work with the President expeditiously to fill both vacancies on the Court."
