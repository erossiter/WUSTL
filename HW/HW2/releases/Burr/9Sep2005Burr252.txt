  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $237,996 in United States Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) school safety resource grants for North Carolina.  
 The federal funds, made available through the Justice Department's Secure Our Schools Program (SOS), will assist officers in improving security at North Carolina schools. 
   "We must ensure that our students can work and learn in the safest possible environment," said Senator Burr. 
   SOS grants are awarded to law enforcement officials and school systems. The Orange County Sheriff's Department will receive $142,660. Moore County Schools will receive $49,270. Lee County Public Schools will receive $21,255. Camden County will receive $14,841. The City of Raleigh will receive $10,000. 
   SOS grants help cover the cost of enhanced security in schools such as the installation of metal detectors, locks, lighting and other equipment. COPS officials work with grantees to address the most pressing security needs in their city or county.
