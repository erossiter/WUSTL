SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON EARMARK MORATORIUM VOTE
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina) today issued the following statement regarding the Senate's vote on an earmark moratorium for Fiscal Year 2009: 
   "I have long believed that the process of airdropping earmarks in Congressional spending bills has gotten out of control. I believe Congress must fully debate spending items in public - in an open and transparent way. I am disappointed the Senate missed this opportunity for earmark reform. Americans deserve a government that spends their money wisely or not at all. I will continue working with my Senate colleagues to reduce waste, promote efficiency, and bring transparency to government spending."
   The bi-partisan amendment, introduced by Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), was co-sponsored by Senator Burr and 14 other Democratic and Republican senators. The measure calls for a ban on all earmarks in the FY 2009 budget.
