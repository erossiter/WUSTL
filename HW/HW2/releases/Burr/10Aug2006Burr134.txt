Funds were awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP), which aims to support firefighters and the services they deliver. The United States Department of Homeland Security awarded the funds.  
   "I applaud North Carolina's firefighters for using these funds to better prepare our communities for an emergency," Burr said. "Local fire departments are one of the first to respond in a time of crisis. These funds will help our firefighters improve their preparedness for emergencies."
