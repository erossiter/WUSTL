SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR CHAPEL HILL FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,240,748 in federal funding for the Chapel Hill Fire Department. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, which aims to increase the staffing and deployment capabilities of fire departments.  
   "Firefighters risk their lives every day to help others," Burr said. "This grant will allow the Chapel Hill Fire Department to hire additional personnel which will improve firefighter safety and enhance emergency response times." 
   The Chapel Hill Fire Department will use the funds to hire twelve additional firefighters. This grant is the result of a larger initiative by the Chapel Hill Town Council which seeks to improve fire safety by hiring additional staff. Last year the fire department hired six new firefighters. 
   The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program is part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which supports firefighters and the services they deliver.
