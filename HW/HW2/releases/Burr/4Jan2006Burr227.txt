SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $143,879 FIRE GRANT FOR KERNERSVILLE
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $143,879 United States Department of Homeland Security grant for the Kernersville Fire Department.  
 The grant, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of training, equipment and improvements to the fire station. 
   "Firefighters risk their lives each time they respond to an emergency," said Senator Burr. "These grants will make Kernersville safer by ensuring their firefighters are offered the best training and equipment available." 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
