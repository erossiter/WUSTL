   Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The Congressional Award is a private-public partnership which receives all funding from the private sector and was originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton have signed continuing legislation. 
   North Carolina currently has over 500 young people working towards a Congressional Award Medal. Since 1998, North Carolina has had over 70 medalists.
