SENS. DOLE, BURR EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR NORTH CAROLINA JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr today testified before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in support of the three judicial nominees from North Carolina.  
 Their testimony comes one week after Dole and Burr both signed their respective "blue slips," moving the nominations forward in the confirmation process. 
   The nominees include Terrence W. Boyle to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit, Robert J. Conrad to be U.S. District Judge for the Western District of North Carolina, and James C. Dever, III to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The nominations were sent to the Senate by President Bush on February 14. 
   All three North Carolina judicial nominees were nominated in the last Congress, though none received a hearing. 
   "Today's hearing is long overdue," said Senator Dole. "Our federal bench has been without the service of these able judges for far too long. All three North Carolina nominees come with impeccable credentials, and it is my privilege to support all three of them. It is my fervent hope the full Senate will move expeditiously on these nominations and that senators will refrain from partisan political maneuvers." 
   "Today is a good day for North Carolina," said Burr. "Today's hearing - something denied to all three nominees in the past - is an important step to move the nominations forward in the confirmation process. I urge the Judiciary Committee to approve Judge Boyle, Magistrate Dever and former U.S. Attorney Conrad so their nominations may have an up or down vote on the Senate floor."
