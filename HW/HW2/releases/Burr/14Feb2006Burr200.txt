SEN. BURR COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF WHITNEY TO SERVE AS U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FOR WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA
  Statement by Senator Richard Burr on the Nomination of Frank Whitney to Serve as U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of North Carolina 
   "I applaud President Bush for nominating Frank Whitney to be the next Western District Court Judge. Frank is a good pick. He has the solid experience and a track record that will make him an effective judge. I hope the confirmation process for this judgeship will move forward and we can fill the vacancy in the Western District. 
   The impact of federal judgeships on our legal system should not be underestimated, and I urge my colleagues to move forward with the confirmation process and ensure an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees. I also remain hopeful that Judge Terrence Boyle will soon see his nomination considered by the full United States Senate. After years of obstruction, Judge Boyle's nomination was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee seven months ago. I believe it's time for his nomination to move forward."
