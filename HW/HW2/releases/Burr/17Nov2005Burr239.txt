SEN. BURR INTRODUCES RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS
  Sen. Richard Burr today introduced a bipartisan resolution recognizing the importance of community health centers and the role the Medicaid Prospective Payment System plays in providing a safety net for low-income and uninsured families.  
   The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the Medicaid Prospective Payment System for community health centers is critical to ensuring Medicaid recipients and the nation's uninsured have access to high-quality and affordable primary and preventative care services. The resolution also recognizes the role community health care centers play as an essential source of care for millions of Medicaid recipients and uninsured Americans. It was jointly introduced with Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). 
   "Community health centers play a critical role in ensuring all North Carolinians have access to high-quality and affordable health care regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay," said Burr. 
   Community health centers are non-profit, community-owned health care entities that provide high-quality and affordable health care and help reduce the burden on hospital emergency rooms that are often used as a last resort for low-income and chronically ill people for health care needs. North Carolina is home to more than sixty community health centers located throughout the state. In 2004, federally-funded health centers provided care for 279,053 individuals in North Carolina. 
   As a member of the House of Representatives, Burr authored legislation that became law establishing the Prospective Payment System to ensure community health centers receive sufficient Medicaid funding.
