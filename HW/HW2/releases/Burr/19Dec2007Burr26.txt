SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON 'OMNIBUS' BILL
  Senator Richard Burr voted against H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 last night and releases the following statement:  
   "Every year, Congress is tasked with funding our government, and we should do so in a fiscally responsible way. This year's massive 'omnibus' bill was over 3,400 pages long. With a total of over half a trillion dollars in government spending, and with no time to really review its contents, I believe it does not responsibly spend the taxpayers hard-earned money. It also uses legislative gimmicks to hide billions of dollars in additional spending, which should be accounted for through the normal annual budget process." 
   "These spending bills must be considered more carefully. I believe Congress should debate each spending item and review its merits. This is the largest domestic spending bill in U.S. history and it was debated in both the House and Senate for less than 24 hours. This is an irresponsible way to fund our nation's government and I did not support this legislation."
