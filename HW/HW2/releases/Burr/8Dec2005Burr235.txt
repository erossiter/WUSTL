SEN. BURR CALLS ON SENATE TO CONTINUE WORK ON BIODEFENSE PREPAREDNESS LEGISLATION
  Sen. Richard Burr today urged his Senate colleagues to continue important negotiations to approve comprehensive biodefense preparedness legislation.  
   "There is no question we need to improve our preparedness for a pandemic outbreak now," said Burr, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness. "Much progress has been made since the Senate H.E.L.P. committee approved biodefense legislation in October. It is critical the Senate continue negotiations on this important legislation to bring more and better medical countermeasures to the market faster." 
   Burr introduced S. 1873, the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005, on October 17. The following day, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions approved the legislation by a voice-vote.
