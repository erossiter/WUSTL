SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $3.5 MILLION GRANT FOR DISASTER RECOVERY IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $3,500,000 United States Department of Labor National Emergency Grant to provide continued assistance to sixteen North Carolina counties affected by hurricanes and tropical storms during 2004.  
 The funds will be made available though the North Carolina Department of Commerce. 
   "Hurricanes and a tropical storm caused widespread damage in Western North Carolina last year," said Senator Burr. "These funds will provide state and local officials with the means to continue to rebuild their communities while providing employment opportunities." 
   The National Emergency Grant will sustain approximately 650 temporary jobs that bring disaster victims food, clothing, shelter and other humanitarian assistance to Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga and Yancey Counties. These temporary jobs also provide for the cleanup of areas damaged by hurricanes and tropical storms, including demolition, renovation and reconstruction of destroyed public structures. 
   Labor Secretary Elaine Chao pledged up to $10,000,000 for cleanup and restoration efforts in North Carolina when she visited Asheville last year in the wake of Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan, as well as Tropical Storm Bonnie. An initial $3,500,000 grant was provided last year.
