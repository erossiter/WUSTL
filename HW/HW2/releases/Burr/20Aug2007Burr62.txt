   WHO U.S. Senator Richard Burr 
   WHAT Federal Grant Workshop for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives 
   WHEN Wednesday, August 22, 2007 at 9:00 AM 
   WHERE Reuter Center, University of North Carolina at Asheville, Asheville, North Carolina 
   Representatives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will present information at the workshop. 
   "Faith-based and community initiative organizations provide help to those who are most in need. These organizations play crucial roles in making our communities better--especially in areas where the government cannot perform," said Senator Burr. "This workshop will provide faith-based and community groups with a better understanding of the federal grants process so they can continue to make a positive impact on the communities they serve." 
   The workshop is part of Burr's North Carolina Economic Development series to make the state more competitive in the federal arena. In February, Senator Burr hosted an economic development summit on health care in Durham. He also hosted an economic development summit in May for North Carolina's museums and libraries. 
   The seminar is free and open to the public. Pre-registration is requested. North Carolina faith-based and community initiative organization personnel and those who wish to attend the workshop should contact Emily Cranford at (202) 224-3154.
