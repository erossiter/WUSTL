SEN. BURR SPEAKS IN SUPPORT OF NORTH CAROLINA JUDICIAL NOMINEE
 U.S. Senator Richard Burr today spoke in support of the nomination of Thomas Schroeder to serve as U.S. District Court judge for the Middle District of North Carolina. President Bush nominated Schroeder for the judgeship on January 9, 2007. Burr delivered the remarks at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination today.  
   "Thomas Schroeder's sharp legal mind and professional experience make him a great candidate for District Court judge. I urge my colleagues to quickly confirm Tom Schroeder to be a United States District Court judge." 
   Thomas Schroeder is a partner at Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge, and Rice, PLLC in Winston-Salem. He has handled many high profile commercial and complex litigation cases across throughout his career. Schroeder had a bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas and a law degree from the University of Notre Dame Law School. 
   Schroeder now awaits a vote by the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. That vote will be reported to the full Senate, who must confirm the nomination before Schroeder can serve as a federal judge.
