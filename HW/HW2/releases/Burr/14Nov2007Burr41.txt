SEN. BURR LAUDS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE VETERANS' HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr, the Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, applauded the committee's passage of several pieces of legislation addressing veterans' health care needs.  
   "I'm glad the Committee focused its attention today on the health care needs of our nation's veterans," Burr said. "In particular, I am proud to cosponsor the mental health bill that passed the Committee today," he added. 
   The Mental Health Improvements Act of 2007 (S. 2162), is designed to improve the treatment and services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, and to provide assistance for research on those disorders. It also provides clarification for the VA to provide mental health services to veterans and their families. 
   The committee also considered The Veterans Pain Care Act of 2007 (S. 2160), which focuses attention on the issue of pain management and the needs of our veterans who suffer from debilitating pain, and The Epilepsy Centers of Excellence (S. 2004) and The Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act of 2007 (S. 2142).
