SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT
Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement regarding the Iraq Study Group Report:  
 "I applaud James Baker, Lee Hamilton, and the panel members for their hard work and dedication in producing a thorough report. 
 The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Iraq and mirrors many of my observations after visiting Iraq in September. At that time my concerns were: security, infrastructure, and the stability of a unity government. The report brings forth some interesting proposals that I look forward to discussing with my colleagues in the Senate. 
 I am confident there are actions which can be taken to improve the situation in Iraq. I continue to believe it is in the best interest of the Iraqi people, the United States, and global security that we remain committed to supporting a free and stable Iraq. 
 I hope in the near future Iraq will take on more responsibility for its own security and the Iraqi army will take over combat operations, allowing our troops to play a greater support role in the region."
