SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO SUPREME COURT
  "I welcome President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. As the confirmation process begins, I will carefully review Ms. Miers' qualifications and I look forward to meeting with her personally. 
   I am hopeful that she will receive a fair, honest hearing followed by an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor."
