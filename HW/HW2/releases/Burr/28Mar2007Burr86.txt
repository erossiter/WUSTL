SEN. BURR COMMENTS ON NORTH SHORE ROAD ISSUE
  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) issued the following statement today regarding the North Shore Road issue in Swain County:  
   "I have always supported an agreement dating back to 1943 between the United States Department of Interior (DOI), the Tennessee Valley Authority, the State of North Carolina, and the citizens of Swain County, North Carolina which would build a road along Fontana Reservoir's north shore. The road has yet to be built and the citizens of Swain County remain uncompensated for their losses. I understand frustration over this lengthy process and I want a quick resolution on this issue. 
   Several years ago, Congress made a commitment to assess the environmental impact of building the road and gave residents of Swain County a voice in the process. The federal government, through the National Park Service, has already spent millions of dollars to conduct an Environmental Impact Study and according to the National Park Service the findings of this study will be released later this year. 
   The community remains split on how to resolve this matter. I do not believe we should stop the work now underway and take a new path. I am aware that some of my colleagues suggest we now seek a financial settlement. Unfortunately we do not have assurances that the federal funding needed to fulfill the commitment made to the citizens of Swain County is achievable, nor is there agreement within the community that this is the right decision."
