SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE O'CONNOR
  "Justice O'Connor had a distinguished tenure in the Supreme Court, and I join all Americans in thanking her for her dedicated service to our Nation. Justice O'Connor has been a fair and thoughtful jurist and sought practical solutions for difficult decisions before the Court. I wish her well. 
   As we prepare for President Bush's nomination to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court, I am hopeful that the confirmation process is thorough, fair and efficient, according to the best traditions of the Senate."
