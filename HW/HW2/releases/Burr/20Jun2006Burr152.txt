SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $1.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR IREDELL COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,507,275 in federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The funding will be used to reconstruct the Interstate 40 and Interstate 77 interchange in Iredell County. The United States Department of Transportation awarded the funds.  
   "It is important that our highways are safe and modern," said Senator Burr. "These funds will ensure North Carolina's interstates are safe and easy to access and will reduce traffic congestion in Iredell County." 
   The Interstate 40 and Interstate 77 interchange is in close proximity to the US-21 interchange, which causes traffic congestion and safety problems in Iredell County. These funds will be used to reconfigure the interchange so it is safer and easier to use. The North Carolina Department of Transportation estimates that over 100,000 cars pass between I-40 and I-77 each day.
