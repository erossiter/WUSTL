SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECRETARY RUMSFELD'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today made the following statement regarding Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's resignation:  
   "Secretary Rumsfeld has had a distinguished career in public service. He has served our country with honor and has been a disciplined leader during a critical period in the War on Terror. 
   This change will provide a fresh perspective on our strategy in Iraq and our path toward success there. 
   I applaud President Bush's nomination of Dr. Robert Gates to serve as Secretary Rumsfeld's successor at the Department of Defense. Dr. Gates has notable career accomplishments at the Central Intelligence Agency and will bring a new outlook to the position. I urge my Senate colleagues to give Dr. Gates timely consideration."
