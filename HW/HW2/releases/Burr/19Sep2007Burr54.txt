SEN. SPEAKS IN SUPPORT OF LUMBEE RECOGNITION AT SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEARING
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today reiterated his support for federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe at a hearing of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Burr is a member of the committee.  
   "The Lumbee Tribe should receive the full federal recognition they deserve," Burr said. "The Lumbees currently can only be recognized through Congressional action. It is my hope that the Senate will fulfill its commitment to achieve fairness and justice for the Lumbees. I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation and finally resolve this issue." 
   Senator Burr is an original co-sponsor of the Lumbee Recognition Act of 2007 which Senator Dole introduced in the 110th Congress. Similar legislation was introduced in the 108th and 109th Congresses. The bill will provide the Lumbees with long sought-after federal recognition Companion legislation, sponsored by Congressman Mike McIntyre, passed the House on June 7, 2007. Congress recognized the Lumbees in 1956, but that legislation also prevented them from receiving federal benefits. The Lumbee Recognition Act of 2007 would provide the Lumbees with complete recognition and make the tribe eligible for all federal benefits and programs.
