SEN. BURR'S SECURITY LEGISLATION INCLUDED IN NEW ENERGY LAW
  Senator Richard Burr today applauded President Bush for signing the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 (H.R. 6). The bill, which was passed by the Senate last week, includes legislation offered by Senator Burr to strengthen U.S. national energy security. Burr's provisions make the Secretary of Energy a member of the National Security Council and direct the President to develop a national strategy to enhance energy security.  
   "I believe our dependence on foreign sources of oil poses a great threat to American national security," Burr said. "Many oil producing nations face political instability and a major disruption of energy supplies would have a significant impact on our economy. Developing a national strategy on energy security and ensuring the Secretary of Energy is involved in our national security are two ways we can address challenges caused by energy dependence." 
   The United States produces over 5 million barrels of oil a day and imports over 10 million barrels of oil each day. Overall, the United States depends on foreign imports for six out of every ten gallons of gasoline consumed domestically. Despite our heavy reliance on foreign oil, there is currently no national coordinated energy security policy. Burr's provisions will require the administration to develop a national strategy for protecting our energy security and ensure the Secretary of Energy has a strong voice in national security issues.
