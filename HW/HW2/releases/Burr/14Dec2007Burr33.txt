SEN. BURR PRAISES SENATE CONFIRMATION OF DR. JAMES PEAKE
  Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) today praised his Senate colleagues for acting quickly to confirm Dr. James Peake to serve as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA). The nomination was approved by the Senate tonight by unanimous consent.  
   "I am very pleased the Senate took quick action to confirm Dr. Peake to serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs," Burr said. "Dr. Peake told me that he can think of no higher calling than serving the country and caring for veterans. This attitude, combined with his years of service to former servicemembers, will make Dr. Peake a great Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I look forward to working with him on improving the lives of our nations' veterans," Burr added. 
   Peake is a 1966 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and began his career as an infantry officer. He served as a platoon leader in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division. For his efforts under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star, a Bronze Star with Valor and two Purple Hearts. After Vietnam, he attended Cornell University Medical College and became board certified in general and thoracic surgery. 
   In 2000, Dr. Peake was nominated as the 40th Surgeon General of the Army and as Commander of the United States Medical Command. In 2004, he joined Project Hope, a non-profit international health foundation with offices and programs in more than 30 different countries on five continents. He is currently the Chief Medical Director and Chief Operating Officer at QTC Management.
