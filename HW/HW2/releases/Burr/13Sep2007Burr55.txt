SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES ALMOST $3 MILLION FOR PITT COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today announced $2,977,343 in federal funding for Pitt County law enforcement. The funds were awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Technology Program, which aims to increase information sharing between local, state, and federal law enforcement.  
   "It is critical that law enforcement agencies are able to quickly communicate with one another," Burr said. "I applaud Pitt County and the Greenville Police Department for taking steps to make their citizens safer." 
   All law enforcement agencies in Pitt County, including state, county, and local offices, will be able to communicate directly with one another once this system is implemented. The system will integrate with North Carolina's statewide VIPER radio system maintained by the state Highway Patrol. 
   The COPS Technology Program provides funds to local law enforcement to be used for the purchase of equipment and software that focuses on data sharing and communications integration. The ultimate goal of the program is to enhance public safety through better communication. Funds provided under the COPS program require a twenty-five percent match from the grant recipient.
