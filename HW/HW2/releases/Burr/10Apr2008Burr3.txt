SEN. BURR APPLAUDS VETERANS' PROVISIONS IN HOUSING BILL
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today praised the passage of the housing stimulus bill, which contains improvements to housing assistance programs for disabled veterans. The provisions enhance two VA grants which help severely disabled veterans modify their homes to better accommodate their disabilities. The bill passed today by a vote of 84-12. 
   "I am pleased the Senate included provisions to help disabled veterans and servicemembers in the housing bill," Burr said. "These funds will provide important assistance like wheelchair ramps and accessible bathrooms, which are often the first step toward independence for these men and women with traumatic injuries."
   The legislation also makes disabled veterans with severe burn injuries eligible for housing assistance. Disabled veterans with severe burn injuries do not now qualify for this program. The grants can be used to modify an existing home or purchase a new home that is adapted for disabilities. The bill increases the rate of grant assistance by 20% and indexes future grant amounts to account for inflation.
