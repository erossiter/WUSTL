SEN. BURR APPLAUDS HHS FOR ESTABLISHING OFFICE TO DEVELOP MEDICINES TO COUNTER BIOTERROR THREATS
  Sen. Richard Burr today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for establishing the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). BARDA was authorized by Burr's Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, P.L. 109-417, which was signed into law on December 19, 2006.  
   "I am pleased the Department of Health and Human Services is acting quickly to establish BARDA," Burr said. "This new office will be key in speeding up the development of drugs and vaccines to protect the American people from threats like bioterrorism and pandemic flu." 
   BARDA manages the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures to defend against chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agents and emerging pandemic infectious diseases. BARDA will partner with academic researchers, drug and vaccine manufacturers, and other potential partners to bring more and better medicines to the public faster in case of an emergency. HHS is currently recruiting a director for BARDA, who would report directly to the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Dr. Craig Vanderwagen. Dr. Vanderwagen was confirmed by the Senate on March 22, 2007.
