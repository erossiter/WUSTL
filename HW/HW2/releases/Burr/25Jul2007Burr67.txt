  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today announced that he will assume the post of ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks.

It also manages the Wild and Scenic River System and the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  
   "I am pleased that my Senate colleagues have chosen me to serve as ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee," Burr said.

I look forward to continuing to be an advocate for North Carolina's parks." 
   North Carolina is home to twelve national parks, trails, battlefields, and historic sites totaling more than 394,000 acres, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, and the Cape Lookout National Seashore.
