SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today released the following statement regarding President Bush's address to the nation on the situation in Iraq:  
   "I welcome the President's decision to begin drawing down U.S. forces in Iraq based on the advice of our generals and the success of our troops in ridding Iraq of foreign insurgents. Like all Americans, I want our troops home as soon as possible and I believe the best way to bring stability to Iraq is to continue the fight against al Qaeda and reduce Iran's influence in Iraq. Although long-term success in Iraq depends ultimately on the Iraqis themselves, our success in Iraq will define the security of our nation for generations to come."
