SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES FIRE GRANT FOR RUTHERFORD COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $270,145 in federal funding from the United States Department of Homeland Security for Forest City Fire Department. The grant, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will help the department recruit and retain volunteer firefighters.  
   "Firefighters give so much of themselves each day to help others in our communities," said Senator Burr. "This grant will help Forest City recruit and retain well qualified emergency response personnel." 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share between twenty and seventy percent of costs over the grant's five year payout.
