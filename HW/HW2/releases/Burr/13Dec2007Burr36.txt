SEN. BURR PRAISES PROGRESS IN VA CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN DURHAM
  Senator Richard Burr today praised the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for moving forward with plans to renovate the Durham VA Medical Center. The VA announced today that it awarded an $8.4 million construction contract for the renovations. The demolition and reconstruction project calls for the construction of three new wards with larger patient rooms and private bathrooms for female veterans.  
   "I am glad this important project is moving forward," Burr said. "North Carolina's veterans population is growing, and the need for larger, updated facilities is obvious. I applaud the VA for taking steps to improve the quality of care for the patients at the Durham VA Medical Center." 
   Totolo/King Joint Venture, a disabled veteran-owned business, was awarded the contract to renovate the over 30,000 square feet of hospital space. The renovation work is scheduled for completion in 2009. 
   The Durham VA Medical Center treated over 46,200 veterans in fiscal year 2007, including 3,565 veterans who recently served in Iraq and Afghanistan. North Carolina is currently home to approximately 750,000 veterans, many of whom receive treatment at one of four VA Medical Centers and six Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) located in the state. In addition to these facilities, the VA is planning to build or is currently building additional CBOC facilities in Charlotte, Franklin, Hamlet, Hickory, and Wilmington. 
   Burr serves as ranking member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
