  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $75,920 in federal funding for the Triangle Urban League (TUL) in Durham. The funds were awarded by the Employment and Training Administration in coordination with the United States Department of Labor's Faith Based and Community Initiatives Office.  
   "I applaud the Triangle Urban League's hard work and dedication to provide employment skills training to at-risk teens. Community initiative organizations like TUL are doing vital work for those in need across North Carolina," Burr said. "These funds are important to at-risk youth in the Durham area." 
   The funds will be used for Project Through Interventions for Employment (Project TIE), which is facilitated by TUL. Project TIE will serve 60 individuals aged 14 to 21 through academic remediation, leadership skills and mentoring, and employability skills.
