SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING RISING GASOLINE PRICES
  "I am hopeful energy supplies in North Carolina, which depend on pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, will not be severely disrupted. This matter is being closely monitored by federal, state and local governments and I have been in communication with the Department of Energy and Governor Easley. I also look forward to participating in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearings next week to work against any potential price gouging of gasoline consumers."
