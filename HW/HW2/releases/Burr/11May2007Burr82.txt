SEN. BURR TO SPONSOR FEDERAL GRANT WORKSHOP IN ROCKY MOUNT
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced his office will sponsor a statewide federal grant workshop in Rocky Mount to focus on improving access to federal grants for museums and libraries. The workshop will be held on Monday, May 14, 2007 at 9:00 AM at the Imperial Centre located at 270 Gay Street in Rocky Mount.  
   The workshop is part of Burr's North Carolina Economic Development series to make the state more competitive in the federal arena. This workshop aims to provide a better understanding of the federal grants process for North Carolina's museums and libraries and will include speakers from federal departments. 
   "Museums and libraries are the foundation for learning in every North Carolina community. They enhance educational opportunities, preserve our heritage, and encourage civic participation in the areas they serve," said Senator Burr. "This workshop will provide North Carolina's museum and library personnel with a better understanding of the federal grants process so that they can continue to make a positive impact on those they serve." 
   This workshop is part of a series Senator Burr is hosting in both Washington, D.C. and North Carolina. In February, Senator Burr hosted an economic development summit on health care in Durham. This is the second workshop for museums and libraries Burr has sponsored. The first workshop was held in November in Hickory. 
   The workshop is free and open to the public. North Carolina museum and library personnel who wish to attend the workshop may contact Emily Cranford at (202) 224-3154.
   Contact: Mark Williams, 202/224-3154.
