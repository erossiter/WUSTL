SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $241,424 IN FIRE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $241,424 in United States Department of Homeland Security grants for North Carolina firefighters.  
 The grants, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of training, equipment and improvements to fire stations and emergency vehicles. 
   "Firefighters risk their lives each time they respond to an emergency," said Senator Burr. "These grants will make Oxford, Raeford, Rhodhiss and surrounding communities safer by ensuring firefighters are better prepared to respond to emergencies." 
   Three North Carolina fire departments will receive federal grants. They are as follows: 
   * Cornwall Fire Department in Oxford will receive $96,644. 
   * The Town of Rhodhiss Fire Department will receive $77,710. 
   * Raeford Volunteer Fire Department will receive $67,070. 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
