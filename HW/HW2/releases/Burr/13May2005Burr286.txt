SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE COMMISSION REPORT
  Statement from Sen. Richard Burr Regarding the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission Report:  
  "I'm pleased that the BRAC Commission has recognized that North Carolina's military installations and our military personnel stationed in the state play a pivotal role in the war on terror.  
   I am proud to be a part of the efforts made on the federal, state and local levels to support our military installations. North Carolina communities have embraced these bases in countless ways - from purchasing land and building roads for joint use to expanding in-state college tuition for military personnel. Across our state, communities like Jacksonville, Fayetteville and Goldsboro, as well as our state government and our congressional delegation, have worked to ensure North Carolina's men and women in uniform and their families have what they need. 
   A transfer of the US Forces Command, a 4-Star Command, to Fort Bragg will further cement Fort Bragg's role as the premier Army installation on the East Coast. The realignment of Pope Air Force Base raises some questions and, while the Army has assured me that the 82nd Airborne will have all the airlift ability necessary to do its important work, I will work to ensure that the BRAC Commission looks into the issue. And by gaining 362 additional personnel, I am confident that Seymour Johnson Air Force Base will continue to play its critical role in our nation's air defense. 
   I am disappointed, however, by the changes at the Naval Air Depot Cherry Point. I will work to ensure their fine work is reviewed by the Commission. 
   Working together in a bipartisan manner at the federal, state and local levels, we will continue to make the case of the importance of North Carolina's military bases."
