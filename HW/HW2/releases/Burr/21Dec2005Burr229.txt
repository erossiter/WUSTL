SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $302,425 IN FIRE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $302,425 in United States Department of Homeland Security grants for North Carolina firefighters.  
 The grants, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of training, equipment and improvements to fire stations and emergency vehicles. 
   "Firefighters risk their lives each time they respond to an emergency," said Senator Burr. "These grants will make communities throughout North Carolina safer by ensuring firefighters are better equipped to respond to emergencies." 
   Three North Carolina fire departments will receive federal grants. They are as follows: 
   * Horneytown Fire Department in High Point will receive $143,844. 
   * Bearpond River Rural Fire Department in Henderson will receive $106,828. 
   * Pelham Volunteer Fire Department will receive $51,753. 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
