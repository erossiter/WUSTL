SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $4.5 MILLION LOAN FOR MITCHELL COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $4,529,000 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development loan for Mitchell County.  
 The funds, made available by Rural Development's Community Facility Direct Loan Program, will cover the construction costs of a new sheriff's office and 36 bed detention facility. 
   "By constructing a new sheriff's office and detention center, these funds will help protect the citizens in Mitchell County," said Senator Burr. 
   Community Facility Direct Loans cover construction and improvement costs of community facilities in rural areas. Mitchell County officials will use these funds to build a new sheriff's office and detention center located in close proximity to the courthouse located Bakersville, improving the efficiency of both. 
   The loan was approved over 40 years at a rate of 4.125 percent.
