SENS. DOLE, BURR TO GOV. EASLEY: SEEKING MORE POTENTIAL OLF SITES NOT THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION
  U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr today responded to North Carolina Governor Mike Easley regarding his letter about the outlying landing field and the OLF Study Group's findings.  
   "While we agree with your assessment that North Carolina residents and officials in potentially impacted areas are overwhelmingly opposed to an OLF, we disagree with your view that the best course of action is now for the congressional delegation to recommend that the Navy develop yet another list of potential locations - in addition to the 21 sites it is currently considering for an OLF," wrote Dole and Burr. 
   "This collaborative effort between your administration and the Navy produced six new proposals for OLF sites. As we expected, these sites have been rejected by residents and local officials. We believe your Administration should continue its work with the Navy to come up with a site that has the support of the local community and meets the needs of the United States military. This lengthy process has been difficult on many North Carolinians, and we hope you would agree that our state is best served by a timely resolution to this matter."
