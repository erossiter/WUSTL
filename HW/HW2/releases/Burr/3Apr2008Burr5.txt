SEN. BURR: 'EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE'
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today called on Congress to modernize and reform our nation's health care system. He urged for health care reform while participating in a health care panel sponsored by the Heritage Foundation today. Other panelists included Senators David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina). The panel discussion kicked off an eight week initiative to discuss health care reform in the Senate. Several Republican senators will be presenting common-sense health care ideas that empower Americans to have access to affordable, high quality health care without government mandates and intervention. 
   "Every American deserves access to quality, affordable health insurance" Burr said. "We have seen a real contrast in the approach to health care policy. Instead of having the federal government control our health care decisions, I believe we need to work to make health care more affordable for individuals through tax reform and more consumer choice. Our health is too important to be left to Washington bureaucrats."
   Burr introduced the Every American Insured Health Act in August of last year. The bill aims to provide all Americans with access to affordable, high-quality health insurance. The legislation would allow Americans to buy health insurance on the free market, regardless of age, income, or employer. Under the legislation, each American would receive a refundable, advanceable tax credit of $2,160 for individuals and $5,400 for families to pay for health insurance.
   "It is long past time for health care reform in this country. We must act now to make sure that every American is insured, and that our country remains competitive in the global marketplace for years to come," Burr added.
