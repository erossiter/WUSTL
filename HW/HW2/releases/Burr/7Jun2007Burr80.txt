SEN. BURR VOTES AGAINST ENDING DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Richard Burr today voted against ending debate on S.1348, the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, citing insufficient time for amendments to the bill on the Senate floor. Burr voted against immigration legislation in the Senate last year that would have granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. 
   "I believe that we should only permit those into our country who respect our laws, our system of government, and way of life. Immigrants should demonstrate their intentions of becoming productive, law-abiding members of our society as a condition for receiving citizenship," Burr said. "I will continue to oppose amnesty for the illegal immigrants living in the United States." 
   "While some aspects of this bill have merit, many important amendments have not been voted on. These common-sense amendments would have saved taxpayers money and improved our border security. We cannot end debate on a critical piece of legislation like this when over one hundred amendments sit without any discussion or vote." 
   Burr voted on several amendments to the bill that would have increased border and national security, including amendments that would bar many criminals from the Z-visa program, increase information sharing between federal and local law enforcement, and improve the location of border fencing. The senator also voted for a more sound fiscal policy, including amendments that would require illegal immigrants to pay back taxes, make illegals ineligible for Social Security benefits on pay they received while working illegally, make temporary workers ineligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, and require Z-visa holders to purchase private health insurance. Senator Burr also voted to make English the national language of the United States.
