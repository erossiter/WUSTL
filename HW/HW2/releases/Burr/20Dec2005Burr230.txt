SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION GRANT FOR NORTH CAROLINA RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER IN RALEIGH
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $1 million federal grant for the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center.  
 The grant, awarded by the Economic Development Administration's (EDA) Public Works Investment Program, will help cover the costs of a $2 million conference and training facility. 
   "This grant ensures that the Rural Center will continue to strengthen our local economies in rural North Carolina," said Senator Burr. "The training facility will help bring new jobs to North Carolina and attract new industry." 
   The Rural Center, created in 1987, will match the EDA's investment in North Carolina by raising $1 million for construction costs for the conference and training facility. The facility will allow the Rural Center to continue its work toward improving the quality of life in rural North Carolina communities, especially those with limited transportation and telecommunication resources. 
   EDA Public Works grants attract new industry, encourage business expansion and generate long-term private sector jobs and investment.
