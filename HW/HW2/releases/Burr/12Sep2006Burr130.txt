SEN. BURR COMMENTS ON RECENT IRAQ VISIT
 Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), David Vitter (R-LA) and Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) commented today on their recent visit to Iraq. While there, the senators met with troops, leading U.S. Army generals and Iraqi government leaders.  
   "Iraq continues to be a very challenging situation. But Gen Casey's Baghdad Security Plan is a good one, and we're cautiously optimistic that the violence will come down as in the past month," Burr said. 
   "To further stabilize the situation, we believe it's essential that Congress reaffirm our commitment to the Iraqi people, not question that commitment, and that we make sure basic services like electricity, water, and sewerage improve," added Coburn. 
   "It's clearer to us than ever that Iraq is a key battle in the war on radical Islamic terrorism - a battle we must win," said Vitter. 
   In addition to meeting with security officials, each senator also visited with the troops from his respective state.
