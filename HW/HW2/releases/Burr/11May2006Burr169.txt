SEN. BURR APPLAUDS ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Richard Burr today praised North Carolina's economic growth and expansion. In March, the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina reported the overall unemployment level for the entire state was 4.5%, lower than the national unemployment rate of 4.7%.  
   "I am pleased North Carolina continues to attract jobs creating economic growth and expansion," Burr said. "As our economy continues to grow, we need to continue working to ensure every North Carolinian who wants a job can find a job." 
   In the first quarter of the year, America's economy grew at a rate of 4.8%. Last year the economy grew 3.5%, the fastest of any industrialized nation. America has added jobs for 31 straight months, creating 5.1 million new jobs for American workers. In 2005 North Carolina added 53,000 jobs according to the North Carolina Department of Commerce. 
   "As North Carolinians continue to experience economic growth, offer a great education system and maintain a solid public health infrastructure, businesses will continue to relocate to our state creating more jobs for our workers and making North Carolina a better place to live and work," Burr added.
