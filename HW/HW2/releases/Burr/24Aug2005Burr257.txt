SEN. BURR TO DISCUSS BIOTERRORISM WITH STATE LEADERS IN DURHAM ON AUG. 25
  Sen. Richard Burr, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness, will visit Durham tomorrow to speak to North Carolina government leaders, public health and law enforcement officials, military personnel and emergency responders participating in the Prevention & Response Integration Conference & Exhibition (P.R.I.C.E. of Freedom). Sen.  
 Burr will speak at 9:15 AM at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel to discuss North Carolina's role in fighting bioterrorism, as well as emergency response and preparedness. 
   "While we work to prevent terror attacks, we must also work to know how best to respond to them in an integrated and coordinated fashion," said Senator Burr. "Prevention and response are essential tasks of law enforcement, military, emergency responders and public health officials. When they are coordinated, we are all better protected." 
   Burr's subcommittee has jurisdiction over a wide range of bioterrorism and public health issues including BioShield, the Centers for Disease Control, immunizations, infectious diseases and vaccines. The Subcommittee has held several hearings this year on 21st century biological threats, the development of biomedical countermeasures and the availability of effective drugs and vaccines to protect against attacks from chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. 
   Any media wishing to cover Burr's speech MUST contact Gary Rector, Deputy Director of the North Carolina Justice Academy, at (828) 685-3600 prior to the event. Please contact Senator Burr's office to schedule separate interviews.
