SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $180,619 IN FIRE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $180,619 in United States Department of Homeland Security grants for fire departments in Hampstead and Burlington.  
 The grants, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of training, equipment and improvements to fire stations. 
   "Firefighters risk their lives each time they respond to an emergency," said Senator Burr. "These grants will make Hampstead, Burlington and surrounding communities safer by ensuring that their firefighters are offered the best training and equipment available." 
   Hampstead Volunteer Fire Department will receive $124,616 to purchase personal protective equipment. 
   North Central Alamance Volunteer Fire Department in Burlington will receive $56,003 to improve firefighter operations and safety. 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
