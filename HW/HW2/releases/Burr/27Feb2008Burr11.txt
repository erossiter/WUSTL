SEN. BURR CALLS FOR VETERANS' DISABILITY REFORM
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr today called for a large-scale reform and improvement of America's disability system for wounded warriors and veterans. Burr delivered his remarks during a U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing on studies provided to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission (VDBC). Experts from the Institute of Medicine and The CNA Corporation provided testimony during the hearing.  
   "The findings in these reports make it very clear that there is an urgent need to update and modernize the veterans' disability system," Burr said. "We have young men and women returning home from war with devastating injuries and they need to come back to a system that cuts out red tape and quickly provides them the benefits and services they need to return to full and productive lives." 
   "We need to take action now to fix these problems. I plan to introduce a bill that would incorporate many of the recommendations from these reports. I look forward working with Senator Akaka to ensure our wounded warriors have a modern, consistent, and coordinated system to help them return to full and productive lives," Burr added. 
   The hearing focused on three reports from the Institute of Medicine and one report from The CNA Corporation. The VDBC used all four reports to develop recommendations on improving the current disability system. All of the studies acknowledged deficiencies in the current system, including the disability ratings schedule, assessment process, and lack of focus on quality of life.
