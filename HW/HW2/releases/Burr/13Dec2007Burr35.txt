SEN. BURR APPLAUDS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF VA NOMINEE
  Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) today applauded the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs for unanimously approving the nomination of Dr. James Peake to serve as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The vote took place today in a special session of the committee held off the Senate floor.  
   "Dr. Peake has spent most of his life caring for military personnel," Burr said. "Dr. Peake's service record and personal dedication to veterans make him very qualified to serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I urge quick consideration of this nomination by the full Senate so we can ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs has a leader," Burr added. 
   Peake is a 1966 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and began his career as an infantry officer. He served as a platoon leader in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division. For his efforts under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star, a Bronze Star with Valor and two Purple Hearts. After Vietnam, he attended Cornell University Medical College and became board certified in general and thoracic surgery. 
   In 2000, Dr. Peake was nominated as the 40th Surgeon General of the Army and as Commander of the United States Medical Command. In 2004, he joined Project Hope, a non-profit international health foundation with offices and programs in more than 30 different countries on five continents. He is currently the Chief Medical Director and Chief Operating Officer at QTC Management.
