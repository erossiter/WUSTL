SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $800,000 FOR MAYLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $899,000 in federal funds for Mayland Community College in Spruce Pine. The money will be used to build a new health sciences building, which will develop the college's nursing and medical assistant training program. The funds were awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce through its Economic Development Administration.  
   "I applaud Mayland Community College for playing an important role in helping Mitchell County's economy prosper," Burr said. "Their nursing and medical assistant program will help train North Carolinians so they can obtain well-paying jobs in the health care field." 
   The health sciences building will allow the college to double the number of nursing students and medical assistants it currently trains. In recent years the surrounding area has lost more than 1,000 manufacturing jobs due to business closures. The enhanced nursing program will strengthen the region's economy by supporting existing medical and health-care facilities, as well as allow for the development of new heath related businesses. This program anticipates creating 133 jobs and generating almost $30 million in private investment 340 new jobs and generate over $37 million in private investment.
