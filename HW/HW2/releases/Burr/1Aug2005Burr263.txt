  Sen. Richard Burr today announced an $800,000 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development loan for the Four-Way Volunteer Fire Department in Surry County.  
 The loan, approved through Rural Development's Community Facility Direct Loan program, will cover the construction costs of a new 9,500 square foot fire station. 
   "We depend on our firefighters and emergency responders to keep our communities safe," said Senator Burr. "These funds will ensure that Surry County firefighters are well-equipped to quickly respond to emergencies." 
   Surry County firefighters will benefit from the use of five drive-through bays, a meeting and training area, a kitchen and handicap accessible bathrooms at the new fire station. The new station will improve the efficiency of the department allowing for faster response times. 
   Community Facility Direct Loans cover construction and improvement costs of community facilities in rural areas. 
   The loan was approved over 40 years at a rate of 4.125 percent.
