SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR JUDGE ALITO TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced his intention to support Judge Samuel Alito to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States when his nomination comes before the full Senate for a vote.  
   "Judge Alito has shown he has the skills needed to do an effective job on the Supreme Court. He has a sound judicial philosophy, impressive legal qualifications and the necessary experience," Senator Burr said. "I believe he is an individual with high integrity and character and he is a proven federal judge who has shown the judicial temperament to be a Supreme Court Justice." 
   Senator Burr's announcement came following Judge Alito's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and meeting with him in December in Burr's Washington, D.C. office. Judge Alito has more prior judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in over 70 years. In 1990, he was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate to serve a lifetime appointment on the bench of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals where he has served for the past 15 years. In addition, he has tried cases as an attorney and was given a unanimous "well qualified" rating by the American Bar Association. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to take up the Alito nomination next Tuesday, January 24.
