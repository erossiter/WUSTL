SEN. BURR APPLAUDS U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE FOR CHALLENGING CHINA ON UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES
  Sen. Richard Burr today praised the U.S. Trade Representative for challenging China's inconsistent trade practices which harm America's businesses. Last week, the U.S. Trade Representative filed suit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to initiate dispute settlement consultations with China regarding its use of unfair trade subsidies.  
   "I believe it is important to confront China on its unfair trade subsidies, because these trade issues significantly impact North Carolina's economy," Burr said. "China is now our nation's third largest trading partner. We cannot stand on the sidelines and allow China to compete unfairly in the global marketplace at the expense of American workers, consumers, and businesses. I support free trade and our ability to buy and sell goods around the world, but the conditions under which we trade should be fair." 
   The use of prohibited subsidy programs violate WTO rules and effectively deny U.S. companies fair competition in the global marketplace. These programs unfairly impact U.S. manufacturers and their employees.
