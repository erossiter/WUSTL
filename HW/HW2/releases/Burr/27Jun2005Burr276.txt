SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $3.7 MILLION GRANT FOR CUMBERLAND COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $3,721,031 United States Department of Labor National Emergency Grant to aid 950 military spouses and civilian personnel at Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base.  
 The funds will be made available through the Cumberland County Workforce Development Board in Fayetteville. 
   "These funds will assist displaced workers from Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base with job training and placement that utilizes their individual skills and meets the needs of local businesses," said Senator Burr. 
   The grant will benefit those who lost their job when a military spouse received a permanent change of station, or the United States Department of Defense outsourced civilian jobs at military installations. The Cumberland County Workforce Development will use the federal funding to help personnel develop an individual employment plan and provide customized training, classroom training, on-the-job training, job placement and support services. 
   An initial grant of $2,280,828 was awarded to Cumberland County in December 2003.
