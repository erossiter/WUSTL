SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFIRMATION OF ALITO TO SERVE AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE TO U.S. SUPREME COURT
  "I'm very pleased the United States Senate took up Judge Alito's nomination today in an up-or-down vote. I believe it was important that we moved beyond partisan rhetoric and that Judge Alito got a full and fair vote on the Senate floor. Judge Alito's background as a proven federal judge, as well as his solid judicial temperament, gives him the experience necessary to be an effective Justice. I think the Senate has taken a positive step forward by approving Samuel Alito to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court."
