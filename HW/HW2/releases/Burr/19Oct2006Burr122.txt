SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR NEW BERN FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,117,375 in federal funding for the City of New Bern Fire Department. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, which aims to increase the staffing and deployment capabilities of fire departments.  
   "I applaud the New Bern Fire Department for using these funds to better prepare its community for an emergency," Burr said. "Local fire departments are one of the first to respond in a time of need. The additional personnel provided by this grant will improve emergency response times in New Bern." 
   The New Bern Fire Department will use the funds to hire twelve additional firefighters. This will allow the fire department to staff four firefighters on every fire engine operating in the city. The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program is part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which supports firefighters and the services they deliver.
