SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES LOAN FOR VANCE COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced a $237,500 federal loan for the Hicksboro Volunteer Fire Department in Vance County.  
 The Community Facility Direct loan, made possible by United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program, will improve the department's emergency preparedness and response time. 
   "Our emergency responders play a vital role in keeping our communities safe," said Senator Burr. "It is critical that firefighters have the necessary resources to ensure that they are prepared to respond to emergencies." 
   Hicksboro Volunteer Fire Department will purchase an Emergency One Commercial Top Mount pumper vehicle on a 2005 Freightliner Business Class two door chassis. This new vehicle will replace an unreliable 24 year-old pumper. 
   The loan was approved at a rate of 4.25 percent over 20 years.
