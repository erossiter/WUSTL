SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES OVER $10 MILLION IN HOUSING ASSISTANCE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $10,066,700 in federal funding for six North Carolina supportive housing groups. The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Supportive Housing for Persons With Disabilities and Supportive Housing for the Elderly Programs, which aim to expand housing opportunities for the elderly and the disabled.  
   "U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funds provide housing opportunities to North Carolina's elderly and disabled populations who need it most," Burr said. "I applaud the hard work and dedication of the supportive housing groups in our state. Their contributions make North Carolina's communities a better place to work and live." 
   North Carolina supportive housing grant recipients will use the funds to build, acquire, or renovate rental housing for people who are disabled or elderly. Funds will also be used to lower rent for low-income tenants.
