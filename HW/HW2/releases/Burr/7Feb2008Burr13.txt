SEN. BURR PRAISES PASSAGE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS BILL
  U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina) today released the following statement regarding the passage of the economic stimulus bill:  
   "I am pleased the Senate has passed an economic stimulus bill today. Our economy needs a boost. We improved the original House-passed economic stimulus legislation by adding rebates for seniors, disabled veterans and their widows, and making sure rebates do not go to illegal immigrants. By lowering taxes and reducing government spending we can further ensure that our economy can grow, now and in the future."
