SEN. BURR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARION VA REPORTS
  Senator Richard Burr, Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, issued the following statement in reaction to two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reports concerning the VA Medical Center in Marion, Illinois:  
   "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must provide excellent care for those who have worn our nation's uniform and it is inexcusable for veterans to lose their lives because of substandard care provided at the Marion VA Medical Center. To the families of those veterans, I express my deepest sympathies." 
   "I expect the VA to quickly implement the recommendations from the reports of both the Inspector General and the VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and for those who are responsible for these deaths to be held accountable. While no evidence exists to suggest that these problems are occurring at other VA facilities, the VA should conduct a thorough review to ensure this is an isolated incident. I look forward to working with Senator Akaka to oversee the implementation of both the Inspector General's and the VA Office of the Medical Inspector's recommendations."
