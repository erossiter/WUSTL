SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $349,202 IN FIRE GRANTS FOR NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $349,202 in United States Department of Homeland Security grants for North Carolina firefighters.  
 The grants, made available by the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will cover the costs of training, equipment and improvements to fire stations. 
   "Firefighters risk their lives each time they respond to an emergency," said Senator Burr. "These grants will make Cokesbury, Monroe and surrounding communities safer by ensuring that their firefighters are offered the best training and equipment available." 
   Two North Carolina fire departments will receive federal grants. They are as follows: 
   * Monroe Fire Department will receive $230,452 for firefighter operations and safety. 
   * Cokesbury Volunteer Fire Department will receive $118,750 for vehicle acquisition. 
   The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness oversees the United States Fire Administration. Firefighter assistance programs provide federal funding directly to local firefighters to ensure they are well-equipped to protect their communities. Local fire departments share up to twenty percent of project costs.
