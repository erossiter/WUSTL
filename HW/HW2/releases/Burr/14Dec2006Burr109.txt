SEN. BURR TO SERVE ON SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Richard Burr has been appointed to serve on the Select Committee on Intelligence for the 110th Congress set to begin in January.  
   "I am pleased to have the opportunity to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee," Burr said. "I was a member of the House Intelligence Committee for four years and look forward to now continuing my service on a committee that is so important to our national security during a critical time in our nation's history." 
   The Intelligence Committee is responsible for providing oversight for federal government intelligence services and has jurisdiction on almost all intelligence matters, including nominations to intelligence services. 
   In addition, Senator Burr will continue to serve on the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, the Committee on Veterans Affairs, and the Committee on Indian Affairs. 
   "These committee assignments will allow me to continue my work on issues like health care, energy, and education," Burr said. "I will continue to focus on supporting our military and veterans, increasing access to affordable health care, strengthening public education, improving public health emergency preparedness and response, and supporting meaningful energy and conservation policies."
