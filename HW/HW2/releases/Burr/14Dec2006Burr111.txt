SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR CLEVELAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced $1,000,000 in federal funds for Cleveland Community College in Shelby. The money will be used to build a new workforce training facility, which will enhance the college's allied health programs. The funds were awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce through its Economic Development Administration.  
   "I applaud Cleveland Community College for expanding its allied health program," Burr said. "These funds will provide Cleveland County citizens with more educational oppurtunities, which will lead to higher salaries and increased economic growth." 
   The workforce training facility will house Cleveland Community College's health programs, science labs, additional classrooms and faculty offices, and a television production lab and studio for the broadcasting curriculum. The new facility is expected to create 340 new jobs and generate over $37 million in private investment.
