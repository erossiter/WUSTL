SEN. BURR ANNOUNCES $940,000 FOR YADKIN COUNTY
  Sen. Richard Burr today announced that the United States Department of Commerce will invest $940,000 in water infrastructure improvements for Yadkin County.  
   The funds, from the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA), will be used to expand Yadkin County's water treatment capacity. The Department of Commerce estimates that the funds will save 357 existing jobs, create new jobs and generate more than $17 million in private investments in Yadkin County. 
   "These funds are vital to saving jobs and providing a source of clean water for Yadkin County," said Burr. "It's important that we ensure all North Carolinians have access to a clean water supply and that we create jobs in every corner of North Carolina." 
   The Economic Development Administration was established to work with states and localities to generate new jobs, retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas and regions of the United States. EDA funds are strategically targeted to increase local competitiveness and strengthen the local and regional economic base.
