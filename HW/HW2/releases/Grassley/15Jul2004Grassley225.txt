SEN. GRASSLEY TO COMPLETE ANNUAL TOUR OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will be traveling across Iowa to meet with his constituents during the Senate recess the week of July 26. This is Grassley's 24th year of holding a public meeting in every county of Iowa. 
   The town meetings are planned in Corning, Bedford, Clarinda, Red Oak, Sidney, Glenwood, Audubon, Orange City, Sibley, Primghar, Spirit Lake, Estherville, Emmetsburg, Spencer, Algona, Forest City, Garner, and Manly and are open to the public. Grassley said that he welcomes questions or comments on any subject. Grassley will also visit businesses in Harlan and Larchwood.
   "It's important that elected officials keep dialogue with their constituents going. The process of representative government is a two way street. My annual visit to each county is an important part of that," Grassley said. "My visits help me know what Iowans are thinking so I can do the best job representing them in Congress."
