  DA: May 23, 2006
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, issued the following comment today about Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. (1921- 2006), who chaired the Finance Committee from 1987 to 1993, before becoming Secretary of the Treasury.
   "Sen. Bentsen set a high standard for public service and brought an independent voice and real world perspective to public policy making. I appreciated his leadership to expand opportunities for exports with NAFTA and GATT, and to enhance retirement security in America with pensions and IRAs. He demonstrated his commitment to bipartisanship with his actions both as an important legislator and as Treasury Secretary."
