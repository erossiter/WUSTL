SEN. GRASSLEY BANKRUPTCY BILL PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following comment after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed his bankruptcy reform bill.  
 Grassley praised the committee for leaving the legislation generally intact for the debate by the full Senate. The legislation is expected to be considered by the full Senate the week beginning Feb. 28.
   Grassley started working on bankruptcy reform legislation in the mid-1990s when he and Sen. Howell Heflin, of Alabama, authored the law that created the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. Grassley first held a hearing in the Judiciary Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee in April 1997. His Bankruptcy Reform bills have enjoyed overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate.
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "As we head to the floor it's important that we stick to our guns to keep poison pill amendments off the bill. We shouldn't be reopening issues or disrupting bipartisan compromises that have been reached with the House. If we can't do that, I'm afraid this necessart and popular bill might see the same fate it's seen before. I'm sure the debate will be spirited at times, but we've been through this more times than I care to count. The time has come for all the stars to align."
