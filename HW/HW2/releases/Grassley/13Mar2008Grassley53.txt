SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES SELECTION OF FOUR IOWANS TO AIR FORCE ACADEMY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that four young Iowans have been selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy for the 2008/2009 school year.  
  The four students include: Jeffory Brenner of Urbandale, son of Dave Brenner and Sheri Burke; Brady Knutson of Hubbard, son of Danielle and Dallas Knutson; Benjamin Sowers of Sergeant Bluff, son of Angela and David Sowers; and Rosalie Warner of Council Bluff, daughter of Robert Warner. 
  "The Air Force Academy requires all applicants to meet the highest standard, and to be accepted says a lot about these young adults." Grassley said. "Each of these students exemplifies the value of hard work and commitment, and I'm sure they will make Iowa proud. 
  In December, Grassley nominated several young Iowans to the four Armed Service Academies as part of if his annual nomination process. 
  Grassley indicated that the highly competitive selection process makes narrowing the list of nominees a difficult task. "Each year we have a high level of competition with so many worthy applicants contending for the few service academy openings," Grassley said. "It's exciting that our state has such a gifted generation coming up through the ranks." 
  Grassley praised the outstanding group of Iowa students who applied for academy nominations in past years and encouraged eligible students to consider submitting applications in the future. " military academies are an excellent option for students committed to pursuing a higher education," said Grassley. 
   Grassley expects additional academy appointments to be offered this year and will issue announcements when appointments are offered.
