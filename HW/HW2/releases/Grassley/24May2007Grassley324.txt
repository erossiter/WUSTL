SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley issued the following statement after the Senate voted 80 -14 in favor of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 
   "I'm glad after many months an overwhelming majority of Congress voted to finally get money to the troops who are in harms way. This legislation also reinforces to the Iraqi leadership that our commitment is not open-ended and that specific benchmarks must be met if the U.S. is going to continue our support. It's time for the Iraqi government to deliver on what they said they'd do."
