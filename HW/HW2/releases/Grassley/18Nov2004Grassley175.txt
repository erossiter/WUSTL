SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON FISA COURT RULING
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement after the special intelligence appeals court lifted restrictions placed on the sharing of information between law enforcement and intelligence officials.  
 Grassley is a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and has been actively involved in the monitoring of the Department of Justice's use and application of FISA.
   Here is Grassley's statement.
   "This ruling will untie the government's hands and help prevent terrorist attacks. The outdated rules on information sharing hurt our counter-terrorism efforts, and now we can move forward to protect national security while respecting rights and abiding by built-in safeguards. Congress will continue close oversight of the FISA process and the Patriot Act."
