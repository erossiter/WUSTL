JUDGE JARVEY CLEARS SENATE BY UNANIMOUS VOTE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that Judge John Jarvey, the nominee to serve as the United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, has passed the Senate by a vote of 95-0. 
   Grassley, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, has pushed the Senate leadership to clear Jarvey's nomination through the Senate.
   "Judge Jarvey is an exceptional nominee. He has shown tremendous dedication to public service and through this process over the last year," Grassley said. "I wish we had gotten Judge Jarvey's nomination through last year, but I'm happy the Senate was finally able to move ahead on his nomination. If his past work and the accolades from his colleagues are any indication, he'll be an outstanding judge."
   Jarvey was nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa when Chief Judge Ronald Longstaff announced his intention to retire from the bench. The vacancy is one of three active judgeships on the Southern District Court. The Court has jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of federal cases, including both civil and criminal matters.
   Jarvey's nomination cleared the Judiciary Committee last year as well, but was one of a number of judicial nominations not acted upon by the full Senate before the end of the 109th Congress. A new Congress started in January, so it was necessary for the President to re-nominate Jarvey for the judgeship.
   Jarvey has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Iowa since 1987. Prior to his current employment, he was a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice from 1983-1987. He was a law clerk to Judge Donald E. O'Brien in the U.S. District Court-Northern District of Iowa. He graduated from Drake University School of Law in 1981 and the University of Akron in 1978.
