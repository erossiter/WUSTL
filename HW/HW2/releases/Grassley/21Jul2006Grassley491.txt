SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS USDA SECRETARY JOHANNS TO CONSIDER IOWA REQUESTS FOR EMERGENCY USE OF CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM GROUND
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today requested that U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns favorably consider any requests that Iowa makes for emergency use of Conservation Reserve Program ground.  
   Grassley said that farmers who are experiencing drought-like conditions should also contact their local Farm Service Agency offices. "This process has to start at the local level, so the more the local FSA offices know, the better case they can make for assistance," he said.
   Grassley also asked that farmers contact Kevin Studer in his Washington, D.C. office at 202/224/-3744 if they're seeing drought impact their pastures and crops.
   Here is a copy of Grassley's letter to Johanns.

   The Honorable Mike Johanns
  Secretary of Agriculture
  U.S. Department of Agriculture
  14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW
  Washington, D.C. 20250-0001
   Dear Secretary Johanns:
   I respectfully request that you favorably consider any requests from local FSA county committees in Iowa for emergency use of CRP ground.
   Iowa's farmers are experiencing severe drought conditions on their farms. I am hearing concerns that cattle producers are specifically being the hardest hit by the current hot and dry conditions in Iowa.
   Natural disasters are a constant threat to Iowa's farmers and rural residents. I hope you will consider my request and feel free to contact me with any questions.
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  United States Senator
