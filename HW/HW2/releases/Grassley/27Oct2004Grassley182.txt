SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR IOWA AIRPORTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley issued the following comment regarding the $9.7 million awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration to the Des Moines International Airport and the $3.5 million awarded to the Dubuque Municipal Airport. 
   "Investments in Iowa's airport infrastructure are essential to spurring economic development, attracting new businesses, improving safety and serving the traveling public.
   "In Des Moines, this federal commitment will fund the next phase of runway extension resulting in easier access for flights serving central Iowa. Dubuque will apply federal funds in towards the development of a new primary runway. Those using the airport will benefit from fewer flight cancellations in poor weather and easier landing approaches for pilots. 
   "These grants are positive examples of our federal dollars at work helping Iowans."
