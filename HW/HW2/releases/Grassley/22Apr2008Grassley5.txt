SEN. GRASSLEY: WEST POINT OFFERS APPOINTMENT TO DAVENPORT STUDENT
  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that Lauren Elizabeth Lybbert of Davenport has been selected to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. She is a student at Davenport Assumption High School, and is the daughter of Bradly and Elizabeth Lybbert. 
   " U.S. military academies are an excellent option for students committed to pursuing a higher education," Grassley said. " West Point requires all applicants to meet the highest standard. Through her hard work and commitment, I'm sure she will make Iowa proud."
   Grassley accepts nominations for each of the service academies every fall. Young Iowans who are interested in applying for an appointment should contact Grassley's Cedar Rapids office. Applications are due October 1.
