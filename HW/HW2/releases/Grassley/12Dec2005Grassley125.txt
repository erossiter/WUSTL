JAPAN, U.S. BEEF EXPORTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley issued a statement regarding Japan's announcement that it will reopen its market to U.S. beef. Sen.  
 Grassley is Chairman of the Committee on Finance, which is responsible for international trade legislation and oversight. He farms corn and soybeans with his son in Butler County, Iowa.
   "Japan's ban went on for way too long, and it wasn't backed by sound science. It was a frustrating situation, and I met twice in recent months with Ambassador Kato of Japan to relay concerns back to Tokyo. When Japan finally accepts our beef again, U.S. producers will benefit along with Japanese consumers. The United States' work isn't done yet. We need to keep a close eye on this situation and make sure the U.S. exports are in fact allowed to resume. As a strong trade advocate, I'll continue to press for full market access for U.S. beef exports to Japan, consistent with international health standards. American producers and processors nationwide, like the Tama facility in Iowa, need some certainty about the marketplace."
