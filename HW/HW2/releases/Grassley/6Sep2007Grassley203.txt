IOWA CITY READINESS CENTER COMPLEX RECEIVES FUNDING IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that $13.186 million was included in the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that passed the Senate today. The bill must now be reconciled with the House version. 
   "The Iowa City Readiness Center is an important part of the Iowa City community and has enjoyed a long and positive relationship with the University of Iowa," Grassley said. "But, the facilities have rapidly deteriorated, and this funding will help implement the National Guard's consolidation and expansion plan. An updated facility will help provide an efficient and effective training complex for our soldiers so they are ready to complete their assigned federal and state missions."
   The Readiness Center supports training of hundreds of officers and enlisted soldiers, in addition to providing space for a troop command headquarters and a medical battalion headquarters.
   The units currently occupy a facility of 18,700 square feet constructed in 1937 as a riding arena and stable for a medical regiment and horse cavalry squadron with 128 personnel. The new Readiness Center will have 80,000 square feet located on approximately 25 acres. It is expected to provide an adequate assembly hall, kitchen, latrines, classrooms, plus administrative and recruiting space.
   Iowa City is the first of a new generation of readiness center, providing space for family support groups, legal teams, chaplain services, and other pre- and post-mobilization activities.
