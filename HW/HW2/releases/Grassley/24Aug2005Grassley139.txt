SEN. GRASSLEY: $2.4 MILLION TO IOWA FOR 23 FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will award $2,404,519 in grant funding to 23 fire departments in Iowa. The federal funds are provided through the Assistance to Firefighters grant program. 
   Operations and Firefighter Safety Program grants have been awarded to Colwell, Coon Rapids, Greene, Grinnell, Kelley, New Sharon, Rembrandt, Sergeant Bluff, Sharpsburg, Sioux Center, Truro and Westside. These funds can be used to train firefighting personnel, establish wellness and fitness programs for firefighters, purchase protective equipment, and improve fire stations and facilities.
   Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program grants have been awarded to Badger, Coulter, East Peru, LaMotte, Montpelier, Ricketts, Russell, Schleswig, Stacyville, Swea City and Titonka. These funds can be used to purchase pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, quints, aerials, foam units, and fireboats. 
   "Firefighters and other first responders play a central role in community safety efforts," Grassley said. "This funding will help make sure that they are prepared to respond to emergencies and protect area residents."
   This funding is part of the 2nd round of fiscal 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards. This federal program will distribute $650 million to local fire departments in 2005 to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs.
