SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES $500,000 TO SIX IOWA COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT LOCAL ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that six communities in Iowa will receive a total of $503,561 in grants through the Drug Free Communities Support Program. This funding is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is overseen by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). 
   Drug Free Community Programs in Boone, Council Bluffs, Gladbrook-Reinbeck, Marshalltown and Mason City will receive assistance.
   "The Drug Free Communities program recognizes that an important part of our national drug strategy is an investment at the community level," Grassley said. "Parents, teachers, business leaders, the media, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, youth and others at the community level often have the most power to discourage drug use. These funds allow communities to tailor their anti-drug activities to meet their own unique needs."
   The Drug Free Communities Grant program supports more than 700 community coalitions across the country dedicated to preventing drug use among our nation's youth. In addition to these new recipients, thirteen other communities in Iowa already receive funds from the Drug-Free Communities Grant program.
   A list of Iowa communities receiving a new Drug-Free Communities grant follows here:
   * Mason City Youth Task Force - $98,184
  * Loess Hills Area Education Agency-Council Bluffs - $100,000
  * Boone Project SAFE Coalition - $100,000
  * Marshall County youth & Violence Prevention Coalition - $100,000
  * Gladbrook-Reinbeck Project Radical - $58,000
   In addition, the Substance Abuse Task Force in Ottumwa, Iowa was awarded $47,377 as part of the Drug-Free Communities Substance Abuse Coalition Mentoring Grant program. Coalition Mentoring grants are provided to existing Drug-Free Communities grant recipients to support their efforts to help support and strengthen community coalitions in near by communities. 
   Only 38 Community Coalitions in the Nation have received Coalition Mentoring grants. The Substance Abuse Task Force in Ottumwa joins the Mason City Youth Task Force, which was first awarded funds through this program last year, as a recipient of this grant.
