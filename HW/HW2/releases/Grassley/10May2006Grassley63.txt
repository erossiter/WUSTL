SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON WHIRLPOOL DECISION TO CLOSE NEWTON FACILITIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today released the following statement after receiving word from Whirlpool officials that they would be closing the Maytag corporate headquarters and research and development center as well as the manufacturing plant in Newton. Grassley called Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig on March 30 to impress upon the company the importance of the jobs in Newton and the importance of Maytag to Newton. During the call Grassley reiterated that Whirlpool wouldn't find a more hardworking, skilled workforce anywhere else in the world.  
   "Today's announcement from Whirlpool was a tough pill to swallow. Newton and the Maytag employees showed their determination, work ethic and ingenuity while exhibiting to the Whirlpool officials that it would be a bad decision to leave the community. Unfortunately, Whirlpool didn't see it the same way the rest of us do. 
   "Now it's time to focus on helping the employees get the assistance they need and working with Newton to pick up the pieces after this devastating news. Today I'll be placing a call to Department of Labor Secretary Chao to reiterate the need for the federal government to do everything it can to help these workers get the reemployment services they need to help them prepare for future employment. And, I'll continue to assist the employees, their families and the community in any way I can to help them through this tough time."
