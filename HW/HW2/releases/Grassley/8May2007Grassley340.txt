SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS IOWANS TO DIRECT ALL CASEWORK TO IOWA OFFICES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley has asked that all Iowans direct any problems or questions they have with a federal agency, known as casework, to his state offices. 
   Until recently, Grassley also had a chief casework specialist, in addition to legislative staff, in his Washington, D.C. office. His state offices are located in Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Sioux City and Waterloo.
    "I have casework specialists in each of my state offices who will be more than happy to help Iowans get through the bureaucratic red tape that often occurs when dealing with the federal government. I hope Iowans will stop by, call or even send an email or letter," Grassley said.
   Grassley's offices in Iowa regularly help constituents contact federal and state agencies in an effort to assist Iowans on a wide variety of issues including Social Security, military, and immigration. State offices are in several areas of Iowa: Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Sioux City and Waterloo.
