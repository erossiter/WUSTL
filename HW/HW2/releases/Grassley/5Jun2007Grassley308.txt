SEN. GRASSLEY INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO NAME MARSHALLTOWN POST OFFICE AFTER FALLEN SOLDIER
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today introduced legislation to name the Marshalltown Post Office after Major Scott Nisely who was killed in Iraq. The legislation was co-sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin. Rep. Tom Latham introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   "Major Nisely was the epitome of a great American. He served his country valiantly for nearly 30 years in the military, but his public service didn't stop there. He also worked for 12 years with the United States Postal Service," Grassley said. "When your daughter moves her wedding just so you can walk her down the aisle, you know he was a devoted family man on top of his other attributes. Naming the post office in Major Nisely's honor is just a small token of appreciation and recognition for somebody who has given so much to his country."
   Nisely's military service included nearly 25 years with the United States Marine Corps and Marines Corps Reserve during which he achieved the rank of Major. Most recently, he took a significant decrease in rank to serve in the Iowa Army National Guard for close to 4 years. His public service also includes 12 years with the United States Postal Service. In addition, Nisely participated in the First Baptist Church's music ministry as a drummer.
