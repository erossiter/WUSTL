SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES WORKERS IN VICTOR ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that former workers from Victor Plastics are eligible to apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance. 
   "This assistance for the nearly 200 workers at Victor Plastics will give them the help they need to get back on their feet. By training for new skills, the workers will be provided a better opportunity to compete for new jobs in the future," Grassley said.
   Workers from River Bend Industries, formerly known as Victor Plastics, Inc., in Victor who totally or partially lost their jobs on or after January 15th, 2007 through two years from the date of certification are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance.
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program is a federal program that provides aid to workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages are reduced as a result of increased imports. The TAA program offers a variety of benefits and reemployment services to help unemployed workers prepare for and obtain suitable employment. Workers may be eligible for training, job search and relocation allowances, income support, and other reemployment services.
   Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance provides assistance for workers over the age of 50 where retraining may not be appropriate.
