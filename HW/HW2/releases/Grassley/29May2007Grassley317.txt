SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON EXPECTED ZOELLICK NOMINATION FOR WORLD BANK PRESIDENT
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, made the following statement after it was announced that President George Bush is expected to name Bob Zoellick as his selection to be president of the World Bank on Wednesday. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "I've got a lot of respect for Bob Zoellick. He's extremely capable, and through his leadership for international trade, I know he has a real understanding of what it takes to advance economic development in poor countries. At the World Bank, I want to see Ambassador Zoellick continue the vigorous campaign that Paul Wolfowitz started against corruption in beneficiary countries. The World Bank is in need of reform from top to bottom. We can't accept business as usual. Paul Wolfowitz may have been railroaded out of his job, but his initiative must continue."
