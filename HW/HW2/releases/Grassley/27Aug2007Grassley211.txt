SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced his resignation.  
   "First and foremost, I want to thank Attorney General Gonzales for his service to our country. Alberto Gonzales made a tremendous impact in the Justice Department as an advocate for protecting children and aggressively pursuing child predators. Obviously the last couple of years have been tough for him. Even after all the scrutiny, it doesn't appear that Attorney General Gonzales committed any crimes, but he did make management missteps and didn't handle the spotlight well when they were exposed.
   "Today, Democratic leaders got what they wanted. Now I hope they'll send a clear message to the president that they'll get somebody quickly confirmed and not politicize the process. As they've said, the Attorney General is a very important position in our government, and if we're going to get a qualified and respected person to accept the nomination, that person will need to know they won't be drug through the mud for a short-lived stint as Attorney General."
