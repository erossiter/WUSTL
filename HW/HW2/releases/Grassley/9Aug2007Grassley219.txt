SEN. GRASSLEY TO COMPLETE ANNUAL VISITS TO ALL OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will complete his annual visit to all of Iowa 's 99 counties, visiting seven counties during the week of August 20.
   Town Hall meetings are planned in Cherokee and Monona counties and are open to the public. Grassley will also visit businesses and attend events in Blackhawk, Ida, Monona, Palo Alto , Polk, and Woodbury counties. 
   "I enjoy communicating with Iowans because representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes many area residents will attend his meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
   Grassley will be in the Des Moines area on Monday, August 20. He will first hold a FIT meeting in Ankeny . The FIT program was established by Grassley to address Iowa 's drug problem at the grassroots level by helping people work together to keep their schools, workplaces, and communities drug-free. Throughout the rest of the day he will receive and award from the National Association of Manufacturers and visit the Allied/Nationwide Insurance Company.
   Later in the week, Grassley will tour Northwest Iowa . He will visit several businesses including the Schuster Company in Le Mars, Diamond Vogel in Orange City , Skyjack Incorporated in Emmetsburg, and Ida Services Incorporated in Battle Creek . Ida Services Incorporated assists persons with disabilities by providing job training and helping their consumers live independently.
