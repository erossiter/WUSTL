PAYMENT LIMITS AMENDMENT
  Senator Chuck Grassley today issued the following comment after his amendment to direct farm payments to those who need it most was defeated by a vote of 56-43. The amendment needed 60 votes to pass.  
   Ensuring that farm payments be directed to those who need it most, as the law was intended, has been a long-standing priority of Grassley's. A similar amendment was adopted during the 2002 farm bill debate, but it was stripped during negotiations between the House and Senate. Grassley and Dorgan have since introduced stand alone legislation to address closing loopholes that allow 10 percent of the farmers to receive 73 percent of the benefits.
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "We had a victory and a defeat all in one vote. It was a victory because a vast majority of Senators voted for real reform. It was a defeat because we needed 60 votes. The Senate rules give the minority great privilege and in this case one Senator required us to meet the 60 vote threshold. I can't justify 10 percent of the farmers getting 73 percent of the payments. Obviously, others think that's okay. This isn't over. The underlying bill is not real reform. There are loopholes that you can drive a 9630 John Deere tractor through and I'm going to work to convince the conferees that the majority in the Senate was right."
