SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS PRESIDENT TO GRANT ASSISTANCE FOR IOWA AFTER DEVASTATING RAINS HIT STATE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today sent a letter to President George Bush asking for prompt consideration of a request for federal assistance for several Iowa counties after heavy storms impacted Iowa. 
    "Much of Iowa was under water following the days of rain that crossed the state in August. These counties deserve all the help we can give them," Grassley said. "The president's quick approval will help them get back on their feet as early as possible."
   The law requires that federal disaster assistance first be requested by the governor. Then, Iowa's congressional delegation may ask for the request to be granted by the federal government.
   Here's a copy of Grassley's letter to Bush.

   The Honorable George W. Bush
  President of the
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   I respectfully ask that you grant the request made today by Governor Culver for a declaration of a major disaster for the State of Iowa as a result of a severe weather system that produced high winds, heavy rain, thunderstorms, and flooding beginning on August 17, 2007 and continuing. There has been one fatality and many injuries as a result of these storms. The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed.
   Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request.
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  United States Senator
