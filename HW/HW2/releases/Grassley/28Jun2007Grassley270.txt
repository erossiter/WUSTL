SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION CLOTURE VOTE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley made the following statement after the Senate voted against cloture on the immigration reform bill. The bill was subsequently pulled from consideration. 
   "Today's vote is further evidence that the process was flawed from the very beginning. This should be a lesson that you can't have a bill put together by a rump caucus of a few Senators, bypass the committee process, limit debate and stop amendments from being offered and expect it to pass. Coupled with the fact that amnesty was included in the bill, this legislation was not a good solution to our immigration problem. Now it's time to enforce the laws already on the books until a real solution can be found."
