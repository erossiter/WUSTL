SEN. GRASSLEY: MESKWAKI TRIBE ONE STEP CLOSER TO ASSISTANCE FOR NEW HIGH SCHOOL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that language urging the Department of the Interior to give full consideration for his request to help fund a new 9-12 school at the Meskwaki Tribal settlement near Tama is included in the fiscal 2005 spending bill for the interior that is expected to pass the Appropriations Committee later today.  
 After Committee approval, the bill must be considered by the full Senate.
   The Tribal School Construction Demonstration Program allows the Secretary of the Interior to provide grants to Indian tribes for the construction of tribally controlled schools.
   "A secondary school at the settlement would give young people in the tribe an opportunity to continue a quality education at even higher levels without having to leave the settlement," Grassley said.
   The Sac and Fox Meskwaki Settlement School Expansion project, approved in November of 2002 by the Meskwaki Settlement School Board, would develop, implement and operate a comprehensive high school program. Currently the tribe operates a school for grades K-8 only. The expanded school could begin with ninth grade students in the Fall of 2005 and add one grade or more each year thereafter. 
   Grassley said expansion measures would ensure that the new facility meets North Central Association accreditation requirements, college admission requirements and K-12 standards and benchmarks. In addition, expanding the K-8 facility would reduce new construction costs while enhancing services and curriculum available to students. The expansion would include a new technology lab/computer lab, auditorium, additional classrooms and office space, renovated cafeteria/commons area, and additional facilities. 
   Grassley said he will continue to work with Senate appropriators throughout the process to see that the project is included in the final version of the bill.
