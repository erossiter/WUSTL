SEN. GRASSLEY YEARLY MEETINGS IN EVERY IOWA COUNTY BEGIN THIS WEEK
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today reminded Iowans that he will once again begin his annual tour of Iowa's 99 counties with visits to 12 counties this week.
   "These meetings help generate an exchange of ideas that are necessary for representative government," Grassley said. "Holding a meeting in each of our 99 counties gives me the opportunity to have an open and honest dialogue with Iowans. I've always found that the best way to work on behalf of Iowans is to maintain a conversation, not only through these county meetings, but also through email, postal mail, telephone calls and face-to-face meetings." 
   Grassley will tour several businesses and meet with employees at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Mount Pleasant, Case New Holland in Burlington, Emerson's Fisher Valve Division, and AlphaGen Materials in Vinton. He will also speak with the Oskaloosa-Sunrise Kiwanis, the Sigourney Kiwanis, the Iowa City Rotary and will meet with patients and staff at the McCreery Cancer Center in Ottumwa .
   He will speak with students and participate in question and answer sessions at Louisa-Muscatine Jr./Sr. High School, Pekin Community High School , Williamsburg High School and City High School in Iowa City
   Grassley will participate in a community walking tour of West Liberty and meet with chamber members and the mayor after the tour.
