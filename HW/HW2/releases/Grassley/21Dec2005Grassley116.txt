SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES FEDERAL JUDGESHIP APPLICATION DEADLINE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that Iowans interested in applying for a federal judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa should submit their applications by January 13, 2006. 
   A vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa was created when Chief Judge Ronald Longstaff announced his intention to retire from the bench. The vacancy is one of three active judgeships on the Southern District Court, which is based in Des Moines. The Court has jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of federal cases, including both civil and criminal matters. 
   Grassley said he wants to make sure that all Iowans are aware of this opportunity to serve. He invited those applying to let him know of their interest before January 13, 2006 by writing him at 206 Federal Building, 101 First Street, SE, Cedar Rapids, 52401, Attention: Mary Day. Grassley said he plans to recommend qualified Iowans to the President for the judgeship.
   "Judge Longstaff has been a tremendous representative on the Southern District Court. I hope the person who takes his place will be of the same intellect, integrity and temperament," Grassley said. "I encourage anybody who is interested in this position to apply."
