SEN. GRASSLEY REMINDS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES OF DEADLINE TO SIGN UP FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today reminded Iowa Medicare beneficiaries that they have until midnight on Monday, May 15 to sign up to receive prescription drug coverage through Medicare. Representatives from the Medicare hotline, 1-800-Medicare will be available throughout the weekend to answer questions from beneficiaries. The Medicare website, www.medicare.gov is also available for seniors to learn more about plans available in their areas.  
   "It's a good benefit, it's available, and I hope people will take full advantage of it if they want to," Grassley said. "I hope Iowans will take the time to check out their options. The program is already paying for more than a million prescriptions a day nationwide. And as the program grows, more people will save more money."
   On Monday, for additional information, Iowans can also call the State Health Insurance Information Programs in Iowa at 1-800-351-4664. SHIIP has volunteers who can offer beneficiaries one-on-one counseling.
