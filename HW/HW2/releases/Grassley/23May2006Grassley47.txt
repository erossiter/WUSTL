SEN. GRASSLEY LOOKS TO SOLVE STUDENT HOUSING ISSUES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today sent a letter asking for language to be included in the pending Supplemental Appropriations bill that would fix a provision that adversely impacted disabled students. Grassley sent the letter with Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, George Voinovich of Ohio, and Tom Harkin of Iowa and Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, Rep. Pat Tiberi of Ohio, and Rep. Deborah Price of Ohio.
   A new Section 8 housing rule was included in the fiscal 2006 Treasury, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development and Appropriations bill, and was designed to strengthen and clarify the eligibility requirements for students who want to reside in federally subsidized housing. This bill failed to provide adequate protections for students with disabilities under the age of 24.  
   Since he learned of the problem, Grassley has been working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to resolve the issue. But, it has come to the attention of the Members that students might be at risk of losing their supportive housing as early as next week if a fix is not signed into law.
   The letter states, "The Final Rule issued by HUD, in response to the FY06 appropriations provision, is intended to close a loop-hole in the Section 8 program which allowed students athletes and other non-needy students at universities across the country access to Section 8 housing assistance. While we support efforts to end abuses in the Section 8 program, we believe that the language included in this rule could negatively affect some of our most vulnerable populations."
   Here is a copy of the letter.

   Dear Chairmen, 
   We ask you to include the language from H.R. 5117 and S.2591 in the Conference Report for the Fiscal Year 2006 (FY06) Supplemental Appropriations bill. This legislation fixes an unintended consequence of a provision added to Section 327 of the FY06 Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Appropriations bill by allowing disabled students continued access to HUD Section 8 rental assistance. This legislation would have no impact on the federal budget.
   The Final Rule issued by HUD, in response to the FY06 appropriations provision, is intended to close a loop-hole in the Section 8 program which allowed students athletes and other non-needy students at universities across the country access to Section 8 housing assistance. While we support efforts to end abuses in the Section 8 program, we believe that the language included in this rule could negatively affect some of our most vulnerable populations. For example, it has come to our attention that disabled students living near The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio could be put at risk of losing their supportive housing as early as next week if a fix is not signed into law.
   Because of the urgent nature of this problem, we ask that you include this legislative language in the pending supplemental appropriations bill, allowing eligible disabled college students to continue to live in affordable housing. Thank you for your continued leadership.
   Sincerely,
   Deborah Pryce
