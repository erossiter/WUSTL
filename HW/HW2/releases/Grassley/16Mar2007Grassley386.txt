SEN. GRASSLEY CONTINUES VISITS TO EVERY IOWA COUNTY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley has planned meetings in eight Iowa counties to gather input from Iowa farmers and other stakeholders as Congress turns its attention to a new farm bill. 
   He said today that he will be in Audubon, Adair, Carroll, Cass, Crawford, Harrison, Pottawattamie and Shelby counties for open-to-the-public meetings on April 2 and 3. Grassley will also speak at the USDA Rural Development state meeting for employees hosted in Des Moines.
   Grassley is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and farms corn and soybeans in Butler County with his son and grandson. This marks the 27th consecutive year that he has held at least one meeting in every one of Iowa's 99 counties to keep in touch with constituents.
    "I want to hear more about what farmers want in a new farm bill," Grassley said. "Of course, if people have questions or comments on topics other than the farm bill, I'll be happy to talk about those topics, too. I hope as many area residents as possible are able to participate in these meetings and the dialogue that's fundamental to representative government."
   Here is information about Grassley's upcoming meetings.
