SEN. GRASSLEY VISITS WITH LOCAL STUDENTS, STAFF
  Sen. Chuck Grassley recently visited with students, faculty and staff at Oelwein High School. The Senate schedule allowed Grassley to travel to Iowa earlier than expected. This gave him extra time to visit Oelwein High School. 
   "The students at Oelwein High School were a very bright group and they asked very intelligent questions," Grassley said. "I enjoy hearing the views of young Iowans and to see their interest in the political process."
   This marks the 27th consecutive year that he has held at least one meeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties to keep in touch with constituents.
   Meeting with students has been a priority for Grassley throughout his career in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. He meets with nearly 40 groups of students during the year both in Iowa and in Washington.
