SEN. GRASSLEY WORKS TO SOLVE HOUSING PROBLEM FOR DISABLED COLLEGE STUDENTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley is working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to change a new Section 8 housing rule that negatively impacts disabled students pursuing higher education.  
   The rule was included in the FY06 Treasury, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development and Appropriations bill, and was designed to strengthen and clarify the eligibility requirements for students who want to reside in federally subsidized housing. This bill failed to provide adequate protections for students with disabilities under the age of 24.
   "We are working to resolve the problem so that students with disabilities have access to the quality of life these housing developments provide," Grassley said. "The service helps residents live independently. Disabled students should not be penalized for pursuing their education."
   Grassley learned of the problem through students who were affected in Ohio. These students live in a residence run by a non-profit organization that provides low-income modified housing for the severely disabled while they pursue job training and other educational goals. Due to their disabilities, these students are unable to live independently in dorm rooms or other apartments. Grassley is working with Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio to fix this problem.
