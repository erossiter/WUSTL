SEN. GRASSLEY ADDRESSES SENATE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following comment after staff members for Sens. Grassley and Tom Harkin and Rep. Steve King met with officials from the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Postal Service. Grassley, Harkin and King had previously requested the Inspector General to perform an independent review of the proposed consolidation of the Sioux City mail processing facility. Following the request from the Sioux City delegation, the Inspector General's office compared the proposed Sioux City consolidation with a number of other pending consolidations and determined that it had a relatively high degree of risk and bore further review. The Inspector General agreed to perform a full audit of the proposed consolidation, taking into consideration the concerns that have been raised by the community such as possible degradation of customer service and the lack of a sound business case for consolidation. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "We haven't had a whole lot of good news dealing with the Postal Service on the Sioux City mail processing center, but today's announcement is reason for hope. This doesn't stop the move from occurring, but with the Inspector General taking a more in depth look at the Sioux City situation we'll at least get a complete and independent review of what we think is a problematic proposal."
