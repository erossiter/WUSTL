SEN. GRASSLEY TO VISIT 17 COMMUNITIES TO MEET WITH IOWANS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit 17 counties to meet with Iowans during the Congressional recess to be held March 21 - 31. 
   Town meetings are planned for Audubon, Denison, Onawa, Logan, Atlantic, Glenwood, Sidney, Clarinda, Bedford, Corning, Greenfield and Guthrie Center and are open to the public.
   Grassley will also attend events in Carroll, Kirkman, Council Bluffs, Red Oak, and Des Moines.
   "Representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "My annual meeting with county residents allows me to share with Iowans what I'm doing in Washington and hear their views on issues that are important to them. I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes many area residents will attend his meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject. 
   Here is information about Grassley's town meetings.
