SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES NOMINATIONS OF YOUNG IOWANS TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that he has nominated several young Iowans to the United States Service Academies. 
   "I'm proud to nominate each of these very high achieving young Iowans," Grassley said. "Every year we see a high caliber of young men and women from Iowa who are interested in our service academies. I'm confident that these nominees will represent our state well."
   Grassley nominates several young Iowans each year for a select few spots. Each academy then selects students based on the number of vacancies for the 2008-2009 school year. Often, because of the high quality of nominations from Iowa , several students are selected to attend each academy.
   Grassley praised the outstanding group of Iowa students who applied for academy nominations in past years and encouraged eligible students to consider submitting applications in the future. "This year was a highly competitive selection process and it was very difficult to narrow the list of nominees once again," said Grassley.
   Grassley will issue announcements when appointments to the academies are offered.
   Here are Grassley's nominations.
