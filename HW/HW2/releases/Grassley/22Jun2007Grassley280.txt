SEN. GRASSLEY TO VISIT FOURTEEN IOWA COUNTIES DURING 4TH OF JULY RECESS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will continue his annual tour of Iowa with visits to fourteen counties during the 4th of July Congressional recess from July 2-6. He will make visits to Emmet, Dickinson, Osceola, Lyon, O'Brien, Green, Story, Webster, Mitchell, Howard, Cedar, Louisa, Jefferson , and Keokuk counties. 
   Town meetings are planned for Emmet, Dickinson, O'Brien, Greene, Webster, Mitchell, Howard, Cedar, Louisa, Jefferson , Keokuk, and are open to the public.
   "I enjoy communicating with Iowans because representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes area residents will attend his town hall meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
   Throughout the week, Grassley will also speak at the Sibley Rotary, meet with representatives from Easter Seals on a farm in Lyon County, participate in the grand opening of the Large Animal Research Facility at Iowa State University, and receive an award from the Special Olympics.
