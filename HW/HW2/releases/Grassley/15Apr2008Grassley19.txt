  Senator Chuck Grassley announced today that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has awarded $160,000 in digital conversion grants to Iowa Public Radio Stations in Lamoni and Bettendorf. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a private, non-profit corporation, created by Congress, to promote public telecommunications services. 
   "These grants will allow the radio stations in Lamoni and Bettendorf to provide better quality services to their communities," Grassley said.
   KOWI-FM in Lamoni received a digital conversion grant for $85,000 and KWNJ-FM in Bettendorf received a digital conversion grant for $75,000.
