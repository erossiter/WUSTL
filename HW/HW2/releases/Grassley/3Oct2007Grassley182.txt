SEN. GRASSLEY WORKS TO STOP ABUSIVE TRAVEL SPENDING
  Sen. Chuck Grassley along with Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan requested a report from the Government Accountability Office regarding abusive travel spending by federal employees. The report released today reports that high-ranking officials wasted at least $146 million over a one-year period of time on this improper use of first-class and business-class travel.  
   "The federal employees who like to stretch their legs while they fly need to realize they've already stretched the taxpayer's purse by $146 million," Grassley said. "Sen. Coleman has shown great leadership in requesting this report and we share the goal of stopping this abuse. This GAO report falls right in line with legislation I've authored that would require all federal agencies to be more accountable with their government charge card programs as well as establish penalties for violations."
   This report is a follow up to a previous report Grassley along with Coleman and Rep. Jan Schakowksy of Illinoise originally requested from GAO in 2003 on premium class travel in the Department of Defense. Concerns about possible abuse of premium class travel by Defense Department employees arose out of Grassley' previous investigations of abuse of government travel cards and purchase cards. 
   "This new report falls right in line with legislation I've sponsored to require all federal agencies to be more accountable with their government charge card programs, and to establish penalties for violations," Grassley said. "I'll be looking at whether my legislation can be strengthened based on the new GAO recommendations."
