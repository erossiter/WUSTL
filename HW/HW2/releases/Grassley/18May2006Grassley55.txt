SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL, AMENDMENT 3961, OFFERED BY SEN. ISAKSON OF GEORGIA
  STATEMENT BY SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY ON THE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL AND AMENDMENT 3961, OFFERED BY SENATOR JOHNNY ISAKSON OF GEORGIA. 
   "On Tuesday, the Senate had an opportunity to take a positive step forward in securing the border. Senator Isakson from Georgia offered an amendment to commit the Congress to securing the border before implementation of any amnesty program. In fact, the amendment would have required the federal government to hire more enforcement personnel and border agents, construct fencing in certain areas on the border, and secure technological and communication assets. The amendment would also have required Congress to fund an increase in detention space so that illegal aliens aren't free to roam in our communities. I supported this amendment because I believe the border needs to be secured, first and foremost. I have and will continue to oppose an amnesty for illegal aliens. I was disappointed to see the Senate lose an opportunity to secure our borders as soon as possible by failing to approve the Isakson amendment."
