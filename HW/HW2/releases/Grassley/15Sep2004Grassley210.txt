SEN. GRASSLEY APPLAUDS FUNDING FOR IOWA IN COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that several Iowa projects are funded in the Senate spending bill for Commerce, Justice and State related projects. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate.  
   Grassley helped secure nearly $3.5 million for projects in Iowa. These projects include a rural mentoring program, computer software for the Iowa State Patrol, Project STORM at the University of Northern Iowa, an internet security program at Iowa State University. The spending bill also includes funding for three initiatives to address illegal drug problems in Iowa.
   "Federal funding for these projects is an investment in the lives of Iowans," Grassley said. "With this money we can encourage kids to study meteorology and weather science careers, help establish relationships between mentors and young people in rural areas, and help curb the illegal drug use and violence in our communities."
   Here is a list of the projects.
   * Iowa Big Brothers and Big Sisters, $1.24 million - Funds will help Big Brothers and Big Sisters to work in conjunction with the Iowa Mentor Center on a rural mentoring program. The Iowa Mentor Center is initiating an aggressive plan to provide mentoring programs to children in rural and unserved Iowa communities. The Iowa Mentor Center will recruit volunteers in communities to help develop relationships between the mentor and the students. The Iowa Mentor Center programs work to reduce drug and alcohol use, improve school performance and attendance, improve relationships and self-esteem and reduce violence. 
   * Iowa State Patrol, $1 million - Funds will help the Iowa State Patrol computer software upgrade to the Traffic and Criminal Software (TraCS) data collection system. The Iowa State Patrol uses the TraCS software to better leverage their time, be more efficient and improve officer safety. Funds will be used to continue to expand the capabilities of the TraCS system and allow for more efficiency in accident reporting, driver license checks, and registration checks. The funds would expand the number of patrol cars with the current system and allow the State Patrol to coordinate their services with other agencies.
   * Highway Drug Interdiction Team, $765,000 - Funds will help put together a combined effort of specialized agents and troopers that could address the problem of drugs being moved across interstate highways in Iowa. Agents would coordinate to arrest and seize contraband and assets from drug traffickers and work with prosecutors to assure successful prosecutions. The Division of Narcotics Enforcement estimates approximately 80% of illegal drugs seized in Iowa are imported from other states. Drugs also pass through Iowa on their way to destination cities such as Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit and New York. 
   * University of Northern Iowa, STORM Air Quality Initiative, $650,000 - Funds will help the project continue to develop into one of the best Centers for teaching and researching meteorology. This year's funding will enable STORM to support research to quantify the contribution of agriculture and transportation to atmospheric aerosol in Iowa. These efforts are in response to the growing awareness that local air quality is interconnected to regional and global transport processes. The work will be coordinated with the Iowa Waste Reduction Center, which assists small Iowa businesses in complying with emission regulations. 
   * Iowa State University, Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment, $500,000 - Funds will help the Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment provide an integrated environment to work on synergistic research projects in information assurance and to solve the problems facing industry, government, and law enforcement. Together they will create a virtual Internet for the purpose of researching, designing, and testing cyber defense mechanisms as well as analysis of cyber attacks. The facility will be the catalyst for bringing together top researchers from several disciplines for a common goal of making computing safer.
   * Drug Endangered Children rapid response team, $500,000 - Funds will help expand the program to include teams in six counties plus add a state coordinator for the program. Funding will also be utilized for family centered services to include obtaining substance abuse treatment, drug testing for children and parents and communications equipment for Drug Endangered Children team members. Over the past two fiscal years, the Iowa Department of Human Services has classified 958 children as victims of abuse due to parental involvement with meth labs. Grassley secured funding for this project during last year's appropriations process.
   * Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy, $300,000 - Funds will help purchase and install approximately 6,600 additional tank locks to deter the theft of anhydrous ammonia which is used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Locks would be offered to farmers and anhydrous retailers in 30-35 counties. Currently, farmers and anhydrous retailers with nurse tanks in 57 of Iowa's 99 counties either have tank locks or are scheduled to receive them in 2004.
