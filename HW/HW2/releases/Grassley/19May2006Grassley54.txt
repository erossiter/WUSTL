SEN. GRASSLEY TO HOST MEETING WITH NEWTON MAYOR ALLEN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF LABOR DEROCCO
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that he will host a meeting with Newton Mayor Chaz Allen and Assistant Secretary of Labor Emily Stover DeRocco on June 7.  
   The meeting follows up on a personal telephone call Grassley made to Department of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao after the Whirlpool announcement. Following the conversation, Chao asked the Asst. Secretary for Employment and Training Administration to assist the Maytag workers and the community with all the available resources at the Department.
   "When I called Secretary Chao, she was very sympathetic to the Newton community and offered all resources that the Department had available," Grassley said. "I appreciate the work the Labor Department is doing to help the workers and the community. We need all hands on deck to ensure that these workers get the reemployment services they need to help them prepare for future employment.
   Grassley said that he expects the discussion to include the array of opportunities and assistance that are available from the Labor Department to respond to the needs of the Maytag workers. They plan to also identify similar resources that are available across the federal government for the workers and the community.
