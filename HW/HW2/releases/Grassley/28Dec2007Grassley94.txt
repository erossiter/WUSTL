SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS PRESIDENT TO GRANT ASSISTANCE FOR IOWA AFTER DEVASTATING ICE HITS STATE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today sent a letter to President George Bush asking for prompt consideration of a request for federal assistance for several Iowa counties after heavy winter storms impacted Iowa. 
   "Much of Iowa was impacted by downed trees and branches, power lines and ice-coated roads following the days of the winter storm that crossed the state in early December.  These counties deserve all the help we can give them," Grassley said.  "The president's quick approval will help them get back on their feet as early as possible."
   The law requires that federal disaster assistance first be requested by the governor.  Then, Iowa's congressional delegation may ask for the request to be granted by the federal government.
   Here's a copy of the text of Grassley's letter to Bush.
   December 28, 2007
   The Honorable George W. Bush
   President of the
   The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
   Washington, DC 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   I respectfully ask that you grant the request made late last week by Governor Culver for a declaration of a major disaster for the State of Iowa as a result of a severe winter storm that produced major damage from freezing rain, sleet, ice and snow on December 10 and 11, 2007.  The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed.
   Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request.
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  United States Senator
