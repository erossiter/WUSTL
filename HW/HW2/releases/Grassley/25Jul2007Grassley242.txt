IOWA SENATORS INTRODUCE RESOLUTION HONORING 133RD INFANTRY
  Senators Chuck Grassley and Tom Harkin today introduced a Senate resolution "honoring and expressing gratitude to the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry ('Ironman Battalion') of the Iowa National Guard." 
   "The Iowa National Guard members and their families have done our state proud. They've served bravely and honorably in one of the most dangerous parts of Iraq," Grassley said. "These soldiers and their families put their lives on hold, endured prolonged separation, and sacrificed in the longest deployment to Iraq seen by our citizen soldiers. I hope the men and women of the 133rd and their families, as well as all the members of our armed forces, know the great amount of gratitude we have for their service to our nation."
   The 133rd Infantry returned home today.
   A companion bill was introduced in the House by the members of the Iowa delegation.
