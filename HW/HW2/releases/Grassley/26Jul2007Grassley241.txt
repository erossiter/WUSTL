GAO MAIL PROCESSING REPORT RELEASED
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after the Government Accountability Office released its report, "Mail Processing Realignment Efforts Under Way Need Better Integration and Explanation." According to the GAO, the report describes the status of the initiatives by the U.S. Postal Service developed for realignment in the 2002 Transformation Plan; evaluates how the planning, impacts, and results of these initiatives align with realignment goals; and evaluates the Postal Service's communication practices with stakeholders in making realignment decisions. The report critiques the process used in determining the down sizing of the Postal Service's mail processing center located in Sioux City. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "The GAO report showed several areas that need improvement in the Postal Service's process in determining its realignment initiatives. The report itself does not address the situation in Sioux City, but the shortcomings found in today's report call into question the recommendations to consolidate the mail processing center. These problem areas should be fixed. The Postal Service employees and the Sioux City community deserve to know that a fair process was used in the decision to move jobs out of Sioux City."
