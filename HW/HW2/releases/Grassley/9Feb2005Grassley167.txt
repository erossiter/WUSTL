FORMER IOWA ARMY AMMUNITION PLANT WORKERS ADDED TO SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT BY ADVISORY BOARD
 Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following comment regarding the decision by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to add the class of workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant from 1949 to 1974 to the Special Exposure Cohort.  
 The Board's decision now will be considered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
   "This is the best outcome we could have hoped for. The process was slow, but today's action shows that the process can work. Now, these workers are a step closer than they've ever been to getting the compensation they deserve. As the process moves forward, I will ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider the Board's decision as expeditiously as possible."
