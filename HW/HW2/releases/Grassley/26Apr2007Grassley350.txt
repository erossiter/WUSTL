SEN. GRASSLEY AMENDMENTS INCLUDED IN FINAL AMERICA COMPETES ACT
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that the America Competes Act that passed the Senate last night included two of his amendments. Grassley's amendments recognize the need to provide challenging and rewarding educational experiences to America's brightest students. 
   "My amendments are an excellent way to get talented kids involved in math and science and other fields critical to our economic growth," Grassley said. "We cannot neglect the importance of challenging and encouraging our most promising students to excel so that they will some day be the scientists, engineers, and researchers that will create the innovations that will drive our economy."
   The first amendment would improve a provision already in the America Competes Act. Currently the bill creates new summer internships working with the National Laboratories. Grassley's amendment would target these internships toward high ability learners in middle or high school who may be bored with their regular coursework and need such an experience to stimulate their interest in science.
   Grassley's second amendment also improves a grant program that encourages schools to expand offerings of Advanced Placement (AP) courses. The amendment would prioritize these grants for schools that allow advanced students to take AP courses earlier than traditionally offered if they are prepared for such work.
   Grassley has been the leading advocate for talented and gifted children in the U.S. Congress and has worked to ensure that they have access to the education needed to reach their full potential. Grassley advanced legislation that would expand the availability of gifted education services and he was successful in expanding the benefits available for gifted students through the No Child Left Behind Act.
