SEN. GRASSLEY WELCOMES REOPENING OF TAIWAN BEEF MARKET
 Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa today welcomed the reopening of the Taiwanese market to imports of U.S. beef.  
 Taiwan originally closed its market to U.S. beef in December 2003 following the first detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United States, and Taiwan reopened its market in April 2005. Following a second case of BSE in the United States in June 2005, Taiwan shut down its market again to U.S. beef imports. Taiwan will now permit the importation of U.S. boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age. Grassley is chairman of the Committee on Finance, with jurisdiction over international trade. He made the following comment on the reopening of Taiwan's beef market.
   "I'm glad Taiwan has recognized the obvious, that U.S. beef is safe. Millions of Americans consume U.S. beef every day, and the Taiwanese will now be able to join them in enjoying this product. I hope other countries around the world will take notice of Taiwan's decision. Taiwan has made a science-based determination that it's safe to import U.S. beef. If it's safe for consumers in Taiwan and the United States to eat U.S. beef, it's safe for consumers in other countries, too."
