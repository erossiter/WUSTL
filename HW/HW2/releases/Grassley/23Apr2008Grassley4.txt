INSPECTOR GENERAL REFORM ACT CLEARS SENATE
  Senator Chuck Grassley released the following statement after the Inspector General Reform Act was cleared by the Senate today. The bill must now be reconciled with legislation that has already passed the House. Grassley has been a longtime advocate for inspectors general and their primary mission to ferret out fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government. He is a cosponsor of the bill that passed today. 
   "It's the Inspector General who is on the frontline against waste, fraud and abuse at federal agencies. Congress created Inspectors General to protect taxpayer dollars from an ever growing federal bureaucracy. It takes an individual with an iron will to stand up to federal agencies, and it all starts by putting the right individual into the shoes of the Inspector General. I've tried to do everything possible to strengthen the IG system and urge courage and independence on the part of individual Inspectors General. The Inspector General Reform Act is a good legislative step to help ensure IGs keep their independence and their status as the watchdogs who safeguard public confidence in our system of self-government."
