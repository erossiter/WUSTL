SEN. GRASSLEY TO BEGIN 25TH ANNUAL TOUR TO IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will begin his annual visit to each of Iowa's 99 counties with meetings in nine counties on Jan. 10 and 11. This is the beginning of Grassley's 25th year visiting every Iowa county. 
   Grassley will be holding town meetings in Madison, Warren, Marion, Butler, Bremer, Chickasaw and Floyd counties. The town meetings are open to the public and Grassley encourages all area residents with questions or comments to attend. 
   Grassley will also visit schools in Dallas and Black Hawk counties.
   "Elected officials can easily lose touch with what's going on with their constituents if they spend all of their time in Washington, D.C. I come home nearly every weekend and my county visits help me know what Iowans are thinking. I take that common sense to Washington on their behalf," Grassley said.
   Here is a list of Grassley's visits in January.
