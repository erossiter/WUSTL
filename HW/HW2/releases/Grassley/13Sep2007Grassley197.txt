SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH ON IRAQ
  Sen. Chuck Grassley issued the comment below in response to the speech delivered tonight by President Bush regarding progress in Iraq.  
   "This week, General Petraeus delivered the candid, unvarnished progress report that he promised Congress. Tonight, the Commander-in-Chief is choosing to adopt the General's recommendations on troop reductions and the next phase of involvement. At this point, the approach fulfills what I'm looking for, which is a strategy that works to drawing down the U.S. commitment as quickly as possible while also looking out for U.S. interests and security in the long term. Americans are safer with an Iraq that is stable and not a haven for terrorists."
