SEN. GRASSLEY: IOWA PROJECTS TO GAIN IN INTERIOR SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that $750,000 for Silos and Smokestacks was included in the fiscal 2005 spending bill for the interior that is expected to pass the Appropriations Committee later today.  
 The bill will then be considered by the full Senate.
   Grassley also said that language supporting the establishment of a National Center for Advanced Biobased Foundry Binders and Pollution Reduction Technologies at the University of Northern Iowa Metal Casting Center (UNIMCC) was also included in the bill. 
   "Silos and Smokestacks will continue to help communities in Northeast Iowa preserve its agriculture heritage and increase public awareness to the unique cultural aspects of the region's history," Grassley said. "The Metal Casting Center's research is among the top in the nation. This is an important step in advancing their research capabilities."
   Silos and Smokestacks is expected to receive $750,000 to continue helping communicate northeast Iowa's agricultural heritage and is one of 23 designated areas of the National Heritage Partnership Areas program. The project involves more than 80 communities, sites and attractions in Iowa that tell the story of agriculture and its role in the region's history. It covers more than 20,000 square miles and encompasses a 37-county region.
   Grassley said the University of Northern Iowa's Metal Casting Center has led research in the development and use of biobased binders and aggregates from renewable agricultural feedstocks. A National Center for Advanced Biobased Foundry Binders and Pollution Reduction Technologies would provide many things including: conducting research on Hazardous Air Pollutants reduction and emissions containment technologies; testing new materials from industry sources; and providing demonstration facilities for new technologies.
