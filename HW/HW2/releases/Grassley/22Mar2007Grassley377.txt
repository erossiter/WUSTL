JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SUBPOENA VOTE
  During a Judiciary Committee meeting this morning, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked that he be recorded in support of giving the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in consultation with the ranking member, the authority to issue subpoenas to White House officials regarding the Committee's inquiry into the administration's dismissal late last year of U.S. Attorneys. Committee members voted by voice vote to give that authority to the Chairman. 
   "I wanted to express my support for getting the facts out on the table. The sooner we do that, the better. The executive branch - no matter who is President - is almost always extremely resistant to oversight requests from Congress. For example, I've been very frustrated in my efforts of the last year to get information about the Food and Drug Administration's actions with regard to an antibiotic. The FBI has continued to stonewall several of my requests. Congress has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight. I've worked to meet that responsibility both when the spotlight is on an issue and when it's not. Congress' inquiries need to be legitimate oversight. I want to make sure that we do the right thing for the American people."
