CHINESE OFFICIALS' COMMENTS ON CURRENCY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Committee on Finance, today expressed concern over comments from Chinese officials that China may liquidate its holding of U.S. treasuries if Congress tries to force a revaluation of the Chinese currency. Grassley made the following comment on his concern and wrote to the Chinese ambassador. The text of his letter follows.  
  "These types of threats are counterproductive and dangerous. They'll only harden people's views that China is purposely manipulating its currency to gain economic advantage. But they won't stop the United States from taking steps to encourage China to float its currency as a mature economic power. The Chinese government's leaders should clarify whether these comments are official government policy."

   Dear Mr. Ambassador,
   According to an article in today's edition of the Daily Telegraph, two Chinese government representatives have recently suggested that China may use its $1.3 trillion in currency reserves as a "bargaining chip" if the United States enacts new legislation to address undervalued foreign currencies. One of the individuals, an official at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, went so far as to suggest that China might be "forced" to take steps that would "lead to a mass depreciation of the dollar."
   These types of dangerous comments illustrate why the United States is right to be concerned about China's currency practices. I would appreciate your confirmation that the comments do not reflect the official position of the Chinese government. 
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  Ranking Member.
