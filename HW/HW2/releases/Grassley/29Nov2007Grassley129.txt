SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON FORMER REP. HENRY HYDE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement on the death of former Congressman Henry Hyde. Grassley and Hyde were two of 16 Republicans who were first elected to the House of Representatives in 1974. 
   "Henry Hyde was one of the sweet 16 who were able to ride to victory in 1974 despite a bad political climate for Republicans. He immediately showed his leadership with the 'Hyde Amendment' to help protect the lives of unborn children. His intellect and wit came forward as he led two different committees during his 32 years in the House. He was a great representative for the people of his district, and he leaves an important legacy for our nation. Barbara and I send our thoughts and prayers to his family."
