BUSH SIGNS SEN. GRASSLEY'S CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS BILL INTO LAW
 Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, today made the following comment after the President signed into law the Class Action Fairness Act.  
 Grassley first held hearings in 1997 in the Judiciary Administrative Oversight and the Courts subcommittee. He then introduced the Class Action Fairness Act in 1998 with Sen. Herb Kohl, of Wisconsin.
   "The bill the President signed today is The result of hard fought compromises made over the past four Congresses. From the first time we introduced this bill in 1998, the goal was to ensure that class action lawsuits benefitted consumers, rather than the lawyers who were making millions in fees while the consumers got worthless coupons. Today's bill still has the overarching theme of protecting consumers and making the system more fair."
