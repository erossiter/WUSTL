SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF MUKASEY TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following comment after President George Bush nominated Judge Michael Mukasey to be the next Attorney General. 
   "Judge Mukasey has presided over some of the most complex cases in the United States, including several important terrorism cases, and has earned a reputation for being a skilled, fair and open-minded jurist. I expect Senate Democrats to move his nomination forward as quickly as possible. With the top job at the Justice Department sitting empty, now is not the time to play politics and delay the confirmation process. I look forward to learning more about Judge Mukasey and his views."
