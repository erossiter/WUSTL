SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS WHITE HOUSE TO APPROVE HELP FOR IOWA COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today sent a letter to President George Bush asking for prompt consideration of a request for federal assistance for Louisa and Muscatine counties after tornadoes hit both counties less than a week ago. 
   Grassley received a report from his staff who toured the Fruitland community after the tornado hit the area. One staff member was in Muscatine when the tornado hit. Grassley was not available to visit because he was attending his grandson's high school graduation.
   "Louisa and Muscatine county residents have been through devastating tornadoes and deserve all the help we can give them," Grassley said. "The president's quick approval will help them get back on their feet as early as possible."
   The law requires that federal disaster assistance first be requested by the governor. Then, Iowa's congressional delegation may ask for the request to be granted by the federal government.
   Here's a copy of Grassley's letter to Bush.
   June 7, 2007
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  President of the 
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20500 
   Dear Mr. President:
   I respectfully ask that you grant the request made today by Iowa Governor Chet Culver for a declaration of a major disaster for the State of Iowa as a result of tornados and other severe weather that affected the counties of Louisa and Muscatine in Iowa on June 1, 2007. The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed. 
   Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request.
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  United States Senator.
