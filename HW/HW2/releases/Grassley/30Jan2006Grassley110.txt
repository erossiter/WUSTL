SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON FAILED ATTEMPT TO FILIBUSTER JUDGE ALITO
 Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement after Senate voted to end a partisan filibuster on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. 
   "The unprecedented filibuster attempt by the Democrats was an unfortunate and unnecessary act that has only delayed the confirmation of an excellent nominee. Judge Alito has been a dedicated public servant who practices what he preaches - integrity, modesty, judicial restraint, and devotion to the law and the Constitution. He deserves to be confirmed.
   "The Senate has always provided its advice and consent on Supreme Court nominees with an up or down vote. The Democrats need to stop politicizing the nominations process and get to the people's business in the Senate. I look forward to the final vote on Tuesday and possibly seeing Justice Alito on Tuesday evening at the State of the Union with his colleagues on the Supreme Court."
