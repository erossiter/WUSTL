SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON IRAQ VOTE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement after the United States Senate failed to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to a resolution that expresses a sense of the Congress on the current strategy in Iraq. Grassley voted against proceeding to the bill. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "This is a rare Saturday vote. We've had only a handful of votes on Saturdays in the last 20 years. Even though I had to cancel a couple of speeches in Iowa, this is the place to be because the War on Terrorism is the most important issue facing Americans.
   "The American people deserve a full debate complete with votes on resolutions put forward by both Republicans and Democrats. Not only is it important to vote on whether we support the new direction in Iraq, but it's even more important that we vote on whether we support funding for our troops. There's no doubt that things haven't gone well in Iraq, but now is the time to show our troops in harm's way that we are standing behind them."
