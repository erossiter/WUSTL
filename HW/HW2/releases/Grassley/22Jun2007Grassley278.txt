SEN. GRASSLEY REITERATES POSITION ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley released the following statement regarding the immigration reform bill that is expected to come before the Senate next week. The Senate debated the bill in late May and early June, but the bill was pulled from the floor because it could not garner enough votes to continue debate. 
   Grassley has said that he will not vote for an immigration reform bill as long as it contains amnesty.
   "As long as amnesty remains in the bill that comes before the Senate next week, there is no question that I will vote against it. I've learned my lesson. I voted for amnesty in 1986 and I'm not about to do it again. Despite my opposition to the bill, I will be offering a number of amendments to make sure that the same mistakes aren't repeated. Iowans can be certain that I will be working on their behalf to ensure that our borders are secured and employers are held accountable for their actions."
