'JETSETA'S BILL' INCLUDED IN CHILD SEX OFFENDER LEGISLATION PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that "Jetseta's Bill" has been included in legislation that passed the Senate tonight and is expected to pass the House of Representatives next week.  
   Introduced in April 2005, the original Jetseta legislation guaranteed punishment for criminals who commit violent crimes against children. A modified version of "Jetseta's Bill" was incorporated into the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety bill that also includes legislation introduced by Sens. Orrin Hatch and Joe Biden to strengthen and reform state sex offender registries, legislation by Sen. Byron Dorgan to create a national sex offender database, and legislation by Sen. Jon Kyl to protect children from Internet predators. This comprehensive child sex offender bill is a compromise that was worked out between the House and Senate.
   "Nothing can bring back Jetseta Gage, but an important piece of legislation in her memory passed the Senate today. This bill ensures that those who commit heinous crimes against our children are appropriately punished, and that anyone thinking of committing similar crimes will think twice about the repercussions," Grassley said. "Passing this legislation will give sex offenders tougher penalties for the crimes they commit and will allow us to monitor sexual predators more closely." 
   Provisions based on the "Jetseta Gage Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act" are included throughout the Adam Walsh bill. The provisions in the new bill that refer to mandatory minimums are named the "Jetseta Gage Assured Punishment for Violent Crimes Against Children."
   Mandatory Minimums 
   The bill would guarantee punishment for criminals who commit violent crimes against children by establishing stiff mandatory minimums. The bill establishes the following mandatory minimums for offenders who commit violent crimes against children under the age of 18:
   * If the crime of violence is murder - 30 years to life;
   * If the crime of violence is kidnapping, an attempt to commit kidnapping, or maiming - 25 years to life;
   * If the crime of violence results in serious bodily injury, or if a dangerous weapon is used - 10 years to life.
   Increased Penalties
   The bill would increase the penalties for sexual offenses against children. The bill increases penalties for the following federal crimes:
   * Aggravated sexual abuse of children
   * Abusive sexual contact with children
   * Sexual abuse of children resulting in death
   * Sexual exploitation of children
   * Using misleading domain names to direct children to harmful material on the Internet
