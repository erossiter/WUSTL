SEN. GRASSLEY SCHEDULES ADDITIONAL TOWN MEETINGS DURING APRIL CONGRESSIONAL RECESS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit a total of 20 counties during the April Congressional recess held from April 2 - 6. Grassley had previously said he would visit 8 counties from April 2 - 3.
   Grassley will now be holding town hall meetings focusing on the new farm bill in Hancock, Humboldt, Kossuth, Winnebago, and Wright counties on April 5 as well as the previous town meetings scheduled in Audubon, Adair, Carroll, Cass, Crawford, Harrison, Pottawattamie and Shelby counties. 
   In Grassley's Kossuth County Town Hall Meeting he will present Melvin Faber of Burt with a Bronze Star for his heroic service in the Vietnam War. Grassley will be joined by Jason Faber, Melvin's son to present the Bronze Star.
   Grassley will also speak at the grand opening of the Freedom Fuels, LLC Biodiesel Manufacturing Plant in Mason City, the USDA Rural Development state meeting for employees hosted in Des Moines and the Pocahontas Rotary Club. He will also visit Lincare in Cherokee, Sioux Central School in Sioux Rapids, Sac City Junior/Senior High School and Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City.
   "I want to hear more about what farmers want in a new farm bill," Grassley said. "Of course, if people have questions or comments on topics other than the farm bill, I'll be happy to talk about those topics, too. I hope as many area residents as possible are able to participate in these meetings and the dialogue that's fundamental to representative government."
   Here is information about Grassley's upcoming meetings.
