SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS OF YOUNG IOWANS TO SERVICE ACADEMY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that Christopher Poulsen of Atlantic; Drew Martin of Belle Plaine; Eric Parks of Cedar Rapids (Washington High School); and Alex Volesky of Newhall (Benton Community High School) have been offered appointments to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
   "I'm very proud of these young men. They are very deserving of these appointments and will serve our country well in the Air Force. They each have exceptional academic credentials and have been active in many extra-curricular activities," Grassley said.
   Last year, Grassley nominated the young Iowans to fill vacancies for the 2007/2008 school year at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
   Grassley indicated that the highly competitive selection process makes narrowing the list of nominees a difficult task. "Iowa is full of talented young people, a number of whom are contending for the few service academy openings. It is extraordinary to see them competing at such a high level," Grassley said. "It's exciting to see that our state has such an abundance of young talent."
   Grassley praised the outstanding group of Iowa students who applied for academy nominations in past years and encouraged eligible students to consider submitting applications in the future. "U.S. military academies are an excellent option for students committed to pursuing a higher education," said Grassley.
   Grassley expects additional academy appointments to be offered this year and will issue announcements when appointments are offered.
