SEN. GRASSLEY TO VISIT ELEVEN IOWA COUNTIES DURING CONGRESSIONAL RECESS IN AUGUST
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will continue his annual tour of Iowa with visits to 11 Iowa counties during the first week of the Congressional recess. He will hold town hall meetings in Van Buren, Davis, Appanoose, Wayne, Decatur, Ringgold, Taylor, Page, Fremont, Mills, and Montgomery counties. 
   "I enjoy communicating with Iowans because representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes area residents will attend his town hall meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
   Grassley will also visit the Iowa Heart Center , an Electronic Data Systems Call Center , and the Des Moines Art Center . He will also sit in on a Lipids Class held at Mercy West Hospital in Clive . The Lipids Class provides information for diabetics or high risk patients that can help control or prevent the onset of diabetes. Medicare has recently provided coverage for these programs and Grassley was asked to attend to learn more about these group visits.
