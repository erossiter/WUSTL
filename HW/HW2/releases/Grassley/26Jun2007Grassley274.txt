SEN. GRASSLEY WELCOMES COMPROMISE ON ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCES EXTENSION
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Committee on Finance, today made the following comment on a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to extend trade preferences to Andean nations for eight months.  
   "This is a reasonable compromise. It gives us a window to enact the Peru and Colombia free trade agreements, which I support. It also extends benefits to Bolivia and Ecuador. I've been critical of extending unilateral trade preferences for Bolivia and Ecuador based on some of the actions and policies of the governments in those two countries. I'll continue to evaluate their actions and policies closely. Unilateral trade preferences should not be taken for granted."
