SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES GRANTS
  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that the Office of National Drug Control Policy is making $19 million in Drug Free Communities Support Program Funds available to approximately 150 communities NATIONWIDE. Applications are now available and will be accepted through Friday, March 21, 2008. 
   "I encourage any eligible organization to apply for this funding," Grassley said. "Drug Free Communities grants help get funding directly to the grassroots where it can help communities that need it most. These funds will help local agencies provide necessary services to help our children grow up and live in a drug free environment.
   The Drug Free Communities Support Program provides grants of up to $125,000 to community coalitions that mobilize their communities to prevent youth alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug, and inhalant abuse. The program acts as a catalyst for increased citizen participation in efforts to reduce substance use and abuse among youth and it provides drug-free community coalitions with much-needed funds to carry out their important missions.
   Grassley has long been a leader in the fight against drugs. He first sponsored the Drug Free Communities Act in 1997. He took the lead to see that the legislation was reauthorized in 2001 and again in 2006.
   In the late 1990s, Grassley launched an extensive first-of-its kind statewide initiative to address Iowa 's drug problem at the grassroots. "Face It Together," or FIT, was designed to help Iowans work together to keep their schools, workplaces and communities drug-free.
   Grassley currently serves as the Co-Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control.
