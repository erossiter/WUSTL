HOUSE VOTE ON SCHIP VETO
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance, issued the comment below about the outcome of the vote in the House of Representatives today to try to override the President's veto of compromise legislation to reauthorize the children's health insurance program. Sen. Grassley helped to write the compromise legislation, which also won the support of 17 additional Republican senators.
   "The stage is set to continue working on a bicameral, bipartisan approach that can do one of two things, either get a presidential signature or enough votes in the House of Representatives."
