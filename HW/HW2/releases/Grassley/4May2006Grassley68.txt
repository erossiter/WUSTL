SENATE PASSES 'JETSETA'S BILL' INCLUDED IN CHILD SEX OFFENDER LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that "Jetseta's Bill" passed the U.S. Senate tonight. The original legislation was introduced in April 2005 and guaranteed punishment for criminals who commit violent crimes against children.  
   The modified "Jetseta's Bill" was incorporated into a larger child sex offender bill that also includes legislation introduced by Sens. Orin Hatch and Joe Biden to strengthen and reform the State sex offender registries and legislation by Sen. Byron Dorgan to create a national sex offender database.
   The bill now must go to a conference committee to be reconciled with the House passed bill.
   "It looks like the cases of Jetseta Gage, and the many other children who have been murdered by repeat sex offenders, have opened the eyes of those who had held up this important legislation. Passing this legislation will give sex offenders tougher penalties for the crimes they commit and it will allow us to monitor them more closely," Grassley said.
   The Jetseta Gage Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act provision in the bill includes:
   Mandatory Minimums 
   The bill would guarantee punishment for criminals who commit violent crimes against children by establishing stiff mandatory minimums. The bill establishes the following mandatory minimums for offenders who commit violent crimes against children with the intent to commit a sex crime:
   * If the crime of violence results in death of a child under 12 years - 30 years to life;
   * If the crime of violence is kidnapping, or maiming, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit kidnapping or maiming, or results in serious bodily injury - 20 years to life;
   * If a dangerous weapon is used - 10 years to life;
   Increased Penalties
   The bill would increase the penalties for sexual offenses against children. The bill increases penalties for the following four federal crimes:
   * Aggravated sexual abuse of children
   * Sexual abuse of children resulting in death
   * Sexual exploitation of children
   * Using misleading domain names to direct children to harmful material on the internet.
