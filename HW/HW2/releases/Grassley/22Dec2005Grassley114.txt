MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN ENROLLMENT
  More than 21 million seniors and people with disabilities will get prescription drug coverage under Medicare's new benefit as of Jan. 1, 2006, the federal Health and Human Services Department announced today. Sen.  
 Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Committee on Finance, who helped to enact the prescription drug benefit and other Medicare improvements, made the following comment on today's announcement.
   "This is good news. It shows beneficiaries like what they see when they look at the new Medicare drug options available to them, and they're signing up. It means they won't miss out on any eligibility. They'll get the benefit the minute it goes into effect. Also, the interest in Medicare's new support for retiree drug coverage shows the effort to protect these benefits is working. No one should miss the opportunity to get coverage through Medicare's first-ever voluntary drug benefit.
   "Those who haven't signed up have until May 15, 2006, to sign up for coverage in 2006. There are a number of resources to help beneficiaries sort through their options. The State Health Insurance Information Programs that operates in Iowa has volunteers that can offer beneficiaries one-on-one counseling. Iowans can call SHIIP at 1-800-351-4664. Beneficiaries can also call 1-800-Medicare or visit the Medicare website to learn more about plans available in their area. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has worked to develop a broad network of community-based organizations nationwide that also can help beneficiaries, their families, and caregivers learn more about the benefit and make decisions. Also, the Access to Benefits Coalition - http://www.accesstobenefits.org/ - is a good resource."
