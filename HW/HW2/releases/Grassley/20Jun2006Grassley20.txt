SEN. GRASSLEY TO LAUNCH FIRST OF ITS KIND WEBCAST TOWN HALL MEETING
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that Iowans will have the first crack at his ground-breaking webcast town hall meeting. "Straight From Capitol Hill: A Grassley Webcast" will be streamlined through his website for Iowans to ask questions and voice their concerns. 
   Grassley encourages Iowans to log on to the Internet and email questions about his work in Washington. The Grassley Webcast will bring Iowans inside the daily life of the United States Senate. He hopes to tape the program from a different location each week. The program will be streamlined weekly through Grassley's website for Iowans to view.
   The Grassley Webcast opens up another avenue for Iowans to participate in the process of representative government. 
   "The right to petition your government is a First Amendment freedom - along with freedom of speech and religion - that often gets overlooked. I'm committed to making it a greater part of the lives of Iowans,"Grassley said. "This webcast builds on my town meeting in every Iowa county, every year, and my responding to every letter, email or phone call I receive from a constituent. Representative government is a two-way street. The Grassley Webcast is another way to make this process work." 
   "Straight from Capitol Hill: A Grassley Webcast" is now available on Grassley's website.
