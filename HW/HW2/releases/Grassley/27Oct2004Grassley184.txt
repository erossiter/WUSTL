SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES 'IOWA WOMEN 2000: LINKING & LEARNING'
  Calling Iowa women to come together for a one-day non-partisan, non-political motivational conference, Sen. Chuck Grassley and his wife Barbara invite women of all ages and backgrounds to attend "Iowa Women 2000: Linking & Learning," from 7:45 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., on Monday, August 21, at the Hy-Vee Conference Center, 5820 Westown Parkway, in West Des Moines.  
   "Whether working as professionals, mothers, homemakers or activists, women face a variety of challenges and choices everyday," said Grassley. "Their tireless efforts form the common thread that links women in Iowa of all ages and backgrounds to one another." 
   Working to provide Iowa women the opportunity to draw and learn from one another's experiences, the Grassleys will host for the sixth time an inspirational forum that again features locally and nationally acclaimed presenters. KCCI-TV anchor, Mollie Cooney, will serve as moderator. 
   The featured speakers include: 
   * Jean Sherman Chatzky, NBC's Today Show financial contributor and Money magazine editor-at-large, will present her insight on investing and money matters 
   * Corrine Ganske, MD, Associate Director of Iowa Lutheran Family Practice Residency Program, will speak on proper medical decision making 
   * Carol J. Uhrich, Executive Vice President and President Home Solutions of Maytag, will share her story of success and working in corporate America 
   * David Meinz, nutritionist, speaker and author of Survival of the Fittest, will offer his message on nutrition and women's health. 
   "Women who have attended our past conferences tell us that the day is an affordable, worthwhile opportunity to network with other professionals, homemakers, entrepreneurs, students and community leaders," said Grassley. "Participants at this year's conference will come away with the motivation and know-how to better invest their money, live healthier lives, make wise medical choices and find success in the workplace. The event is a great way to start off the work week and rejuvenate for fall."
