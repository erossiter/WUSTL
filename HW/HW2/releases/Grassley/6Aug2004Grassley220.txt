SEN. GRASSLEY: CLEAN DIAMOND TRADE ACT APPEARS TO BE WORKING
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Committee on Finance, worked to help pass the Clean Diamond Trade Act in 2003.  
 The bill, now law, is designed to help stop the trade of diamonds that fund violent civil conflicts in many African countries.
   The law implemented U.S. participation in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for trade in rough diamonds. The Kimberley plan is an international agreement establishing minimal acceptable international standards for national certification relating to cross-border trade in rough diamonds. Now, according to media reports, the Congo Republic intends to try to restore order in its diamond trade after being dropped from the Kimberley Process list of legitimate diamond traders. Sen. Grassley made the following comment on this development.
   "I'm pleased that the Congo Republic is pledging to take steps to help stop trade in conflict diamonds. When Congress passed the Clean Diamond Trade Act in 2003, we hoped it would help eliminate trade in illegal conflict diamonds. It's good news that the law appears to be working."
