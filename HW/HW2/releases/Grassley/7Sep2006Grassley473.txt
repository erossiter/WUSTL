SEN. GRASSLEY CONCERNED ABOUT INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IN FBI'S INVESTIGATIVE DATA WAREHOUSE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today asked the FBI to provide more information about the agencies providing resources to the Investigative Data Warehouse, the new database being used to pull together intelligence in an effort to fight terrorism. 
   Grassley's staff received a briefing several months ago on the new counterterrorism tool. He became concerned following news reports touting the new tool when it was clear during the briefing that not all agencies were sharing their intelligence information with the FBI for the databank.
   "If it's true that all of our law enforcement agencies aren't sharing information, we've got a major problem. The FBI has done very little to earn the trust of their counterparts, but it's time for everyone to set aside their differences and do what's right to protect the American people," Grassley said.
