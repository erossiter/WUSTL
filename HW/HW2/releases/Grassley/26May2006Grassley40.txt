SEN. GRASSLEY TO PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS ON INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley will discuss international security issues - including terrorism, nuclear arsenals and global health threats - with legislators from European nations at meetings this weekend and early next week in France and Germany. 
   Grassley said he will be part of a U.S. Senate delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. The Assembly was established in 1955 to create a forum for lawmakers from NATO-member nations.
   Meetings are scheduled on Saturday and Sunday in Paris, and on Monday evening, Tuesday and Wednesday in Berlin.
   In Washington, Grassley is Chairman of the Finance Committee, which is responsible for international trade legislation. He has shepherded through the Senate free-trade agreements with Morocco, Bahrain and Oman as part of an overall effort to foster greater political stability in the Middle East through economic opportunities.
