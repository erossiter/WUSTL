SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, chairman of the Committee on Finance, today made the following comment on the death of former President Gerald Ford. 
   "President Ford restored transparency to the White House. He did what he thought was right and explained his actions without spin. By showing himself as a regular guy who happened to achieve great things, he brought renewed respect to the presidency when the country really needed it. I was a freshman in Congress when he was president. During his presidency and many times afterward, whenever I talked to him, he was an all-American, regular guy."
