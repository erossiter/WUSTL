SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENT ON CENTER FOR RURAL AFFAIRS REPORT ON HOUSE FARM BILL PAYMENT LIMITS
  Senator Chuck Grassley issued the following statement about the House farm bill payment limits provisions. Grassley has worked with the Center for Rural Affairs to implement a hard cap on farm payments in the upcoming farm bill. He has introduced legislation with Senator Byron Dorgan to would set a limit of $250,000 for farm payments in an attempt to better target farm program payments to family farmers. 
   "As much as I appreciate what Chairman Peterson was trying to do in the House farm bill, the bottom line is that it isn't reform. In fact, it's a step backwards. Big farmers will continue to get bigger and young and beginning farmers will continue to be shut out. The Senate needs to step up and pass a real cap that the public has been asking for."
