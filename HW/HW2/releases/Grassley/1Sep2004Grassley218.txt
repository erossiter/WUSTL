MESKWAKI CODETALKERS GET HEARING BEFORE SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs will hold a hearing on the contributions of Native American Codetalkers in American military history.  
 The hearing will take place on Sept. 22 in Washington, D.C.
   Grassley also said that the Indian Affairs Committee will be inviting Robin Roberts, a member of the Meskwaki Tribe in Tama County, to testify during the hearing. Grassley submitted Roberts' name to provide expert testimony on the issue. Grassley said Roberts came to him several months ago concerned that the Meskwaki Codetalkers had not been awarded Congressional Gold Medals for their service to the United States during World War II. 
   "The hearing is an important step forward in awarding these brave people the Congressional Gold Medal. They were an integral part of the United States' success in World War II," Grassley said. "This is a chance for these Iowans to share the stories of the sacrifices that were made in freedom's honor."
   Grassley signed a letter in July with several other Senators asking for the hearing. He's also a co-sponsor of legislation that would authorize Congress to present gold medals to Native Americans who served as codetalkers during foreign conflicts in which the United States was involved during the 20th Century.
   In 2000, Congress voted to give Congressional Gold Medals to the original 29 Navajo Codetalkers who developed a code used in World War II. Because of the secret nature of their missions, Native American Codetalkers had not previously received public recognition for their efforts. Grassley said that it's only right to award Congressional medals to the other tribes that had codetalkers in the war effort.
