SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS BUSH TO RECONSIDER IOWA REQUEST FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today asked President George Bush to consider an appeal made by Iowa to designate a major disaster declaration for Johnson, Jones and Muscatine counties. The counties were struck by tornadoes and severe weather in April. 
   Grassley's letter follows today's request by Governor Tom Vilsack. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) originally denied Vilsack's request for disaster assistance for the tornado ravaged area. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved assistance for the area. This means that SBA loans will be available for Johnson and the contiguous counties impacted by the disaster.
   Requests for federal disaster assistance must originate from the Governor. Grassley has said that he would support any appeal made by Vilsack to the original decision made by FEMA.
   Here is a copy of Grassley's letter to Bush.
   July 7, 2006
   The Honorable George W. Bush
   President of the United States of America
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   I respectfully ask that you consider the appeal that Governor Vilsack submitted today for a Major Disaster Declaration for Johnson, Jones, and Muscatine Counties. The original declaration was requested in response to tornadoes and severe weather that struck eastern Iowa on April 13, 2006. It is my understanding that additional information has been gathered since the original request was submitted that clarifies the magnitude and severity of this disaster.
   Thank you for your prompt consideration of this appeal.
   Sincerely,
   Charles E. Grassley
  United States Senator
