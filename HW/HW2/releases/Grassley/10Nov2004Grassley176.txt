REP. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON BUSH NOMINATION OF GONZALES TO BE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Floor Statement of Senator Chuck Grassley
   "Alberto Gonzales has been an able counselor and trusted advisor to the President. The Department of Justice has its work cut out for it as America continues to fight the war on terror and as the FBI moves to prevent crime and terrorism rather than just investigate crimes after they have occurred. I look forward to hearing from Judge Gonzales about his ideas as the nomination process moves forward."
