SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON ENERGY BILL
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after the House-passed energy bill failed to garner enough votes in the Senate. Grassley voted against cloture in order to ensure the bill could be amended. 
   "Today's vote sends a clear message to the House of Representatives that there have to be changes made to the bill, such as rolling back, at least to some degree, the Democrats' limitation on the wind energy credit. Don't get me wrong, we'll get an energy bill passed. It will be one that we can all work with, not a bill that was pulled from well-intentioned negotiators and then changed before being passed in the House. There are several good aspects of the bill. For instance, the increased Renewable Fuels Standard will have a dramatic and positive impact on rural America."
