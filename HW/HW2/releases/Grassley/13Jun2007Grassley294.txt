SENS. GRASSLEY, SALAZAR INTRODUCE 25 X '25 RESOLUTION TO ENERGY BILL
  Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ken Salazar today filed their 25 x '25 resolution as an amendment to the energy bill currently being debated in the Senate. The resolution says "By 2025, America's farms, forests and ranches will provide 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United States, while continuing to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food, feed and fiber." 
   Grassley and Salazar had introduced the resolution as a stand-alone bill earlier this year.
   "The energy bill is an appropriate place to include the 25 x '25 resolution. It sets a workable goal for renewable energy production and use that we can all aim for with sensible policies and initiatives," Grassley said. 
   The 25 x '25 initiative does not prescribe a way to achieve the goal. Instead, it recognizes the benefit of implementing supportive policies and incentives to stimulate the development and use of renewable energy. 
   The initiative also identifies the benefits of technological improvements to the cost and market appeal of renewable energy. The supporters of the 25 x'25 goal commit to support sensible policies and proper incentives to work toward the goal.
