  Sen. Chuck Grassley released the following statement after learning that Mediacom and Sinclair Broadcasting reached a retransmission consent agreement that will allow KDSM in Des Moines and KGAN in Cedar Rapids to again be broadcast on the Mediacom system.
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "I'm glad Mediacom and Sinclair settled this on their own and without the heavy hand of the government. I was happy to help give them a nudge back to the negotiating table to reach an agreement so Iowans can receive the local news and important safety and educational information."
