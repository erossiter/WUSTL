SEN. GRASSLEY: MONEY FOR STORM LAKE RESTORATION PROJECT INCLUDED IN APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley said that $300,000 for the Storm Lake Restoration Project was included in the Interior Appropriations bill that passed out of committee today.  
   The Storm Lake Water Quality and Restoration Project is an ongoing effort to dredge the lake and improve the watershed to prevent silt from re-entering the lake. 
   "This is an important project that will make a great impact on the long-term viability of the lake. It's also gratifying to see the how the different partners in the community have come together to advance this project," Grassley said. 
   Grassley said that he also expects funding for Destination Park in Storm Lake to be included in the Transportation/Treasury/Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. The Destination Park project includes construction of an interpretive center that would include hands-on learning exhibits for watershed protection, prairie habitat, local animals, and alternative energy sources.
   The bill will now move for consideration by the full Senate. It will then be reconciled with the bill from the House of Representatives. Grassley said he will continue to work with Senate appropriators throughout the process to see that funding for these projects are included in the final version of the bill. The appropriations process begins each spring and is typically completed at the end of each congressional session.
   Yesterday, Grassley announced other projects included in the Interior Appropriations bill. Those can be found on his website, http://grassley.senate.gov.
