  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that numerous economic development and transportation-related projects in Iowa are slated to receive federal funding through the appropriations bill for Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (THUD), which has been finalized by a house-senate conference committee. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the conference report before it's sent to the President for his signature.
