SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES MEETING WITH NEWTON COMMUNITY LEADERS, FEDERAL AGENCIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that he has arranged a meeting between several federal government agencies and Newton community leaders to discuss federal assistance for Newton in the wake of the Maytag closures occurring over the next year.  
   The meeting will take place on September 14 at the Dew Moines Area Community College Newton campus and will give federal officials a first-hand look at the situation in the community. The meeting will begin at 9 a.m. and is expected to conclude around noon. 
   "This meeting will allow the federal representatives to hear directly from local leaders on the challenges facing the community. It will also give Newton officials a greater opportunity to collaborate with and receive information on the resources and assistance available to the community from the federal government," Grassley said.
   Earlier this summer, Grassley arranged for Newton Mayor Chaz Allen to meet with Department of Labor Assistant Secretary Emily Stover DeRocco in Washington, D.C. During the meeting, the Assistant Secretary agreed to travel to Newton with other government officials and meet with Newton community leaders. 
   Grassley said that along with Assistant Secretary DeRocco, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary for Rural Development Tom Dorr, and representatives from the Economic Development Administration, Small Business Administration, and Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families will be participating in a round table discussion with community leaders.
