SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON AMENDMENT TO STRIKE AMNESTY PROVISIONS FROM IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted against an amendment to strike Title VI of the immigration reform bill. Title VI allows for amnesty of more than 12 million illegal aliens in the United States. 
   "The immigration reform bill gives more than 12 million lawbreakers a walk in the park toward citizenship. Today we had a chance to eliminate the amnesty, and ensure that illegality is not rewarded. Unfortunately a majority of the Senate voted against the provision. I'll keep working to make this a better bill, although there's only so much repair that can be done with amnesty. Iowans can count on this Senator to learn from my mistake in 1986 when we voted to give amnesty to the illegal aliens already in the U.S."
