SEN. GRASSLEY HONORED FOR HIS WORK IN HEALTHCARE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley has received the 2006 American Association of Nurse Anesthetists 2006 National Healthcare Policy Leadership Award. 
   Grassley received the award on behalf of his advocacy for rural healthcare, promotion of a strong Medicare program, and help in promoting a "seat at the table" for the nurse anesthesia profession in the debate over value-based purchasing in healthcare.
   As chairman of the Senate Finance committee Grassley was a leader during budget reconciliation and on a specific provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) which halted a scheduled cut to physician and non-physician payments in 2006. 
   Grassley received this award with an address to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists national healthcare advocacy conference on Tuesday, April 25, 2006.
