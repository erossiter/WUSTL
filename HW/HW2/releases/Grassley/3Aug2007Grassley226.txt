SEN. GRASSLEY WORKS TO PROTECT KIDS FROM DRUGS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today called on Congress to respond to alarming reports of drug dealers marketing dangerous illegal drugs to kids at an increasingly younger age.  
   "Young people are the most at-risk population for drug abuse, so it's disturbing to see highly addictive drugs like meth, heroin, prescription pain killers, antidepressants, and steroids marketed and distributed in new ways to get a greater number of school-age children addicted," Grassley said in a speech before the United States Senate. "We need to stop those growing trends. Research shows that if you can keep a child drug-free until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted."
