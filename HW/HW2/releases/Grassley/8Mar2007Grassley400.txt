SEN. GRASSLEY PRESENTS SCHOLARSHIPS TO IOWA STUDENTS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley yesterday presented scholarships to Jared Greiner, of Council Bluffs a student at Treynor High School, and Joshua Lipman, a student at Iowa City West High School for being selected as student delegates to the United States Senate Youth Program. 
   Grassley presented both Greiner and Lipman with a scholarship certificate of $5,000 at the Senate Reception on Capitol Hill, March 7. The students were selected by the Iowa Department of Education for their academic achievements and their leadership capabilities.
   "I enjoy meeting with students from Iowa. It is encouraging to see such bright young people representing our state," Grassley said. "This scholarship has a strong reputation for honoring our nation's future leaders."
   The program was established in 1962 by a U.S. Senate Resolution to promote government awareness among students. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation runs the program and sponsors two students from each state, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity to spend one week in Washington D.C. to experience government in action. The participants hear major policy addresses by senators, cabinet members, officials for the Departments of State and Defense and directors of other federal agencies. They will also meet with a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
