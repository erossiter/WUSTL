SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON FDA ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANTI-ANEMIA DRUGS
  Senator Chuck Grassley issued the comment below about recommendations made today by a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee regarding prescription drugs used to combat anemia in cancer and kidney patients. 
   Last year, Senator Grassley called on the manufacturers of these drugs to provide complete information to the FDA about company studies on the effects of the drugs. Today, the FDA advisory committee recommended restrictions on the use of these drugs for certain cancer types and some form of patient consent.
   "FDA officials need to make a timely decision on these recommendations, as patients and doctors rely on the FDA's guidance on safety in making decisions about treatment. The concerns in this case - that drugs to fight anemia after chemotherapy might actually make some cancers and tumors grow -are as upsetting as they come. The drug-safety system ought to respond in an upfront way that puts science and patient safety first."
