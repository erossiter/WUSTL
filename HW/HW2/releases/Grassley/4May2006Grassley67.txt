  GRASSLEY COMMENTS AFTER MEETING WITH POSTMASTER GENERAL ABOUT SIOUX CITY MAIL SORTING FACILITY 
   Sen. Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after meeting with the United States Postmaster General about the situation facing the Sioux City Mail Sorting Facility.
   "We had a positive and productive meeting with the Postmaster General, which left me cautiously optimistic. I explained how disappointed we were that the Postal Service did not fulfill its promises from the last meeting and we expect things to be different this time around. He did show a greater understanding of the community's concerns and a willingness to finally work in partnership with Siouxland leaders to resolve concerns about possible degradation of service."
