SEN. GRASSLEY DELIVERS GOOD NEWS: NORTHWEST AIRLINES TO SERVE DUBUQUE AIRPORT
  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced to a group of Dubuque area representatives who were in Washington, DC that Northwest Airlines would begin service at the Dubuque Regional Airport starting June 20. Tickets will be available for purchase beginning February 16. 
   "This is great news for the Dubuque area. They have been working hard to make their case for additional service in and out of their airport and it looks like their extra effort has paid off," Grassley said. "I appreciate Northwest's commitment to Iowa. This service will be a big boost to the Dubuque area for business and recreational travelers."
   Grassley said that Northwest discontinued service to Dubuque after the downturn in air travel following the events on September 11. Since then, he has urged them to reconsider the city as they continued to expand into new communities.
   According to Northwest Airlines, the 34-seat aircraft used in the Dubuque flights will be operated by Mesaba Airlines as Northwest Airlink.
   The daily flight times are as follows:
   Leaves Minneapolis at 1:45 p.m. - Arrives in Dubuque at 2:50 p.m.
   Leaves Minneapolis at 9:15 p.m. - Arrives in Dubuque at 10:39 p.m.
   Leaves Dubuque at 6:50 a.m. - Arrives in Minneapolis at 8:12 a.m. (this flight does not begin until June 21)
   Leaves Dubuque at 3:10 p.m. - Arrives in Minneapolis at 4:12 p.m.
   Dubuque Mayor Roy Buol was at the announcement today and said, "Transportation infrastructure, including increased air connectivity, is essential to our growing economy and the return of Northwest Airlines to Dubuque is truly great news for our many business, leisure and convention travelers and to support our growing tourist base."
