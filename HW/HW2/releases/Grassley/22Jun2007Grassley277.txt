SEN. GRASSLEY TO ATTEND IOWA CORN INDY 250
  Sen. Chuck Grassley this weekend will continue his efforts to promote renewable energy at the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at the Iowa Speedway in Newton. The event will highlight the importance of ethanol and the increased use of the fuel. 
   Grassley has been one of the strongest advocates for ethanol. As Bob Dinneen, President of the Renewable Fuels Association, recently wrote to Grassley that he "was ethanol before ethanol was cool." Click here to see a copy of the letter from Dinneen.
   On Sunday, Grassley will participate in several activities. Here is a copy of his expected schedule.
   9 a.m. Press conference
   9:35 a.m. Tour facilities
   10 a.m. visit with Iowa Corn Growers, Ethanol Promotion and Information Council, Iowa Farm Bureau
   11 a.m. Pre-Race Activities at Center Stage
   12:25 p.m. Race begins
   Grassley recently helped advance pro-ethanol initiatives through the Senate Finance Committee. Grassley, as the ranking Republican on the Committee, shaped the renewable energy tax incentives in the legislation. The legislation builds on the 2005 tax package that Grassley wrote as chairman of the committee and would help further promote the development of clean, renewable fuels like ethanol. The package of tax incentives did not pass the full Senate, but Grassley said it could be included in the final bill.
   Grassley also successfully led the efforts to defeat anti-ethanol amendments during debate on the energy bill. He also has continued his pursuit of Big Oil and their apparent obstruction to installing E-85 refueling pumps. Grassley recently wrote letters to the four major oil companies questioning their alternative fuel policies.
