SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON SIGNING OF ADAM WALSH CHILD PROTECTION, SAFETY BILL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today released the following comment after President George Bush signed into law a bill that includes a modified version of "Jetseta's bill." Grassley introduced "Jetseta's bill" in honor of Jetseta Gage, a young girl from Iowa who was abducted, raped, and murdered by a repeat sex offender. 
   Introduced in April 2005, the original Jetseta legislation guaranteed punishment for criminals who commit violent crimes against children. A modified version of "Jetseta's Bill" was incorporated into the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety bill that also includes legislation introduced by Sens. Orrin Hatch and Joe Biden to strengthen and reform state sex offender registries, legislation by Sen. Byron Dorgan to create a national sex offender database, and legislation by Sen. Jon Kyl to protect children from Internet predators. This comprehensive child sex offender bill is a compromise that was worked out between the House and Senate.
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "Of course we're very sorrowful for Jetseta's death. Unfortunately, nothing Congress can do will bring her back. But we can do everything possible to discourage sexual predators and to save the lives of other young people. This federal legislation will enhance the criminal penalties on sexual predators with the idea that we discourage them in the future from committing the same acts to another child."
