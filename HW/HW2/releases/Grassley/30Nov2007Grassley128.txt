CHUCK LARSON NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR TO LATVIA
  Senator Chuck Grassley released the following comment after President George Bush announced his intent to nominate Iowan Chuck Larson, Jr. to be Ambassador to Latvia.
   "Chuck Larson has served Iowa as a state senator and served our country as a member of the National Guard in Iraq. He's now been called to serve again as Ambassador to Latvia. I'm confident that Chuck will represent Iowa and the United States well and excel in this position just as he has throughout his career. I hope the Senate moves quickly to confirm his nomination."
