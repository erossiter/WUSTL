SEN. GRASSLEY: $50,000 FOR CLERMONT HISTORICAL LANDMARK
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said the Department of the Interior, National Park Services has awarded a $50,000 grant to the State Historical Society of Iowa. The funds are through the Save America's Treasures grant program and will help preserve an 1896 Kimball Pipe Organ in Clermont.  
   The Kimball Pipe Organ, located in the 1858 Union Sunday School, is the oldest and largest of its kind. The organ and the Union Sunday School were placed on the National Historic Register in 1974. 
   Grassley wrote a letter to the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Organ Preservation Ad Hoc Committee of the Clermont Historical Preservation Commission, a group representing the organ.
