SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON FORMATION OF BIPARTISAN COMMISSION TO EXAMINE MILITARY, VETERANS' HEALTH CARE IN U.S.
  Sen. Chuck Grassley released the following statement on the situation at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the President's announcement today on the formation of a bipartisan commission to examine military and veterans' health care in the United States. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "Our soldiers deserve the best possible care, and it's inexcusable to hear of the bureaucracy and terrible living conditions many have been subjected to. The Commission announced today by President Bush is a good step in getting at the serious management problems at Walter Reed and making sure conditions meet high standards at other Department of Defense and VA medical facilities. More immediately, Secretary Gates has taken the bull by the horns, as he should, and is holding people accountable to get to the bottom of the situation."
