SEN. GRASSLEY SCHEDULES TOWN MEETINGS DURING FEBRUARY CONGRESSIONAL RECESS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit a total of 27 counties during the February Congressional recess held from February 19-23 and 26. Grassley had previously said he would visit 23 counties from February 19-23.
   Grassley will now be holding town meetings in Benton, Poweshiek and Tama counties on February 26 as well as the previous town meetings scheduled in Butler, Chickasaw, Clarke, Dallas, Delaware, Dubuque, Franklin, Floyd, Lucas, Madison, Monroe, Story, Warren, and Union counties and are open to the public. 
   Grassley will also attend Rotary Club meetings in Bellevue, Boone, Cedar Rapids, Clear Lake, and Pella; tour businesses in Monticello and Stuart; and visit schools in Marshalltown and Williamsburg; and tour a drug rehabilitation center in Colfax.
   "The communication with Iowans that these visits provide is what helps me make decisions back in Washington, DC," Grassley said. "I take the common sense input I receive and put it to good us in our nation's capital."
   Grassley said that he hopes area residents will attend his town hall meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
   Here is information about Grassley's county visits.
