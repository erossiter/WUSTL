SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION CLOTURE VOTE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley made the following statement after an attempt to stop consideration of additional amendments to the immigration reform bill was thwarted. A vote on cloture, a procedural maneuver to end debate, was not agreed to. Grassley expects several of his amendments to be considered before the end of the debate. 
   Here is Grassley's comment.
   "Today's cloture vote was ill conceived and should never have been brought forward in the first place. To end debate after only two weeks on one of the most important domestic policy issues we'll consider, especially after the majority bypassed the committees of jurisdiction, speaks volumes as to the problems with this bill. There are a lot of good amendments that have been introduced and members deserve to have them considered."
