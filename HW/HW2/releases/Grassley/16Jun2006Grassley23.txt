SEN. GRASSLEY TO HOST U.N. DELEGATION IN IOWA
  Sen. Chuck Grassley will host a group of foreign Ambassadors to the United Nations (U.N.) for a short visit to Iowa. U.N. Ambassadors from Colombia, Honduras, Hungary and Mali will participate in the tour. 
   "This short visit will only give our guests from the United Nations a taste of the people and places we have in Iowa, but I hope even in the limited time they have, they'll see the innovation and technology found throughout the state," Grassley said. "I'm glad they chose to visit Iowa."
   Grassley has been leading foreign delegations to Iowa since 1986. Every other year, Grassley has invited each country with an embassy located in Washington, D.C. to send to Iowa their ambassador and spouse to travel an area of the state and visit businesses, farms and the Iowa State Fair. Last year, 74 countries were represented on Grassley's Ambassadors Tour.
   The success of Grassley's Ambassadors Tour led the office of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to contact his staff about a possible trip to Iowa for several of the U.N. ambassadors. 
   Because of the Senate schedule, Grassley will only be traveling with the delegation on Sunday evening.
   Here is a schedule of visits for the delegation.
