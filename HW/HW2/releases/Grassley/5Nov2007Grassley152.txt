SEN. GRASSLEY: JOSHUA OMVIG BILL SIGNED INTO LAW
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following statement after President George Bush signed into law the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Bill. The law is named for Joshua Omvig, an Iowa soldier who committed suicide upon returning from serving in Iraq.
   "Today's action helps give veterans who are suffering mental anguish a place to turn when all else seems lost. These are brave men and women who need to know that there is help out there and they deserve medical treatment just like any other veteran."
