SEN. GRASSLEY SCHEDULES ADDITIONAL TOWN MEETINGS DURING FEBRUARY CONGRESSIONAL RECESS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit an additional 10 counties during the February Congressional recess on February 22 and 23. Earlier this week, Grassley said he would visit 13 counties on February 19-21. 
   Town meetings are planned for Butler, Franklin, Floyd, Chickasaw, Dubuque, and Delaware counties and are open to the public. 
   Grassley will also attend Rotary Club meetings in Clear Lake, Cedar Rapids and Bellevue. He'll also tour a business in Monticello. 
   On February 19-21, Grassley will make visits to Boone, Clarke, Dallas, Guthrie, Jasper, Lucas, Madison, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Polk, Story, Warren and Union Counties.
   "I enjoy communicating with Iowans because representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about. I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents," Grassley said. 
   Grassley said that he hopes area residents will attend his town hall meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject. 
   Here is information about Grassley's county visits.
