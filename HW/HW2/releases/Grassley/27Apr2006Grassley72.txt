SEN. GRASSLEY, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SENSENBRENNER INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO CREATE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN JUDICIAL BRANCH
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today introduced legislation in the Senate to create an Inspector General for the Judicial Branch. Companion legislation was introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. 
   Grassley said an independent watchdog for the federal Judiciary is an important way to promote credibility within the Judicial Branch of government. 
   "Press accounts and Government Accountability Office reports indicate the federal Judiciary's self policing is not up to snuff. An Inspector General is just the right medicine the federal Judiciary needs to ensure it is complying with its own ethical guidelines and to root out potential waste, fraud and abuse in the system," Grassley said. "Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and an IG can only help shed more light on the actions of our Judicial Branch of Government and keep it accountable to the American people."
