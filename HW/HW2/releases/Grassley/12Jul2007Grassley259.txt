SEN. GRASSLEY TO WELCOME FOREIGN DIPLOMATS TO IOWA
  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that he is once again bringing foreign diplomats to Iowa for his biennial "Ambassadors Tour" from August 13 - 17. It's expected that more than 60 countries will be represented on the tour this year.
   Every other year Grassley invites each country with an embassy located in Washington, D.C. to send to Iowa their ambassador and spouse. If the ambassador is unable to participate, the embassy has the option of sending another designee. The participants travel through a portion of the state to learn more about Iowa's businesses, agriculture, education and culture. 
    "This is a great opportunity for Iowa to showcase its people, businesses and education system to diplomats from around the world," Grassley said. "We give our guests an opportunity to explore America's heartland so that they can take their experience back to their home country and share all of the good things Iowa has to offer."
   Grassley will lead the foreign diplomats through the communities of Johnston, Pella, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mount Pleasant, Keokuk, Fort Madison, Burlington, Muscatine, Kalona, Mitchellville, Des Moines and Indianola.
   Grassley said that during the week the diplomats will stay in the houses of Iowans at the over-night stops in the Pella, Mount Pleasant, and Muscatine. "The people of Iowa never fail to amaze me with their generosity. Our guests from around the world see first-hand why Iowans are the greatest asset our state has," he said.
   Grassley began his effort in 1986 during the farm crisis. Fostering good relations with new and existing trading partners is an integral part of Grassley's work as the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade issues.
   Tour events are completely funded by private, individual and corporate sponsors. Grassley also works with the Iowa Department of Economic Development to maximize the benefits of the trade tour of Iowa.
