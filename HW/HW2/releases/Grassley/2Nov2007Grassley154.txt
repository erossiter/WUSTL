SEN. GRASSLEY: FEDERAL GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY, CULTURE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) will be granting funds to African-American museums across the country. This grant program increases the institutional capacity and sustainability in the nation's African American museums by building the knowledge, skills, and abilities of staff members and volunteers. 
   "African-American museums are important in preserving the heritage and increasing the knowledge of the history of African-American culture," Grassley said.
   The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation's 122,000 libraries and 17,500 museums. The Institute works at the national level and in coordination with state and local organizations to sustain heritage, culture, and knowledge; enhance learning and innovation; and support professional development.
   The guidelines and applications are available at www.imls.gov. The postmark deadline for sending applications to IMLS is January 15, 2008.
