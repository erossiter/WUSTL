PROVISION IN SENATE-PASSED LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW SPENCER PROJECT TO PROCEED
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that legislation passed by the Senate would allow Spencer to move forward on the U.S. 71 bypass project. 
   The federal transportation bill that was signed into law in 2005 included $5 million for U.S. 71 Bypass for Spencer. Because of technicalities, Spencer was not able to proceed on the project. The bill that passed the Senate yesterday officially changed the name of the project to "West Spencer Beltway Project," which allows Spencer to receive the funds and move to construction.
   "This was an important project for Spencer back in 2005. These changes will now give them the opportunity to get these improvements made," Grassley said.
   The bill must now be reconciled with a version passed by the House of Representatives before being sent to the President.
