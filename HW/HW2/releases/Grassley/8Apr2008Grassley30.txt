SEN. GRASSLEY CALL-IN TV SHOW TO AIR LIVE ON APRIL 16
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that his monthly call-in show will air live on Wednesday, April 16, from 6:30-7:00 p.m. (Central Time) on television stations across Iowa. 
   "Ask Your Senator" is broadcast from Washington, DC, and can be seen live in communities served by Mediacom throughout Iowa. The show also airs live in Spencer.
   The show is also streamlined over the Internet so that Iowans without cable access can view and participate in the program through Grassley's website using Real Player.
   "I hope Iowans will tune in and participate in my cable show so we can engage in the type of conversation that makes our process of representative government work," Grassley said.
   Grassley said that it's important to hear from constituents to answer any questions or address any concerns they may have.
   * Iowans can ask questions during the show by calling toll-free 800/736-8255.
   * Questions also can be e-mailed in advance to askyoursenator@grassley.senate.gov
   * To access the program on-line, Iowans with access to an Internet-ready computer and Real Player should go to http://grassley.senate.gov, scroll down to "What's New" and click the link to start the show.
   Grassley also provides taped versions of the show to local cable access channels that aren't able to air the program live. To receive a copy of the program, local cable access providers should contact Grassley's office.
