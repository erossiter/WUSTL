SEN. GRASSLEY CONTINUES MEETINGS IN EVERY IOWA COUNTY
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that that he will be meeting with Iowans in 17 counties the week of February 18. The Senate will not be in session that week for the President's Day congressional recess.
    "These constituent meetings help generate an exchange of ideas that is necessary for representative government," Grassley said. "Holding a meeting in each of our 99 counties gives me the opportunity to have an open and honest dialogue with Iowans. Representative government is a two-way street and I hope people will come out, talk to me and be a part of the conversation." 
   Grassley's meetings will take him to the counties of Adair, Appanoose, Boone, Clarke, Dallas, Greene, Hamilton, Hardin, Jasper, Lucas, Madison, Marion, Monroe, Poweshiek, Story, Warren and Wayne.
   Grassley will hold town hall meetings in Eldora and Knoxville. He will tour businesses and meet with employees at Gates Corporation in Boone; Springboard Engineering in Newton; and Simco Drilling Equipment in Osceola. He will meet with students at Ames High School; Chariton Community High School; Wayne Jr./Sr. High School in Corydon; Albia Community High School; Waukee High School; and Adair-Casey Jr./Sr. High School. He will also speak with the Jefferson Rotary; the Main Street Webster City Kiwanis; the Grinnell Kiwanis; the Centerville Rotary; the Indianola Kiwanis; and the Winterset Rotary.
