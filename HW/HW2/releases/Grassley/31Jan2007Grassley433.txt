SEN. GRASSLEY, REP. SENSENBRENNER SEE NEED FOR INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR JUDICIARY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) today re-introduced legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives to create an Inspector General for the Judicial Branch.
   The Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act of 2007 is nearly identical to a bill that passed the House Judiciary Committee last September. The bills introduced today include language adopted by the House Judiciary Committee to address concerns raised during a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing. The only difference between the Senate and House bills is that the House bill covers only the federal district and appellate courts while the Senate bill also allows the Inspector General to investigate alleged misconduct within the Supreme Court. 
   Grassley and Sensenbrenner said an independent watchdog for the federal Judiciary is an important way to promote credibility within the judicial branch of government, especially in light of the Breyer Committee Report which highlighted problems with the way the federal judiciary has handled complaints about judicial ethics and misconduct.
   "It's been shown through press accounts and various reports that the federal judiciary is in need of some sunshine. An Inspector General can only help shed more light on the actions of the Judicial Branch and keep it accountable to the American people," Grassley said. "An Inspector General can help root out potential waste, fraud and abuse, which to me seems very positive for the federal judiciary."
   "The creation of an Inspector General is not a radical idea," said Sensenbrenner. "Inspectors General exist in over 60 Executive agencies, boards and commissions, and in Congress as well. They shine a light on the internal operations of these entities in order to prevent fraud and improve efficiency and accountability. There is no reason why the Judicial Branch should be exempt from this type of oversight."
   "In recent years, there have been numerous disturbing reports that Federal judges have violated ethical rules, including disclosure and recusal requirements for conflicts of interest, or engaged in judicial misconduct," Sensenbrenner continued. "These violations threaten a foundation of our judicial system: an unbiased, impartial arbiter. An IG will bolster this foundation by ensuring better compliance."
   Grassley is a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Sensenbrenner is the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
