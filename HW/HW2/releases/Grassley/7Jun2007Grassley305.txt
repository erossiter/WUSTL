IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL PULLED FROM SENATE FLOOR
  Sen. Chuck Grassley released the following statement after the immigration reform bill was pulled from the Senate floor.
   "I'm disappointed I didn't have the opportunity to bring up several of my amendments that I believe would have made this a better bill. The process in which the majority brought the bill forward skirted the democratic process. It's no wonder cloture votes failed three times today. In the end though, with amnesty as part of the underlying legislation, I just couldn't support it."
