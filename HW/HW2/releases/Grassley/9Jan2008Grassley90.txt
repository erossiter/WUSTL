  Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that Danielle Hoksins of Baxter and Lindsey Van Beek of Inwood have been selected to participate in the 46th Annual United States Senate Youth Program. Hoskins and Van Beek will receive $5,000 scholarships and will serve as delegates for the program's Washington Week being held March 1-8, 2008. 
   "Danielle and Lindsey are a testament to Iowa 's top notch education system, and I am glad they are being rewarded for their hard work and leadership." Grassley said. "With this program, they will be provided with a once in lifetime opportunity to view the federal legislative process firsthand."
   The United States Senate Youth Program began in 1962 with the mission of providing insight into the workings of the government for high school juniors and seniors. Two students from each state are selected to participate in the week-long educational program focusing on the three branches of government. Selected students also receive a $5,000 college scholarship with encouragement to continue coursework in government, history and public affairs.
