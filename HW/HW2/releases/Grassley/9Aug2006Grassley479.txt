SEN. GRASSLEY CONTINUES VISITS TO IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will continue his annual tour of Iowa with visits to 24 counties during the August congressional recess.
   Town meetings are planned for Allamakee, Audubon, Carroll, Clay, Clayton, Crawford, Dickenson, Emmet, Harrison, Howard, Iowa, Keokuk, Kossuth, Lyon, Monona, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Shelby, and Sioux Counties and are open to the public. He will also attend events and visit businesses in Crawford, Harrison, Mahaska and Mitchell Counties.  
   Senator Grassley will also host his bi-annual Women's Conference in West Des Moines, attend a groundbreaking event for Absolute Energy LLC in St. Ansgar, visit the Museum of Religious Arts in Logan, and meet with Communities for Literate Iowa Kids in Denison.
   "Representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "My annual meeting with county residents allows me to share with Iowans what I'm doing in Washington and hear their views on issues that are important to them. I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes many area residents will attend his meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
