SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON SENATE FARM BILL COUNTER-OFFER
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following comment after the Senate members of the farm bill conference committee made a counter-offer to the House of Representatives. The offer contained a tax package that included several priorities of Grassley's, including tax incentives for young and beginning farmers and relief from the self-employment tax on CRP payments for the disabled and retired. 
   "The Senate put forth a well-balanced package to the House that includes priorities like nutrition, conservation, energy and tax relief. Senator Baucus and I put together a package of off-sets that are workable solutions to paying for important provisions wanted by both the House and the Senate. Only time will tell if the House really wants a farm bill and will work with us to enact good legislation."
