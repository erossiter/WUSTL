SENS. GRASSLEY, SALAZAR INTRODUCE RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING NEED FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY
  Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ken Salazar today introduced a Senate resolution that says "By 2025, America's farms, forests and ranches will provide 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United States, while continuing to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food, feed and fiber." 
   "Unfortunately 'abracadabra' won't solve our energy problems, which is why the 25 x '25 initiative is so important," Grassley said. "This initiative sets a goal that we all can work toward with sensible policies and incentives."
   The 25 x '25 initiative does not prescribe a way to achieve the goal. Instead, it recognizes the benefit of implementing supportive policies and incentives to stimulate the development and use of renewable energy. 
   The initiative also identifies the benefits of technological improvements to the cost and market appeal of renewable energy. The supporters of the 25 x'25 goal commit to support sensible policies and proper incentives to work toward the goal. 
   Grassley and Salazar also introduced the resolution in the 109th Congress.
