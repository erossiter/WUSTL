SEN. GRASSLEY REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT DRUG USE IN AMERICA
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that legislation he co-sponsored to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been approved by the Judiciary Committee. The legislation that will now be seen by the full Senate was originally introduced in 2003 by Sens. Chuck Grassley, Joe Biden of Delaware and Orrin Hatch of Utah. 
   "We expect the federal government to play a leading role in confronting the drug problem found in our country," Grassley said. "The legislation will help improve the coordination of the federal efforts against drug use."
   The legislation states that ONDCP has a responsibility to ensure that Federal prevention, law enforcement, treatment, and interdiction initiatives cover the full spectrum of opportunities available that will stop the drug problem. It will also give the ONDCP responsibility for the execution and effectiveness of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, or HIDTA program.
   Grassley has been highly critical of ONDCP in recent months. Despite his criticism, the Iowa Senator believes ONDCP plays an important role in fighting the drug problem in our country.
