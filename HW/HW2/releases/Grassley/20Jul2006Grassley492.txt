SEN. GRASSLEY RECEIVES AWARD FOR HIS WORK WITH DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Grassley received the 340B Coalition 10th Anniversary Achievement Award for his leadership and support of the drug discount program in the Public Health Service Act.  
   The 340B Coalition represents federally qualified safety-net providers that participate in a drug discount program established under section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. The Coalition was created to aide providers with compliance of the program while working with the Federal Government to improve implementation of the program. 
   As chairman of the Senate Finance committee Grassley has worked diligently with safety-net providers to reduce wasteful spending, close loopholes and pay health care providers accurately. He also was instrumental in including a provision to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that saves money in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Deficit Reduction Act limits the receipt of nominal price drugs for purposes of the Medicaid drug rebate to 340B entities thereby preserving the integrity of the system and its safety net providers.
   Mikki Stier and Mark Hall, representatives of Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, along with Jonni McCrann of the Public Hospital Pharmacy Coalition presented Grassley with the award.
