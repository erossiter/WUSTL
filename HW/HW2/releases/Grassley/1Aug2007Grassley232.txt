SEN. GRASSLEY'S AMBASSADORS TOUR TO EMBARK ON WEEK OF VISITS TO IOWA COMMUNITIES
  Senator Chuck Grassley today reminded Iowans that in less than two weeks he will bring foreign diplomats from 63 countries to Iowa for his biennial "Ambassadors Tour." The tour runs from August 13 - 17. The visits will focus on Southeast and South Central Iowa and will conclude with a visit to the Iowa State Fair.
    "Our visits to communities throughout Iowa give diplomats from around the world an opportunity to see first hand the possibilities in our state. We'll showcase our top-notch educational institutions, innovative businesses and friendly people," Grassley said. 
   Grassley began the tour during the farm crisis in 1986. Since then, he has invited each country with an embassy located in Washington, D.C. to send to Iowa their ambassador and spouse on the biannual tour. If the ambassador is unable to participate, the embassy has the option of sending another designee. The participants travel through a portion of the state to learn more about Iowa's businesses, agriculture, education and culture.
   Grassley will lead the foreign diplomats through the communities of Johnston, Pella, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mount Pleasant, Keokuk, Fort Madison, Burlington, Muscatine, Kalona, Mitchellville, Des Moines and Indianola.
   Grassley said that during the week the diplomats will stay in the houses of Iowans at the over-night stops in Pella, Mount Pleasant, and Muscatine. "The people of Iowa never fail to amaze me with their generosity. Our guests from around the world see first-hand why Iowans are the greatest asset our state has," he said.
   Fostering good relations with new and existing trading partners is an integral part of Grassley's work as the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade issues.
   Tour events are completely funded by private, individual and corporate sponsors. Grassley also works with the Iowa Department of Economic Development to maximize the benefits of the trade tour of Iowa.
