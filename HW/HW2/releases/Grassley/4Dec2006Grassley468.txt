SEN. GRASSLEY ANNOUNCES NOMINATIONS OF YOUNG IOWANS TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that he has nominated several young Iowans to the United States Service Academies.  
   "Every year we see a high caliber of young men and women from Iowa who are interested in our service academies," Grassley said. "These young people are high achieving Iowans who will represent our state well. They've worked hard to get to this point and I'm honored to nominate them."
   According to Grassley, the highly competitive selection process makes it difficult to narrow the list of nominees each year. Grassley nominates several young Iowans each year for a select few spots. Each academy then selects students based on the number of vacancies for the 2006-2007 school year. Often, because of the high quality of nominations from Iowa, several students are selected to attend each academy.
   Grassley praised the outstanding group of Iowa students who applied for academy nominations in past years and encouraged eligible students to consider submitting applications in the future. "U.S. military academies are an excellent option for students committed to pursuing a higher education," said Grassley.
   Grassley will issue announcements when appointments to the academies are offered.
