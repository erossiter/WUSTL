SEN. GRASSLEY: 32 IOWA COUNTIES ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER AID AFTER APRIL FREEZE
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has designated 32 Iowa counties as disaster areas after the late spring freeze from April 4 - April 10. Farm operators in each county are eligible to apply for loans. 
   "As a farmer I understand the frustration of unpredictable weather," Grassley said. "I encourage all affected farmers to apply for these loans to help alleviate some of your production loss."
   Farm operators in the following counties are eligible to be considered for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency.
   Audubon, Crawford, Fremont, Harrison, Monona, Polk, Pottawattamie and Tama counties are considered to be primary natural disaster areas.
   Adair, Benton, Black Hawk, Boone, Carroll, Cass, Dallas, Grundy, Guthrie, Ida, Iowa, Jasper, Madison, Marion, Marshall, Mills, Montgomery, Page, Poweshiek, Sac, Shelby, Story, Warren and Woodbury counties are considered to be contiguous disaster counties.
   Iowans can contact their local FSA offices for information about the loan applications.
