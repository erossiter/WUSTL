SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON TROOP WITHDRAWAL AMENDMENT
  Senator Chuck Grassley today made the following comment after an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would mandate a withdrawal of troops in Iraq failed. 
   "The withdrawal deadline in the amendment failed to recognize the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including a likely failed state, chaos, and the bolstering of al-Qaeda - which would be a direct threat to our homeland. It also signals to the insurgents, al-Qaeda, and our enemies in Iraq our military gameplan. We all agree that we need to bring our soldiers home as quickly as possible, but it must be done in a responsible way that gives our troops every opportunity to succeed. 
   "Earlier this year, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed General Petraeus to carry out a new plan in Iraq. The Senate then followed up by funding that plan. General Petraeus committed to provide to the Senate an unvarnished assessment in September. I think we owe it to him and our troops in the field to listen to that assessment, and then make the necessary changes to our strategy."
