SEN. GRASSLEY ASKS FOR OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON USDA OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS
  Senator Chuck Grassley today asked for an oversight hearing on the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Agriculture. Grassley's request was sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   "Because this is such an infant office, it's important Congress do proper oversight. While it's not clear if actual discrimination is occurring, I want to know exactly if the claims I've heard are accurate," Grassley said. "Congress must watch this office closely to be sure that the rights of minorities are best served, especially since USDA has had less than stellar results in this area." 
   The Office of Civil Rights was created in March 2003 to provide overall leadership and coordination of all civil rights programs across the Department of Agriculture. Several years ago Grassley worked to ensure the Office of Civil Rights was given the resources, autonomy, and authority by USDA to adequately help underserved farmers and disadvantage employees. Grassley has recently heard problems about how the Office tracks, processes, and remedies complaints brought against both the USDA, and its own office.
