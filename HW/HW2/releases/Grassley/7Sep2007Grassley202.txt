SEN. GRASSLEY SPEAKS AT NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH KICK-OFF
  Sen. Chuck Grassley yesterday spoke at the kick-off of the 18th annual celebration of Recovery Month. This kick-off also recognized Grassley's continued support for addictions treatment and recovery services. 
   The event, hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors, promotes the benefits of addiction treatment and the message that recovery from substance abuse is possible. Recovery Month also recognizes the efforts of treatment, prevention, and community support providers.
   "The best way to stop substance is to make sure it never starts, but we must provide support for those who fall victim to drug or alcohol abuse," Grassley said. "By supporting initiatives that create a community wide support network, we can help substance abusers get back on track and on the road to recovery."
   Grassley currently serves as the Co-Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics control which is involved in the oversight of the Office of National Drug Control Policy
   In Iowa, Grassley founded a community-based anti-drug coalition called "Face It Together" to support efforts by parents, educators, businesses, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, health care providers, youth groups and news organizations to combat illegal drugs.
