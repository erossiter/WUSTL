SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT VETO OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT LEGISLATION
  Senator Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement after President George Bush vetoed the Water Resources Development Act.  
   "The Water Resources Development Act contains provisions for much needed improvements on the Mississippi River. These improvements are necessary if our agriculture producers and manufacturers are able to compete in a global market in the future. WRDA has been a work in progress for 7 years and enjoys broad, bipartisan support in both the Senate and House. The bottom line is that the House passed the bill 394 to 25 and the Senate passed it by a vote of 91 to 4. With this strong support, it appears this is finally going to become law, despite the President's ill-advised veto."
