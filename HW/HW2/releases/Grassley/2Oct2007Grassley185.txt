SEN. GRASSLEY CONTINUES FIGHT TO KEEP DES MOINES ARMY RECRUITING BATTALION ACTIVE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley said that the Army's response to an August letter urging that the Des Moines Army Recruiting Battalion be kept active is encouraging in that it makes clear the proposal to close the doors isn't final. Army officials reviewing the proposal to close the battalion said that arguments to the contrary have merit.  
   "We gave the Army clear facts showing that the U.S. Army Recruiting Command erred in its proposal. It's very good to hear that the misguided proposal is being carefully reviewed and that the Army is serious about considering our request," Grassley said. "Consolidating the Des Moines Recruiting Battalion with Minneapolis would be a costly mistake." 
   In August, Grassley sent a letter signed by every member of Iowa 's congressional delegation to the Pentagon asking for reconsideration of the decision to deactivate the Des Moines Recruiting Battalion and consolidate it with the Minneapolis Recruiting Battalion. The letter revealed that a proposal made by the U.S. Army Recruiting Command was against staff recommendations. 
   Grassley, Sen. Harkin, and Reps. Latham, Boswell, King, Braley and Loebsack said that Des Moines has a closer average distance to other metropolitan areas in the region, is closer to supporting Military Entrance Processing Stations, and is closer to its supporting military installations. Greater Des Moines also has a lower cost of living than Minneapolis . And, the newly constructed facility is located on a military installation instead of leased space, resulting in a substantially lower annual operating cost for the Des Moines Recruiting Battalion. 
   Below is the Iowa congressional delegation's August letter to the U.S. Department of the Army. Here is copy of the Department's response.
