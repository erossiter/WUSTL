$742,500 RELEASED TO CLINTON FROM HOUSE, URBAN DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is releasing $742,500 to Clinton for the redevelopment of Liberty Square. 
   The funds come from the Economic Development Initiative Special Project Grants which were included in the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal 2006.
   "These federal funds will help Clinton clean up the Liberty Square area and create an environment for new industrial and residential development," Grassley said. 
   Specifically, the money will characterize, complete risk assessments, acquire, demolish structures, and clean up abandoned contaminated sites within the revitalization area. Clinton identified 25 Brownfield sites in the Liberty Square area that pose the greatest challenge to redevelopment.
