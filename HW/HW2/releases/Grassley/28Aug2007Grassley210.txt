CENSUS BUREAU STATISTICS ON UNINSURED
  Today the Census Bureau released an update on the number of Americans, both children and adults, without health insurance. Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Committee on Finance, made the following comment on today's update. 
   "This should motivate the House and Senate to re-authorize SCHIP this fall. The Senate bill will insure a lot of kids who don't have health insurance. It'll keep others from losing insurance. On insuring adults, some Americans get a federal tax benefit for health insurance, and others don't. We need to look at what works and what doesn't and try to fix the inequities."
