SEN. GRASSLEY PAYS TRIBUTE TO REP. MAYNE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today paid tribute to former Rep. Wiley Mayne of Sioux City. Rep. Mayne died on Sunday.
   "Wiley Mayne would have been a 30-year congressman if it wouldn't have been for Watergate. He had the respect of political allies and opponents alike. He was an institution in Northwest Iowa politics and served the Siouxland community long after his time in elected office. He was a great man and a great political leader.
