SEN. GRASSLEY HONORED FOR LEADERSHIP IN AGRICULTURE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley recently received AgriBank's District Farm Credit Council's Distinguished Service Award. The award recognizes two members of Congress who have demonstrated leadership regarding issues facing the Farm Credit System, as well as agriculture and rural. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota also received an award. 
   "Farmers understand the importance of agriculture to Iowa 's economy. So it's especially nice to be receiving an award from other farmers," Grassley said.
   "My fellow farmers and I on the AgriBank District Council are pleased to honor Senator Grassley with our 2007 Distinguished Service Award. As one of only two active farmers in the United States Senate, he understands the changing needs of agriculture and rural and we look forward to working with him in addressing these important issues," said Roy Tiarks of Council Bluffs, IA. Tiarks is the current Chairman of the AgriBank Board. 
   Grassley is a member of the Senate Agriculture committee and is active in the upcoming farm bill debate. In April he held town hall meetings in 13 counties to discuss the farm bill and hear from Iowans. 
   Grassley has said that concentration is the number one issue facing agriculture today. He has introduced several pieces of legislation that would address concentration including packer ban, market transparency, mandatory arbitration and payment limits.
   "Many Iowans and farmers that I have talked to have similar concerns about farm payment limits, the commodity title and renewable fuels," Grassley said. "I will remain committed to these issues and the principles I've laid out over the last several months."
