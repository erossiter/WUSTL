SEN. GRASSLEY INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ENSURE GREATER USE OF BIODIESEL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley has introduced legislation that would mandate the use of 1.25 billion gallons of biodiesel per year by 2012. 
   "Biodiesel is just one more way we're lessening our dependence on foreign oil. Everyday we're seeing more renewable energy sources like ethanol and biodiesel being used. Ensuring continued use of these renewable energy products will only help our efforts to wean us off foreign oil, increase investment in rural America, and benefit the environment," Grassley said.
   The bill sets the mandate to increase over time from 450 million gallons in 2008 to 1.25 billion gallons in 2012. Eighty percent of the mandate will be reserved for biodiesel and the other twenty percent may be filled by other "bio-based diesel replacement" products.
   Grassley said the capital infusion will help jump-start struggling rural economies, create jobs and offer local farmers and residents promising investment opportunities. Just like ethanol, a biodiesel manufacturing facility will bring a new payroll to town and put more money in farmers' pockets.
   Iowa currently has 14 biodiesel refineries running or under construction.
   Grassley introduced the bill with Senators Dick Lugar of Indiana, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tom Carper of Delaware and Barack Obama of Illinois.
