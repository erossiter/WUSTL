SEN. GRASSLEY COMMENTS ON STOLEN VA DATA
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today issued the following statement regarding the compromise of data from the Veterans Affairs Administration. 
   "It's a step in the right direction that the VA Inspector General and the FBI are launching a full scale investigation to determine if there was negligence. It's time the VA take the Inspector General seriously and get to the bottom of its information security vulnerabilities. I hope the VA has learned its lesson and this will be the last time the Inspector General has to reprimand the VA. In the meantime we need to ensure that our veterans have the information they need to protect themselves in case of identity theft."
