IOWAN NAMED INTERIM U.S. ATTORNEY IN NORTHERN DISTRICT
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that President Bush has named Matt Dummermuth as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa. Grassley said he expects the President to nominate Dummermuth to permanently fill the position once all the paperwork and background checks are completed. 
   Dummermuth was one of three names Grassley nominated to fill the opening in the Northern District.
   "Matt will be able to jump right in because of his vast experience at the U.S. Department of Justice as well as his work in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia," Grassley said. "He will serve Iowa well."
   U.S. Attorneys prosecute federal criminal and civil rights cases. The Northern District of Iowa is based in Cedar Rapids.
