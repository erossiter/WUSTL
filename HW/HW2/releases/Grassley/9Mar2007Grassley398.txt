VOTE ON SECURITY AMENDMENTS IN SENATE
  The Senate today voted against consideration of a package of amendments that would have enhanced the security requirements in the 9/11 Commission bill currently being debated in the Senate. The package included a Grassley amendment that would ensure individuals who are on U.S. soil and have their visas revoked, can immediately be deported. Currently, when a possible terrorist has their visa revoked, they can use the U.S. court system to stay in the country. This jeopardizes classified intelligence, may hinder investigations dealing with criminals and terrorists and make deportation nearly impossible.  
   Here is a statement from Grassley.
   "It was my understanding from the Democrat majority that the 9/11 bill was about national security, which makes it all the more alarming that our package of security amendments was rejected. The package of amendments put forth by Republican senators would have put some teeth into this bill and actually help secure our country rather than pretending to finish the Commission's recommendations. By denying an up or down vote on these security amendments, the Democrats are potentially putting the public at risk. It's time this Congress realize that immigration and border security have everything to do with national security. We live in a very different world and a pre-9/11 mindset isn't going to help keep terrorists out of the country."
