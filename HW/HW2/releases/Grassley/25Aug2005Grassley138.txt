SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRAC HEARING, ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today made the following comment after the Base Closure and Realignment Commission's second day of hearings.  
 These hearings are the basis for the final recommendations that will be submitted to the President for approval. 
   "It's gratifying to know that the Commission accurately assessed the fairness and value of keeping the Civilian Personnel Office located at the Arsenal, but I'm once again disappointed that they failed to see very similar arguments to keep the Defense Finance and Accounting Service in Rock Island. I'm sure the personnel who work at CPOC will continue to be the best in the country at their jobs and I'm glad they will remain in the Quad Cities area."
