SEN. GRASSLEY AMENDMENT TO PROTECT TAX DOLLARS ACCEPTED ON SPENDING BILL
  As part of his long standing effort to promote good-government and protect tax dollars, Sen. Chuck Grassley today said his amendment to shed light on exactly who gets federal contracts for border security was accepted to the Senate's version of the annual spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. 
   "The public has a right to know who receives these big-money contracts, and that the contracts to improve security are well-managed," Grassley said. 
   Grassley's amendment would require the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security to review contracts for border security that are over $20 million. It would also require the Inspector General to report on cost overruns, delays or mismanagement of contracts, and then require the Secretary of Homeland Security to account for these problems. Last, the amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to disclose when border security contracts are given to foreign entities.
   A similar amendment of Grassley's was included in the Senate's immigration reform bill.
   The Homeland Security appropriations bill is expected to be completed in the Senate this week. The bill will then be debated by a House-Senate conference committee before receiving final approval by both Houses.
