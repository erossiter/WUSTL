SEN. GRASSLEY: FOUR VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINICS CLEARED FOR OPENING
  Sen. Chuck Grassley tonight learned that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has given final approval for four Iowa outpatient clinics to be opened in Carroll, Cedar Rapids, Marshalltown and Shenandoah. 
   "This is great news for Iowa veterans and it couldn't have come at a better time as we commemorate those who have died in our nation's service this Memorial Day," Grassley said. "With these outpatient clinics we'll enhance services and improve access for our veterans who deserve the best care we can provide.
   The process of opening these clinics will begin immediately, but the timeline can vary for each complex. Iowa's four outpatient facilities which were approved were the most of any state.
   "VA is committed to providing world-class health care to the men and women who have served this nation," VA Secretary Jim Nicholson said. "These new clinics will bring VA's top-notch care closer to the veterans who have earned it."
   According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, nearly 80 percent of the health care provided by the VA hospitals is outpatient care.
   The VA is currently modernizing its health care facilities as part of a comprehensive process called CARES, Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services.
