SEN. GRASSLEY TO VISIT 22 COMMUNITIES DURING CONGRESSIONAL RECESS
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit 22 counties to meet with Iowans during the Congressional recess to be held May 31 - June 3. The meetings are part of Grassley's annual tour of Iowa's 99 counties. 
   Town meetings are planned for Garner, Forest City, Emmetsburg, Estherville, Spirit Lake, Sheldon, Sibley, Rock Rapids, LeMars, Ida Grove, Cherokee, Storm Lake, Sac City, Jefferson, Rockwell City, Pocahontas, Dakota City and Clarion.
   Grassley will also visit the Algona Lions Club, the Spencer Kidney Dialysis Center, Van Beek Scientific in Orange City, and Goodwill Industries in Sioux City.
   "With the broad number of important issues before Congress, I hope Iowans will come to these meetings to ask questions and share their views," Grassley said. "My annual meetings are an important part of the dialogue between elected officials and their constituents that is critical to making representative government work."
   The meetings are open to the public and Grassley said that he hopes many area residents will attend. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
