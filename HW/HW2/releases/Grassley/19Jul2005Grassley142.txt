SEN. GRASSLEY BRINGING THE WORLD TO IOWA
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today announced that he will once again bring foreign diplomats to Iowa during his biennial "Ambassadors Tour" from Aug. 15 - 19. Already, representatives from 74 countries are signed up for the tour. 
   Grassley's Ambassadors Tour is designed to showcase Iowa's resources, facilitate greater economic collaboration between Iowa and other countries, and expose Iowa to the rich diversity of the world community. The first tour was held in 1986. The dignitaries visit several business, as well as tour the Iowa State Fair and a family farm.
   "This is an opportunity for Iowa to show the world our innovative businesses, celebrated agriculture, and top-notch schools," Grassley said. "Our guests will learn about Iowa's people, land and businesses and take this back to their home countries. We're making real connections here."
   The week-long tour will travel through the communities of Des Moines, Marshalltown, Cedar Falls, Waterloo, Charles City, Waverly, Denver, Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Amana, Iowa City, Williamsburg, Grinnell, Prairie City, and West Des Moines.
   Every other year, Grassley invites each country with an embassy located in Washington, D.C. to send to Iowa their ambassador and spouse. If the ambassador is unable to participate, the embassy has the option of sending another designee. 
   Grassley said during the week the diplomats will stay in the houses of Iowans at the over-night stops in the Cedar Valley, Dubuque, and Iowa City. "Our friends from around the world see first-hand the generosity of hundreds of Iowans. They're immersed in Iowa values and friendship," he said.
   Grassley began his effort during the 1980s farm crisis. Fostering good relations with new and existing trading partners is an integral part of Grassley's work as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade issues. 
   Tour events are completely funded by private, individual and corporate sponsors. Grassley also works with the Iowa Department of Economic Development to maximize the benefits of the trade tour of Iowa.
