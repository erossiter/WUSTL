SENS. GRASSLEY, SALAZAR 25 X '25 RESOLUTION CLEARS SENATE
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that his 25x'25 resolution passed the Senate by voice vote and will be included in the energy bill. The resolution says "By 2025, America's farms, forests and ranches will provide 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United States, while continuing to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food, feed and fiber." 
   Grassley and Salazar had introduced the resolution as an amendment to the energy bill on Tuesday and had earlier this year introduced it as a stand-alone bill.
   "This is a common sense initiative that I'm happy the Senate was able to approve quickly. The resolution sets a workable goal for renewable energy production and use that we can all aim for with sensible policies and initiatives," Grassley said. 
   The 25 x '25 initiative does not prescribe a way to achieve the goal. Instead, it recognizes the benefit of implementing supportive policies and incentives to stimulate the development and use of renewable energy.
   The initiative also identifies the benefits of technological improvements to the cost and market appeal of renewable energy. The supporters of the 25 x'25 goal commit to support sensible policies and proper incentives to work toward the goal.
