SEN. GRASSLEY: IOWA WINS BIG IN FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION BILL, PROJECTS THROUGHOUT STATE FUNDED
  Sen. Chuck Grassley today said that Iowa will receive a big boost in funding for projects throughout the state in the federal transportation bill that was filed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives today.  
   As a senior member of the House-Senate conference committee, Grassley was able to secure $2.3 billion for Iowa projects over the next five years. With this funding he was able to give a financial boost to many projects throughout the state. This includes priorities for individual communities as well as for the Iowa Department of Transportation.
   "The Iowa delegation worked hard to get the state the necessary funding to give Iowans safe roads, bridges, trails, buses, and transportation facilities," Grassley said. "It was important to get this bill done so states like Iowa can plan for their short season when work can be done due to our long winters."
   Congress has been considering legislation to re-authorize the federal highway program for the next five years. Several committees have jurisdiction over parts of this program. The Senate Finance Committee, which Grassley chairs, was in charge of determining how the government raises the money to pay for the highway and transit programs.
   Here is a list of projects that were included in the bill for Iowa broken down by area of the state.
