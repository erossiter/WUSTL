GRASSLEY MEETS WITH IOWA RESERVE SOLDIERS AS U.S. ARMY RESERVE COMMEMORATES ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY
  Senator Chuck Grassley met today with Iowa Reserve Soldiers, Army Reserve Spc. Patricia Howes and Army Reserve Sgt. Jeff Garretto, during their trip to Washington for a special reenlistment ceremony of 100 Army Reserve Soldiers in recognition of the Army Reserve's 100th anniversary. 
   "It is great to see these fine young soldiers choosing to continue to serve our country in the Army Reserves," Grassley said. "Iowa could not be more proud of our troops and their continued resolve to keep safe."
   The centennial reenlistment ceremony of 100 Army Reserve soldiers is the beginning of the Army Reserve's 100th anniversary commemoration, which will take place throughout 2008.
