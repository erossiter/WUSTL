SEN. GRASSLEY TO KICK OFF ANNUAL VISITS TO EVERY IOWA COUNTY
  Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will continue his annual tour of Iowa with visits to 13 counties during the February congressional recess.  
   Town meetings are planned for Clarke, Dallas, Lucas, Madison, Monroe, Story, Warren and Union Counties and are open to the public.
   Grassley will also attend events in Boone, Colfax, Des Moines, Marshalltown, Pella and Stuart.
   "I am excited to start my county visits again," Grassley said. "I enjoy communicating with Iowans because representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about. I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents." 
    Grassley said that he hopes area residents will attend his town hall meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject. 
   Here is information about Grassley's county visits.
