ENERGY BILL CLEARS SENATE
  The Senate tonight completed work on an energy bill that contains a renewable fuels standard that would mandate 36 billion gallons by 2022. The bill also includes a requirement for biodiesel.  
   Here is a statement from Senator Grassley.
   "I'm glad we were finally able to inject some common sense into the energy debate and get a bill that can be enacted into law. This is the most robust renewable fuels standard we've ever had and will dramatically expand the use of renewable energy and drive the production and development of cellulosic biofuels. It will give a tremendous boost to ethanol and biodiesel producers who have suffered from lower prices. The bill will also have a dramatic impact on Iowa's biodiesel producers who now will have some much needed assurances and incentives to get up and running the production plants that have been sitting idle. I expect the House to act quickly and get the bill to the president for his signature."
