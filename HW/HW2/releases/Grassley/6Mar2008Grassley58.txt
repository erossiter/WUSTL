SEN. GRASSLEY TO MEET WITH IOWANS IN 35 COUNTIES DURING MARCH CONGRESSIONAL RECESS
  Senator Chuck Grassley today said that that he will be holding meetings in 35 counties from March 17--28. The Senate will not be in session for a scheduled congressional recess. 
  "I've been meeting with Iowans in every county, every year I've represented Iowa in the United States Senate. It's this exchange of ideas that gives me greater insight directly from Iowans that I can take to Washington with me," Grassley said. "Holding a meeting in each of our 99 counties gives me the opportunity to have an open and honest dialogue with the people I serve in the U.S. Senate." 
  Grassley's meetings will take him to the counties of Allamakee, Bremer, Butler, Cedar, Cerro Gordo, Clay, Clayton, Clinton, Delaware, Dickinson, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Franklin, Hancock, Humboldt, Jones, Kossuth, Linn, Lyon, Mitchell, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Sioux, Tama, Washington, Winnebago, Winneshiek, Worth, and Wright.  
  Grassley will hold town hall meetings in Anamosa, Bancroft, Clarion, Dakota City, Decorah, Dyersville, Eldridge, Emmetsburg, Garner, Hampton, Inwood, Manchester, Marion, Mason City, Northwood, Parkersburg, Primghar, Sibley, Sioux Center, Spencer, Spirit Lake, Stacyville, Tipton, Toledo and West Union. He will tour businesses and meet with employees at Cummins in Lake Mills and Plastics Unlimited in Preston. He will meet with students at Williamsburg High School and Allamakee High School. He will also speak with the Waverly Kiwanis; the Charles City Rotary; the Estherville Rotary; and the Kalona Rotary. He will also take a walking tour of the Guttenberg shopping district and marina. 
  Grassley will also present military service medals to the family of Corporal Kenneth W. Jurgens in Hopkinton. Corporal Jurgens was killed in action in Vietnam. Family members and friends have recovered medals and badges to honor his service to the United States. 
  On Thursday, March 27, Grassley will participate in a Prescription Drug Town Hall meeting in Clinton. The meeting will focus on prescription drug and cold medicine abuse.
