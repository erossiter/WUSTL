SEN. GRASSLEY TO VISIT 20 COMMUNITIES TO MEET WITH IOWANS
 Sen. Chuck Grassley announced today that he will visit twenty counties to meet with Iowans during the President's Day Congressional recess to be held Feb. 21 - 25. 
   Town meetings are planned for Creston, Mt. Ayr, Leon, Corydon, Centerville, Albia, Chariton, Newton, Marshalltown, Ottumwa, Bloomfield, Keosauqua, Fairfield, Mount Pleasant, Fort Madison, West Burlington and Wapello and are open to the public.
   Grassley will also attend events in Osceola, Des Moines and Davenport.
   "Representative government requires the type of dialogue that these meetings are all about," Grassley said. "My annual meeting with county residents allows me to share with Iowans what I'm doing in Washington and hear their views on issues that are important to them. I take the common sense input I receive back to Washington on behalf of my constituents."
   Grassley said that he hopes many area residents will attend his meetings and share their views with him. He said that these meetings will be a good opportunity for him to take questions from Iowans on any subject.
