SCOTUS TO RELEASE OF AUDIO TAPES FROM GUANTANAMO CASE
  Senator Chuck Grassley issued the following statement after the Supreme Court today announced that it would immediately make available the audio tapes of the oral arguments in the Boumediene v. Bush; Al Odah v. U.S. scheduled to be heard next week. 
   Grassley and Senator Charles Schumer successfully urged Chief Justice William Rehnquist to allow the delayed audio broadcasting of the oral arguments when the 2000 election was disputed before the Supreme Court. The release of the tapes was a historical step for judicial branch transparency.
   The Senators are also the authors of legislation that would give federal judges the discretion to allow the photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting and televising of federal court proceedings.
   "The announcement by the Supreme Court to release the transcripts of next week's oral arguments in the Guantanamo detainee cases is a welcome step toward transparency in the federal Judiciary. As a long time supporter of open government I believe that a key first step to a more accountable and transparent Judiciary is to give people more access to what occurs in America's courts. By making these audio tapes public immediately following the arguments, the Supreme Court is recognizing the important role it plays in our Republic and how the American people are better off hearing our highest court in action.
   "However, more can be done for the Judicial Branch as a whole. Next week, I hope to have my legislation allowing media coverage of the federal courts reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. When this bill becomes law the American people will not only have a right to their day in court, but a right to see, hear, and understand how the federal Judiciary works."
