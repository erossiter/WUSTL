SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN FARM BILL
  Senator Chuck Grassley today released the following statement after the Agriculture Committee was briefed on the latest developments in the farm bill. 
   "It's good to hear that we'll be moving forward on a new farm bill. It's best if we can give farmers the ability to plan long term. We have yet to see the language, but it's my understanding that my legislation to put a hard cap on farm payments was not included. It's disappointing because these provisions have support from constituencies across the country. And, I have yet to see a good reason for 10 percent of farmers getting 72 percent of the benefits of the farm program. As for the rest of the bill, I'll be looking more closely at the various aspects including the proposed average crop revenue program."
