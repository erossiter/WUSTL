                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Press Releases             Barrasso Delivers Maiden Speech to Senate  September 10  2007     WASHINGTON  U S  Senator John Barrasso  R Wyo   today delivered his maiden speech to the U S  Senate  which outlined his vision for   Wyoming and laid out specific legislative efforts he will champion  In   Wyoming   we believe the future is ours to shape  Barrasso said  Since taking office  Ive heard from thousands of people all over the state about their hopes and dreams for their families  their communities    Wyoming and our nation  One theme has been universal  fight for   Wyoming   I will fight for   Wyoming everyday by championing quality education for our children  quality jobs for our families  affordable and accessible healthcare for our communities  and our core values     Wyoming is blessed with incredible resources   coal  natural gas  and oil   and alternative sources of energy such as wind  Barrasso continued  The    University of    Wyoming s     School of    Energy Resources is prepared to become the leading energy research institute in the world  They are finding ways to convert coal to liquids  coal to gas  and pump carbon dioxide back into the earth to enhance oil recovery  The worlds most powerful computer is being assembled in   Wyoming to help make this possible  I believe we can and will develop new energy technologies while preserving the natural beauty and the wildlife of our state  Thats the future I see for   Wyoming   I believe there is a role for government     but the role must be limited  Government should not do for people what they can do for themselves  Nor should government put obstacles in the way of people pursuing their American dream  Thats why I will champion legislation to cut wasteful spending and make sure taxpayers get value for their money  I will fight to help our hospitals and health care providers deliver quality care to our families in an environment with limited resources by co sponsoring the      Craig    Thomas    Rural    Hospital and Provider Equity Act and by joining the Senate Rural Health Caucus  I will work to make sure that public lands remain open to multiple use  while at the same time ensuring that our environment is protected  As an outdoorsman and a conservationist  Senator Craig Thomas worked on two bills affecting the western part of   Wyoming that were very close to his heart  While he is not here to carry on the work  the work needs to continue as part of his legacy  One is called the Snake River Headwaters Legacy Act of 2007  This bill will create a lasting legacy for   Wyoming people and for future generations  while ensuring that access  multiple use and private property rights are not restricted  As a tribute to Senator Thomas and in recognition of his years of leadership in the Senate and specifically the Energy committee  I will ask that my name be attached to S  1281  The second bill affecting the western part of Wyoming deals with a very special area named the   Wyoming range  As a strong supporter of multiple use  I still believe there are areas of our state that are so sensitive that they must be protected from development  I will soon be introducing a bill in the Senate to protect the undeveloped areas of the   Wyoming range from any future oil and gas leasing  My legislation is intended to achieve that goal while respecting property rights that currently exist in the   Wyoming range  I am humbled to be given the opportunity and the responsibility to represent the people of   Wyoming in the United States Senate  Barrasso concluded  I will continue to work with all people  regardless of party  on issues that are important to the people of   Wyoming   We just heard one of the best maiden speeches  Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   said following Barrassos speech  On behalf of the Republican Conference  I congratulate Senator Barrasso on an outstanding opening address  Your skill set in addition to your leadership abilities are certainly welcome here in the United States Senate  Theres a lot of work to be done out here teaching the east about the west  so that they understand that the one size fits all approach to government doesnt work  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   said  Im glad to have the help explaining   Wyoming   as he did so aptly in this speech  Hes a tremendous asset to the United States Senate  and Im very proud to welcome him as my colleague and part of the delegation  Watch video of the Senator s Maiden Speech
