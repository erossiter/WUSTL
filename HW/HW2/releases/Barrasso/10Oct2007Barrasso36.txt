                                      Press Releases             Barrasso  Wyoming Must Lead on Energy Senator Addresses Summit on Energy and Climate in Jackson October 10  2007  JACKSON    U S  Sen     John Barrasso today spoke at the summit on energy and climate sponsored by the    University of    Wyoming s     School of    Energy Resources and other institutes   The text of Senator Barrassos speech follows    Thank you all  it s been great to join you yesterday evening and today  Wyoming has extraordinary resources  and one of course is the     University of    Wyoming   The faculty  the students  the researchers are a testament to the Universitys efforts to bring together the best our state has to offer  For all of you who worked on and are participating in this summit  many thanks   I have only been a United States Senator for a little over 100 days  It has been a whirlwind  It has taken me to 31 town meetings  over 130 floor votes  and has involved every issue under the sun and below the ground  from energy research and development to tourism and recreation  From job growth to health care to housing   It took me to the     University of    Wyoming to lead a discussion with students on the book Beyond Oil  Its a book that was sent to every incoming student  And you would be proud of the high quality of the students at the     University of    Wyoming  I have worked hard to not skip a beat and to live up to the high ideals and expectations of   Wyoming people who still mourn the loss of our friend    Craig Thomas   Like    Craig Thomas   I continue to work in  and live in   Wyoming    Let s get to the matters of energy  climate  and balance before us today   For Wyoming  a State with extraordinary natural beauty and extraordinary energy resources  I am   Wyoming  s voice on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  I also serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee  which is the home of two subcommittees with specific oversight of climate change issues   The title of this speech  The Energy Picture from a  Perspective  That should make everyone s eyes roll  because    is pathetically behind and lagging on a coherent energy picture  You have heard that from every speaker    And states  private industry and public institutes are forced to work around the irresponsible absence of action on a federal energy policy as well as federal energy research and development   The Governor is right  I want to join him in calling for serious  focused research and development into energy innovation   The Bush administration has fallen behind on research  I ll go beyond that and say we need to take immediate action on ideas like tax credits for clean coal technologies and dollars for gasification technology   The Governor called for a new commitment akin to our nation s successful effort to put a man on the moon  Heck  I ll settle for a financialcommitment on par with what we spend every four years to put a man   or woman   in the White House   But seriously  where ever you find yourself on the issue of climate change and energy development  we can agree on one important dynamic  the market  Change not only awaits us   it is banging on the door   Consumers are demanding more and more green energy  More people know now that a carbon footprint isn t a kind of new running shoe  Reducing carbon is a mantra  a fact in the marketplace which must be recognized   And   Wyoming  as an economy that is based on carbon extraction  must be highly conscious of this market dynamic  Because consumer direction leads to public policy    public policy and regulatory actions  either taxing carbon or capping carbons    all of these will affect   Wyoming perhaps more than any one policy issue on the horizon  This debate cannot be ignored or rejected    Wyoming must be at the forefront  leading it   If you look at the presidential candidates  they are all talking about carbon as a top issue  There will a climate bill coming  The bottom line is our country s energy portfolio is headed for change  and that means jobs in   Wyoming will change with it  The writing is on the wall regardless of where you stand on the issue of climate change  I had an old medical professor  Dr  Milt Davis  He said you never want to be diagnosed with mural dyslexia  I asked him what he meant  He said mural dyslexia is the inability to read the handwriting on the wall   You can harbor doubts about the science  but the political and market realities are under no such illusion  the writing is on the wall  From my point of view we  in Wyoming  can be a part of that discussion  play a significant part in blending solutions  or be forced to accept the changes that others will attempt to put upon us   In our absence our resources  our people  our jobs will lose out  I am not willing to accept that In   Wyoming we lead  If not by example  then by success   I believe   Wyoming represents a mix of energy solutions that can be a part of our country s energy future for many  many years to come  With less impacts   We must adapt  make changes  and be ready to put our money where our best hopes are  We must take the debate seriously so that a coal producing state like   Wyoming remains a strong energy player  or our coal will be left as a stranded asset by policy shifts and consumer demand   There is a new vocabulary that   Wyoming must direct  carbon capture  carbon sequestration  gasification  liquefaction and allocation  Innovations in each of these issue areas are vital for   Wyoming  s future  Cliff Hansen  our former Senator and Governor  through his willingness to engage in a debate about federal minerals royalties allowed this state to enjoy 50 percent of those royalties   The energy debate of our generation is carbon  Period  You can agree or disagree with Global Warming theories  but no one can wish the issue away  And the public policy debate about carbon has dramatic effects on   Wyoming  s future  our state  our communities  our jobs  our families  Period  It is research and innovation and smart thinking that will keep   Wyoming  s economy from being sequestered with coal as a stranded asset  We know that  We all know what is requiredwhat we need to do is act for the good of   Wyoming  I applaud the University  the Wyoming Legislature  our private industry and the Governor for joining us in finding solutions  The inaction of    is unacceptable  What is the bottom line  The delay and uncertainty of policy will make the consequences of not acting even more severe when you finally do act  What do we  as   Wyoming s policy makers  need to do  We have to join as a team to block and tackle  be proactive and strategize if Wyoming is to have a strong future in our carbon based resources in a 10  20  50 year future  What actions can we do now to make the glide path more manageable for us  To make a future stronger  As a   US Senator  I can do something  Investment tax credits for clean coal technology in any energy legislation  Period  We can do that now   Equally immediate is to be a constructive partner as Congress goes forward in sending price signals for carbon  The overall effort for each of us is to be engaged in the process    not an impediment  In a clean coal market  gasification as outlined by our friends with GE is the future  With our abundance of coal    Wyoming should be a leader in coal gasification     Wyoming did not get to be a state with 50 percent of the mineral royalties coming to us by not getting engaged in the process  We are where we are today because previous senators rolled up their sleeves and they made themselves relevant to the debate    Wyoming is relevant in clean air issues  and mine land reclamation because we actively engaged in the debate  If we arent engaged in policy that involves the deployment in clean coal technology  then Wyoming runs the risk of being irrelevant in that debate  The Governor talked earlier about innovation and significant investment in new technologies  I agree absolutely  I would add to that a realization among decision makers that these changes will not and cannot happen during one year  2 years  or even an election cycle  We need to accept that innovations come over time  but in the mean time  you cannot simply shut off our current traditional energy sources  I can assure you  one of the biggest threats to addressing effectively the concerns of climate change would be to significantly impede current domestic production today in anticipation of new technologies in the future  Innovate  prepare for changes  but retain our ability to make the power we need today and to be less dependent on foreign sources  I want to repeat the most important point of where the climate change debate will lead us  You can harbor doubts about the science  but the political and market realities are under no such illusion  We in   Wyoming will be at the center of that discussion  I am committed to that   Our people  our jobs depend on that leadership that all of us will provide collaboratively and aggressively  Bottom line  In   Wyoming we lead If not by example  then by success  Teddy Roosevelt came to   Wyoming 103 years ago  He spoke at the     University of    Wyoming   10 000 people showed up  Well have more folks than that at homecoming this weekend  but that was a huge crowd for over 100 years ago  He said People of Wyoming  I believe in you and in your future  He was right to believe in us then  and we are right to believe in ourselves for the next 100 years  Ronald Reagan came to   Cheyenne 25 years ago  He was campaigning for Malcolm Wallop  our former   US Senator and ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee  President Reagan said the thing he loved about the     Rocky    Mountain west was people here still believe the future is ours to shape  I  like everyone else in this room  believe the future of   Wyoming is still ours to shape  Thank you for joining actively in that fight for   Wyoming  s best future                                                    October 2007 Press Releases
