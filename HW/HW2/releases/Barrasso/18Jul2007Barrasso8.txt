                                      Press Releases             Barrasso Delivers First Speech on Senate Floor  July 18  2007        WASHINGTON  In his first speech on the floor of the United States Senate  U S  Senator    John Barrasso addressed the body at 5 a m  today to make his views known about an    Iraq withdrawal amendment  Majority leaders forced an all night session in the Senate as they put forward a new version of a previously rejected    Iraq withdrawal plan   A transcript of the Senators speech follows   Thank you  Mr  President  This is the first time Im addressing this body  Im filling the seat of former United States Senator    Craig Thomas   a Marine  a warrior  and an American hero  He is a gentleman from   Wyoming who has left large boots to fill    Now  some people have suggested that when I give the first speech  Mr  President  that I do it at a time  during a time of day  when many people back home in Wyoming would be watching television  Youre also from the Rocky Mountain Time Zone  and you know that people get up early  but at home  its now 3 a m  and I doubt that we have many viewers at home   Ive been sworn in a little over three weeks ago  but its like Ive never left home  Mr  President  as a physician  an orthopedic surgeon  a trauma surgeon  Im used to getting up at this hour and working at all unusual hours  People of    Wyoming know that and they call on me day and night  Thats why Im here at this hour    About 21 hours ago we had a bipartisan breakfast to discuss this very issue  Of that body  I told the whole group that I was the most prepared to be up at this hour working and Im delighted to be with you  but were here debating a very serious issue    I spent a lot of time with Senator Thomas in the last year driving him around the state of Wyoming  discussing the war  visiting about the war  about his trip to    Baghdad   talking about the fact that we are threatened in a global war on terror and that this is a threat to our way of life   As a background  Mr  President  as a trauma surgeon and also as a    Wyoming state senator  in the state senate I chaired the Transportation  Highways  and Military Affairs Committee  And in that position  I asked to go and make sure that the Wyoming troops were getting everything they needed in Afghanistan and    Baghdad   I was unable to make that trip  The arrangements couldnt be made    But I was able to go to Walter Reed  and at Walter Reed  I was able to visit the troops  the wounded warriors because I wanted to make sure both as a state senator and as an orthopedic surgeon that those folks were getting the kind of care that they deserved  What I saw were hero warriors  people who had lost a limb or two limbs and they wanted to return to combat  they wanted to do anything they could to get back with their buddies and fight for freedom      Mr  President  Wyoming has paid the price  as has every state  Ive been to services for young people who have lost their lives  Ive held and tried to comfort family members  A little over a month ago I got a call from my physician assistant  Her son is in    Iraq   Her nephew  also in   Iraq   And she had just gotten the news that her nephew had been killed  I went to visit the family  Mr  President  these are brave warriors  These are people doing everything they can for freedom and for our nation  They did not die in vain   This past weekend  I was home in Wyoming  a town meeting in Douglas also home over the Fourth of July for town meetings in Jackson and in Lander  and then go to a couple of rodeos  as Im sure you do as well  referring to Sen  Tester   I talked to hundreds of folks traveling around the state    You know  when you go to a rodeo  whether it was in Casper or on the Fourth of July in Cody  where I attended with a former United States Senator from Wyoming who has served on the Iraq Study Group  when they ride into the arena holding the American flag  people stand  take off their hat and put their hand over their heart  The announcer doesnt have to tell them to do that  they just do it    And at both of those rodeos  in    Casper and in Cody  they dedicated the Star Spangled Banner with a salute to    Craig Thomas   former Marine  Susan Thomas was there at both events and received the love of the crowd  And at both events  the announcer asked for prayers for the bravest men and women in the world  those who were fighting to keep us free  What I heard from people all around   Wyoming was dont quit  dont pull out  support the troops   And what are the consequences of withdrawal  We heard it today with the Cornyn Amendment  It passed today 94 3  The purpose  To express the sense of the Senate that it is in the national security of the United States that    Iraq not become a failed state and a safe haven for terrorists  And we can go through the findings  The Senate makes the following findings  A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for Islamic radicals including Al Qaeda and Hezbollah  who are determined to attack the United States and United States allies  The Iraq Study Group report found that chaotic    Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally  The Iraq study group noted that Al Qaeda will portray any failure by the    United States a significant victory that would be featured prominently as they recruit for their cause in the region and around the world   We can go on and on  Mr  President  but to me the Iraq Study Group final report page 67 says it best  The point is not for the United States to set timetables or deadlines for withdrawal  an approach that we oppose  with that  Mr  President  I yield
