Obama Continue to Press for Withdrawl of Baroody Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Friday  May 18  2007         United States Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Bill Nelson  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the White House asking them to provide information surrounding the controversial nomination of Michael Baroody to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   The letter continues an effort begun earlier this week by Nelson and Durbin to press the administration to withdraw Baroody s name from consideration  In today s letter  the senators asked for copies of a  150 000 severance agreement Mr  Baroody received from his current employer  the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM   an addendum to that package and additional documents regarding the possible conflict of interest that pay package may have caused       This request follows a letter sent yesterday asking the President to withdraw the nomination of Mr  Baroody on that grounds that he is unfit to fill the position the nation s consumer protection watchdog  In his current position  Baroody has repeatedly worked against efforts to strengthen consumer protection laws and to protect manufacturers from scrutiny and liability  Mr  Baroody s nomination is expected to receive a hearing from the Senate Commerce Committee next week        To put it bluntly  Mr  Baroody is unfit to serve in this important position   Durbin said   The case is clear  The severance package Mr  Baroody received creates a monumental conflict of interest that alone should disqualify him from consideration  If the Administration continues with his nomination  we ll continue to fight on the side of protecting our families and children         This nomination shows the Bush administration s disregard for citizens in favor of corporations   said Senator Nelson   You simply cannot have an industry lobbyist be a watchdog over the same corporations he was paid to represent        Last week  Senator Durbin sent a letter to the Acting Commissioner of CPSC  Nancy Nord  seeking information to the agency s reaction learning that a popular magnetic toy had caused one death and dozens of serious injuries of children  The case was profiled in a recent series of articles in the Chicago Tribune       Last week  Nelson  in a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   divulged his intent to block Mr  Baroody s nomination from reaching the Senate floor   Specifically  Nelson has placed a  hold  on Baroody  which is a formal notice given by a senator who doesn t want a particular person s nomination to reach the Senate floor for consideration   It s widely viewed as an effective blocking mechanism  because it takes the votes of at least 60 of the 100 senators to overcome it       Text of the letter to the White House appears below         May 18  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20500   Dear Mr  President    On March 1  2007  you nominated Michael E  Baroody for the position of Chair and Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission   CPSC     This nomination was transmitted to the Senate on March 5  2007   In connection with Mr  Baroody s May 24  2007  nominations hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee  we are writing to request the following documents      a copy of Mr  Baroody s January 26  2006  severance agreement with the National Association of Manufacturers   NAM     a copy of the January 10  2007  amendment to Mr  Baroody s severance agreement   a copy of any correspondence  memoranda  electronic communications or other documents associated with the March 5  2007  letter from Mr  Baroody to Page C  Faulk  General Counsel  CPSC  detailing the steps Mr  Baroody will take to  avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest  in connection with the  150 000 severance payment he will receive from NAM if confirmed as Chair of the CPSC  and  a copy of any correspondence  memoranda  electronic communications or other documents associated with Ms  Faulk s April 24  2007  letter to Senator Daniel Inouye  Chairman  Senate Commerce Committee  finding that the  150 000 severance payment creates  no conflict of interest or other barrier to Mr  Baroody serving as Chairman or Commissioner of the CPSC     These documents are necessary so that both the Committee and the American public are fully informed of the circumstances surrounding Mr  Baroody s  150 000 severance package from NAM  and the extent to which that payment affects his ability to serve as Chair of this critical consumer protection agency       So that we may review these documents in advance of the hearing  we request delivery as soon as possible and  in any event  no later than 5 p m  on Tuesday  May 22  2007       Thank you in advance for your prompt assistance with this request       Sincerely    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   U S  Senator Bill Nelson  D FL   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL
