Underscores Administration s Failures to Safeguard Federal Student Loan Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wednesday  August 1  2007       The U S  Department of Education has failed to safeguard the nations federal student loan programs and should immediately increase its oversight of lenders and schools and fully enforce the law  government investigators concluded in a new report released today by leading Democratic lawmakers  Todays report comes after months of congressional and state investigations have uncovered unethical financial relationships among lenders  school financial aid officers  and public officials responsible for overseeing the federal student loan program in the Departments Office of Federal Student Aid  Under current law  lenders participating in the federal loan program are prohibited from using inducements or gifts to curry favor with colleges or universities  The report  which was prepared by the Government Accountability Office at the request of Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Representatives George Miller  D CA  and Dale E  Kildee  D MI   found that the Department does not have a sufficient oversight program in place to identify and address questionable lender behavior  such as inducements  In addition  the report found that despite repeated requests from lenders for the Department to provide direction on inducements  the Department had not updated its inducement guidelines in nearly 20 years and  in some cases  did not respond to lenders inquiries at all  In 2003  the Departments Inspector General also urged the Department to issue a Dear Colleague letter to lenders and schools on its regulations regarding inducements and gifts  The report also determined that the Department had a poor system for dealing with complaints of improper lender behavior  For example  out of 26 documented complaints received by the Department between 2001 and 2006  only two complaints prompted action by the Department  and 14 complaints were left unresolved  In addition  the report found that the Department attempted to use its sanctioning authority against lenders accused of improper inducements only twice over the past twenty years  For those of us in the Congress who have been working to protect students from exploitation  todays GAO report has confirmed our fears  said Durbin  Lenders continue to take advantage of students entering college and the Department of Education is not doing enough to prevent it  Parents and students have placed their trust in a Department that is not living up to its responsibility  If Secretary Spellings ignores this grim report  more and more students will be saddled with avoidable debt for years to come  This report again underscores that the Department of Education completely defaulted on its responsibilities to protect the nations student loan programs  said Miller  the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  There is simply no excuse for this administration ignoring repeated warnings about potential lender abuses  both from independent agencies and even from lenders themselves  Earlier this year I called on the Secretary to take emergency actions to hold lenders and schools accountable and enforce the law  Today I again urge her to start doing the job she was entrusted with by immediately implementing this reports recommendations  Students and families should be deeply concerned that the Department of Education failed to enforce the laws designed to protect them from unscrupulous lender tactics for so long  said Kennedy  the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  The higher education bill passed unanimously by the Senate last week provides even more protections for borrowers  but theyll only be effective with proper follow through by the Department  I hope Secretary Spellings will do everything in her power to build on her recent efforts to increase enforcement of the current laws against improper lender inducements  and carefully consider the recommendations in this report  The Departments failure to conduct even the most basic oversight is a great disservice to hard working students and their families  said Kildee  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood  Elementary  and Secondary Education  I hope that the Secretary finally will take this opportunity to rectify the results of this prior inaction  In May  U S  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings appeared before the House Education and Labor Committee to testify about the Departments role in conducting oversight of the federal student loan programs and the Reading First program  another education program that has been marred by conflicts of interest  In April  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told the Committee that the Bush administration had been asleep at the switch when it came to providing oversight over the student loan programs  Over the past several months  Miller and Kennedy have been conducting investigations into the student loan industry  Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation that would clean up the relationships between lenders and schools  In February  Miller and Kennedy introduced the bipartisan Student Loan Sunshine Act  which the House overwhelmingly passed in May  Key provisions of the bill were incorporated into the Senates reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  the Higher Education Amendments of 2007
