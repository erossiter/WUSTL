                                                                                                                                                                                           Friday  September 2  2005    JACKSONVILLE  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  visited Looking for Lincoln sites in Jacksonville  Pittsfield  Quincy and Beardstown today to learn more about what each community is doing to develop and promote its Lincoln landmarks       Durbin plans to use the information to generate support among his colleagues in the Senate for legislation he  Rep  Ray LaHood  R IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  have introduced to establish an Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area    The legislation calls for up to  10 million over 10 years to make federal grants available for preservation  education and economic development activities across the Heritage Area       Durbin wants Illinois communities to work together to tell the whole Lincoln story   The Looking for Lincoln project is designed to formally tie together Illinois    natural  historic  cultural and recreational resources touched by the life and influence of the nation s sixteenth President   Durbin is working closely with the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition  focusing on the places where Lincoln spent his formative years   His goal is to let each community tell its unique story  so tourists have the opportunity to visit series of historic places that  when joined together  provide a complete look at Lincoln   s life in Illinois   In the end  the communities involved will benefit from job creation and new tourism revenue  as well as a renewed sense of pride about their role in Lincoln   s heritage          Our goal is to bind the various elements of Lincoln   s life spread throughout Illinois into a tangible experience of Lincoln s legacy     said Durbin      We want to be able to tell the whole story   Families with plans to visit the Presidential Museum and Library should know that to extend their trips  or come back again  and visit several of the other historic Lincoln sites throughout the region             Illinois  in both its physical and cultural landscapes  shaped Abraham Lincoln s character from youth to adulthood   said Durbin      In his farewell address at Springfield  Lincoln said     To this place and the kindness of these people I owe everything      Just as Illinois left its mark on the character of Abraham Lincoln  Lincoln left his lasting impressions on our State   s artifacts  landscapes  buildings and folklore   Establishing a Lincoln National Heritage Area will bind these scattered elements into a tangible experience of Lincoln   s legacy for Illinoisans and visitors alike             As we have seen since the opening of the Presidential Library  Lincoln sites around Illinois have experienced an increase in visitors   That interest is only going to grow as we approach the bicentennial of Lincoln s birth in 2009     said LaHood      Looking For Lincoln will be the program which will tie the Lincoln experience together throughout the state  I applaud Senator Durbin for his dedication to the project and I look forward to continuing our work on advancing this legislation in Washington          The Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area would encompass an area spanning 41 Central Illinois counties  including Presidential sites in Springfield as well as other notable sites including the Lincoln Douglas Debate Museum in Charleston  the Macon County Log Courthouse in Decatur and the Carl Sandburg Home State Historic Site in Galesburg       The legislation protects private property rights and would not require any private citizen or entity to be affiliated with the Lincoln Heritage Area   The bill names the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition as the management authority for the National Heritage Area  but does not grant any zoning or land use power to the Coalition       Up to  10 million in federal grants would be available under this legislation  with no more than  1 million awarded in any single year   Any amount awarded for Lincoln National Heritage Area activities must be matched dollar for dollar in state  local or private funds      ______________________________     Excerpts from Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area Act  S  973          The story and example of Lincoln

place and the kindness of these people I owe everything          Lincoln  in turn  left his own traces across the Illinois landscape  They remain today in the form of stories  folklore  artifacts  buildings  streetscapes  and landscapes  Though scattered geographically and in varying states of development and interpretation  together they bring an immediacy and tangible quality to the powerful Lincoln legacy   Individually and collectively  they constitute an important national cultural and historic resource  Communities throughout this region know the value of their Lincoln legacy  but
