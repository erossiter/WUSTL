     DURBIN ASKS PRESIDENT TO ABANDON CALL FOR BRAZILIAN ETHANOL IMPORTS

PRESIDENT TO ABANDON CALL FOR BRAZILIAN ETHANOL IMPORTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wednesday  May 10  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   along with four other members of the Senate  sent a letter  late last night  to the President  urging him to abandon his call for ethanol imports  promote the developing U S  ethanol industry and work to expand domestic renewable fuels production   Additional signatories to the letter included Senators Tom Harkin  D IA   Barack Obama  D IL   Tim Johnson  D SD  and Byron Dorgan  D ND    Yesterday  Durbin also sent a letter to fellow Senators  urging them to join him in opposing the President   s proposal to lift the tariff on ethanol imports and stressing the need to commit to home grown ethanol production          If we allow the Administration to lift the tariff on Brazilian ethanol  and increase imports  we may find ourselves as dependent on foreign ethanol as we are on foreign oil     said Durbin      Illinois is currently the nation   s leading source of clean burning ethanol  and second in the nation in corn production   The 4 800 jobs created by Illinois     1 billion dollar investment in ethanol is only the beginning of opportunities for businesses and farmers across the nation   The President   s proposal to lift tariffs threatens to cut American ethanol development short and jeopardize our country   s quest for energy independence          Both the letter to the President and Durbin   s letter to his colleagues point out that the President has attempted to justify the proposal to lift ethanol tariffs with the unsupported claim that home grown ethanol has played a significant role in recent gas price increases   Durbin notes this claim is disputed by the President   s own Administration   The Energy Information Agency  EIA   the statistical agency of the U S  Department of Energy  recently held a press conference regarding their 2006 Short Term Energy Outlook report  where    EIA Administrator  Guy Caruso  stated that the MTBE phase out accounts for only  a few pennies  of the cost of gasoline          Text of both letters appears below           May 9  2006   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    We are greatly concerned about your sending mixed messages to the American people  the renewable fuels industry and Congress with respect to the promotion of domestic biofuels   As you know  the country is mired in a gas price crisis  and imports of petroleum are going up  not down   The Energy Information Administration of the U S  Department of Energy currently projects we will import as much as 70 percent of our petroleum needs by 2030       This is not the time to call into question the role that home grown renewable fuels can play in reducing prices at the pump and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil   We welcome your statements in support of ethanol and biofuels  but we disagree with your suggestion to an audience of renewable fuels advocates last month that ethanol is partly responsible for the run up in gasoline prices   In fact  ethanol makes up a fraction of the cost of a gallon of gasoline  the majority of which is the international price of crude oil  now hovering in the  70 75 per barrel range   In fact  if not for the increasing supply of ethanol in the marketplace  prices would be even higher       To the extent the phase out of MTBE may contribute to higher gasoline prices in some cases  that situation developed because the petroleum industry insisted on continuing to use MTBE  despite its known environmental risks  instead of making an orderly transition to ethanol much sooner   Now that those companies have finally realized that Congress is not going to exempt them from liability for MTBE   s environmental damages  they are switching to ethanol   That is not the fault of the ethanol industry   Hence we see no justification for waiving air quality standards  as you have suggested  simply because the petroleum industry has thus far favored MTBE and disfavored ethanol       Last week you called for repealing the tariff on imported ethanol  with the expectation that the United States would thus import more ethanol and bring down gasoline prices   This would be a serious mistake that would undermine a carefully targeted U S  tax incentive promoting the growth and development of our domestic renewable fuels industry   All the tariff does is offset the tax credit  so that it only goes to domestically produced ethanol   Without the tariff  our U S  tax incentive would help support ethanol production in foreign countries   Our focus must be on building energy security through domestically produced renewable fuels       In any case  ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices   We have sufficient ethanol production here at home  and it is expanding every day   The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that 500 million gallons of additional production capacity will be on line by early July of this year   That is enough to replace MTBE and to supply already existing ethanol markets   Meanwhile  there is no ready supply of foreign ethanol to be shipped to the United States   The other major ethanol producer  Brazil  recently lowered the mandated ethanol content of its national fuel portfolio from 25 percent to 20 percent because it is short of ethanol   Last year  the United States imported only 80 million gallons of ethanol from Caribbean countries  well short of the 270 million they are allowed to ship us tariff free under the Caribbean Basin Initiative  CBI        We also welcomed the call in your State of the Union speech earlier this year for increased federal investment to produce greater supplies of domestic ethanol   We want to work with you to make this investment a reality  but your Fiscal Year 2007  FY07  budget proposes less than half the funding for biomass energy research and development authorized in the energy bill you signed into law last year   What   s worse  where your budget does call for increased funding  it comes from reductions in other renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives   We urge you to reconsider your budget proposal and submit a revised budget request with adequate funding for these initiatives in light of the current energy crisis       Your Administration   s recent actions cannot be reconciled with the stated goals of your energy program   We urge you to abandon your focus on providing incentives to foreign countries to ship ethanol into the United States  to uphold air quality standards and to work with us to expand domestic renewable fuels production       Sincerely    Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL   Byron Dorgan  D ND   Tom Harkin  D IA   Tim Johnson D SD        May 9  2006  The Role of Ethanol in the Rising Cost of Gasoline  Supplies Are Meeting Demand   Dear Colleague    During the past few weeks  various media outlets have reported that ethanol shortages caused by the phase out of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether  MTBE  are responsible for the rising cost of gasoline   Recently  President Bush called on Congress to lift the tariff on imported ethanol   I would like to share with you the shortcomings in this approach to the issue       One of the most contentious proposals discussed during debate on last year   s Energy bill was a safe harbor provision that would have protected manufacturers and distributors of fuels containing the oxygenate MTBE from product liability claims   I was proud of the fact that the Senate stood firm in opposing efforts to shield producers and distributors of this groundwater contaminant from liabilities   While Congress did not ban the use of MTBE  most refiners reacted to Congressional action on the safe harbor provision by discontinuing the production and use of MTBE and developing plans to replace MTBE with ethanol       Many have claimed that the transition from MTBE to ethanol has created an ethanol shortage that is the root cause of soaring gas prices   While the transition from MTBE to ethanol has resulted in localized price increases and supply disruptions due to differences in the way ethanol is distributed and stored  currently there is no shortage of ethanol   According to a February 2006 Department of Energy  DoE  Energy Information Agency  EIA  report  the transition from MTBE to ethanol will create demand for 130 000 barrels per day  bpd  of ethanol   The most recent EIA ethanol production statistics show that in February 2006  production of ethanol reached a level of 302 000 bpd and that the United States had a 25 day supply of the fuel   In addition  CEOs of major oil companies and refiners  including Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil and William Klesse of Valero  have stated that there is sufficient ethanol to meet demand       It is important to note that oil companies and refiners are responsible for these temporary supply disruptions and localized price increases   These companies voluntarily phased out MTBE before they acted to secure supplies of ethanol to replace their troubled product   It was shortsightedness on the part of oil companies  not shortages of ethanol production that caused these temporary price increases       The EIA and energy industry analysts report that the voluntary switch from MTBE to ethanol accounts for only a few cents per gallon in the increased price of gasoline   The April 11  2006 EIA    Short Term Energy Outlook    reports that     While ethanol supplies are expected to remain tight this summer  sufficient new ethanol production capacity is under construction to replace MTBE and resume previous levels of discretionary ethanol blending in conventional gasoline in 2007   The phase out of MTBE is projected to increase slightly the average price of all gasoline      In a press conference discussing the report  EIA Administrator Guy Caruso stated that the MTBE phase out accounts for only    a few pennies    of the cost of gasoline   In the next year  ethanol capacity is expected to increase by 2 3 billion gallons  or 35   due to construction of 35 new ethanol plants and nine plant expansions  which should prevent future supply disruptions       Even though the Department of Energy  DoE  and CEOs of major oil companies agree that there is sufficient ethanol to meet demand  some are calling for Congress to lift the tariff on imported ethanol   While I am open to working with my colleagues on measures to provide relief to parts of the country experiencing supply disruptions due to the transition away from MTBE  I would like to explain why now is not the time to lift the tariff on ethanol       First  in light of production statistics  it is not necessary to ramp up the amount of ethanol we bring into the United States   Second  while Brazil   s ethanol industry is a global model for energy independence  that nation is not prepared to export significant amounts of ethanol to the United States at the current moment   With significant domestic demand for ethanol and rising global demand for sugar pushing up the price of cane  Brazil does not have enough ethanol to export significant quantities to the United States   In fact  Brazil recently reduced its mandated level of ethanol in gasoline from 25 to 20  due to tight supplies   In addition  under the Caribbean Basin Initiative  CBI   up to 7  of our domestic ethanol market  or 240 million gallons  may be imported duty free  However  ethanol imports have never come near the 7  cap  reaching 3   or 100 million gallons  in 2005   Therefore  lifting the tariff on ethanol would bring little new ethanol into the U S  market in 2006       In addition  it is a stated goal of the United States to use more renewable fuels and become more energy independent   By passing an aggressive Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  in the 2005 Energy bill  the Congress sent a clear signal to farmers and venture capitalists alike that the United States was ready to make a sincere commitment to developing a home grown  renewable source of energy to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and the despotic regimes that produce it   Brazil   s pursuit of a similar    Pro Alcohol    program following the OPEC oil crises of the 1970s led that nation to provide subsidized loans and tax incentives to producers  mandate a national fuel blending requirement of 25   and levy a 20  ad valorem protective duty against ethanol imports   In 30 years  Brazil has gone from being a nation reliant on foreign oil to one that is a net exporter of energy   Lifting our tariff on imported ethanol now  when ethanol accounts for less than 3  of all transportation fuel used in the United States  would dramatically undermine our stated commitment to home grown renewable energy  and promote the ethanol industries of our trade partners       Last  the development of a domestic ethanol industry means significant wealth development and job creation for rural communities around the country   In Illinois alone  investment by the ethanol industry exceeds  1 billion and has generated 800 jobs in plant operations and 4 000 jobs in secondary industries   Nationwide  21 states have at least one ethanol plant  and as industry and science continue to unlock the secrets of cellulosic ethanol  rural communities all across the country will build ethanol facilities and benefit from the development of this home grown fuel       I look forward to working with you to facilitate the growth of one of the most promising alternatives to foreign sources of energy       Sincerely       Richard J  Durbin                                                U S  Senator
