April 23  2007   WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Maria Cantwell  D WA  today sent a letter to U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach asking him to identify the companies that were recipients of the contaminated rice protein shipments from China and to request that the FDA identify and inspect all suspect pet food ingredients imported by the U S  from China and other countries       Recent reports indicate that in addition to the contaminated wheat gluten found during the first wave of pet food recalls  contaminated shipments of rice protein and corn gluten have been used for pet food and could have entered the human food supply   On April 2nd  a Chinese company  Binzhou Futian  sold rice protein to Wilbur Ellis and a second unknown importer  Wilbur Ellis has said that the shipment was distributed to five pet food manufacturers   Three of those manufacturers have revealed themselves and recalled food  the other two have not       Given the strong possibility that these two pet food manufacturers also received contaminated rice protein and that they have failed to implement voluntary recalls  Durbin and Cantwell today asked FDA to release the names of these manufacturers and require them to trace and recall any pet food made with the potentially contaminated rice protein   The Senators have also asked that the name of the second importer be released       Last week  Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  met with U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach in Durbin s Capitol office to discuss the latest recall of pet food  this time caused by contaminated rice protein imported from China   In the meeting  Durbin and DeLauro learned that the Chinese Government has blocked requests from the FDA to send personnel to China to inspect the facilities suspected of producing the contaminated products  The FDA first contacted the Chinese Government on April 4  2007  but have not been granted permission to send food inspectors into the country   In response  Durbin and DeLauro sent a letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States  Zhou Wenzong  urging the Chinese Government to issue visas to U S  food inspectors as quickly as possible       Two weeks ago  Durbin and Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing the FDA s response to the pet food recall   The hearing examined the timeline of the investigation  the source of the contamination  and the agency s regulatory and inspection responsibilities   In the hearing  the Senators also questioned outside experts   about the current state of the pet food industry  as well as regulatory or resource shortfalls that led to the widespread recall of tainted pet food       Text of the letter appears below         April 23  2007   Commissioner Andrew C  von Eschenbach  M D   Parklawn Bldg   Mail Code  HF 1  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  MD 20856   Dear Commissioner    We are writing today in light of the recent expansion in the pet food recall   Over the past week  shipments of imported rice protein and corn gluten have been discovered to be contaminated with melamine   In addition  we have learned that the human food supply may be at risk from tainted pet food sold to a hog feeding operation in California       Once again  our food supply has been put at risk by contaminated ingredients that originated overseas and were never inspected by the FDA   In addition to identifying those companies who were recipients of the contaminated rice protein and have yet to do the right thing by identifying themselves  we request that the FDA begin comprehensive testing and sampling of both rice protein and corn gluten  similar to the testing and sampling performed on wheat gluten   The FDA must assure Congress and the American people that the shipments of rice protein known to be contaminated with melamine imported by Wilbur Ellis and the second unknown importer are the only shipments of contaminated rice protein to reach the United States and that no contaminated corn gluten has reached the United States  Should any additional contaminated rice protein or corn gluten be found  the FDA should take immediate action to identify those companies receiving the contaminated products and press for removal of any contaminated food from the market   Additionally  we request that the FDA conduct comprehensive testing on all pet food about which it has received complaints regarding symptoms of kidney failure in dogs or cats   The FDA s strategy thus far of waiting for companies to self report contamination and make the individual decision to remove contaminated food in their own time frame has served to increase the number of animals sick and dying and magnify this sad situation       Repeatedly  American pet owners have been told that products not on the recall list are safe for their pets  only to discover that the recall has expanded and that their pets may still be vulnerable   In order to prevent further contaminated food from reaching our shelves  we are requesting the following of the Food and Drug Administration       1  Wilbur Ellis Co   the San Francisco based company that imported the shipment of contaminated rice protein has said that the shipment was distributed to five pet food manufacturers   Three of those manufacturers have revealed themselves and recalled food  the other two have not   Given the strong possibility that these two pet food manufacturers also received contaminated rice protein and that they have failed to implement voluntary recalls  we believe the FDA should release the names of these manufacturers and require them to trace and recall any pet food made with the potentially contaminated rice protein   If FDA is unable to reveal this information  we ask for a detailed legal explanation       2  We have learned that in addition to Wilbur Ellis  a second United States company imported a shipment of rice protein from China that is also likely to be contaminated with melamine   We request the FDA identify this second importer as well as those manufacturers to which it may have sold the contaminated product   Again  we request the FDA closely track this shipment and immediately press the affected companies to recall any food containing the imported rice protein       3   The FDA has engaged in significant testing and sampling of wheat gluten   Given we now know contaminated shipments of both rice protein concentrate and corn gluten have also been exported from China  we ask the FDA to begin comprehensive testing and sampling of rice protein concentrate and corn gluten immediately       4  We have seen this recall expand dramatically  both in terms of the number of brands and different products recalled  and in the number of ingredients contaminated   In light of the strong possibility that these protein sources were purposefully contaminated for economic purposes  we are concerned about the safety of other imported pet food ingredients and the possibility of them being contaminated   Accordingly  we ask the FDA to proactively respond by      Identifying and inspecting all suspect pet food ingredients imported by the U S  from China and other countries  Studying the feasibility of testing protein based pet food ingredients imported from China and other countries for melamine  Taking steps to work with the Chinese Government and other foreign governments to inspect their facilities and provide technical assistance to improve their food safety standards    Approximately 63  of Americans own a cat or a dog   The FDA owes the American public their best effort to prevent contaminated food from getting to store shelves and to remove contaminated food that is already on shelves before more pets die  We look forward to the Food and Drug Administration s prompt and complete response to this letter       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Maria E  Cantwell  United States Senator
