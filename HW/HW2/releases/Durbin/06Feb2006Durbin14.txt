     DURBIN SAYS PRESIDENT   S BUDGET IS    OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE NEEDS OF ILLINOIS AND THE NATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2 6 2006                                                                                                                                                                            DURBIN SAYS PRESIDENT   S BUDGET IS    OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE NEEDS OF ILLINOIS AND THE NATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Monday  February 6  2006           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said the budget the President sent to Capitol Hill today is out of touch with the needs facing residents of Illinois and other Americans  Durbin said that the Bush budget would increase the nation   s public debt to nearly  8 trillion  cut 2 1 billion from the federal education budget and reduce the funding for medical research into diseases such as cancer and heart disease        The President   s annual budget is our first opportunity since the State of the Union to understand the Administration   s priorities for the nation  The budget received today continues a failed tax policy at the expense of middle income families  shortchanges education  reduces resources for firefighters and law enforcement and reverses a national commitment to vital medical research     said Durbin          Americans are struggling to pay home heating costs  yet the President   s budget cuts funding to help the most vulnerable in our nation pay their bills             Our children are lagging behind academically and states are struggling to fund public schools  yet the President is proposing the largest education cuts in history             The 9 11 Commission and the Bush administration warn that we are still at high risk of terrorist attack  yet the President   s budget cuts homeland security grants to states and funding for police and firefighters             Medical discoveries that could save lives and money are within reach yet the President   s budget cuts funding for the National Institutes of Health for the first time in 26 years          The administration   s insistence on hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax breaks for the wealthy is driving up our national debt and forcing deep cuts in domestic programs   We need to be more responsible  We need to make funding for education  heating assistance  and basic health insurance our top priorities   This budget puts them last          Durbin noted that when the President took office in 2001  his economic experts had predicted that the U S  would run a  5 trillion surplus over the next decade   The U S  is now expected to run an  8 trillion dollar deficit over that same time       Durbin said the following line items of the President   s new budget pose particular problems for Illinois       Education    The President proposes to cut education by  2 1 billion  the largest cut in the 26 year history of the Education Department       For the fifth year in a row  the President s budget again fails to fully fund the federal No Child Left Behind  NCLB  act   The shortfall for 2007 is  15 4 billion  in Illinois the shortfall is  530 million which could have served an additional 159 000 Illinois school children       In addition  for the second year in a row  the President   s budget cuts the federal funding for special education  In Illinois  cuts for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA  amount to  283 million less than promised       The President s budget includes funding for math and science   a goal Senator Durbin has championed for years   But the President pays for his math and science initiatives by cutting 42 existing programs aimed at helping disadvantaged students  in pre school through college   Two programs which help disadvantaged students get into and succeed in college     GEAR UP and TRIO are directly affected   These cuts include the elimination of nearly all federal vocational education programs   In Illinois  Chicago GEAR UP recently received  49 million and Northeastern Illinois University and the Illinois Dept  of Human Services received  8 2 million and  3 5 million  respectively  in GEAR UP grants   Through the three TRIO programs the President has proposed cutting  Illinois received a total of  17 8 million in 2004 and was able to serve 19 407 disadvantaged students       For the fourth year in a row  the President s budget makes college expensive by freezing the maximum Pell grant at  4 050 and eliminating the Perkins Loan program  which provides low interest loans to help needy students       Health Care    Despite his promise in the State of the Union address  the President   s budget contains no new meaningful initiatives to lower health care costs or reduce the number of uninsured Americans   The President recommends reducing spending for Medicare by  36 billion over the next five years   Over the next ten years  as the baby boomers retire  the President   s budget would reduce Medicare spending by  105 billion dollars       The President   s budget cuts funding for 18 of the 19 Institutes at the National Institutes of Health  NIH     Our leading agency on medical research has lost  1 billion in constant dollars since 2003 and the President proposes to freeze the overall NIH budget at current year levels    To pay for an increase in bioterror and avian flu research  the President is cutting research that could advance treatments for cancer  heart disease and stroke  Lou Gehrig s disease  autism  and diabetes are all cut back in the President s budget       The President    budget also recommends cuts in several federal health grant programs   The budget cuts Children   s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education funding nationwide by 67 percent   The Children   s Memorial Hospital in Chicago    one of several hospitals in the state to benefit from the program    received  10 2 million in 2004 and  10 1 million in 2005   The program is essential to train the very best medical professionals to serve our children       The President   s budget eliminates Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants   These grants help maintain and upgrade small hospitals in rural areas  and coordinate and improve health care delivery in rural parts of the country   In Illinois  51 Critical Access Hospitals received a total of  625 000  650 000 from this grant       The budget eliminates a federal program that helps pay malpractice premiums for doctors who treat patients in free clinics      I have met many of these selfless professionals who ask for no pay but only insurance protection to continue their fine work     Durbin noted       President   s budget also eliminates The Area Health Education Centers  AHEC  grant program which improves access to health care services  predominantly primary health care  through projects and activities that link health professions education with communities   The Illinois AHEC Program  led by the Illinois Health Education Consortium  was established in 1991   These Illinois communities are largely those urban and rural regions where there are medically underserved populations and or health professions shortage areas   The participants are Midwestern University  University of Illinois  Southern Illinois University  Illinois Department of Public Health  Chicago Department of Public Health  Illinois Primary Health Care Association  and Illinois Rural Health Association       The President   s budget eliminates the federal grant program for Allied Health Professionals  which trains people in medical technology  nutrition and other allied health fields experiencing critical shortages       Homeland Security   First Responders    The President   s budget dramatically cuts funding for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 78 percent  eliminates the The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  and deeply cuts two programs to hire and train firefighters       The proposed cuts in COPS funding will be a serious setback for Illinois communities   Since 1994  Illinois law enforcement agencies have been awarded more than  422 7 million in COPS grants for community policing efforts   COPS grants have funded 5 530 additional police officers and sheriff   s deputies in Illinois   682 local and state law enforcement agencies in Illinois have benefited from COPS funding  and  22 million has been awarded to hire 182 school resource offices to improve safety for students  teachers and administrators in Illinois elementary and high schools   An additional  50 3 million has been awarded to enhance crime fighting technologies  allowing Illinois law enforcement officers to spend more time on the streets preventing and fighting crime       The amount of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased nearly tenfold between 1997 and 2003  so ending the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funds would severely hamper regional methamphetamine task forces and several crime prevention programs       The President s budget completely eliminates SAFER firefighter hiring program  which provides funding to fire departments to hire additional fire fighters and first responders   In Illinois  over  1 3 million was awarded to fire departments for hiring recruiting additional fire fighters in 2005   The budget also reduces funding for the FIRE program  from  545 million to  293 million in FY2007   In Illinois  over  25 million was awarded to IL fire departments for equipment in 2005   This program provides equipment and training to fire departments in Illinois and across the country to help them prepare and respond to terrorist incidents       Energy    The President s budget cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to just  1 782 billion from  2 161 billion   LIHEAP funds assist low income households in covering rising residential energy costs   Only two states typically receive more LIHEAP funds than Illinois  and last year the state received nearly  113 million in assistance   In a year when many Illinois residents have seen home heating costs double  the budget for Illinois would be cut by more that  11 million       The President   s budget cuts energy efficiency programs from  316 million to  225 million  a decrease of 28    One of these programs  D O E  s Weatherization Program that has provided weatherization services to more than 5 3 million low income families  nationwide  would see a reduction in funds of  78 4 million    For 2006  5 002 Illinois homes are expected to receive   weatherization assistance    Based on a 33  reduction in the weatherization budget  1 668 families would not receive weatherization assistance next year       National Guard    The President   s budget cuts the Army  s end strength by one combat brigade and the National Guard  s end strength  by six brigades    about 17 000 Guard soldiers   Last year  after a top to bottom force review  Army leaders said they need a total of 77 combat brigades to meet mission requirements  At that force level  they said  active duty combat soldiers would spend one year out of three away from their families  and Guard and Reserve troops would spend 18 months away from their families every five or six years   America has relied more heavily on the National Guard in Iraq than in any war since World War II   And more than 50 000 Guard troops were called to respond to Hurricane Katrina       Veterans    The President   s budget would force more than 50 000 Illinois veterans with incomes as low as  25 842 per year to pay more for their health care   Illinois veterans will be hit with a  250 annual fee to participate in the VA healthcare system and their monthly prescription drug costs will more than double     going up to  15 per month from the current  8 for a 30 day supply of medication       In addition  the Department of Veterans Affairs has consistently underestimated the agency   s true costs in three areas   acute hospital care patients  psychiatric patients and the number of total medical visits have all exceeded VA   s projections in three of the last four years   Already more than one million American troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   More than 10 000 soldiers have been wounded in action   Mental health professionals estimate that at least 16 percent of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   requiring psychiatric treatment       Defense    The Department of Defense budget hit a record  439 3 billion  and that figure does not include the majority of projected spending in Iraq and Afghanistan   The White House has already announced that it will seek an additional  70 billion in emergency funds for the two wars  and that it will ask for  70 billion more in FY07       The Pentagon has again failed to fully incorporate these enormous costs into the national security budget   The DOD budget does not include specific funding requests for critical activities including the training of Iraqi Security Forces   In 2006  the training of Iraqi police and security forces cost an estimated  4 4 billion   That effort and that money are critical to a successful transition in 2006 in which Iraqi forces must take the lead in defending their own people and territory  but these costs are not incorporated into the national budget   Congress has supported every Pentagon request for funds for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and would support increased assistance for the training of Iraqi security forces   Like other costs of the war  however  Iraqi troop training should be addressed as part of this budget  rather than managed through repeated supplemental requests       Economic Development    The President s 2007 Budget would once again derail Amtrak by allocating  900 million for Amtrak service nationwide   700 million less than what the rail line needs to operate   The cuts could force closure of some routes   Chicago and 29 other communities in Illinois that serve over 3 million people would see a reduction or possible shutdown of Amtrak service       The President   s budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by   765 million   Illinois will lose  27 million  threatening funding for new runway construction at O   Hare and improvement at airports such as Waukegan  Palwaukee  Cahokia  and Robinson       Mine Safety    The President   s budget claims to have increased mine safety funding by  11 million   In fact  nearly all that increase will be wiped out by inflation  leaving no new dollars to hire the 130 inspectors Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  says it needs   In Illinois  six new coal mines have opened since 2005 and it ranks third in the nation in coal production   Four of the six budgets President Bush has proposed since taking office have cut MSHA funding       Child Care    The President   s budget cuts the Social Services Block Grant  SSBG  by  500 million  from  3 billion to  2 5 billion   Much of this funding is devoted to child care funding assistance to help working families provide a safe environment for their children   Illinois is projected to receive  73 6 million in SSBG funding in FY2006   The proposed cut would take more than  12 million out of Illinois s budget for child care and other supportive services provided to families       The budget also provides no inflation adjustment for after school programs provided through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program   The funding for this program would remain flat at  981 million   1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion authorized for FY2007   In Illinois  46 community based organizations receive  16 8 million to serve students in 21st Century Community Learning Centers   The shortfall in funding leaves behind two million students  who would be receiving before  and after school services and summer opportunities if the program were funded at the level promised in the No Child Left Behind Act   If the program were fully funded  Illinois would receive  101 3 million in FY2007   Under the President s budget  the state is projected to receive only  40 2 million  leaving more than 82 000 Illinois students without access to a local program   Parents of these children will continue to wonder where their children are between the time school is dismissed and the time the parents can arrive home from work
