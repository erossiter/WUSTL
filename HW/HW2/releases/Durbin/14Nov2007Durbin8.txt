Underscores Need for Durbin Mortgage Foreclosure Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wednesday  November 14  2007        A troubling new housing report  released today by the Center for Responsible Lending forecasts that foreclosures on risky  subprime loans will negatively affect homeowners to the tune of nearly  225 billion in the coming years  Legislation introduced last month by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  would help nearly 638 000 families  a quarter of the 2 2 million people at risk of foreclosure  keep their homes by allowing them to modify the terms of their loan in bankruptcy proceedings     The Center for Responsible Lending report shows that in Illinois  one of the states hardest hit by the subprime market collapse  foreclosures are expected to affect nearly 3 million neighboring homes  at a cost of  17 5 billion  Cook County  Illinois  is singled out as one of the hardest hit counties in the nation     The report notes that of the 150 000 Cook County homeowners with subprime mortgages  nearly 20  are expected to lose their homes to foreclosure  Because foreclosures affect property values of nearby homes as well  nearly 2 million other families throughout the county would see their home values decrease by an average of  7 559  Cook County is home to 5 2 million people   Todays report shows that millions of Americans need our help to ensure their dream of owning a home  This is especially true in Cook County and other parts of Illinois  Durbin said  Congress must take action now to keep people in their homes and to maintain property values in at risk neighborhoods  If we don t act these numbers show that an already bad situation could become catastrophic for homeowners and communities across the country    Durbins bill  The Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act  helps individuals prevent foreclosure  and surrounding homes and neighborhoods wont be negatively impacted to the extent they would if the homes in question were foreclosed upon  Everyone  from lender  to homeowner  to community  would be better off under the terms of this bill than if the homes enter foreclosure    Today  virtually every type of personal debt  including vacation homes and family farms  can be restructured in bankruptcy with the exception of mortgages on a primary residence  This exception dates to the 1970 s  when most mortgages were fixed rate  long term agreements between local bankers and their neighborhood customers  The mortgage market has changed considerably since the 1970s  such that mortgages on primary residences are often now the primary cause of financial distress  This bill would help the bankruptcy code catch up with this shift    To help families save their homes  the Durbin bill would   Eliminate a provision of the bankruptcy law that prohibits modifications to mortgage loans on the debtors primary residence  so that primary mortgages are treated the same as vacation homes and family farms    Extend the time frame debtors are allowed for repayment  to support long term mortgage restructuring    Waive the bankruptcy counseling requirement for families whose houses are already scheduled for foreclosure sale  so that precious time is not lost as families fight to save their homes   To further help families get back on their feet financially as they go through bankruptcy  the bill would also   Combat excessive fees that are sometimes charged to debtors in bankruptcy    Maintain debtors legal claims against predatory lenders while in bankruptcy    Reinforce that bankruptcy judges can rule on core issues rather than deferring to arbitration    Enact a higher homestead floor for homeowners over the age of 55  to help older homeowners who are fighting to keep their homes as they go through bankruptcy but live in states with low homestead floors    Reinforce that consumer protection claims are still available in bankruptcy   Durbins bill has received broad support from groups which include  AARP  AFL CIO  Consumer Federation of America  Consumers Union  NAACP  National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys  National Council of La Raza  National Fair Housing Alliance  National Urban League and SEIU
