FDA TO FIX IPLEDGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Monday  June 12  2006       U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Judd Gregg  R NH   along with senators from both political parties  today sent a letter to the Acting Commissioner of U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Andrew Eschenbach  urging the FDA to address problems associated with the implementation of the iPLEDGE program   The iPLEDGE program was established in March of 2006 to help prevent pregnancy among women taking the acne drug Accutane  which can cause severe birth defects   Durbin serves on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services and Gregg is the former chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   Both Senators support the risk management goals of the program       In the letter  the Senators noted     our offices continue to receive numerous complaints from doctors  patients  and pharmacists about the inflexible and confusing requirements that have denied access to the drug to thousands of qualified patients during the course of therapy    FDA needs to act quickly to improve the operation of this program and ensure that its goals are met          The iPLEDGE program was launched by the Food and Drug Administration and requires those involved with prescribing  supplying  or using the acne drug Accutane to register and accept certain responsibilities such as turning in forms associated with pregnancy test results and commitments to use multiple forms of birth control   Since its implementation  the program has been cited as the source of numerous problems  including increasing risks associated with the drug by unnecessarily causing its extended use  undermining the integrity of patient physician relationships  and causing a number of dermatologists to stop prescribing the medication altogether       Additional signatories to the letter include Senators Pat Roberts  R KS   Ron Wyden  D OR   Bob Bennett  R UT   Russ Feingold  D WI   Orrin Hatch  R UT   and Chris Dodd  D CT             Andrew C  von Eschenbach  MD                                            Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs  U S  Food and Drug Administration  Parklawn Building  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  MD  20857   Dear Acting Commissioner Eschenbach    We are writing to express our concern over the implementation of the iPLEDGE program for isotretinoin  Accutane   and request that you work with stakeholders  program sponsors and the program vendor to address the procedural barriers plaguing the operation of the program       As you know  the    iPLEDGE    program was launched on March 1  2006  and is based on recommendations made in 2004 by the FDA Advisory Committees on Dermatologic Drugs  and Drug Safety and Risk Management   We understand the program has been a tremendous undertaking for FDA   To date  nearly 95 000 patients and 15 000 prescribers are activated in the program       We applaud your response to concerns about the operational aspects of the program raised by dermatologists  patient advocates  and pharmacists in early February   However  despite these efforts  our offices continue to receive numerous complaints from doctors  patients  and pharmacists about the inflexible and confusing requirements that have denied access to the drug to thousands of qualified patients during the course of therapy       We are very concerned that the interruptions in therapy caused by the iPLEDGE program are increasing the risk associated with taking isotretinoin by unnecessarily causing the extended use of the drug   In addition  we are concerned that iPLEDGE is undermining the integrity of the patient physician relationship   Finally  we are disheartened to hear that the program   s administrative burdens are causing some dermatologists to stop prescribing this medication     thereby further reducing access to the drug   In short  FDA needs to act quickly to improve the operation of this program and ensure that its goals are met       Thank you for your consideration and continued efforts to ensure that the goals of this program are achieved
