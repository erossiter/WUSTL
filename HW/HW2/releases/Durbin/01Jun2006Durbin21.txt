ASK CONGRESS TO FUND CHICAGO RAIL MODERNIZATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Thursday  June 1  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  Chairman Kit Bond  R MO  and Ranking Democrat Patty Murray  D WA  urging them to fund the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program  CREATE    CREATE is designed to modernize the Chicago railroad system and would significantly reduce rail and motorist traffic congestion  protect and promote local economic development  and decrease dependence on foreign crude oil          Chicago is at the crossroads of the nation s rail network  but rail congestion not only ties up traffic and adds to pollution  it threatens our economic growth   said Durbin    Our antiquated rail systems could cost Chicago businesses  2 billion and 17 000 jobs over the next twenty years             Congress needs to do its part to ensure that rail traffic remains a safe and efficient means of moving cargo across the country     said Obama     This modernization of our rail systems in the Chicago area will help grow our economy and is crucial if Illinois is to remain the crossroads of our nation          The  1 5 billion CREATE program was designed as a public private partnership to decrease congestion in the Chicago area by removing 25 grade crossings and 6 rail to rail crossings by building flyovers or underpasses   So far CREATE has only received about 5 percent of what it needs in recent federal funding measures       Durbin and Obama noted that lengthy transit times have discouraged Chicago area businesses from using rail transport and has caused them turn to more costly truck transport   In the letter  the Illinois lawmakers explain that CREATE would increase rail traffic speed    from 9 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour  saving shippers  40 million per year in reduced inventory costs      Furthermore  if congested rail areas  known as    choke points    were reduced and    10  of goods currently shipped via truck were instead shipped by rail  fuel savings would approach one billion gallons per year      With these improvements  rail transport would become a clear alternative to trucking for Chicago area businesses       CREATE would also help Chicago area residents commuting by Metra  Amtrak or car save a significant amount of time and money   Today  the average Chicago area motorist spends 300  more time in traffic than they did 20 years ago   In today   s letter  Durbin and Obama noted that CREATE would save commuters    3 000 hours per day in lost time idling at railroad crossings      and the decrease in motorist delays at railroad crossings would reduce carbon monoxide emissions another 400 million tons by 2042      Metra commuters would also benefit  with  190 million in time savings          If we are going to get serious about reducing our dependence of foreign oil  we need to take a close look at how our urban transportation infrastructure operates     said Durbin      Rail transport is more than three times more energy efficient than truck transport  It is time to modernize the Chicago rail system and lay the foundation for future energy savings            June 1  2006   Chairman Christopher S  Bond  Subcommittee on Transportation   Treasury  and HUD Appropriations  130 Dirksen Building  Washington  D C   20510   Ranking Member Patty Murray  Subcommittee on Transportation   Treasury  and HUD Appropriations  128 Dirksen Building  Washington  D C   20510   Dear Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Murray    As the Subcommittee considers the Fiscal Year  FY  2007 Transportation  Treasury  Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies Appropriations measure  we write to express our strong support for  350 million to fully fund the Capital Grants program for Rail Line Relocation and Improvement projects at the Department of Transportation   This program would provide grants for relocation or grade separation of rail tracks that are interfering with a community   s motor vehicle traffic flow  its quality of life  or its economic development       This program was authorized by Section 9002 of the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU  in 2005   Under this measure  Congress authorized  350 million per year from FY 2006 through FY 2009  but subsequent appropriations measures and the President   s 2007 Budget Proposal have not included funding for this critical program       By fully funding the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement grant program  Congress could take a significant step toward modernizing our nation   s antiquated rail infrastructure and preparing our transportation system to meet the demands of the 21st Century   Rail transportation provides numerous public benefits  including fuel conservation  pollution reduction  relief of traffic congestion  protection of public safety on our nation   s highways  and promotion of economic development       The economic and environmental benefits of hauling goods by rail are clear  as one train can haul an average of 280 truck trailers  and railroads can move one ton of freight an average of 410 miles on just one gallon of fuel   That is more than three times as energy efficient as trucks moving the same amount of freight   However  in this 21st century on demand economy  shippers and businesses often eschew moving their goods by rail due to the lengthy transit times caused by congested railroad chokepoints   If these bottlenecks were relieved and 10  of the goods currently shipped by truck were instead shipped by rail  fuel savings would approach one billion gallons per year       One of these intermodal chokepoints is in Chicago  a region through which nearly one third of the nation   s freight rail traffic passes each year   Six of the seven North American Class I freight railroads converge in Chicago  which serves as the switching yard for America   s eastern and western railroads   Chicago presently handles more than 37 500 freight rail cars per day and is expected to handle 67 000 freight rail cars daily within 20 years    Chicago also serves more than 2 5 million rail passengers per year as Amtrak   s Midwest hub   Likewise  Metra  the region   s commuter rail agency  operates 700 trains per week out of its Chicago hub and serves 300 000 city and suburban passengers daily  sharing track with freight rail on 11 of the region   s rail lines   This mix of various modes of rail traffic  along with heavy truck and automotive traffic that intersects with these rail lines in the nation   s third largest city  often forces the nation   s freight rail traffic to come to a halt in the Chicago region       The  1 5 billion Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency  CREATE  Program was developed as a public private partnership to help both railroads and the Chicago area cope with this sharp increase in freight volume  while also producing considerable improvements for motorists  commuter rail  and Amtrak passengers   CREATE would unclog the Chicago rail system by building 25 highway to rail grade separations and six rail to rail grade separations   This would allow average rail traffic speeds to increase from 9 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour  saving shippers  40 million per year in reduced inventory costs       The benefits to the nation would be manifold   Most notably  the CREATE program would reduce the nation   s diesel fuel consumption by 7 million gallons per year in the short term and 18 million gallons per year by 2042   Locomotive emissions would be reduced by over 2 000 tons of nitrogen and 500 tons of carbon monoxide  and the decrease in motorist delays at railroad crossings would reduce carbon monoxide emissions another 400 million tons by 2042   Passenger rail commuters would save  190 million worth of time formerly spent on travel delays  and Chicago area motorists would regain 3 000 hours per day in time formerly lost idling at railroad crossings    This equates to a savings of over 200 000 gallons of gas per year for motorists alone   Moreover  grade separation of highway rail crossings would reduce the high number of fatal accidents that happen at these intersections each year   In 2005  the Chicago region had the highest number of recorded fatalities at highway rail crossings in the nation  with 15       CREATE needs federal rail grant funds such as those authorized in Section 9002 of SAFETEA LU to successfully finish the program  or else Chicago will lose  2 billion in production and 17 000 jobs over the next two decades   Other rail intensive cities around America will also witness an economic loss if the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement grant program is not fully funded to help modernize urban rail hubs and combat worsening traffic congestion   The amount of time the average commuter spends in traffic has nearly tripled in the past 20 years and commute times are expected to get much worse  with truck traffic projected to double in the next 20 years       In order to reduce truck  automotive  and rail traffic congestion  reduce America   s dependence on foreign crude oil  expand the use of passenger rail  increase safety  and benefit the nation   s economy  the Capitol Grants for Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Program must be fully funded   We respectfully request that the Committee provide the full  350 million authorized in the law    Funding of rail relocation and grade separation projects will yield immense returns on infrastructure investment and move the nation   s transportation system closer to peak efficiency well into the 21st Century       Thank you for your consideration of this request   Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator
