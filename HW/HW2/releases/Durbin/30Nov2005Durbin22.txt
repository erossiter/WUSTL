

ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO ADDRESS SERIOUS CONCERNS RAISED IN GAO REPORT ON TERRORIST FINANCING                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  November 30  2005       Following the release of a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Chuck Grassley  R IA  and Susan Collins  R ME  today called on President Bush to address the serious problems that continue to undermine our attempts to track  target  and cut off the flow of funds to terrorists   The GAO report  which was requested by Durbin  along with Grassley and Collins  found that The U S  government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the delivery of counter terrorism financing training and technical assistance to countries it deems vulnerable to terrorist financing   In a letter to President Bush  the Senators urged the President to review the recommendations raised in the GAO report and instruct the cabinet officers and agency heads to undertake needed changes and improve coordination of their efforts   The Senators encouraged the President to instruct the Secretaries of State and Treasury  in conjunction with the National Security Council and other relevant agencies  to develop and carry out an integrated strategic plan to coordinate the delivery of training and technical assistance to combat terrorist financing  Such a strategy should address the concerns raised above  Additionally  the Senators said that a Memorandum of Agreement is needed to clarify roles  resolve disputes  and coordinate funding and resources for counter terrorism financing and anti money laundering training and technical assistance   In their letter to the President  the Senators cited the lack of progress since the GAOs last report on terrorist financing in 2003 and the apparent resistance within the executive departments to recognizing the need for improved coordination mechanisms and an integrated strategic plan   The financing of terrorist activities is unquestionably a matter of critical national security  and we know that the coordination of our efforts has not been an easy task to undertake It is important that Congress knows how and when you will be implementing the GAO recommendations  Please provide this information by January 13  2006  they concluded   The reports can be seen by visiting the GAO website  www gao gov   The full text of the letter to President Bush appears below   November 30  2005  The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500  Dear Mr  President   In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  we initiated an inquiry with the Government Accountability Office  then still the General Accounting Office  into methods of terrorist financing   In 2003  having received a general overview from the GAO  we submitted a follow up request to address the effectiveness and coordination of U S  efforts to combat terrorist financing in greater detail   We have now received the GAOs assessment of those efforts  its report points to serious problems that continue to undermine our attempts to track  target  and cut off the flow of funds to terrorists   We hope that you will review the GAO recommendations carefully and instruct the cabinet officers and agency heads to undertake needed changes and improve coordination of their efforts   We are particularly concerned about the need to better coordinate U S  efforts  to work more effectively with international partners  and to create a cohesive strategy to advance our goals   The urgent need to improve coordination and communication across agency and institutional lines was highlighted as well by the 9 11 Commission and congressional intelligence reform efforts as critical to improving security   In its report  the GAO found that  The U S  government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the delivery of counter terrorism financing training and technical assistance to countries it deems vulnerable to terrorist financing  There appear to be inter departmental disputes among the Departments of State  Justice  and Treasury over roles and leadership  disparities between actual needs and resources distribution  and a lack of systems to evaluate overall performance and incorporate those results into current and future planning efforts   Moreover  the GAO also reported shortfalls in accountability to Congress  including insufficiencies in annual reports and  again the absence of meaningful performance measures to assess effectiveness   In its report  the GAO offered a number of recommendations which we respectfully urge you to implement   Specifically  we encourage you to instruct the Secretaries of State and Treasury  in conjunction with the National Security Council and other relevant agencies  to develop and carry out an integrated strategic plan to coordinate the delivery of training and technical assistance to combat terrorist financing   Such a strategy should address the concerns raised above   We also concur with the GAO that a Memorandum of Agreement is needed to clarify roles  resolve disputes  and coordinate funding and resources for counter terrorism financing and anti money laundering training and technical assistance   Performance measures are needed both to evaluate success and failure and to improve planning efforts   Reports to Congress need to include more complete information so that we can better fulfill our oversight responsibilities   We request that information on the status of the development and implementation of the integrated strategic plan and Memorandum of Agreement be included in reports to Congress from the Departments of Treasury and State   We were disturbed by the apparent resistance from the Departments of State and Treasury  in particular  to many of the GAOs findings and recommendations   The tenor and comment of their responses indicate a general unwillingness on the part of the departments to recognize the need for improved coordination mechanisms and an integrated strategic plan   We find it disturbing that the 2003 GAO report cited above raised many concerns similar to the latest report   These recommendations are far too critical in achieving success in combating terrorist financing   We cannot simply continue to ignore these shortcomings that threaten our national security   The financing of terrorist activities is unquestionably a matter of critical national security  and we know that the coordination of our efforts has not been an easy task to undertake   However  we strongly urge you to review and implement the recommendations outlined above and in the GAO report  as well as the 2003 GAO report so that we can combat this growing and persistent threat more effectively   It is important that Congress knows how and when you will be implementing the GAO recommendations   Please provide this information by January 13  2006   Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator  Charles Grassley  United States Senator  Susan Collins  United States Senator
