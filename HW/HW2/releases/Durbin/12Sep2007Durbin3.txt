on Toy Safety Focuses on Problems with Chinese Imports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wednesday  September 12  2007   Washington  DC   Following months of recalls of Chinese manufactured toys  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  convened a Senate oversight hearing focused on toy safety today  The hearing included testimony from Consumer Product Safety Commissioners Nancy Nord and Thomas Moore  the CEO s of the nations largest toy manufacturer and retailer    Mattel and Toys R Us  and representatives of the Toy Industry Association  Consumers Union and American National Standards Institute      More than 25 million Chinese manufactured toys have been recalled this summer alone  That is a staggering number and an indictment of our toy safety system  Durbin said  For years CPSC has been neglected and under funded  resulting in reductions of staff levels and weakened standards  The events of the last four months have shown us the dangers lax authority and limited resources pose to our children  We re here today to address the problem     Durbin noted that since it s inception in 1973  the CPSC s staffing levels have decreased by almost 60 percent  from an all time high of 978 inspectors and full time employees in 1980 to 401 today  the lowest level in history  Meanwhile the number of products over which the CPSC has jurisdiction is enormous  the 401 employees at the agency today are responsible for overseeing more than 15 000 types of consumer goods  Today  a single individual is responsible for testing all toys at the CPSC     After discovering that a toy I purchased for my grandson was recalled in May  I asked myself the same question parents across the country are asking today   who is in charge  The answer is that there is one employee at the Consumer Product Safety Commission responsible for testing toys and ensuring toy safety throughout the country  Durbin said  That is not acceptable     Earlier this summer  Durbin introduced the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act  which addresses some of the resource and regulatory issues facing CPSC  Durbin s bill will increase the authorized funding level for the agency over the next five years  repeal the requirement that the CPSC have a quorum to engage in regulatory actions  a requirement that routinely hinders timely recalls   decrease the amount of time that firms have to respond to CPSC from 30 to 10 days  allow CPSC to waive normal regulatory requirements when human health is in danger and the firm is non cooperative  institute civil penalties for retailers that knowingly sell recalled products and increase maximum fines for violations     Because of the prominence of China in the recent toy and other product recalls  today s hearing also focused on the impact of that countrys safety standards  Today  two thirds of recalled products are imports and two thirds of those are from China  Mattel recently recalled millions of toys manufactured in China because of dangerous levels of lead contamination  Yesterday  CPSC met with a Chinese delegation to discuss safety standards and come to an agreement on toy safety standards  Durbin met with representatives from the Chinese government delegation immediately preceding the hearing      This morning  representatives from the Chinese consumer product agency told me they plan to ban lead in childrens products sold to the United States  My reply was  Youre a little late  the U S  banned lead in 1978  said Durbin  I appreciate the fact that the Chinese are moving to fix the problem  but a willingness to make changes does not mean that they have solved the problem  I continue to have serious concerns about China s ability to layer modern standards on top of industrial practices that are anything but modern      The hearing also featured testimony from toy manufacturers and retailers who have taken steps to improve internal quality control standards and to increase the volume of toys inspected for safety  Also testifying at the hearing was the noted consumer advocacy organization  Consumers Union  the publishers of Consumer Reports  who have urged Congress to increase resources and statutory authority for the CPSC   United States Senator Dick Durbin on Toy and Consumer Safety    Senator Durbin has been a leader in the Senate on issues dealing with consumer safety  specifically those focusing on toys  Following one of the first toy recalls this year  reported by the Chicago Tribune this spring  Durbin began to aggressively engage the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  regarding its regulatory authority  budget  inspections and standards     Durbin has been active on two bills dealing with product safety this Congress  The first  the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act  which Durbin introduced last month  will dramatically expand the CPSCs ability to protect American consumers by increasing the agencys funding and giving it the regulatory tools and resources it needs to effectively monitor product safety      The second bill is the Childrens Product Safety Act  This bill  introduced by Senator Bill Nelson  D FL  and cosponsored by Durbin  will require all childrens products to be certified as having met rigorous product safety standards by independent laboratories    Timeline on Durbins Efforts on Consumer Safety     September 6    Durbin announces first congressional oversight hearing on the issue of toy safety  Witnesses will
