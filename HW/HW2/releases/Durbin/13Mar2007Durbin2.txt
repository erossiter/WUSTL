ASKS AMERICAN EAGLE TO WORK WITH GREAT LAKES AVIATION TO GET SERVICE STARTED IMMEDIATELY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  March 13  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the President of American Eagle Airlines  Peter M  Bowler  asking that the airline work to minimize the disruption of air service for downstate Illinois travelers  Regions Air which formerly served downstate communities such as Quincy and Marion halted service on March 8th  Great Lakes Aviation was recently awarded the Essential Air Service contracts in Marion and Quincy formerly held by Regions Air  but transitions to new air carriers can take weeks or months before full service is restored  Durbin has asked that the airlines cooperate to make sure the necessary planes  personnel and equipment are in place so that service between downstate communities and St  Louis Lambert International Airport can resume immediately        While I am happy to see that the Department of Transportation has named Great Lakes Aviation as the new carrier for Marion and Quincy flights to St  Louis  we need to do everything possible to make sure that Great Lakes doesn t experience any delays in beginning service and that they have all the help they need to get off the ground and in the air right away   said Durbin       Regions Air is the current recipient of a two year  3 5 million per year federal subsidy to operate Essential Air Service  EAS  to Quincy  Marion  and Decatur   The Essential Air Service program was established by Congress in 1978 to ensure that communities with commercial air service before airline deregulation could continue scheduled flights   Without EAS  many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all  and residents of smaller cities would have to travel significant distances for flights   Great Lakes Aviation will take over with service in Marion and Quincy when Regions  contract expires in May and July respectively   In addition  the Department of Transportation has issued an emergency order seeking proposals for service to Decatur        text of the letter below         March 13  2007   Mr  Peter M  Bowler  President  American Eagle Airlines  4333 Amon Carter Boulevard   Fort Worth  TX 76155   Dear Mr  Bowler    I write today to request your assistance in restoring American Connection passenger service from Decatur  Marion  Quincy  and Springfield  Illinois  to St  Louis Lambert International Airport   As you probably know  the U S  Department of Transportation recently awarded Great Lakes Aviation Essential Air Service  EAS  program designation for the Marion and Quincy flights   The Department has also issued an emergency order seeking proposals for Decatur service       This urgent request is necessary because the previous carrier  RegionsAir  has ceased scheduled operations   And there are simply no guarantees that they will ever resume operations       This most recent shutdown comes on the heels of a 48 hour cessation of service March 3   As we discussed last month  Regions has been generally unreliable from St  Louis to nine Midwestern cities for several months       With four Illinois communities without scheduled passenger air service to St  Louis  this issue has become even more urgent than when we discussed Regions poor service record in February       I appreciate all you and American have done to date to monitor this situation   I respectfully ask you to work with Great Lakes Aviation  the U S  Department of Transportation  and the affected communities to restore American Connection service to St  Louis as soon as possible       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
