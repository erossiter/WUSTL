May 24  2007        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the leadership of both the Senate and House Agriculture Committees urging them to strengthen nutrition programs  most notably the Food Stamp Program  in the upcoming reauthorization of the Farm Bill   Durbin was joined by members of the Illinois congressional delegation in sending the letter to Senate Chairman Tom Harkin  D IA  and Ranking Member Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA  and the House Chairman Collin Peterson  D MN  and Ranking Member Bob Goodlatte  R VA         Hunger is a form of poverty  and the persistence of hunger in the wealthiest nation in the world is both alarming and unacceptable  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  over 35 million Americans    more than one in ten households    experience hunger or are at risk of hunger  In Illinois  individuals and families in 450 000 households cannot secure an adequate diet  These Americans skip meals  eat too little  or go without food for days   wrote Durbin  a co chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus   The Food Stamp Program is the nation s largest nutrition program for low income Americans       Noting the impact of the Food Stamp Program in Illinois  Durbin and the others wrote   The Food Stamp Program is an essential part of the safety net for individuals struggling to meet their most basic needs       The program is critical to Illinois  where more than 1 2 million people rely on food stamps every month  In 2006  the program generated more than  1 5 billion into the state s economy  benefiting farmers  grocers  small businesses  and communities throughout our state        The letter takes note of three areas where the program can be strengthened and asks the committee specifically to   adjust the food stamp benefit levels  which are currently at  1 14 per person per meal in Illinois  review current eligibility restrictions  which currently exclude legal immigrant adults and unemployed childless adults  and streamline and simplify program rules in order to ease barriers to participation  which currently prevent eligible households from accessing nutritional assistance    Signatories to the letter

Collin C  Peterson  Chairman  Committee on Agriculture  U S  House of Representatives  Washington  D C  20015   The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  U S  Senate  Washington  D C   20510   The Honorable Bob Goodlatte  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  U S  House of Representatives  Washington  D C  20015   Dear Chairmen Harkin and Peterson and Ranking Members Chambliss and Goodlatte       As the Senate and House Agriculture Committees prepare the reauthorization of the Farm Bill  the members of the Illinois congressional delegation urge the Committees to strengthen the nutrition programs included in the bill  particularly the Food Stamp Program       Hunger is a form of poverty  and the persistence of hunger in the wealthiest nation in the world is both alarming and unacceptable  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  over 35 million Americans   more than one in ten households   experience hunger or are at risk of hunger  In Illinois  individuals and families in 450 000 households cannot secure an adequate diet  These Americans skip meals  eat too little  or go without food for days       The Food Stamp Program is an essential part of the safety net for individuals struggling to meet their most basic needs  It enables millions of Americans to lead healthier and more productive lives by putting food on the tables of working families  A majority of food stamp benefits  80 percent  go to households with children  with the rest going mostly to seniors or persons with disabilities  The program is critical to Illinois  where more than 1 2 million people rely on food stamps every month  In 2006  the program generated more than  1 5 billion into the state s economy  benefiting farmers  grocers  small businesses  and communities throughout our state       In light of the Food Stamp Program s track record  we request that the Committee strengthen the program during the reauthorization of the Farm bill  Specifically   Adjust food stamp benefits to provide an adequate diet for recipients  Current food stamp levels  at  1 14 per person per meal in Illinois  are insufficient  Review current eligibility restrictions  The program currently excludes legal immigrant adults and unemployed childless adults  Streamline and simplify program rules to ease barriers to participate  In Illinois  67 percent of eligible households receive food stamps  a figure that is higher than the national average  due to state efforts to reach out to needy households  Even at higher levels than average participation rates  33 percent of eligible households are not accessing nutritional assistance    The Administration s Farm Bill proposal includes two important improvements  allowing households to deduct the full amount of child care costs they incur  so that food stamp benefits reflect these expenses  and excluding retirement and education savings from the food stamp asset tests when determining eligibility  so that poor families who lose their jobs and become eligible for food stamps are not punished for saving  We encourage the Committee to incorporate these improvements as the reauthorization process moves forward       According to the Congressional Budget Office s latest projections  food price inflation accounts for virtually all the growth in food stamp spending  The Food Stamp Program is working  and we need to ensure that it is equipped with the resources to continue doing so successfully       We understand that the Committees face multiple priorities in the Farm Bill  However  combating hunger to meet the basic needs of all Americans should be a top priority  We urge the Committees to strengthen the Food Stamp Program and other federal anti hunger and nutrition initiatives in the Farm Bill  and we look forward to working with you on these important issues       Sincerely       Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
