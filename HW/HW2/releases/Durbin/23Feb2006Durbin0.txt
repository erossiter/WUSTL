Thursday  February 23  2006    NORTHBROOK  IL      The complex Medicare drug benefit is shortchanging seniors while rewarding drug companies and it must be changed  U S  Senator Dick Durbin said today   The Senator introduced legislation last week designed to protect seniors and people with disabilities from the fluctuating drug prices and formulary changes that threaten to wreak havoc on their budgets       As the Medicare prescription drug benefit law is currently written  Medicare beneficiaries are locked into their Medicare Prescription Drug Plan  PDP  for one year   The PDPs  on the other hand  have the ability to change drug prices or formularies at any time   Seniors diligently compare plans and decide on the best plan for them  but they end up choosing a plan based on a momentary snapshot of drug prices   They should be able to count on the prices that guided their decision   If the plans refuse to lock in their prices and formularies  we need to give seniors a way out       Durbin   s legislation would require plans to stick by their original quotes unless the price decreases  so seniors  many of whom are on a fixed income  will not be hit with unexpected additional charges       Durbin   s bill  called the Medicare Drug Honest Pricing Act  will      Allow Medicare beneficiaries whose plan increases any drug price by more than 10  to choose a new plan   Allow Medicare beneficiaries whose PDP plan changes their formulary to choose a new plan   Seniors will have 60 days after they are notified by their plan of a formulary change to switch         Illinois seniors wanted a Medicare benefit that would lower their drug prices     Durbin said      What they have today is a confusing benefit  a law that prohibits Medicare from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies and a plan that guarantees drug companies billions of dollars in profits    Medicare Part D is a reward for drug companies and a disaster for America   s seniors             Many seniors are frustrated and angry   We need to change the benefit to make it fair  reliable and affordable     Durbin said      I believe we can come together  on a bi partisan basis  to make this program work for the seniors and the people with disabilities who are depending on it          While drug companies and HMOs are guaranteed hundred of millions of dollars from the federal government  seniors are guaranteed a headache if they sign up for the wrong plan     Durbin said  pointing to recent comments by a leading academic expert on the industry who forecasted that drug companies will make as much as  40 billion over the next ten years in windfall profits       Durbin has authored and co sponsored a series of legislative proposals to improve the Medicare prescription drug benefit      Durbin has long supported providing the Department of Health and Human Services with the authority to negotiate for better prices from the pharmaceutical industry and to give seniors the opportunity to receive benefits directly from Medicare rather than through HMOs   A recent study found that drug prices offered by ten leading private drug plans under the Medicare drug program are more than 80 percent higher than the prices negotiated by the Veterans    Administration   He also supports legislation pending before Congress to ensure that seniors and people with disabilities immediately receive the drugs they need at prices they can afford under the terms of coverage they have been promised   The Senator also sponsored the Medicare Informed Choice Act Legislation  which will give seniors and people with disabilities the time they need to navigate the confusing enrollment process  extending the deadline to sign up for a plan until the end of 2006      Even though Durbin has serious doubts about the structure and implementation of the new law  he urges Illinois seniors to enroll by the May 15 deadline to avoid the penalty that takes effect after that date          As we work to improve the Medicare drug benefit  I want to help Illinois    seniors deal with the existing program     Durbin said      We need simplicity  efficiency  convenience and access   The private market has not provided that  it is time to let Medicare try          Extensive information about the Medicare drug benefit is posted on Durbin   s Web site  www durbin senate gov
