OF SENATORS INTRODUCE THE AFRICAN HEALTH CAPACITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wednesday  March 7  2007    Washington  DC    A bipartisan group of Senators today introduced the African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007  a comprehensive bill to help sub Saharan African nations confront the alarming shortage of health workers  thirteen countries on the continent have fewer than 5 physicians per 100 000 people   The United States has 549 physicians per 100 000 people        Increased funding from governments and private donors to expand health services holds the promise of saving millions of lives in Africa  But  a severe shortage of health workers on the ground represents a tight bottleneck slowing the flow of resources to patients who need them   said Dr  Paul Farmer  medical anthropologist and a founder of Partners In Health   Sub Saharan Africa faces a shortage of more than 800 000 doctors  nurses  and midwives and an overall shortage of 1 5 million healthcare workers  The bill introduced today  particularly with its focus on harnessing the power of paid community health workers  is a much needed step toward closing this gap        Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Russ Feingold  D WI  called the lack of health care workers and capacity in many African nations a  critical obstacle  in the world s fight against HIV AIDS and a potential outbreak of Avian Flu and in promoting economic development and growth        With 11 percent of the world s population  25 percent of the global disease burden and nearly half of the world s deaths from infectious diseases  sub Saharan Africa has only 3 percent of the world s health workers   Senator Durbin said    Personnel shortages are a global problem  but nowhere are these shortages more extreme  the infrastructure more limited and the health challenges graver than in sub Saharan Africa  the epicenter of the HIV AIDS pandemic   We will not win the war against AIDS or any other African health challenge without finding solutions to this crisis         I am very proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bill as it is critical for bolstering our efforts to combat HIV AIDS and other diseases in Africa   said Senator Coleman   The lack of health care capacity in Africa imposes major constraints on the long term effectiveness of programs fighting HIV AIDS and other diseases  For this reason  any forward looking  comprehensive strategy to fight these terrible diseases must include elements that build African health care capacity         One of the most critical issues facing Africans today is the massive shortage of health care workers   Senator Feingold said    The United States has been a leader in addressing HIV AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis  and other global health crises  but this assistance will only be sustainable with the establishment of a strong medical infrastructure  Bolstering health care capacity in Africa is essential for preventing millions of deaths each year and ensuring our efforts to fight these diseases succeed        The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 seeks to help sub Saharan African countries strengthen the capabilities of their health systems by      Improving dangerous and sub standard working conditions  Addressing training  recruiting and retention concerns  especially in rural areas  for doctors  nurses  and paraprofessionals  Developing better institutional management  and Increasing productivity  reducing corruption and building public health infrastructure    The bill also requires the President to develop a coordinated strategy to promote health care capacity in Africa   The bill has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
