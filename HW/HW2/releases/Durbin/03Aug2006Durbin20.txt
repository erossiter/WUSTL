                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  August 3  2006   WASHINGTON  DC     A bipartisan group of Senators today introduced the African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2006  S 3775  a comprehensive bill to help sub Saharan African nations confront the alarming shortage of health workers  thirteen countries on the continent have fewer than 5 physicians per 100 000 people   The United States has 549 physicians per 100 000 people       Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Norm Coleman  R MN   Russ Feingold  D WI  and Mike DeWine  R OH  called the lack of health care workers and capacity in many African nations a    critical obstacle    in the world   s fight against HIV AIDS and a potential outbreak of Avian Flu and in promoting economic development and growth          With 11 percent of the world   s population  25 percent of the global disease burden and nearly half of the world   s deaths from infectious diseases  sub Saharan Africa has only 3 percent of the world s health workers     Senator Durbin said      Personnel shortages are a global problem  but nowhere are these shortages more extreme  the infrastructure more limited and the health challenges graver than in sub Saharan Africa  the epicenter of the HIV AIDS pandemic   We will not win the war against AIDS or any other health challenge without finding solutions to this crisis     Durbin said          I am very proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bill as it is critical for bolstering our efforts to combat HIV AIDS and other diseases in Africa     said Senator Coleman     The lack of health care capacity in Africa imposes major constraints on the long term effectiveness of programs fighting HIV AIDS and other diseases  For this reason  any forward looking  comprehensive strategy to fight these terrible diseases must include elements that build African health care capacity             The massive shortage of healthcare workers may be the most critical issue facing health care systems in Africa  contributing to millions of preventable deaths each year     Senator Feingold said      I am proud of the leadership role the United States has taken in addressing HIV AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis  and other global health crises   However  the resources we have invested in Africa will ultimately be fruitless unless we establish an infrastructure to ensure their effectiveness in the long term             I am proud to join my colleagues in supporting this worthy bill that will help millions of people in Africa get the basic health services they need    A coordinated strategy for healthcare workers would ultimately help combat the HIV AIDS epidemic by increasing treatment and education about the disease  This  coordinated with infrastructure improvements  will also give much needed doctors and nurses access to more patients     said Senator DeWine      In addition  these measures will help these developing nations to support economic growth and create jobs for their citizens          The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2006 seeks to help sub Saharan African countries strengthen the capabilities of their health systems by       Improving dangerous and sub standard working conditions  Helping train  recruit  and retain doctors  nurses  and paraprofessionals    Developing better management and public health training  and Improving productivity and workforce distribution       The bill also seeks to promote enhanced coordination of U S  foreign assistance and requires the President to develop a coordinated strategy to promote health care capacity in Africa
