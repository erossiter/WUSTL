February 20  2006    WILLIAMSVILLE  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  toured the Viper Mine in Williamsville on Monday morning  which is owned by International Coal Group  the same company that owns the Sago Mine in West Virginia   Durbin has previously expressed concern that the Viper Mine has 124 safety violations on record since ICG purchased the mine a year ago          The recent tragic events in West Virginia and Kentucky have captured the nation s attention and exposed the serious dangers our miners face every day     said Durbin      We have more than 3 500 miners in Illinois   We owe it to them and to their families to ensure all 25 mines in operation in Illinois are well equipped and adequately prepared          For decades the coal mining industry had been shrinking and mines were being closed  resulting in a formation of fewer mine safety teams across the country   Coal mining in America and in Illinois has seen a recent resurgence in the past two years  causing new mines to open  and necessitating the creation of additional mine rescue teams and more mine safety inspectors       Durbin called for additional funding for mine safety inspectors  saying     We need to make sure our mines are carefully and regularly inspected          The President   s 2007 budget claims to have increased mine safety funding by  11 million   In fact  nearly all that increase will be wiped out by inflation  leaving no new dollars to hire the 130 inspectors Mine Safety and Health Administration says it needs   In Illinois  six new coal mines have opened since 2005 and it ranks third in the nation in coal production       Durbin also called for passage of two mine safety bills in the U S  Senate which he has co sponsored   The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006  S 2231   introduced by Sen  Robert C  Byrd  D WV   is designed to strictly enforce the health and safety standards in the existing mine safety law  including rapid notification and response  tougher penalties for habitual safety violators  emergency communications and breathing equipment  and expanded use of advanced safety technologies       Durbin said he was encouraged by the recent Senate passage of a second bill  the Mine Safety Tax Relief Act of 2006  which will provide tax credits and incentives to encourage coal companies to invest in mine safety equipment and training  including communications technology that allows operators above to communicate with miners below  in case of accidents  electronic tracking devices which allow operators to know where miners are  breathing devices  and mine atmospheric monitoring equipment   The legislation encourages these investments by providing mine operators with a tax deduction in the amount of 50  of the cost of the equipment purchased       The bill also encourages  with the use of tax credits  mine companies to form rescue teams where they don   t exist and increase the number of mine rescue team members trained where teams are already in place       The mine safety proposal  which was authored by Sen  John D  Rockefeller  D WV   was offered as an amendment to the tax reconciliation bill  and was approved by the Senate earlier this month   The bill now goes to a conference committee where the Senate and House versions of the bill will be reconciled       Durbin has also written to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them for a review of mine safety records in Illinois and elsewhere   In his letters he asked the agencies to examine two issues     the impact funding cuts for mine safety inspections have had on mine safety  and a status report on safety conditions at all of Illinois    mines   President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the six years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 130 mine inspectors since 2000
