President  I rise today to honor the work and achievements of Hispanic Americans  Every year since 1968 Americans have formally recognized the importance of Hispanic heritage and the contributions of Latino members of society  Hispanic Heritage Month allows the nation s 41 million Latinos  along with all Americans  to celebrate Latino community and culture       As the fastest growing population in America  Hispanics have the potential to significantly impact society through their hard work  commitment to faith and closely knit families   Aida Gianchello is one of the Latina Americans who are changing the world   Aida founded the Midwest Latino Health Research  Training and Policy Center at the University of Chicago at Illinois   From this Center  Aida works within the Latino community and with the public health network to address health problems that disproportionately affect Latinos  including life threatening diabetes  asthma and hypertension       This morning  I had the pleasure of meeting three women from Illinois about to graduate from the National Hispana Leadership Institute   Juanita Irizarry is the executive director of Latinos United  a housing policy and advocacy organization in the Chicago area   Eva Serrano is director of community and school partnerships at Aurora University   Elena Tijerina is a partner at Lucent Technologies   These are powerful women  already participating in civic  business and community affairs  moving forward in leadership   We are lucky to have them in Illinois       I also must mention my friend Al Galvan   Al is a veteran of World War II and the founder of the first Hispanic organization for Hispanic American veterans   The Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce recently bestowed its life time achievement award on Al Galvan       Despite the remarkable accomplishments of many Hispanic leaders  Hispanic Americans still face daunting challenges  including the 14 million who do not have health coverage  as well as dangerously low levels of income  But they are rising to face these challenges    the rate of minority enrollment in post secondary institutions continues to grow  as does the number of small businesses owned by Latinos  Leaders are recognizing the problems faced particularly by Latinos and are offering specific solutions  Aida Gianchello led the charge to serve struggling neighborhoods in Chicago by setting up three diabetes focused self care centers which each reach about a thousand residents a month  many undocumented and uninsured       Individual efforts  like those of the Illinois leaders I have mentioned here today  make me proud to acknowledge the work and achievements of Latinos throughout Illinois and the country  It is only with the continued dedication and appropriate appreciation of Hispanic Heritage that the Latino culture will grow and thrive in America
