December 20  2005           After surveying the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder website and finding major price fluctuations  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  is pulling a bait and switch on America   s seniors   Durbin called on HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt to post a warning on the website informing seniors that drug plan prices are subject to change       In a letter to Secretary Leavitt  Durbin wrote     Simply calling the figure related to a particular plan an    estimate    is not enough   It doesn   t warn seniors about the continued shift in prices   Many seniors have already chosen their plans and are not aware that the prices may have increased or decreased          Durbin pointed to Healthspring  a drug plan offered to Medicare beneficiaries that rose 78 percent from December 7  2005 to December 19  2005          Your spokesperson responded to media inquiries sparked by my original letter by saying the price changes were the result of a    computer logic error    that had been repaired     Durbin continued      However  the prices on the website continue to change  and the law allows plans to vary their prices on a weekly basis             Many seniors have already chosen their plans and are not aware that the prices may have increased or decreased     Durbin noted   He said that a constituent he described in his original letter to Leavitt has seen her total cost increase more than  400          She is taking Arthrotec  Fosamax  K Tabs  Lasix  Prevacid  and Trental     Durbin continued      On November 30  2005  the Medicare Plan Finder showed that Medicare Rx Rewards Premier priced her drugs at an estimated annual cost of  2 643   My staff re checked the same drug list on the Plan Finder yesterday  December 19  2005  and found the same plan was estimated to have an annual cost of  3 120     an increase of  477   That   s after the increase of  1 152 from November 17 to November 22  which I wrote about in my last letter             The CMS website is currently doing a poor job informing seniors of price changes   Nowhere does it explain that costs within a plan can change     I urge you to remedy this situation before the benefit begins so seniors understand what they may be paying     Durbin concluded in his letter to Secretary Leavitt       The full text of the Durbin   s letter to Secretary Leavitt appears below           December 20  2005   The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Department of Health and Human Services  Hubert Humphrey Building  Room 416G  200 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt    I wrote to you on November 28  2005 to urge you to place a prominent notice on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  website informing Medicare beneficiaries that the drug prices quoted on the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder can change   Seniors should be informed that they should not expect the prices they find on the website to be the prices they will pay throughout the year  unless they choose a plan with co payments rather than coinsurance  and all their drugs are on the formulary       Your spokesperson responded to media inquiries sparked by my original letter by saying the price changes were the result of a    computer logic error    that had been repaired   However  the prices on the website continue to change  and the law allows plans to vary their prices on a weekly basis   Therefore  I once again urge you to place a prominent notice on your website informing seniors that the prices are changing and will continue to change   Simply calling the figure related to a particular plan an    estimate    is not enough   It doesn   t warn seniors about the continued shift in prices   Many seniors have already chosen their plans and are not aware that the prices may have increased or decreased       My staff has been checking the drug prices applicable to the constituent I originally wrote to you about  and her total costs have increased more than  400 since the date of my last letter   She is taking Arthrotec  Fosamax  K Tabs  Lasix  Prevacid  and Trental  On November 30   2005  the Medicare Plan Finder showed that Medicare Rx Rewards Premier priced her drugs at an estimated annual cost of  2 643   My staff re checked the same drug list on the Plan Finder yesterday  December 19  2005  and found the same plan was estimated to have an annual cost of  3 120     an increase of  477   That   s after the increase of  1 152 from November 17 to November 22  which I wrote about in my last letter       Another plan  Healthspring  rose 78 percent from December 7  2005 to December 19  2005   Even when plan prices decrease  seniors need to know   What if they rejected a plan one week because it was too expensive  but it became the best deal for them the next week   And would that still be their best deal next year        The CMS website is currently doing a poor job informing seniors of price changes   Nowhere does it explain that costs within a plan can change   Under the heading    How Much Will the Plans Cost     you should point out the possibility of price fluctuations  but instead the Plan Finder says nothing on the subject and simply explains the structure of the benefit   I urge you to remedy this situation before the benefit begins so seniors understand what they may be paying       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senate
