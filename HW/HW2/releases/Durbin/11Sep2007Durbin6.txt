                                                                                                                                                                                                Tuesday  September 11  2007          U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor as the nation marks the sixth anniversary of the 9 11 attacks on America  Rescuing good out of the evil and heartbreak of 9 11 One year from today  the first of Americas three official 9 11 memorials will be dedicated at the Pentagon  It will feature 184 stainless steel benches  each surrounded by a pool of water  one bench for each of the 184 innocent victims who died in the Pentagon and on the plane that struck it six years ago today  This morning  on the front page of the Washington Post  is a story about a small company of master metalworkers who are finishing each of those benches  grinding and polishing them  transforming them into perfectly uniform  flawlessly smooth memorials  The company is called Buchtel  It is located just outside of Chicago  Its owner  Abe Yousif  is an Iraqi immigrant who left his homeland in 1978  months before the start of the Iraq Iran war  and has never been back  All 24 of Abe Yousifs employees are also immigrants from Mexico  Bosnia and other nations  For Abe Yousif and each of his employees  polishing the benches for the Pentagon Memorial has become a deeply personal mission  As the Post describes it  If he can make the benches perfect  he believes he will help others to heal  If he can make the metal shine brilliantly  they will feel hope  He wants people to run their fingers along the steel and find  in its clean  immaculate smoothness  something affirming  redeeming even  on a site now scarred by murder and death  Today  on the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on our nation  many Americans in Illinois and across our nation are searching for their own ways to rescue some lasting good out of the evil and heartbreak of 9 11  Nearly 3 000 innocent victims from more than 150 nations who died in the 9 11 attacks  Jeff Mladenik  a husband and father of four from Hinsdale  Illinois  just outside of Chicago  had just been named interim CEO of a new e commerce company  But he had another job that meant even more to him  his work as an assistant pastor at his church in Oak Brook  He was on American Airlines Flight 11  the plane that struck the first tower  one of nine men and women from Illinois who died on 9 11  After Jeff Mladeniks death  his pastor told a reporter  I can guarantee that  Jeff  would tell us that hatred and bitterness must not have the last word  One of Americas first memorials to the victims of 9 11 was a tiny  makeshift memorial created by a woman in Shanksville  Pennsylvania  in her own front yard just weeks after the attacks Within days  the first tribute arrived  a bouquet of flowers  Next to it was a note that read  Thanks for saving our lives  the Capitol employees  We who are privileged to work in this building have a special obligation to work together to prevent the next attack  We need to listen  and heed  the recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 Commission to make America safer  We passed important legislation that moves us in that direction this year  but we need to do more  And we need to honor and pay our respects to those who gave their lives in the attacks six years ago today  As a sign of our nations respect  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the eight other Illinoisans who died on September 11  2001  be entered in the Congressional Record following my remarks  and I yield the floor        Note  Following are the names of the other Illinoisans who died in 9 11  Their names will be printed in todays Congressional Record  the official record of todays proceedings in Congress  Mr  President  as a sign of respect  I would like to read the names of the eight other Illinoisans who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11  2001  Kathy Bantis  Andrea Haberman  Suzanne Kondratenko  Darya Lin and Sue Sauer  all from Chicago  and Robert Rasmussen  from Hinsdale  were all in meetings in the Twin Towers when the planes hit  Commander Dan Shanower  of Naperville  a Navy intelligence officer  had just sat down at his desk after briefing his admiral on the World Trade Center attacks when the third plane smashed into the Pentagon  He died there  along with Navy Reserve Lt  Commander Patrick Murphy  who grew up in Flossmoor  Illinois  We remember them today  along with Jeff Mladenik  also of Hinsdale  and all of the nearly 3 000 innocent victims who died on September 11  2001  We also remember those they have left behind  and those who still suffer today  May they  and we  continue to heal and find peace
