LEADERS IN HOUSE AND SENATE INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT MINORITY AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  February 15  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    Today  Representatives Hilda L  Solis  D CA   Alcee L  Hastings  D FL  and Mark Udall  D CO  and Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and John Kerry  D MA  introduced the  Environmental Justice Act of 2007   This legislation is an important step in the protection of minority and low income communities from the disproportionate burden of negative human health and environmental impacts of pollution or other environmental hazards       For decades  industrial zones  refineries  and power plants have jeopardized the health of low income and communities of color  In Southern California  71 percent of African Americans and 50 percent of Latinos live in non attainments areas  Nationally  people of color are three times more likely to be hospitalized or die from asthma and other respiratory illnesses linked to air pollutions       The Environmental Justice Act of 2007 would fully implement the 1994 Executive Order titled  Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations   E O  12898  to ensure that all federal agencies and their programs and rules are appropriately protecting our nation s most vulnerable communities  It requires the Environmental Protection Agency to fully implement recommendations included in three recent government reports and creates reporting requirements  including an update on the inclusion of environmental justice in the EPA s emergency command response structure        For far too long federal agencies have disregarded the health of minority and low income communities  choosing instead to reinterpret the Executive Order so that it fits the policies they want to promote   said Solis  who was the first woman to be recognized with the John F  Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award for her pioneering work on environmental justice   This legislation is a critical first step to achieving real and lasting justice for minority and low income communities across this country  Codifying the Executive Order will empower communities without a voice to join in the fight to protect their health and welfare         Healthy communities are important to everyone  And the simple truth is that our most vulnerable communities have not been treated fairly   said Durbin   Minority neighborhoods  the elderly and low income communities bear disproportionate environmental risks and hazards and the investments and benefits to fix these problems are not equally distributed  This bill changes that by requiring the EPA to act to protect these communities from additional sources of pollution         More than a decade after Executive Order 12898  the time has come for federal agencies to truly embrace the vision of empowered citizens and healthy communities   Hastings said   This legislation will mandate the EPA accountability that communities of color and low income families have been dying to achieve for many years   Through the open process that brought forth this legislation  the people have spoken         We are introducing this bill today to ensure environmental protection for all communities  It is not only unacceptable  it is immoral to leave minority and low income families bearing the brunt of our nation s pollution problems   Kerry said   Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has turned the very definition of environmental justice on its head  We can do better   and we should start by passing this legislation         Too often  federal actions affecting the environment have hurt Americans in minority and lower income communities that in some eyes have seemed expendable   Udall said   Instead  federal policies must focus on providing clean  healthy and quality environments so these communities will have hope for the future and opportunities for their residents to improve their lives   Our bill is intended to help achieve that goal        Several reports have noted the failure of the EPA to ensure its policies  rules and regulations protect environmental justice communities  In 2004  the Office of the Inspector General  OIG  at EPA found that this agency has not fully implemented the Executive Order nor has it defined or developed criteria for determining who is disproportionately impacted  In 2005 the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that the EPA failed to consider the impact of its air regulations on minority and low income communities  and in 2006 the OIG reported that the EPA  cannot determine whether its programs cause disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on communities of color and low income populations        The Environmental Justice Act of 2007 is endorsed by more than 15 organizations  including the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement  the Lawyer s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law  the Center for Health  Environment and Justice  Communities for a Better Environment  the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University  Natural Resources Defense Council  Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice  Beyond Pesticides


