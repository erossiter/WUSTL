AMTRAK BOARD TO EXPLAIN THE DISMISSAL OF AMTRAK PRESIDENT AND CEO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  November 16  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to Mr  David Laney  Chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors  regarding the recent firing of the President and CEO of Amtrak    November 16  2005      Mr  David M  Laney  Chairman  National Passenger Railroad Corporation Board of Directors  60 Massachusetts Avenue  N E   Washington  D C  20002    Dear Chairman Laney       I am writing to you regarding the November 9  2005 decision by the Amtrak Board of Directors to dismiss President David Gunn   While I question the current legitimacy of the Board  I would like to ascertain the Board   s reasons for its decision and the Board   s long term plans for Amtrak       Like many in the U S  Senate  I was astounded by the timing of Mr  Gunn   s dismissal   Under Mr  Gunn   s leadership  Amtrak took many needed steps to become fiscally responsible  and Amtrak   s future seemed bright   Congress has recently been considering Amtrak authorization and appropriation measures  and the steady hand of Mr  Gunn factored favorably in Congress    decision making   For example  on November 3rd the U S  Senate voted for an Amtrak reauthorization measure by an overwhelming 93 6 margin   To fire the President of Amtrak on the heels of that vote is an affront to this institution       There is also a more fundamental question here besides the timing of Mr  Gunn   s dismissal   Specifically  I question whether the Board of Directors had the legitimacy to dismiss Mr  Gunn  since you are the only individual whose position on the Board was confirmed by the Senate   Moreover  there are three vacancies on the Board  and two of the four current Board Members are recess appointments whose terms will end soon   Clearly  the Board   s decision to fire Mr  Gunn was made without the necessary broad bi partisan representation that Congress intended when it established the Amtrak Board of Directors       During his time at Amtrak  Mr  Gunn increased ridership and revenue   Illinois is a prime example of Mr  Gunn   s efforts   In Fiscal Year 2005  Amtrak carried more than 3 million people to 30 communities in Illinois  and many of the short and long distance routes based out of Amtrak   s Chicago hub witnessed a double digit percentage increase in ridership   These ridership numbers show that passengers as varied as business commuters  college students  and leisure travelers are increasingly choosing Amtrak as their mode of transportation       As you know  no passenger rail service in the world earns a profit   Passenger rail transportation needs government assistance to function  as do all modes of transportation   However  I am concerned that your Board   s dismissal of Mr  Gunn signals an effort by the Board and by the Bush Administration to seek an end to federal government assistance  which would unequivocally portend the demise of Amtrak   The Administration   s unrealistic insistence that Amtrak turn a profit  combined with its recommendation that federal operating subsidies be eliminated  strongly suggests that the Bush Administration wants to let America   s only passenger railroad die       Amtrak   s announcement of Mr  Gunn   s dismissal stated     The passenger rail service needed to intensify the pace and broaden the scope of its reforms      I fear that your vision of reform entails the wholesale dismantling of Amtrak  and that you will seek an end to government support  thereby granting the Administration   s wish to kill Amtrak   If that is not the case  then I respectfully request information as to the Board   s plans to preserve and improve Amtrak service across the nation and in my home state of Illinois       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter   I look forward to your reply       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin     Cc  Mr  Floyd Hall  Mr  Enrique Sosa  The Honorable Norman Mineta
