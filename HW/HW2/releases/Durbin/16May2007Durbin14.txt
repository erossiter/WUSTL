     Durbin  WRDA Bill Authorizes Federal Funding for Asian Carp Barrier

Bill Authorizes Federal Funding for Asian Carp Barrier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wednesday  May 16  2007         The United States Senate today approved the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA    The bill includes a provision authored by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  that will authorize the use of federal funds to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the Asian Carp Barrier project   This barrier will prevent the spread of invasive species  including Asian Carp  between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal        The Asian Carp threatens both the native fish and natural wildlife of the lake and in turn  the economy of the entire Great Lakes region   said Durbin    Currently  this invasive species threatens a  4 1 billion sport and commercial fishing industry in the Great Lakes  The bill passed today recognizes the threat of the Asian Carp by authorizing the permanent operation of the barrier system to prevent these harmful fish from entering the waters of the Great Lakes        Asian carp  an invasive species  threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem by consuming large quantities of phytoplankton and competing with native fish for habitat   Originally  Asian Carp were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities  The carp have made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River  Asian carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds  and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day       The legislation will authorize the Corps of Engineers to complete construction on a permanent barrier and to upgrade and make permanent the original demonstration barrier  This bill avoids potential construction delays and funding problems by allowing the federal government to fully fund the barrier project  Failure to continue work on the project could result in Asian Carp by passing the incomplete barriers and entering the Great Lakes       In addition  the legislation authorizes federal funding for a feasibility study to investigate the options and technologies available to form a more comprehensive strategy to prevent the spread of invasive species between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and other aquatic pathways   The feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers would include many types of invasive species  not limited to Asian Carp        While Asian Carp is the immediate threat to the Great Lakes  the potential for other invasive species to enter through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and other aquatic pathways is very real   said Durbin    The feasibility study included in the Senate bill today acknowledges the importance of investigating the appropriate resources to prevent more invasive species from damaging the ecosystem of the Great Lakes        In the House version of WRDA that was passed this April  Congresswoman Judy Biggert  R IL  worked to include a provision similar to Durbin s that authorizes the use of federal funds for the Asian Carp Barrier project   In January 2007  Durbin and Biggert introduced legislation to authorize funding for the Asian Carp barriers in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal    The Senate bill was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works       The demonstration barrier in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal was authorized in 1996 under the National Invasive Species Act to prevent non native species like the Asian carp from moving between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes  Since this barrier was designed to be temporary and is close to the end of its expected service life  a second permanent barrier is being constructed       In June 2006  Durbin and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  worked to successfully secure  400 000 to operate the barriers that prevent invasive species from entering the Great Lakes   Twenty eight other Great Lakes House Members joined Congresswoman Judy Biggert  R IL  in sending a letter to House appropriators in support of this effort  The funding was included to pay for the operation of Barrier I  a temporary barrier that keeps the invasive species out of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan by emitting an electric current that deters the carp from passing through       Durbin was a member of the conference committee between the House and Senate versions on the emergency spending bill where the provision to fund Barrier I was added   The bill was signed into law on June 15th  2006
