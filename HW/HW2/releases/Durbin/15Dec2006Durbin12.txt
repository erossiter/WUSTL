ANNOUNCES METH AWARENESS AND PREVENTION AD CAMPAIGN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Friday  December 15  2006    CHICAGO  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced the launch of a campaign to promote awareness and prevention of methamphetamine abuse in southern and central Illinois in partnership with the Illinois Sheriffs    Association and the Illinois Broadcasters Association   The campaign will use TV and radio commercials  as well as billboards to educate Illinoisans about the dangers of meth     In fiscal year 2006  Durbin secured  177 700 in federal funding for the Illinois Sheriff   s Association to help raise meth awareness  These funds were secured through the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program in the Justice Department spending bill   That funding will be tapped for the community awareness campaign   Durbin is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the Anti Meth Caucus     Earlier this year  Durbin asked the University of Illinois to gather and analyze data on how meth is affecting Illinois and to look at strategies for fighting back   The data suggest that most victims are white adults living in rural areas   Most of the people whose lives are damaged by this drug are poor and have less education than the average Illinois citizen   Men outnumber women by about 12    but for most street drugs  men outnumber women by closer to 50  margins     That stronger hold on women has major implications for children and families and their communities  Durbin said   Approximately 1 700 women with children and 115 pregnant women entered public drug treatment centers in Illinois last year   In 2004  more than half of the children entering foster care in some areas of rural southeastern Illinois were forced into the program because their caretakers were meth abusers      Meth is tearing apart our families and overwhelming our child welfare network     Durbin said        Illinois law enforcement response has been swift and well coordinated     Durbin said   Last year  the Illinois State Police encountered nearly 1 000 meth labs  more than double the number uncovered in 2000   In 1997  police found 24 meth labs  which indicates a ten fold increase over 8 years     Over the course of the last several years  Illinois Sheriffs    Association determined that a comprehensive approach  involving law enforcement and public safety working hand in hand with the communities to focus on prevention was required        The University of Illinois report speaks to the role of media and the value of a growing community awareness in turning the tide against meth use   The goal of this ad campaign is to make sure our communities know that this is happening     right here in Illinois   We know that awareness campaigns can help shape attitudes and spark conversations   These are not quiet ads   Our hope is that these ads will make people think     Durbin said        Before we can work together to protect our communities from the damaging effects of meth addiction  we have to recognize that there is a problem    and that we all need to be part of the solution     Durbin said     The ad campaign focuses on increasing meth awareness in southern and central Illinois  the areas of the state with the greatest need   More than 200 billboards will be placed in counties south of I 80  with a focus on counties south of I 72   The television ads will run in Champaign Urbana Springfield Danville  the Quad Cities  Peoria and Paducah KY Cape Girardeau MO Harrisburg  IL   The TV spots are intended to run after 7 00 pm to reach the targeted age group of 12     17  parents and avoid TV time typically viewed by young children    The radio ads will run in Peoria  Champaign Urbana  the Quad Cities and Marion Carbondale   The ad campaign is expected to begin to air on December 17 and will run for two  2  13 week cycles
