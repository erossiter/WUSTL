STATEMENT FOR SUBCOMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE LAW HEARING ON GENOCIDE AND THE RULE OF LAW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Monday  February 5  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   Following  you will find U S  Senator Dick Durbin s  D IL  opening statement for the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law hearing on Genocide and the Rule of Law   Durbin recently was named Chairman of the Senate s first subcommittee on human rights and the inaugural hearing was held on Monday  February 5    Welcome to Genocide and the Rule of Law  the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Committee s newly created Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law   We are honored to welcome as well this distinguished panel of witnesses to share their views on this important and timely issue   After a few opening remarks  I will recognize Senator Coburn  the Ranking Member  for an opening statement  and then we will turn to our witnesses    Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee  But first a word about this new Subcommittee   I want to thank Senator Patrick Leahy  Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  for establishing the Subcommittee  and for asking me to serve as Chairman   Senator Leahy has championed human rights for many years  and this Subcommittee is another indicator of his commitment to this issue   This is the first time in Senate history that there has been a subcommittee focused on human rights   And the timing is right   At this moment in our history  it is vitally important to our national interest to promote greater respect for human rights around the world   When our leaders speak of our inherent desire for freedom and our communal need for democracy  they are acknowledging the fundamentals of human rights   And those who ignore and violate these fundamentals do more than challenge some idealistic goal   Repressive regimes that violate human rights create fertile breeding grounds for suffering  terrorism  war  and instability   In our time  the world is a much smaller place  and the social ills caused by human rights abuses know no borders   We will never be truly secure as long as fundamental human rights are not respected   Our Declaration of Independence says  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights   Too many times in our history we have fallen short of this ideal  but this commitment to human rights was  and is  the promise of America   I hope that this Subcommittee will give the Senate an opportunity to work together to maintain America s leadership in protecting and promoting fundamental human rights   America also stands for another revolutionary idea  the rule of law   As John Adams said  we are a government of laws  not of men   We should keep in mind that human rights are little more than empty promises if they are enforceable in law   That is why this is the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee  and that is why it is part of the Judiciary Committee   And that is why this Subcommittee will focus on the law as a means for making the promise of human rights a reality    Genocide and the Rule of Law  When Chairman Leahy asked me to chair this Subcommittee  I knew that our first hearing had to be on the subject of genocide and the rule of law   Rafael Lemkin  a Holocaust survivor and the architect of the Genocide Convention  placed his faith in the ability of the law to prevent genocide   He implored the international community to adopt laws against genocide  saying  Only man has law    You must build the law   The legal prohibition against genocide is obviously an unfulfilled promise   We see this most clearly today in Darfur in western Sudan   In this region of six million people  hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and over two million people have been driven from their homes   For them  the commitment of never again rings hollow   We must ask ourselves why   Is this a failure of law  or of will   Or both   What are the legal obligations of states to prevent genocide before it has begun   Do debates about the legal definition of genocide serve as an excuse for governments not to act   What is our responsibility to protect victims of atrocities that do not meet the legal definition of genocide   And we must explore legal options for preventing genocide  or  in the worst case scenario  stopping an ongoing genocide  like the one in Darfur   During today s hearing  we will explore using the law to impose criminal and civil sanctions on individuals who are guilty of genocide   We will discuss the status of the International Criminal Court s Darfur investigation  and whether the federal government is doing everything it can to facilitate that investigation   We will also examine the possibility of criminal and civil liability under U S  law for people who commit genocide anywhere in the world   Divestment is another legal tool that has put pressure on the government of Sudan to stop the genocide   Today s divestment movement is the heir to the anti apartheid movement of the 1980 s   Apartheid ended because of the courage and determination of people like Nelson Mandela  but divestment was also a source of external pressure on the apartheid system   Today I want to announce that I plan to introduce legislation to authorize state and local governments to divest from Sudan   Senator Brownback  my colleague Senator Obama and members of this Subcommittee have played leading roles  in the divestment movement and  more broadly  the fight against the Darfur genocide   I look forward to working with the members of this Subcommittee to enact divestment legislation and other legal measures that will help end the genocide in Darfur   A little over a year ago  Senator Brownback and I visited Kigali  Rwanda   We stayed in the Hotel Mille Collines  made famous by Don Cheadle s movie Hotel Rwanda   As I walked down the corridor to my room  I could not help but think of that movie and the hundreds of frightened Rwandans who huddled there  fearing the worst   Early one morning  I walked down the hill to Saint Famille  a simple  red brick Catholic Church  I learned later that Saint Famille was a sanctuary for people fleeing the genocidaires   Sadly  this sanctuary was no refuge at all   It was overrun and nearly one thousand people were massacred in the church I visited that morning   In 1994  my predecessor and friend  Senator Paul Simon of Illinois  pleaded with the Clinton Administration to do more to stop the genocide in Rwanda  and President Clinton later called his inaction the worst foreign policy mistake of his administration   I salute the Bush Administration for calling the situation in Darfur the genocide that it is   Now that we have acknowledged for more than four years that this horror is happening on our watch  we must summon the courage act to stop this carnage  this genocide
