                                                                                                                                                                                                  Monday  July 23  2007       United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation today which will dramatically expand the Consumer Product Safety Commissions  CPSC  ability to protect American consumers  Durbins bill follows his recent effort  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  to increase funding for the consumer protection agency over the Presidents budget request  Durbin also sent a letter today to President Bush and the Secretary of Health and Human Services  Michael Leavitt  regarding the Working Group on Import Safety the President unveiled last week  In the letter  Durbin requests congressional representation in the working group and requests a meeting with Secretary Leavitt  who chairs the import safety study group  A copy of the letter is attached  The creation of a Working Group on Import Safety is a good first step  Durbin said  But its important that this isnt a toothless  ineffective exercise  Import security is a real problem which affects every American  I hope that Congress will be included in working with the Administration to find a solution to protecting American consumers  Durbins bill  expanding CPSCs authority  funding  and resources  was cosponsored by Senator Bill Nelson  D FL   Last week  Durbin and Nelson introduced legislation which would increase the safety of childrens products by requiring that all imported products designed for use by children under the age of 5  pass rigorous safety standards and be certified by an independent agency  Every week there is another story that highlights the need for a strong consumer protection agency  said Durbin  We can do better  This bill addresses the shortfalls in our system head on  Protecting consumers is the number one priority of CPSC and its time we gave the tools they need to effectively and efficiently do their job  What we have now isnt working  said Nelson  We need to make sure tainted  dangerous products arent coming into our country  and if they still get by all of the protections  we need to stop stores from selling them  This bill would help keep these hazardous products out of our homes  Durbins bill does the following    Increases the authorized funding level for the agency over the next five years  This would allow the CPSC to hire more inspectors and compliance staff and pursue additional regulatory and enforcement actions    Repeals the requirement that the CPSC have a quorum to engage in regulatory actions  The CPSC has operated without a quorum since January 15  2007  Without a quorum  the CPSC cannot pursue regulatory activities under Section 15 of the FHSA  order a firm to give notice of hazard and refund or replace product  Section 3 e  2  of the FHSA  ban an imminently hazardous children s product   or Section 12 of the CPSA  pursue a recall and injunctive relief of an imminently hazardous product     Decreases the amount of time that firms have to respond to CPSC information releases under 6 b  from 30 to 10 days  In a time of email and rapid communications  there is no need to give firms a 30 day window to respond to notifications of the release of information  Shortening this time frame would increase the rapidity with which CPSC could request documents and release information to the public    Allows CPSC to waive Section 6 b  requirements when human health is in danger and the firm is non cooperative  In instances in which firms fail to respond to CPSC inquiries in a timely manner  the CPSC is unable to release information to the public in a timely manner due to the constraints of Section 6 b   This provision would allow the CPSC to waive that requirement in instances that present an imminent human health hazard and firms refuse to cooperate    Institutes a civil penalty for retailers that knowingly sell a recalled product  This language would expand an Illinois state law that sets a penalty for retailers that knowingly sell or stock recalled products  The civil penalty for this infraction would be a maximum of  500 per day    Increases maximum fine for violations  This language would increase the maximum fine for infractions to create a more significant disincentive for firms to violate health and safety standards     The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for protecting individuals and families from dangerous products including toys  child safety seats and power tools  In November of 2005 a child from Washington state was killed after swallowing tiny magnets that had broken loose from a Magnetix toy  In March of 2006  the CPSC announced a voluntary recall of nearly 4 million sets of the popular toy  A voluntary recall asks the toy company to remove the toy from store shelves  but doesnt require it be done  Unfortunately  this made it possible for Rose Art Industries to continue to sell the product  despite the known hazard  On April 19th  2007 an additional recall of another 4 million units was announced  Last week the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a Durbin drafted spending bill out of committee  Durbin  Chairman of the Financial Services and General Government subcommittee  included  70 million budget increase for CPSC  This increase is  7 2 million above last year and  6 8 million above the Presidents budget request  This new funding will allow CPSC to hire new employees in the areas of hazard identification and reduction  field operations and compliance  and funds for critically needed IT improvements   Timeline on Durbins Efforts on Consumer Safety   Senator Durbin has been an active leader on issues dealing with consumer safety  specifically those focusing on toys  Following a series of investigative reporting by the Chicago Tribune  Durbin has actively engaged the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  regarding its regulatory authority  budget  inspections and standards   As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Finance Services and General Government  Durbin has oversight authority over the CPSC   Below is a timeline of Durbin s actions on the issue  July 10  Durbin includes language in the Senate Appropriations Committees Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  FSGG   increasing the CPSCs FY08 funding to  70 million  Durbin is the Chair of the FSGG subcommittee  This is over  7 million more then last years funding level and an almost  7 million increase to the Presidents request  On July 12th  the full Appropriations committee reported the Durbin Financial Services bill out of committee  June 28   Durbin and Senator Klobuchar  MN  sent letters today to the CEO of RC2  Curtis Stoelting and to Nancy Nord  Chairwoman of the Consumer Protection Safety Commission  CPSC  asking them to detail the steps taken in the recall of 1 5 million units of Thomas and Friends toys and accessories  Certain models of Thomas and Friends toys were recently found to be tainted with toxic lead paint  The recalled toys manufactured in China and sold by the RC2 Corporation  were voluntary recalled on June 13  2007  June 15   Durbin and Congressman Bobby Rush hold a field hearing of Durbin s Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Finance Services and General Government in Chicago  Testifying at the hearing was Nancy Nord  Acting Chairwoman of CPSC  Dr  Kyran Quinlan of American Academy of Pediatrics  Lisa Madigan  Illinois Attorney General  Nancy Cowles  Executive Director of Kids in Danger  a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting children  and Sharon Henry  the mother of a child injured by the Magnetix Building Set  June 5   Durbin meets with Chairwoman Nord  A meeting between the two on May 15 had to be canceled  In the meeting the two discussed the Magnetix case  but focused on the larger issue of regulatory authority and Chinese imports  May 23   President Bush withdraws the Baroody nomination  May 18   Durbin  along with Senators Nelson  FL  and Obama  IL   asked the White House for copies of a  150 000 severance agreement Mr  Baroody received from his current employer  the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM   an addendum to that package and additional documents regarding the possible conflict of interest that pay package may have caused  May 17   Durbin sent a letter to President Bush strongly opposing his pick to chair the Consumer Product Safety Commission and urging the withdrawal of the controversial nomination  The nominee  Michael Baroody  was a lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM  and in that position  repeatedly worked against efforts to strengthen consumer protection  In addition  Baroody accepted a large severance payment from the NAM  which represents industry the CPSC regulates   causing a substantial conflict of interest  May 8   Following the publication of a series of reports on a toy which has caused more than two dozen life threatening injuries to children and at least one death  Durbin sent a letter to Nancy Nord  Chairwoman of the CPSC  asking for information on the steps taken by the Commission with regards to this case  The toy in question  Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets  uses powerful magnets which  if dislodged  can be swallowed and attract internally  causing severe internal injuries
