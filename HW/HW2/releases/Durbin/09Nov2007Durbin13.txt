November 9  2007    CHICAGO  IL   Veterans seeking care in the nations VA hospitals would be able to rest easier about the quality of care they are provided if legislation to be offered next week by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  is signed into law  Durbin wrote the bill in response to the troubling circumstances at the Marion Veterans Medical Center  VAMC  in southern Illinois which suspended all inpatient surgeries at the on August 31 due to an unusual increase in deaths over a six month period  We dont have all the facts yet about the situation in Marion  but we do know that what happened is unacceptable  During the course of the investigation  four top level executives have been relieved of their post  one surgeon has resigned and this week agreed not to practice medicine in the U S  again  and four others have had their privileges restricted  said Durbin  who believes the circumstances at the Marion VAMC may point to greater problems within the VA medical system  Durbins legislation is designed to tighten the process for hiring doctors  introduce a new quality assurance mechanism  and attract more quality medical professionals to the VA  The bill would require doctors applying to VA to disclose all past malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against them and any ongoing investigations or outstanding allegations  as well as to send a written request to any state board where they have ever held a license asking that board to disclose this same information to the VA  These measures would likely have stopped the Marion VA hospital from hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez while the Massachusetts State Medical Board was investigating him for gross incompetence  Durbins bill also calls for a designated doctor  with the appropriate seniority and qualifications  to monitor the quality of the surgeons on staff  This doctor will report directly to the leadership of the hospital but will also report to a similar quality assurance doctor at the regional level  This will ensure that if there is a lapse in leadership at the facility  which appears to have been the case at Marion  a separate avenue is there for employees to express concerns  Finally  the legislation proposes incentives to more easily recruit quality doctors to practice in VA facilities  where salaries are often not competitive with private hospitals or private practice  It calls on VA facilities to establish close affiliations with nearby medical schools  proposes to help relieve crushing medical school debt for young doctors choosing a career path and offers incentives to bring more senior doctors into a veterans hospital setting  even if on a flexible or part time basis  Durbin and U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  have worked for nearly two months on the ongoing investigations regarding the care provided in Marion and the hiring of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after cases of malpractice and disciplinary action  The Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the Marion VAMC in late August and the VA Inspector General has initiated an investigation  Four top hospital officials at Marion have also been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  Several times  Durbin and Obama have called on the former Secretary of Veterans  Jim Nicholson and the current Acting VA Secretary  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center
