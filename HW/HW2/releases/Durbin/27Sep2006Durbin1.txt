FORMER PRESIDENT OF IRELAND MARY ROBINSON TO CAPITOL HILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wednesday  September 27  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with former president of Ireland Mary Robinson in his Capitol office to discuss the fight against HIV AIDS  the global shortage of health care workers  and the    brain drain    emigration of health care workers from Africa to North America and Europe        President Robinson shares my concern for what is taking place in Africa     Durbin said      With 11 percent of the world   s population  25 percent of the global disease burden and nearly half of the world   s deaths from infectious diseases  sub Saharan Africa has only 3 percent of the world   s health workers   Personnel shortages are a global problem  but nowhere are these shortages more extreme  the infrastructure more limited and the health challenges graver than in sub Saharan Africa  the epicenter of the HIV AIDS pandemic  We will not win the war against AIDS or any other health challenge without finding solutions to this crisis        Robinson is currently applying her experience in governance and human rights work as president of Realizing Rights  the Ethical Globalization Initiative   The Ethical Globalization Initiative seeks to promote greater human development and security by fostering more equitable international trade and development  strengthening responses to HIV AIDS in Africa  and shaping more humane migration policies     Durbin introduced the African Health Capacity Investment  AHCI  Act of 2006 with a bipartisan group of Senators last month   He also offered an amendment to address the    brain drain    issue during the Senate   s debate on immigration earlier this year     The AHCI Act is a comprehensive measure to help sub Saharan African nations confront the alarming shortage of health workers   Thirteen countries on the continent have fewer than 5 physicians per 100 000 people     Durbin pointed to nations like Ethiopia  where there are only 3 doctors and only 20 nurses per 100 000 people     In the U S   we have 549 doctors and 773 nurses per 100 000 people  And yet  according to Ambassador Randall Tobias  who has been confirmed as the first U S  Director of Foreign Assistance  there are more Ethiopian trained doctors in Chicago than in Ethiopia     Durbin said     Under Durbin   s proposed amendment to the Senate immigration bill  those applying for legal status to work as health professionals in America must answer whether they signed a bond or made a promise to work in their home country in exchange for educational support  If the answer is affirmative  then they must fulfill that commitment before being allowed to work in the U S     Additionally  the amendment would allow legal permanent resident doctors and nurses to travel to developing countries to assist with health emergencies without jeopardizing their own immigration status in the U S     Regarding the critical shortage of health personnel  Durbin pointed to a report released by the World Health Organization  WHO  which found that    there is a universal shortage of 4 3 million healthcare workers  but the crisis is most severe in Africa           This is an alarming report  It shows that we face a global health crisis with profound consequences     Durbin said     The WHO report identifies the increasing migration of health workers from the poorest countries to the richest as representing a    loss of hope and years of investment           This    brain drain    is impacting millions of lives in Africa     Durbin said      Africa loses 20 000 health professionals each year  they leave to staff the hospitals and offices of Europe and North America  Their countries lose the investments they have made in their education and training and the benefit of their skills at a time when AIDS is ravishing the African continent        Robinson was Ireland   s first female president  serving in office from 1990 to 1997   From 1997 to 2002  she served as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights   Robinson also attended the XVI International AIDS conference last month in Toronto
