     DURBIN  OBAMA PROMISE TO HOLD PENTAGON NOMINEE UNTIL RUMSFELD RELEASES OVERDUE WIND FARM REPORT

PROMISE TO HOLD PENTAGON NOMINEE UNTIL RUMSFELD RELEASES OVERDUE WIND FARM REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thursday  September 7  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  told Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Thursday that they would hold up a key administration nomination until Rumsfeld released a long overdue report that is delaying the construction of wind farms across the Midwest       In a letter to Rumsfeld  Senators Obama and Durbin promised to continue their block a Senate vote on the nomination of Mr  Robert L  Wilkie to be Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs until the DoD issues the report which was supposed to be completed by May 7  2006   The report would determine whether wind farms interfere with military radar systems          The delay of the Defense Department report on wind farms is costing Illinois businesses and potential investors every day   It could also jeopardize the development of one of our nation s best sources of clean alternative energy     said Durbin      If there are real problems caused by wind farms  we should find ways to mitigate  reduce or eliminate them  but our wind farm owners deserve an answer today             Because this report is months overdue  investors and landowners in the Midwest who see the promise of wind farms are taking their money elsewhere     said Senator Obama     I take very seriously concerns that these structures could interfere with military readiness  but I also strongly believe that with gas prices reaching record highs and mounting instability in the Middle East  America should start investing in alternative energy sources immediately          In today   s letter  the Illinois lawmakers also asked that the DoD report meet    the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act by identifying any technologies that could mitigate any adverse effects on the military operations identified       The 2006 Defense Authorization Act called for DOD to submit a report to Congress on the effects of windmill farms on military readiness  In particular  the report sought to determine whether wind farms could interfere with military radar       On March 21  2006  DOD and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issued a joint interim policy on the proposed windmill locations which states     The DOD DHS Long Range Radar Joint Program Office Interim Policy is to contest any establishment of windmill farms within radar line of site of the National Air Defense and Homeland Security Radars      Shortly thereafter  the Midwest Regional Office of the FAA sent    notice of presumed hazard    letters to wind farm sites that they had determined are in the line of site  The FAA defined    in the line of site    as any windmill within a 60 mile radius of a radar center or radar tower       By this definition  much of the nation is now in the radar line of site  and this interim policy had a sweeping effect that stalled or stopped wind energy projects across the country  including more than a dozen in the Midwest       On June 2  2006  Senators Durbin  Obama  Russ Feingold  D WI   Herb Kohl  D WI   Kent Conrad  D ND  and Byron Dorgan  D ND  wrote letters to officials at DOD and FAA voicing their support for the responsible development of wind power       Although Wilkie is currently serving as the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs  Durbin and Obama said they will block his official confirmation until DOD clarifies whether these sites will be able to operate  Without this certainty  potential investors fear that their resources could be lost        text of letter below         September 7  2006   The Honorable Donald H  Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  1000 Defense Pentagon  Washington  DC 20301 1000   Dear Secretary Rumsfeld    We are writing concerning the ongoing study on the effects of wind energy projects on military readiness that the Department of Defense  DoD  is performing in response to Section 358 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006  P L  109 163    The study was due no later than May 7  2006  yet the Department has missed this deadline and no report  to date  has been released       In March 2006  the DOD and Department of Homeland Security released an interim policy that resulted in the Federal Aviation Administration s  FAA  issuance of  Notices of Presumed Hazard  to wind projects located within a radar line of site of the National Air Defense and Homeland Security Radars   Many of the projects that received these notices are located in the Midwest   Each day this report remains delinquent  these wind energy projects lose opportunities for new investment  and may not be able to meet deadlines for completion   Additionally  due the limited number of companies with expertise in windmill farm construction  the delay involving current projects indirectly affects a large number of proposed projects   As a result  wind development has been halted in its tracks  with the threat of permanent derailment       Although we eagerly await the findings of the DOD study  we are concerned that the study will report on interference from wind turbines on radar systems  but will not adequately examine effective mitigation opportunities   Therefore  we are concerned about the impact of the report on overall wind production       We ask that you immediately expedite the completion of this report and that the report include a clear articulation of any conflict between the windmill farms and military radar installations   This is necessary to provide clarity for the industry and allow these companies to move forward with their projects   We also ask that you ensure the report meets the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act by identifying any technologies that could mitigate any adverse effects on the military operations identified       We understand that the nomination of Mr  Robert L  Wilkie to be Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs for the Department of Defense  DoD  is pending before the Senate   We have placed a    hold    on this nomination because of the Department   s failure to meet the deadline for completion and release of the aforementioned congressionally mandated report       We would appreciate your effort to release this long awaited report prior to consideration of this nomination         Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator
