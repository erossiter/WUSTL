     DURBIN SAYS PRESIDENT S BUDGET IS NOT THE BUDGET AMERICANS VOTED FOR IN NOVEMBER

PRESIDENT S BUDGET IS NOT THE BUDGET AMERICANS VOTED FOR IN NOVEMBER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Monday  February 5  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said the budget President Bush delivered to Capitol Hill today shows that the President has not listened to the American people who voiced their opinions at the voting booth last fall   Last November  the country voted for a government that would put the needs of American families first  said Durbin   We need to make funding for education  healthcare  homeland security and a new energy policy our top priorities  This budget puts them near the bottom of the list  We need to be responsible with the way we spend federal dollars so that we dont saddle our children with our debt   These are the priorities shared by millions of American families  The budget the President presented today is not the budget the American people voted for    Education   Last November  Americans voted for a government that would give schools the money they need  so that their kids could have a good education   This budget not only fails to give our failing public school system additional funds  it proposes to cut funding by  1 5 billion  for a total of  56 billion   This represents a 2 6 percent cut from the fiscal year 2007 level of  57 5 billion   We need a budget that will fund our struggling public school system and ensure that the cost of a college education is still within reach for middle income Americans   For the sixth year in a row  the President s budget fails to fully fund the federal No Child Left Behind  NCLB  act   While funding for NCLB will increase by  993 million  for a total of  24 6 billion  the President s budget continues to under fund NCLB by  14 8 billion this year  for a cumulative shortfall of  70 9 billion since enactment of the law   The bulk of federal funding for NCLB is provided through Title I  which helps schools provide textbooks  teachers and additional classroom help to students from low income families   The President s proposed increases for Title I and math instruction  and a  300 million voucher initiative to support education outside of public schools would come at the expense of 44 programs  including career and technical education  Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  the Leveraging Education Assistance Partnerships Program and Perkins Loans   ILLINOIS IMPACT   The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  SEOG  Program provides need based grants to low income undergraduate students    In 2005  over  56 4 million in SEOG grants helped more than 49 000 Illinois college students   The Leveraging Education Assistance Partnerships Program provides grants to states for need based grants and community service work study assistance to college students    In 2006  Illinois received over  2 million in LEAP grants  The Perkins Loan program provides low interest loans to help needy students   In 2005  approximately  90 3 million in Perkins loans helped over 39 000 Illinois colleges students   The President also proposes a  687 million reduction for career and technical education funded by the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act  despite the fact that Congress reauthorized and strengthened this program just last year and the President signed the reauthorization bill into law   As a result of the cut  most states would see their funding reduced by almost half  and 5 million secondary students and 3 million postsecondary students participating in career and technical education programs  as well as more than 2 million students enrolled in Tech Prep programs  could see their courses reduced or eliminated   ILLINOIS IMPACT  In Illinois  colleges would have  22 7 million for such assistance in FY08  compared to  49 2 million in Perkins technical and vocational grants last year   For the fifth year in a row  the Presidents budget makes college more expensive by under funding or cutting student aid programs aimed at helping disadvantaged students gain access to college and failing to include any initiatives that help college students pay off student loans   The Presidents budget proposes to increase the maximum Pell to  4 600 in 2008 and increase it to  5 400 by 2012   However  the budget only includes enough funding for a maximum award of  4 050  the same as it has been for the past five years   The President s proposed increase would be implemented through separate legislation and paid for with cuts in mandatory spending    Pell Grants have not kept pace with the rising cost of attending college   In 1986  maximum Pell Grant covered 51  of the cost of tuition  fees  room and board at a public four year college  but only covered 35  in 2005   ILLINOIS IMPACT   Last year  over 192 000 Illinois students were awarded nearly  440 million in Pell Grants   The Presidents budget also fails to include any initiatives to help college students pay off student loans   From 2001 through 2006  the price of tuition  fees  and room and board at four year public institutions has increased by 44 percent nationally and 34 percent in Illinois   In 2004  nearly two thirds of all four year college graduates nationwide had student loan debt  compared with less than one third of graduates in 1993   The Presidents budget does nothing to help students struggling with this increasing debt   The President s budget would also cut Head Start by  100 million  for a total of  6 79 billion   For 30 years  Head Start has helped young children from disadvantaged families enter kindergarten as prepared as their more economically advantaged peers   Since 2002  Head Start has been cut by 11 percent in real terms   Head Start serves more than half a million children all over the United States   The budget adds no increase for afterschool programs  currently funded at  981 million    1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion authorized level for FY2007   The Bush budget leaves behind 2 million students who would receive afterschool services if the program were funded at the level promised last year in NCLB   ILLINOIS IMPACT   If afterschool programs were fully funded at the federal level  Illinois would receive  102 million in FY2008   Under the President s budget  the state is projected to receive only  44 million  leaving more than 76 000 Illinois students without access to a local afterschool program   Parents of these children will continue to wonder where their children are between the time school is dismissed and the time the parents can arrive home from work   Health Care   President Bush s real thoughts about health care can be found in the budget he released today   massive spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid  no real improvements to the Medicare drug benefit  and penalties for states that are working to expand health coverage to all children   We must put providing real help for seniors ahead of lining the pockets of the corporations that benefit when seniors get sick  said Durbin  Until the President adequately funds Medicare and gives the government authority to bargain on behalf of seniors  the current drug plan will continue to be a financial boon to the pharmaceutical industry and a bad deal for seniors   Once again  the President is proposing large cuts to Medicare and Medicaid   The Presidents budget recommends reducing spending for Medicare by  76 billion and Medicaid by  25 billion over the next five years through legislative and regulatory changes   These cuts would come on top of the more than  10 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts  over five years  he signed into law last year   The Presidents budget also fails to recommend improvements to the Medicare drug benefit  and his proposal for expanding health insurance coverage would do more harm than good   ILLINOIS IMPACT  In Illinois  more than 1 5 million people depend on Medicare and more than 2 million people depend on Medicaid for essential health care services   The President budget reduces federal payments for the State Childrens Health Insurance Program to Illinois and other states that cover children with family incomes exceeding twice the poverty level   ILLINOIS IMPACT   Illinois would lose  16 million in SCHIP funding under the Presidents budget  which translates into a loss of coverage for 13 000 children in the state   Illinois has covered all children  regardless of income  since July 2006 with its historic All Kids initiative   The Presidents recommendations would determine limitations on which kids have health insurance and penalize Illinois expansion efforts   Nationally  SCHIP ensures the health coverage of 6 million children   The Presidents budget also eliminates vital programs that increase minority representation in the health professions and access to quality healthcare for all  The budget reduces funding for Health Professions Training by  180 million  a 61  cut in important programs that contribute to the quality of our healthcare system  Cutting scholarships for disadvantaged students will reduce the opportunities for many students to pursue a career in medicine   ILLINOIS IMPACT   The University of Illinois at Chicagos  UIC  Center of Excellence and the federal Health Career Opportunities Program sites at UIC  Chicago State University  Oakton Community College and other academic institutions are critical for training a diverse cadre of health professionals and improving service to underserved and rural populations   Yet the Presidents budget eliminates all funding for both the Health Career Opportunities program and Centers of Excellence in health professions training   The Presidents budget proposes a total of  17 million for Rural Health Programs  a cut of  104 million or 87    This includes eliminating the Area Health Education Centers  AHEC  grant program which improves access to health care services  predominantly primary health care  through projects and activities that link health professions education with communities   ILLINOIS IMPACT  In Illinois  AHEC assists those communities with medically underserved populations and or health professions shortage areas   AHEC partners include Midwestern University  University of Illinois  Southern Illinois University  Illinois Department of Public Health  Chicago Department of Public Health  Illinois Primary Health Care Association  and Illinois Rural Health Association   While the President proposes a  13 million increase for Nurse Loan Repayments  his budget eliminates the Advanced Education Nursing program which allows registered nurses to go to school to qualify as faculty or other nurse specialties   ILLINOIS IMPACT  Illinois faces an acute shortage of nurse faculty  and the proposed elimination of the only federal program to address this need would hurt Illinois efforts to address this growing problem   Last year  for lack of nurse teachers  Illinois schools turned away 1 900 qualified applicants for enrollment in a college of nursing   Despite the growing number of applicants  Illinois is moving toward a nurse shortage that could reach 21 000 nurses needed by 2020   The President s Budget also proposes to cut  424 million  when compared to the FY07 CR that Congress is now considering  from the Global Fund to fight HIV AIDS  Tuberculosis  and Malaria   While the President should be commended for his commitment to fight HIV AIDS  the Global Fund should be funded just as aggressively    Homeland Security   Our law enforcement agencies  first responders and emergency preparedness officials back home need to know that the federal government will provide them with the tools they need  said Durbin   As we witnessed with recent natural disasters  communities large and small face special challenges and vulnerabilities when disaster strikes   The Presidents budget does not provide the funding needed to protect public safety and to ensure that our citizens will be evacuated quickly and safely should a natural disaster or terrorist attack occur   The Presidents budget cuts funding for state and local law enforcement assistance by  1 3 billion  dramatically decreases funding for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program  and eliminates the SAFER firefighter hiring program   The proposed cuts in state and local law enforcement assistance programs will pose a serious setback for Illinois communities    The programs for which the President seeks to cut funding include the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants  which have been used to fund anti methamphetamine task forces in Illinois  as well as other programs dealing with drug prevention and enforcement  law enforcement information sharing  and combating gangs   ILLINOIS IMPACT   The amount of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased nearly tenfold between 1997 and 2003   The elimination of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funds would severely hamper regional methamphetamine task forces and several crime prevention programs   Whereas the Democratically controlled Congress allocated  542 million for COPS in the Fiscal Year 2007 Continuing Resolution   a  70 million increase over 2006 funding levels  the Presidents budget would give only  32 million for COPS   ILLINOIS IMPACT  Since 1994  Illinois has received more than  422 7 million in COPS grants for community policing efforts  helping Illinois law enforcement agencies fight and reduce violent crime   These grants have provided funding for 5 530 additional police officers and sheriffs deputies in Illinois  and have benefited 682 local and state law enforcement agencies   In addition  the COPS program has given Illinois  22 million to hire 182 school resource offices to enhance safety in Illinois primary and secondary schools  The program has also awarded over  50 million for crime fighting technologies  such as communications equipment and information sharing systems   The President s budget completely eliminates the SAFER firefighter hiring program  which provides funding to fire departments to hire additional fire fighters and first responders   In Illinois  approximately  4 4 million was awarded to fire departments for hiring recruiting additional fire fighters in 2006   The budget also reduces funding for the FIRE program  from  547 million to  300 million   ILLINOIS IMPACT  In Illinois  over  13 6 million was awarded to IL fire departments for equipment in 2006   This program provides equipment and training to fire departments in Illinois and across the country to help them prepare and respond to terrorist incidents   Energy   The Presidents budget does not fully address the most critical energy issue facing Americans today  our growing dependence on foreign oil and the impact this dependence has on our economic security and national security   We need an aggressive energy policy that provides more funding for the development of renewable energy options   The Presidents budget fails to recognize the role that renewable energy needs to play in our energy future   Overall funding for funding for energy efficiency programs was also cut by 21 9 percent from 2006 levels   The budget proposes an 8 6 percent cut from fiscal year 2007 in wind energy funding  to  40 million  flat funding for solar energy  and a 17 6 percent cut in weatherization and intergovernmental activities  which includes the adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and practices by state and local governments   As energy prices continue to burden low income American families  the Administration has again failed to provide full funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program   The Administration provided only  1 5 billion in formula funding and  282 million for contingency funding  for a total of  1 782 billion  a 17 5   cut from the  2 161 billion enacted for FY 2007 and FY 2006   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized LIHEAP at  5 1 billion   ILLINOIS IMPACT  Nearly 1 million families in Illinois seek assistance from LIHEAP annually   This year  Illinois formula funding will be cut from  113 million to  85 million in the following year    According the Short Term Energy Outlook  EIA DOE 1 9 07  the 79 percent of Midwestern households using natural gas are paying 95 percent more for heat than they were in  2001 2002    Finally  just weeks after President Bush mentioned global climate change in his State of the Union address and only days after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded for the first time that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver  the Administrations Climate Change Science Program budget was cut by  120 million  or a 7 percent decrease from FY 2007 budget    Agriculture   More than 76 000 farm families in Illinois produce crops and livestock that feed families all over the world  said Durbin   Our states farmland is some of the most productive on the planet  and federal agriculture policy is vitally important to Illinoisans   One of the most critical funding areas for the continued vitality of Americas farmers and rural areas is agricultural research  which has led to improvements in crop and livestock genetics and the development of new and value added products   Some of the best research in this area is being done at the ARS lab in Peoria and the University of Illinois Extension Services   Unfortunately  the Presidents budget proposes cuts in nearly every agricultural research line item   Overall  the agricultural research budget was cut  306 million or 13 percent from FY2007  with decreases of  28 million in basic research and  133 million in applied research   The Presidents budget also cuts funding for the Agriculture Research Service  ARS  by  48 million and for Extension activities by  167 million    Transportation   Amtrak is vitally important to Illinois  said Durbin   Unfortunately  the President and his Administration are once again attempting to privatize and eventually eliminate Amtrak rail service   Year after year  these political games drive Amtrak to the brink of insolvency and Congress is forced to ride to the rescue   The President s 2008 Budget would once again derail Amtrak by allocating  800 million for Amtrak service nationwide  roughly  800 million less than what the rail line needs to operate   The cuts could force closure of some routes   ILLINOIS IMPACT  Chicago and 29 other communities in Illinois that serve over 3 million people would see a reduction or possible shutdown of Amtrak service   Durbin noted that more than 3 million people in Illinois boarded Amtrak in 2005  making the passenger rail line one of the most important modes of transportation in the state  Every intrastate route in Illinois has seen significant increases in the past few years in ridership  and ridership numbers on three state routes were up by an average of 49  over a comparative two month span from the previous year after the state of Illinois added train service in late 2006   Therefore  it is vital that Amtrak receive the proper level of federal funding so that these trains can continue to operate   The Presidents budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by  750 million   ILLINOIS IMPACT  Illinois will lose  34 million  threatening funding for new runway construction at OHare and improvement at airports such as Waukegan  Palwaukee  Cahokia  and Robinson   Spending Responsibly   American families balance their checkbooks  why shouldnt the federal government   Last November  Americans voted for a government that would work to balance the national checkbook  but the Presidents budget will put our country in a deeper fiscal hole   By using gimmicks and failing to account for the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  the President claims that his budget will eliminate the annual deficit by 2012   The American people will not be fooled by this sleight of hand   Last month  the President announced that he was sending 21 500 additional combat forces to Iraq   But the reality of the escalation is even worse  the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the real numbers of troops sent may be closer to 48 000 than 21 500 when you include support personnel   The Administration had predicted that the troop increase would cost  5 6 billion   CBO estimates that it may cost as much as  27 billion over the next year   The Presidents budget also fails to include adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax in his budget which  if not changed  will raise taxes on tens of millions of middle class families this year and beyond   The President knows that Congress will not allow the middle class to be gobbled up by the AMT  yet he avoids addressing this issue altogether in his budget   Durbin noted that when the President took office in 2001  his economic experts had predicted that the U S  would run a  5 trillion surplus over the next decade   The U S  is now expected to run a  9 10 trillion dollar deficit over that same time   The national debt now equals almost  29 000 for every American alive today
