     STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR DICK DURBIN REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE S INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON THE PATRIOT ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3 9 2007                                                                                                                                                                            STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR DICK DURBIN REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE S INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON THE PATRIOT ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Friday  March 9  2007  In late 2005  I requested that the U S  Department of Justice investigate the use of National Security Letters and other powers granted under the USA Patriot Act   The Justice Department s own investigation  which is now concluded  confirms the American people s worst fears about the Patriot Act  It appears that the Administration has used these powers without even the most basic regard for the privacy of innocent Americans  This demonstrates the need for reasonable reforms to the Patriot Act that the bipartisan SAFE Act coalition proposed years ago   I voted for the original Patriot Act in 2001 and I voted to reauthorize it last year  because I believe we should give the government all the tools it needs to fight terrorism   However  I continue to believe that the Patriot Act must include reasonable checks and balances to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans   Background In a November 10  2005 letter  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Larry Craig  R ID   Russ Feingold  D WI   John Sununu  R NH   and Ken Salazar  D CO  asked the Justice Department s Inspector General to investigate the Justice Department s use of National Security Letters and other Patriot Act powers   At the insistence of this bipartisan group of Senators  last year s Patriot Act Reauthorization required the Inspector General to undertake this investigation   The Patriot Act expanded the government s authority to use National Security Letters  which are also known as NSLs   An NSL is a type of administrative subpoena   It is a document signed by an FBI agent that requires businesses to disclose the sensitive personal records of their customers   An NSL does not require the approval of a judge or a grand jury   A business that receives an NSL is subject to an automatic  permanent gag order    11 10 2005 letter below   November 10  2005  The Honorable Glenn A  Fine  Inspector General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C   20530  Dear Inspector General Fine   We write to request that you conduct a review of the Justice Department s use of the expanded search and surveillance authorities granted by the USA PATRIOT Act   Some have cited your office s findings as evidence that there have been no abuses of the PATRIOT Act   However  it is our understanding that your office has not conducted a review to determine how PATRIOT Act authorities have been used and whether they have been abused   According to The FBI s Secret Scrutiny  a November 6  2005 story in The Washington Post  Deputy Inspector General Paul K  Martin said  We have not initiated a broad based review that examines the use of specific provisions of the Patriot Act   Rather  it is our understanding that you have limited your review to complaints that you have received from the public   With regard to these complaints  you stated at a May 10  2005 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Crime  Terrorism  and Homeland Security  None of the allegations we have received alleging misconduct by a Department employee  with one possible exception  related to use of a provision of the Patriot Act   It is not possible to determine whether the PATRIOT Act has been abused solely based upon a review of citizen complaints   Many PATRIOT Act authorities can be used secretly and people who are targeted may not know that their homes have been searched  their phones have been tapped or their personal records have been seized   As you said at the May 10  2005 Judiciary Subcommittee hearing  We do rely upon complaints coming in     To the extent that people do not know of anything happening to them  there is an issue about whether they can complain  so I think that s a legitimate question   Moreover  even if the FBI complies with the PATRIOT Act  whether the use of PATRIOT Act authorities may lead to civil liberties violations is an open question   For example  two federal courts have held that one provision of the PATRIOT Act violates the constitutional rights of American citizens   Therefore  we request that you conduct a review of the Justice Department s use of the expanded search and surveillance authorities granted by the USA PATRIOT Act   In particular  we would appreciate your review of the use of authorities granted by Sections 206  212  213  214  215  216  218  and 505   As Congress debates legislation that would reauthorize and revise the PATRIOT Act  the American people are entitled to know whether the PATRIOT Act has been abused   As the independent bipartisan 9 11 Commission concluded  The burden of proof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on the executive   In light of imminent Congressional action on PATRIOT Act reauthorization  we respectfully request that you inform us whether you plan to initiate a review as soon as possible  and no later than November 16  2005   Thank you for your time and consideration   Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  Larry E  Craig  Russell D  Feingold  John E  Sununu  Ken Salazar
