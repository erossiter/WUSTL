     DURBIN  ILLINOIS MUST BE TREATED FAIRLY IN MEASURE TO HELP UNINSURED

ILLINOIS MUST BE TREATED FAIRLY IN MEASURE TO HELP UNINSURED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thursday  September 15  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the administrators of 20 state high risk health insurance pools detailing his objections to legislation in the Senate  S  288  the State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act  that would result in funding cuts for Illinois and other states with a large number of people without health insurance       Durbin sent his letter in response to criticism leveled by the state administrators that he is blocking funding that would help the uninsured   The bill in question would reauthorize federal grants to states for the operation of high risk pools   High risk pools provide health insurance for individuals with medical conditions that make it impossible for them to qualify for coverage in the regular market          The new bill cuts funding to states with large numbers of uninsured people  such as Illinois  Colorado  Indiana  Maryland and Oklahoma  and increases funding to states with a smaller number of uninsured Americans     wrote Durbin      There is no reason a state like Illinois that has 1 8 million people lacking access to health insurance should suffer a funding cut of 60 percent while a state like South Dakota with 90 000 uninsured people sees its funding more than double  The money should follow the people in need  not be determined by politics          Durbin noted that he has made several attempts this year to reach out to senators on the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee to negotiate a formula that is more fair to Illinois and the larger states      I have approached them with three separate ideas for a compromise  only to be rebuffed each time     Durbin wrote      I would welcome your assistance in reaching out to the HELP leadership to shape a fair compromise             The funds that Illinois will lose with the formula in S  288 could fund insurance for hundreds of Illinoisans and I stand by them     wrote Durbin       Durbin also called on the state administrators to work with him in his efforts to secure funds for the existing program   The state high risk pools have not received any federal funding in two years   Earlier this year  Durbin attempted to offer an amendment to the Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  and Education appropriations bill that would fund the state high risk pools  but was not able to find a suitable offset for the money       When the Labor HHS appropriations bill comes to the Senate floor later this year  Durbin will offer an amendment to fund the state high risk pools       Full text of Durbin   s letter to the state high risk pool administrators follows         September 15  2005   Dear_____    I received a copy of the letter you sent to Majority Leader Bill Frist regarding the high risk pool legislation   I am writing to clarify my position  which you mis characterized in your letter  I have worked to improve the health care system in our country so that it does not leave people    uninsurable      However  until we achieve coverage for all Americans regardless of age  gender  sex  race  class and health status  I am supportive of the role high risk pools play in helping sick and disabled Americans find coverage in our current system       When the Department of Health and Human Services awarded its first high risk pool grants in December of 2003  then Secretary Tommy Thompson hailed the program  saying     getting health insurance to the uninsured has been a high priority of the Bush Administration   These grants will make it more affordable for states to expand access to health care through high risk pools for the uninsured      Well  the re authorization of the high risk pool legislation does not accomplish this goal for my state or other states with high numbers of people who lack access to health insurance       The new bill cuts funding to states with large numbers of uninsured people  such as Illinois  Colorado  Indiana  Maryland and Okalahoma  and increases funding to states with a smaller number of uninsured Americans   There is no reason a state like Illinois  with 1 8 million people lacking access to health insurance  should suffer a funding cut of 60 percent while a state like South Dakota with 90 000 uninsured people sees its funding more than double   The money should follow the people in need  not be determined by politics       Your letter tells Senator Frist I have    blocked    S 288   This is not accurate   I have made numerous attempts to negotiate with the leadership of the HELP Committee to find an acceptable compromise   I have approached them with three separate ideas for a compromise  only to be rebuffed each time   I firmly support providing health insurance to those who are most in need   That is why I am working hard to protect Illinois in the re authorization of this program   I would welcome your assistance in reaching out to the HELP leadership to shape a fair compromise       Finally  your letter mentions the urgency of passing this legislation because the House seed grant funding will expire in October 2005   In fact  there have been no funds appropriated for high risk pools in either the House or the Senate appropriations process for two years   I attempted to include money in the high risk pool program when the Labor HHS Appropriations bill was in Subcommittee  but I was unable to find an acceptable offset given these difficult fiscal times   If we cannot come to a compromise on the funding formula in the authorization bill  I invite you to join me in attempting to add money to the existing high risk pool bill when the Labor HHS appropriations bill comes to the Senate floor later this fall       In closing  I can not stand by and allow a formula to pass that will deprive states with high numbers of uninsured the funding they need to provide coverage in their high risk programs   The funds that Illinois will lose with the formula in S 288 could fund insurance for hundreds of Illinoisans and I stand by them       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
