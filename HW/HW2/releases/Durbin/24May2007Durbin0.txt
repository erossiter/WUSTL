May 24  2007        United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent a letter today  asking the President to follow through with his call to stop the genocide in Darfur  Five weeks ago  the President gave a speech at the Holocaust Museum in Washington  where he said     we have a moral obligation to stop     the genocide  Since then  the United States has not taken further action to end this horrific humanitarian crisis       In his speech  the President said his administration would take stronger steps to end the genocide in Darfur should Sudanese President Bashir not allow the deployment of UN and African Union peacekeepers  end his support of the Janjaweed and allow for humanitarian aid to reach Darfur  President Bashir has yet to act        Five weeks after his hopeful and promising speech  the President has failed to put actions behind his words   said Senator Durbin   I agree with the President that we have a moral obligation to end the genocide  but we must lead  We must act  Five weeks is too long to wait        In his speech  President Bush said the US would take the following steps if President Bashir didn t act within a  short time     Tighten U S  economic sanctions on Sudan Target sanctions against individuals  responsible for the violence in Sudan Prepare a new United Nations Security Council resolution targeting Sudan  To date  none of these steps have been taken       In March  Senator Durbin introduced The Genocide Accountability Act  S 888   which closed the legal loopholes that prevented the Justice Department from prosecuting those who ve committed genocide outside the United States  Also in March  Durbin sent a letter to the President asking him to introduce a UN resolution that would impose multilateral economic sanctions of the Sudanese Government       Senator Durbin was named the Chairman of the first ever congressional committee dealing specifically with human rights this January  The Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law has jurisdiction over all human rights law and polices  focusing intently on issues of genocide  human trafficking  war crimes and torture  The committee s first hearing was on the genocide in Darfur       Text of the letter appears below      May 24  2007   The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    Last month you delivered a moving speech at the Holocaust Museum in Washington in which you rightly declared   No one who sees these pictures can doubt that genocide is the only word for what is happening in Darfur    and that we have a moral obligation to stop it    As of today  five weeks have passed since that speech  and yet the United States has not taken further steps to stop the genocide in Darfur   It is time to act       In your speech you called the negotiations between U N  Secretary General Ban Ki moon and Sudanese President Bashir the  last chance  for Bashir to do the following   Follow through on the deployment of the U N  support forces Allow the deployment of the full  joint U N  African Union peacekeeping force End support for the Janjaweed Allow humanitarian aid to reach the people of Darfur Stop his pattern of obstruction once and for all      You then declared that if Bashir does not fulfill these steps in a  short time  your Administration will take the following steps   Tighten U S  economic sanctions on Sudan Target sanctions against individuals responsible for the violence in Sudan Prepare a new United Nations Security Council resolution targeting Sudan    Five weeks later  Bashir has not responded appropriately   In fact  Mr  Ban s own spokesperson has called renewed bombing in Sudan  indiscriminate  and a violation of international law   It is time to take the further steps you outlined to end this genocide       In addition  I will be introducing legislation that your Administration has helped to draft that will strengthen the disclosure of business activities that benefit the Sudanese government  increase penalties for Sudan sanctions violations  and authorize extra resources for the Administration to strengthen economic sanctions   I hope that you will support this bill  and I stand ready to help you in any way I can       As you stated last month at the Holocaust Museum   you who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat it is to look it in the face  and not back down   It is evil we are now seeing in Sudan    and we re not going to back down    Let s take the next steps forward  and let s do it now       Sincerely      Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
