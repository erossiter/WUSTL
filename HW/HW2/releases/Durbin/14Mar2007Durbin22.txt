COLEMAN INTRODUCE BILL TO EXPAND FAMILY BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR METH ADDICTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wednesday  March 14  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   a member of the Senate Anti Meth Caucus  and Norm Coleman  R MN  today introduced legislation  known as the Family Based Meth Treatment Act of 2007 to improve comprehensive  family based substance abuse treatment for methamphetamine addiction        Family based treatment for substance abuse acknowledges the important connection between a parent and a child   Durbin said    Many parents cannot successfully utilize substance abuse and mental health services if their children are excluded   More importantly  they should never be forced to make that choice   I have been inspired by the courageous individuals I have met who are recovering from substance abuse  not only for themselves but also for their families        Durbin and Coleman noted that studies consistently show that family based treatment increases long term sobriety  educational enrollment  and gainful employment  along with decreased criminal activity and child development delays  Family based treatment centers combine substance abuse recovery with mental health counseling  medical treatment  parenting  education and legal services   These programs provide essential needs of the entire family  rather than just the parent  and have proven to be extremely effective       Statistically  Illinois and Minnesota mirror the rest of the country with at least 70  of the child welfare cases involving a substance abusing parent   The meth epidemic now poses greater costs to states and the federal government as a result of increased child welfare and criminal justice caseloads        I am proud to say that Illinois has two very successful family based treatment centers statewide   said Durbin    The Women s Treatment Center and the Haymarket Center in Chicago have helped hundreds of participants reach their long term sobriety goals  improve family relationships  enroll in school  and find jobs   This legislation will give these family based centers the tools and resources they need to continue helping those that come through the door and give them a chance to open new doors for communities that still need help         I know firsthand from talking to victims and communities across Minnesota that methamphetamine abuse brings devastating consequences not only to individual abusers  but also to families  friends and the community   said Coleman   Sadly  meth has a tendency to tear families apart   Our legislation will not only help parents and pregnant women break their addictions  but also provide services to help them recover their relationships with their children        The Family Based Meth Treatment Act of 2007      Allows additional funding for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment  CSAT  to award grants to programs that provide comprehensive  family based substance abuse treatment for parents and pregnant women   Requires the Director to give priority to programs serving areas affected by high rates of meth addiction with special attention to rural areas   Provides funding to organizations that specialize in comprehensive  family based substance abuse treatment services for non violent offenders as an alternative to incarceration    Senator Durbin recently received the Guardian Award from the Partnership for a Drug Free America to recognize his work in combating substance abuse   He has successfully secured funds for local meth awareness campaigns in Illinois   In 2005  Durbin and Coleman cosponsored the Combat Meth Act which was included as part of the PATRIOT Act and signed into law   The bill included funds set aside for prosecutors and law enforcement agents for rural communities
