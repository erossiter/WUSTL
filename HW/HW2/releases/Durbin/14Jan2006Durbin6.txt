                                                                                                                                                                                            Saturday  January 14  2006   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  delivered the Democratic response to President Bush s weekly radio address on Saturday  January 14     Hello  I   m Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois   It   s really hard to believe  but if he were alive today  Dr  Martin Luther King would be 77 years old   He   s been gone now for nearly as long as he lived   Yet his name  and his life  and his dream still remain a potent moral force in America       I wonder what Dr  Martin Luther King would think about America today   I   m sure he would be pleased with the progress we have made on racial justice   He sure would be proud of Barack Obama  who keynoted the Democratic National Convention and now serves as my colleague from Illinois   He won in my state by one of the largest margins in the history of the Land of Lincoln       But Dr  King would know     we all know     that we haven   t reached the Promised Land   There are a lot of other changes in America that would trouble Dr  King       In his last book  his last words to America  here   s what he said      There is nothing wrong with power   The problem is that  in America  the power is so unequally divided          That is certainly true in America and you can see it in Washington today   Powerful corporate special interests control the agenda and people who don   t have paid lobbyists really don   t have much of a voice   To these power players  the challenges facing America are not problems to solve  but opportunities to exploit    We   re all paying the price for that       Instead of a reliable Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors  we have a complicated mess that wastes tens of billions of dollars on giveaways to pharmaceutical companies and big insurance companies       Instead of a strategy for real energy independence for America  we end up with a plan that includes  10 billion in subsidies to big oil and gas companies    companies that are already enjoying the highest profits in their histories       Corporate profits are up dramatically  but real wages for American workers have gone down now for four years in a row    Think of this   People are putting in a lifetime on their jobs and then losing their pensions to mergers  bankruptcies and corporate sleight of hand       In the wealthiest nation on Earth  it is unforgivable that 45 million Americans have no health insurance and so many people are underinsured    at some of the highest costs you can imagine   Yet the White House and this Republican Congress have done literally nothing over the last five years to address this challenge       Many years ago when I was a college student  I was fortunate to work as an intern for one of the greatest men to ever serve the state of Illinois in the United States Senate   His name was Paul Douglas   He worked with Dr  Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders to help pass the 1957 Civil Rights Act   He was also the first chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee       Senator Douglas once said that the greatest cost of cronyism and corruption is not the dollars it wastes  but the damage it does to people   s trust in government   Here   s what he said      That helps to destroy one of the major foundations in democracy itself          The litany of corruption today in Washington reaches the highest levels you can imagine   from the White House  to Congress  to the well appointed corporate suites on K Street       Now  neither Democrats nor Republicans have a monopoly on virtue   The leadership that brought us to this moment  though  is undeniable   For the last five years  Republicans have enjoyed almost total control of the federal government   This nearly unprecedented concentration of power has produced  sadly  a culture of corruption that is preventing government from dealing with the real needs of our nation       Americans deserve better  and Democrats have pledged to do better   The first step is to restore honest leadership in Washington   When Congress returns this week  Democrats will introduce a comprehensive reform package   Here   s what we need to do   increase accountability in government  enforce the government ethics rules  strengthen lobby bans  and close the revolving door between Congress and K Street     to stop people at the highest levels of government from cashing in on government service       When the President delivers his annual State of the Union address at the end of the month  I hope he will join us  on a bipartisan basis  in reforming the way Washington does business   As Dr  King reminded us  America has no second  or third class citizens   We should all have an equal voice and an equal chance to succeed       I   m Dick Durbin from Illinois   Thanks for listening
