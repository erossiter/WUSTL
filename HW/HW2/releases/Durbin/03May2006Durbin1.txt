May 3  2006           With fuel costs continuing to rise  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today said that thousands of Illinois farmers are facing crippling input costs   Durbin joined his Democratic colleagues in calling for immediate relief for consumers  small businesses and farmers          Illinois farmers have expressed real concern when every dollar they earn from their land is eaten up by the rising cost of fuel and fertilizer     Durbin said      When energy prices cut deep into the profits of family farmers  it threatens their survival          For Illinois farmers struggling to stay profitable  increased fuel prices mean higher costs for operating farm machinery  as well as rising fertilizer and pesticide prices   According to the Illinois Farm Business Farm Management Association and University of Illinois Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics  Champaign Urbana  the average Illinois farmer  with a 1 000 acre farm  is paying  24 000 more than he or she did in 2001 to operate a farm   This 25  increase in costs is a direct result of higher gas prices which have led to higher fuel  fertilizer and pesticide costs for farmers across the state  This year   s dramatic gasoline price spikes are expected to exacerbate the problem even further          Fertilizer is double what it was two years ago and so is diesel   Those prices are just backbreaking   During planting season  our tractors go through hundreds of gallons of diesel a day   Fuel prices used to be a small part of the operating budget and now it   s a major part of our budget   We   re stretching our necks out there planting this season     said Illinois Farmers Union member  Gordon Stein of St  Elmo  Illinois          Illinois farmers are paying more for their diesel fuel and for their fertilizer and some are being forced to sell off land that has belonged to their families for generations  Things have never been easy for small farmers  but the combination of recent droughts  sky high gas prices and an uncertain commodities market is a perfect storm that threatens the future of American agriculture     Durbin said        Whether it s the high cost of gasoline  diesel fuel  or fertilizer  rising fuel and natural gas prices impact every part of our operations  putting a severe strain on farm profitability   said Illinois Farm Bureau President  Philip Nelson       Durbin noted that while fuel prices have increased  commodity prices have either stayed level or decreased    He said Illinois farmers in 2005 paid an additional  314 million for fuel  fertilizer and pesticides than they did in 2004   However  corn and soybean prices have remained level or even decreased in recent years   On average  in 2001  farmers received  1 97 per bushel for their corn  in 2005  they received  1 90   Soybeans pay more today than they did in 2001  but from 2004 to 2005  farmers received about 25 cents per bushel less for their beans          Farmers coping with high energy prices tell me they are unable to purchase new equipment or sign up in advance for seed or fertilizer contracts that will save them money down the road   Equipment dealers and community bankers tell me the same thing   These trends have spillover costs for rural America  as equipment dealers see their sales drop and community bankers see increasing numbers of family farmers filing for bankruptcy and leaving the farm     Durbin said          The Republican leadership in Congress has proposed a  100 rebate to help Americans through this energy crisis   I respect Illinois farm families too much to suggest this is a serious response to a real crisis     Durbin concluded
