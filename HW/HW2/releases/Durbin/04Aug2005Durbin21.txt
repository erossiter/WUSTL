                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  August 4  2005    CHICAGO  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today announced  25 million in federal funding for the North South Wacker Drive Reconstruction Project   Durbin and Obama were joined by Mayor Richard Daley and IDOT Secretary Tim Martin   The funding is part of  215 million Durbin and Obama have secured for Illinois in the TEA 3 transportation bill recently passed in Congress           Improving access to Congress Parkway and I 290 is an important part of the North South Wacker Drive project for traffic congestion and safety reasons     Durbin said      Chicago will benefit from a safer  more accommodating Wacker Drive once the North South reconstruction is completed             Securing funding for Wacker Drive is a result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     Obama said     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges             These transportation projects are vitally important to Chicago   s economy and to the quality of life in our neighborhoods  and they   ll create thousands of construction jobs for the hard working people of our city     Daley said      Senators Durbin  Obama and the entire Illinois Congressional delegation worked very hard on this legislation  and they brought home a winner           The  25 million in funding secured by Durbin will go towards rebuilding an approximately one mile stretch of upper and lower Wacker from Randolph to Congress Parkway       That section of roadway was built in the 1950s  and is in need of replacement   The roadway sees an average of about 60 000 vehicles each weekday   The improvement will help improve traffic flow and increase safety for motorists and pedestrians       The reconstruction of North South Wacker Drive will mark the second half of the effort to rebuild one of Chicago   s most storied roadways   The East West segment of Wacker  from Michigan to Randolph  was rebuilt in 2001 02   The  200 million project was completed on time and within budget        The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21        Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level       Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families          It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois             This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
