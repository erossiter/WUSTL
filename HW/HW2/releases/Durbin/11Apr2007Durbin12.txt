ASKS GREAT LAKES AVIATION TO BEGIN SERVICE IMMEDIATELY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wednesday  April 11  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the CEO of Great Lakes Airlines  Chuck Howell asking that the airline work to begin providing scheduled passenger air service from Decatur  Marion Herrin  Quincy  and Springfield  Illinois to St  Louis as soon as possible   Great Lakes Airlines was awarded the Essential Air Service contracts in Marion Herrin  Quincy and most recently Decatur  Illinois  Durbin has asked that the airline work to make sure the necessary planes  personnel and equipment are in place so that service between downstate communities and St  Louis Lambert International Airport can resume   Without the air service that these downstate communities have come to rely on  basic travel  tourism and economic development has been disrupted  said Durbin   I strongly urge Great Lakes to make this a priority and begin service as soon as possible   I am pleased to see that the Department of Transportation has named a new carrier for Marion Herrin  Quincy and Decatur flights to St  Louis  and we need to do everything possible to make sure that Great Lakes has all the help they need to get off the ground and in the air right away   The Essential Air Service  EAS  contracts to Quincy  Marion Herrin  and Decatur were held by Regions Air which abruptly halted service on March 8th   The two year contract consists of a  3 5 million per year federal subsidy to operate the EAS program that was established by Congress in 1978 to ensure communities with commercial air service before airline deregulation could continue scheduled flights   Without EAS  many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all  and residents of smaller cities would have to travel significant distances for flights   Great Lakes Airlines will officially take over service in Marion Herrin and Quincy when Regions  contracts expire in May 2007 and July 2007 respectively   Durbin sent a letter to the President of American Eagle Airlines  Peter M  Bowler on March 19  2007 urging that the airline work with Great Lakes to begin service immediately   The Regions Air contract to provide service to Decatur is not scheduled to expire until June 30  2008   In light of the recent shutdown in service  the Department of Transportation issued an emergency order to reinstate service to Decatur   Great Lakes was awarded the two year EAS contract to begin as soon as possible and expire on May 31  2009   Text of letter appears below   April 11  2007  Mr  Chuck Howell  CEO  Great Lakes Airlines  1022 Airport Parkway  Cheyenne  WY 82001  Dear Mr  Howell   Congratulations on the recent U S  Department of Transportation Essential Air Service  EAS  program awards for downstate Illinois service to St  Louis Lambert International Airport  I look forward to working with you and to your airline providing reliable passenger air service to a number of communities in downstate Illinois   I write today to strongly encourage Great Lakes Airlines to begin providing scheduled passenger air service from Decatur  Marion  Quincy  and Springfield  Illinois to St  Louis as soon as possible   As you know  this request has become even more urgent because the previous carrier  RegionsAir  ceased operations last month  With four Illinois communities without scheduled passenger air service to St  Louis  this issue has become even more important for economic development and tourism in downstate Illinois   I appreciate all you and Great Lakes have done to date to work with American Airlines and the U S  Department of Transportation to restore passenger air service in downstate Illinois  I understand that you are attempting to work with the Federal Aviation Administration and the management at RegionsAir to use existing infrastructure and schedules to restore service as soon as next month  I applaud that effort and stand ready to help in any appropriate way   I look forward to working with you and community leaders in Decatur  Marion  Quincy  and Springfield to restore passenger air service to St  Louis as soon as possible   Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
