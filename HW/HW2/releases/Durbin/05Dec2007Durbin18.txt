

Genocide Accountability Act Sent to President                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  December 5  2007       The U S  House of Representatives passed Senator Dick Durbins  D IL  Genocide Accountability Act today  sending the legislation  which closes the legal loophole that currently prevents the Justice Department from prosecuting individuals found in the United States who have participated in genocide in other countries  to the President for signature  The bill will be the first piece of legislation produced by the new Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  which Durbin chairs  to become law  There is no safe haven for the hundreds of thousands of Sudanese who have faced genocide in Darfur and yet without this law  our country could become a safe haven for their killers  said Durbin  When this bill becomes law  the current loophole in our genocide law will close and perpetrators of genocide who come to our country will face meaningful consequences  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   the subcommittees ranking member  Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Senator John Cornyn  R TX  joined Senator Durbin as original cosponsors of the bill  Under current law  genocide is only a crime if it is committed within the United States or by a U S  national outside the United States  The Genocide Accountability Act would close this loophole by amending the Genocide Convention Implementation Act to allow prosecution of non U S  nationals found in the United States for genocide perpetrated outside the U S  Under no circumstances should an individual who participated in genocide be allowed to enjoy safe haven within the United States  Our country has served as an example of democracy and individual rights  Allowing these individuals to freely wander our streets is unacceptable  Persons who committed these heinous crimes should be punished to the fullest extent of the law  While it may sometimes be better to seek such punishment in a violators home country  we should at least have the ability to prosecute violators here when it is prudent to do so  said Dr  Coburn  The Justice Department has identified individuals who participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and who are living in the United States under false pretenses  Under current law  these individuals cannot be prosecuted for perpetrating genocide  because they are not U S  nationals and the genocides in which they were involved did not take place in the United States  In contrast  the laws on torture  material support for terrorism  terrorism financing  hostage taking  and many other federal crimes cover offenses committed outside the United States by non U S  nationals  This is a bill that underscores the importance of the rule of law in upholding human rights standards that are embedded in our core beliefs and principles  I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed this important bill and that it is on its way to the President for his signature  Leahy said  The Senate Judiciary Committees new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law already is making significant contributions to the fight against genocide  and I commend Senator Durbin for his efforts  I am proud of the work of our new subcommittee and am confident that it will continue to fulfill its purpose in confronting pressing human rights issues in the United States and abroad  The United States has made strides in helping victims of genocide  but we can and must do more  We must hold those guilty of atrocities responsible and ensure they are brought to justice  By closing the current loophole in federal law  this bill takes important steps to rid the world of genocide  Cornyn said  The Genocide Accountability Act is one of three bills introduced by Senator Durbin that would give our government the authority to prosecute individuals found in the United States who have participated in serious human rights abuses anywhere in the world  The other bills  The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act and the Child Soldiers Accountability Act  have both been unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting passage by the full Senate  Senator Durbin became the Chairman of the first ever congressional committee or subcommittee dealing specifically with human rights law this January  The Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law has jurisdiction over all human rights laws and polices  including genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes  torture and human trafficking  The Subcommittees first hearing was on genocide  It has also held hearings on human trafficking  child soldiers  U S  enforcement of human rights law and a provision in immigration law know as the material support bar
