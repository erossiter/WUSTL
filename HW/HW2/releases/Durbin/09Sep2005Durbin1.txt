time of need          Durbin and the other Senators noted that last year  following a number of hurricanes in Florida  the President requested  2 billion in emergency funding   After the President   s request  Congress worked with the Administration to provide agricultural disaster relief for producers who sustained losses due to the hurricanes and other smaller scale disasters around the country          We ask that you continue to recognize the effects of natural disasters on agriculture by providing relief for producers in your emergency funding request     wrote Durbin and the senators       Full text of the letter appears below         September 9  2005      The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President       We are writing to respectfully request that you address the damages sustained by agricultural producers as a result of Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters in the emergency relief funding you will be requesting from Congress   The devastation we have all witnessed in recent days will have a profound effect on the lives of millions of Americans for years to come   It is important that we provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  as well as local authorities with the funding they need to feed and house displaced individuals  prevent the outbreak of disease  and ease the suffering of those caught in Hurricane Katrina   s path   We ask that when you propose the ambitious relief package we expect  you also include financial assistance for agricultural producers for the extensive losses wrought by Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters this year       Last year  following a series of hurricanes that battered the State of Florida  you responded by proposing  2 billion in emergency funding   This funding was essential for the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to continue its work in Florida   You also made several additional requests for disaster relief funds   These supplemental spending bills helped to provide some relief for agricultural producers who had suffered losses due to the hurricanes and other smaller scale disasters across the nation   We ask that you continue to recognize the effects of natural disasters on agriculture by providing relief for producers in your emergency funding request       We are concerned about a number of natural disasters that threaten to make this a particularly bad year for our agricultural producers   The extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in Florida  Mississippi  Alabama  and Louisiana is difficult to estimate  but significant losses appear to be likely   In addition to the loss of crops and livestock in the Gulf  damage to the Port of New Orleans will probably bring about increases in transportation and fuel costs for producers nationwide   The drought in the Midwest  flooding in various parts of the country  and infestations and livestock diseases have taken a toll   Farmers and ranchers are looking to you to help them in this time of need       Again  we ask you to consider the agricultural losses incurred due to Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters this year when you make your request for emergency relief   Please know that we stand fully in support of your efforts to relieve the human suffering and losses we have seen       Sincerely   Dick Durbin  D IL   Christopher Bond  R MO   Barack Obama  D IL   Mel Martinez  R FL   Ken Salazar  D CO   Kent Conrad  D ND   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Patty Murray  D WA
