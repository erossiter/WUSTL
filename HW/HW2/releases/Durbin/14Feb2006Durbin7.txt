February 14  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Illinois Homeland Security officials in his Capitol office to discuss their concerns with cuts proposed to Illinois terrorism prevention programs  emergency grants  and local emergency response programs in the Presidents FY07 budget   The 9 11 Commission and the Bush administration tell us that we are still at high risk of terrorist attack  yet the Presidents budget cuts homeland security grants and funding for local police and firefighters  said Durbin  The administrations insistence on billions of dollars in new tax breaks for the wealthy is driving up our national debt and forcing deep cuts in critical security and disaster preparedness programs in Illinois  We need to make funding for state terrorism prevention programs  emergency performance grants and first responders a top priority  This budget does not   In todays meeting  Illinois Homeland Security officials pointed to three key Illinois security programs that are either eliminated or severely handicapped by the budget proposed last week   Elimination of the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  LETPP  Cuts to Emergency Management Performance Grants  EMPG  Cuts in Assistance to Firefighters   In the new reality we live in  it s critical that communities across the State have the equipment and resources they need to respond rapidly to disaster    whether it s caused by humans or nature  noted Jill Morgenthaler  Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Safety   Under Governor Blagojevich s leadership  Illinois has made significant strides in improving communication between local  state and federal agencies  as well as preparing to contain and respond to a wide variety of potential threats   Unfortunately  the budget proposed by President Bush could make it harder for us to continue supporting communities  preparedness efforts   And as the Governor has already raised with the President  the Pentagon s proposed cuts to the Illinois National Guard could be devastating to our homeland security   We appreciate Senator Durbin s leadership on this issue in Washington and look forward to working with the entire Illinois delegation to maintain a strong homeland security network   Federal funds to assist state and local law enforcement agencies in preventing and responding to potential acts of terrorism would be dramatically cut with the elimination of the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  which awarded Illinois  12 8 million in 2005   The program received  400 million nationwide in 2005  but this year the President s budget eliminated all funding for the program   The President s budget would place new burdens on states by forcing them to divert funds from other law enforcement grant programs   Illinois Homeland Security officials also voiced concern with the loss of critical funds that help state and local emergency managers develop  maintain and improve capabilities of emergency personnel and evaluate emergency related exercises    Last year  Illinois received  5 7 million in Emergency Management and Performance Grants  EMPG   this year  that funding may be reduced by nearly 10 percent   Durbin said the meeting also focused on significant cuts to programs that provide funds for firefighters  including the elimination of the Staffing and Adequate Fire and Emergency Response  SAFER  Firefighter Hiring Program  which provides funding to fire departments to hire additional firefighters and first responders   In Illinois  over  1 3 million was awarded to fire departments for hiring and recruiting additional firefighters in 2005   The Presidents budget also makes it harder for Illinois to provide equipment and training to fire departments by cutting funds for other firefighter assistance programs by almost 50 percent   Nationwide  these programs will be cut from  545 million in FY2006 to  293 million in FY2007   Illinois received over  25 million for equipment through these grant programs in FY2006   Illinois homeland security officials said they were also concerned that a recent announcement by the U S  Secretary of the Army regarding troop reductions coupled with other program cuts in the Presidents proposed budget could result in the loss of up to 1 000 soldiers from the Illinois National Guard  including an Infantry battalion and the CH47 heavy lift aviation company   Illinois officials are concerned that such a reduction in National Guardsmen would make it difficult to respond adequately in the case of a terrorist attack or natural disaster   Todays meeting was attended by Jill Morgenthaler  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Safety  Bill Burke  the Director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency  Mike Chamness  Director of the Illinois Terrorism Task Force and Margaret Larson  Director of Governor Blagojevich s Washington D C  office
