                                                                                                                                                                                            Saturday  January 27  2007    PEORIA  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  visited Bradley University today to discuss challenges confronting the United States in keeping America   s edge in scientific and technological innovation and his efforts to attract more students to the fields of math  science and technology     During the State of the Union Address earlier this week  President Bush discussed the need to strengthen students    math and science skills   Durbin said he supports President Bush   s focus on math and science education      Our students need to be prepared for the jobs of the future   It is in our national interest to put highly qualified math and science teachers in our classrooms and give our students every opportunity to excel in those areas     Durbin said        The need to strengthen our education pipeline in science and technology is well documented   I   ve introduced legislation in every Congress since 2001 that would make it easier for students to study math and science   Change is incremental  but we are making a difference        Durbin said he will continue to push for a series of legislative proposals designed to help recruit the best possible teachers  prepare those teachers to teach well and support those teachers throughout their careers so they stay in the classroom        When it comes to providing a high quality education  individualized attention from well qualified teachers cannot be underestimated   Small  focused  successful classrooms require a steady supply of good teachers     said Durbin      We need to take action now to recruit and retain the best possible teachers        According to the National Education Association  a historic turnover is taking place in the teaching profession  While student enrollments are rising rapidly  more than a million veteran teachers are nearing retirement   Experts predict that overall the U S  will need more than 2 million new teachers in the next decade     The teacher recruitment problem is most challenging in high need subject areas such as math  science  key foreign languages and special education   At the same time  almost a third of our new teachers leave the profession after only three years and about half exit after five years     Durbin also discussed his plans to continue pushing for legislation that will help maintain a solid base of math and science teachers at the K 12 level  so students are given the proper resources and consistently encouraged to excel in those areas        Science and technology are the engines of economic growth   Our economic future depends on the next generation of workers and their ability not just to keep up  but to innovate     said Durbin     According to U S  Department of Labor projections  new jobs requiring science  engineering and technical training will increase four times faster than the national job growth rate in coming years  If present trends continue  the U S  would need 14 million more qualified workers by 2020 than our education system currently produces  Other reports suggest that several countries  particularly in Asia  threaten to outperform the U S  in areas that have long been America   s strengths  and a recent international comparison of math skills among high school students in 40 countries showed that U S  students fare below the average     The U S  graduates some of the world   s best engineers  scientists and mathematicians   But China  India  South Korea and Japan are educating a far higher proportion of their people in technologies  sciences and math   Since 1975  about a third of U S  undergraduate degrees have been in engineering or a hard or social science   In China  59  of undergraduate degrees are in the sciences   In South Korea  almost half of the college degrees are in a science or engineering     In the coming months  Durbin will be reintroducing the Homeland Security Education Act  which includes  5 000 scholarships to students pursuing math  science  engineering and technology degrees and scholarships of up to  15 000 to cover the costs of scientists  engineers and technology professionals to return to school and obtain their teaching credentials   In return  they agree teach in a high need or low income school for at least five years     Durbin has also long supported increasing the maximum Pell Grant  which has remained stagnant at  4 050 for the past five years and providing a permanent tax deduction for college tuition   Millions of students and parents struggling to pay for college will be helped by a permanent tuition tax deduction  which allows qualified taxpayers to deduct up to  4 000 in tuition and fees from their taxable income     Durbin co chairs of the Senate Science  Technology  Engineering  and Math Education Caucus  along with U S  Sen  Norm Coleman  R MN    The mission of the bipartisan caucus is to identify creative solutions to help put our country back on the right track and to continue to keep America the innovative and technological leader of the globe
