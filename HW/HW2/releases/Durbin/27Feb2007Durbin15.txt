HEARING ON STUDENT LOAN RELIEF FOR YOUNG PROSECUTORS   PUBLIC DEFENDERS LEGISLATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tuesday  February 27  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    Bipartisan legislation authored by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  to create a loan repayment program for attorneys who commit to careers in the criminal justice system was today the subject of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing       Durbin s bill would establish a student loan repayment program for law school graduates who agree to serve as criminal prosecutors or public defenders    Witnesses at today s hearing included two prosecutors from Illinois    Paul A  Logli  the State s Attorney for Winnebago County and the Chairman of the Board of the National District Attorney s Association  and Cook County Assistant State s Attorney Jessica Bergeman        Today prosecutor and public defender offices are having serious difficulty hiring and retaining good lawyers because students are leaving law school with mortgage sized student loan debts  And starting salaries in a prosecutor s or public defender s office are 3 to 4 times smaller than starting salaries in private law firms   said Durbin    When prosecutor and public defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep experienced ones  their ability to protect the public is compromised   The federal government has a responsibility to help make public service law an affordable option for talented  experienced lawyers who want to work in the criminal justice system        Durbin s legislation  the  John R  Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007   is named for the late John R  Justice  former president of the National District Attorneys Association and a champion of efforts to encourage law school graduates to work in public service    The bipartisan legislation is co sponsored by 15 senators including the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D VT  and the committee s senior Republican  Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA   and is considered a top priority for criminal prosecutors and defenders       In today s hearing  Paul Logli testified about the increased difficulty in retaining young prosecutors long enough to see them become experienced career prosecutors    In the last month  my office said goodbye to two promising prosecutors who went into private practice solely for economic reasons     that means more and more of our serious  complex cases in our felony courtrooms are being prosecuted by less experienced attorneys who are only a few years out of law school    Logli added that   The people of the State of Illinois and the victims are not receiving the representation they deserve in our criminal courts        With the average law graduate carrying a staggering amount of student loan debt    an average of  78 763 for those who attended private schools  and  51 056 for public schools   Durbin s bill would establish a student loan repayment option for full time state and local prosecutors and state  local and federal public defenders who agree to serve for a minimum of three years   Federal prosecutors are already eligible for loan relief through existing federal programs       Cook County s Assistant State s Attorney Jessica Bergeman testified about the financial struggle that many of her colleagues face throughout their public practice careers  She noted that one colleague  owes a minimum of  150 000 in post grad loans   She  like me         lives for payday when she can pay her bills and use almost everything left for groceries and a full tank of gas    Bergemen added that she keeps her home temperature at 62 degrees in winter to keep costs down so that she can afford her monthly student loan repayments       Durbin cited the contrast between the loan burdens carried by today s law school graduates and the entry level salaries for prosecutors and public defenders as evidence of the need for relief   More than 80  of law students borrow to pay for their law degree  and the amount borrowed by many students exceeds  100 000   Many law graduates also carry unpaid debt from their undergraduate studies   At the same time  the median entry level salary for state prosecuting attorneys and public defenders is around  45 000       From an employer s perspective  low salaries and high debt make it extremely difficult to recruit and retain attorneys in prosecutor and public defender offices   The Department of Justice has found that almost one third of prosecutor s offices reported problems with recruitment and retention of staff attorneys       Durbin s proposal is modeled after a student loan repayment program currently available to federal employees   Like the federal employee program  attorneys eligible for loan repayment could have up to  10 000 per year of student loan debt repaid   Loan repayments are capped at a maximum of  60 000 per individual       Durbin s legislation is supported by the National District Attorneys Association  the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators  the National Legal Aid and Defender Association  the American Council of Chief Defenders  the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers  the National Juvenile Defender Center  the American Bar Association  and the Conference of Chief Justices       It is expected that Durbin s bill will be voted on by the full Judiciary Committee in the next two weeks  and if approved  should be sent to the Senate floor for consideration sometime next month
