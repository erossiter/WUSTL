Reauthorization Legislation Approved By Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wednesday  May 9  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    The United States Senate today approved the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  S 1082  commonly referred to as the FDA Reauthorization bill   The bill as passed includes an amendment offered by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  that will strengthen the nation s food safety system   The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   one of the federal agencies charged with safeguarding the U S  food supply  has come under fire recently in the wake of nationwide recalls and quarantines of tainted pork  spinach  peanut butter and pet food   Today the Senate approved the FDA Reauthorization bill by a vote of 93 to 1        With the passage of today s legislation  we have begun to address the growing food safety concerns across our nation   My colleague  Congresswoman DeLauro  will be working to include this measure in the House version of the bill and we will be working together to ensure that the House and Senate include it in the final version when they go to conference on the bill   said Durbin       Durbin s amendment establishes an early warning and notification system for human food  as well as pet food  establishes fines for companies that don t promptly report contaminated products  improves inspections monitoring of imports  and provides better  more uniform pet food safety standards   Durbin s amendment was accepted last Wednesday as part of the FDA Reauthorization bill last week by a vote of 94 0       Some of the new responsibilities given to the FDA under Durbin s amendment include      Establishing an early warning and notification system for human food as well as pet food products  The legislation directs the FDA to work with professional organizations  veterinarians  and others to disseminate information about pet food contamination and in cases of both pet and human food  to keep up to date  comprehensive  searchable recall lists on their website   Improving FDA s ability to detect problems  and alert consumers of contaminants by creating an adulterated food registry for imported and domestically produced food   The amendment requires the FDA to establish a registry to collect information on cases of potentially dangerous food adulteration to improve risk based surveillance of food safety and improve the speed at which consumers and firms are notified   Importers and domestic processors and manufactures of food would have to submit information pertaining to actual or suspected adulteration of food  The submission would be made to the FDA for inclusion in a centralized database through an electronic portal   The sources of the recent human and pet food contamination were wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that originated in China  Neither shipment was inspected by FDA  in fact  FDA inspects fewer than 1 5  of imports   A database would give FDA better information on which to base inspections   Requiring companies to maintain records and make them accessible to FDA as part of an investigation   This provision would prevent delays that could keep contaminations from being traced as quickly as possible   In the case of the recalled peanut butter this past winter  an FDA report showed that inspectors were denied documents when they requested them  The bill would clarify that when FDA conducts inspections  it will have timely access to those documents needed to safeguard the food supply   Establishing uniform federal standards and better labeling of pet food  The guidances and practices that today govern the pet food industry are implemented on a voluntary basis by manufacturers and state departments of agriculture  However  there is no requirement for states to adopt these practices and they don t have the force of federal guidelines   Inspections are not coordinated state to state and some states have different standards than others    Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  This Congress they introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act   S  654 and H R  1148 in the Senate and House respectively   Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues
