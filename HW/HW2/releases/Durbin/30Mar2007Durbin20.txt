CONGRESS SHOULD PASS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE MISSISSIPPI RIVER NAVIGATION AND ECOSYSTEM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Friday  March 30  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today applauded the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approval of the Water and Resources Development Act  WRDA    The WRDA bill includes Congressional authorization for locks and dam modernization on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and authorizes specific projects for navigation  ecosystem restoration  and flood and storm damage reduction   The bill will now move to the Senate floor for debate        Passing WRDA will mean over 50 000 new jobs for the region  shorter shipping times  and improved business for Midwest producers along the river   said Durbin    The Mississippi River transports  12 billion worth of products every year  affecting agriculture  commercial  and labor interests across the state   We must update and modernize the waterway to remain competitive in the years to come        The most significant provision in the bill would increase lock and dam capacity and improve the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  The legislation would authorize  2 1 billion for replacing and upgrading locks and dams and another  1 65 billion for ecosystem restoration   Updating these locks is critical for industry and agriculture in Illinois   more than half of Illinois  annual corn crop is shipped to export markets on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers  Shipping via barge on the River keeps exports competitive and reduces transportation costs for Illinois farmers and businesses   said Durbin        This bill also includes critical projects that protect not only the ecosystems of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers but the Great Lakes ecosystem as well   Today  the Asian Carp threatens a  4 1 billion sport and commercial fishing industry in the Great Lakes   The bill passed today recognizes the threat of the Asian Carp by authorizing the permanent operation of the barrier system to prevent the Asian Carp from entering the waters of the Great Lakes   Durbin added       The Committee bill also included a provision that was included last year as an amendment that would establish independent review panels for U S  Army Corps of Engineers projects   This issue has received significant attention in the wake of the Gulf Coast hurricanes  which showed that major levee failures in New Orleans occurred because of faulty design  construction or maintenance  The Corps of Engineers is responsible for carrying out the majority of the projects contained in the WRDA legislation       The provision would establish an independent panel of experts to review projects costing more than  40 million  projects requested by a state governor  projects for which the director of a federal agency has said could have a significant adverse impact  or projects that the Army s secretary has found to be controversial  The provision also calls for an independent safety review for critical flood damage reduction projects  The independent review process will not lengthen the time line for projects to be completed       Specifically  the bill includes       1 87 billion for the construction of seven new 1 200 foot locks at Locks 20  21  22  24  and 25 on the Upper Mississippi River and at LaGrange Lock and Peoria Lock on the Illinois Waterway    1 65 billion for ecosystem restoration  providing the Corps of Engineers authority to do island building  construction of fish passages  floodplain restoration  water level management  backwater restoration  side channel restoration  wing dam and dike restoration  island and shoreline protection  topographical diversity  use of dredged material for environmental purposes  tributary confluence restoration  land easement authority  and land acquisition    246 million for small scale and non structural improvements such as traffic management and boats that push the barges through locks faster     We have been waiting seven long years for a bill to reauthorize navigation projects all over the country   Now the real work begins as we work on the floor of the Senate to pass this bill and to modernize the Mississippi waterway so our region can remain competitive in the years to come   said Durbin       The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure approved a similar version of the Water Resources and Development Act  H R 1495  on March 15   It is expected to be debated in the House after the Congressional recess
