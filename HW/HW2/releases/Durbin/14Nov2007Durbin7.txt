First Ever Hearing on U S  Enforcement of Human Rights Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  November 14  2007       United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  chaired a hearing today examining U S  government attempts to identify  investigate and prosecute suspected perpetrators of serious human rights abuses who are living in America  The hearing  No Safe Haven  Accountability for Human Rights Violators in the United States  was the first ever congressional hearing on the enforcement of human rights laws in our country    America has become a safe haven for the perpetrators of some of the worlds most notorious war crimes  Durbin said  This is unacceptable  Our laws must change and our determination to end this shameful situation must become a priority    There are currently over 1 000 investigations of suspected human rights abusers living in the United States  The perpetrators in question come from 85 countries and are accused of crimes including rape  extrajudicial killings  torture and genocide  It is thought that those under investigation are only a small percentage of the actual number of human rights abusers currently in our country  but the United States lacks the political will or legal ability to prosecute or deport many of them for their crimes    At the end of the last century we saw horrific crimes take place in Bosnia and Rwanda  Sadly  we are seeing similar crimes today in Darfur and Burma  Durbin said  It is our obligation to the victims of these terrible acts to find and punish those responsible while doing all we can to ensure the United States is not a safe haven for perpetrators of such crimes    Testifying at the hearing today were representatives from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security  the two lead US agencies in tracking down and prosecuting suspected human rights violators  They discussed their agencies work to hold human rights abusers accountable once they have entered the United States and what efforts they are taking to prevent them from entering in the first place    Also testifying was Dr  Juan Romagoza Arce  a Salvadoran doctor who was detained and tortured during El Salvadors civil war  In 2002  Dr  Romagoza won a lawsuit against two generals responsible for his treatment who were found to be living in the United States  Despite the overwhelming evidence of their guilt  the generals were only faced with a civil suit brought by victims  They are currently living legally in Southern Florida     Because we lack the political will and legal ability to prosecute many human rights abusers found living in the United States  these individuals have effectively escaped accountability for their actions  Durbin said  In a country with our dedication to human rights  it is unimaginable that we arent doing all we can to change that and to hold human rights abusers accountable    Durbin has introduced three bills this Congress that would give our government the authority to prosecute individuals found in the United States who have participated in genocide  human trafficking and the use or recruitment of child soldiers anywhere in the world     Durbins Genocide Accountability Act  passed the Senate unanimously and is awaiting action on the House floor  The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act and the Child Soldiers Accountability Act also Durbin bills  have both been unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting passage by the full Senate     Senator Durbin became the Chairman of the first ever congressional committee dealing specifically with human rights this January  The Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law has jurisdiction over all human rights laws and polices  including genocide  human trafficking  war crimes and torture  The Subcommittees first hearing  this February  was on the genocide in Darfur and it has also held hearings on human trafficking  child soldiers and on an immigration law know as the material support bar
