                                                                                                                                                                                            Friday  August 25  2006     CARBONDALE  IL      Today  U S Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  hosted a Regional Broadband Summit in Southern Illinois to help raise awareness of broadband as a regional economic development tool   Durbin says a national policy is needed to accelerate the deployment of broadband internet service to rural areas so that every American can have high speed internet access no matter where they live   During the summit  the Senator discussed the Broadband for Rural America Act of 2006  which he introduced earlier this month in the U S  Senate to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas        Broadband is an essential component of our lives  at work and at home  It has become an essential service like water  gas and electricity  Our homes and businesses need affordable access to high speed internet connections  in the same way our homes and businesses need traditional utility services     said Durbin     Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality   When I travel in downstate Illinois  people tell me that they cannot wait to have broadband service  but that there is no service available to them right now  My bill will change that        Two recent reports    one issued by the U S  Department of Commerce and the other by the U S  Department of Agriculture     found that rural and farm households have access to broadband internet at approximately half the level of all U S  households nationwide  Another respected research organization  the Pew Internet and American Life Project  found similar results   In its 2006 report  Pew found that only 18  of rural adults reported a home broadband connection  compared to 31  of urban adults   All of these studies point to a consistent conclusion   Americans living in urban areas are almost twice as likely to have home broadband access as do their rural counterparts     Durbin said broadband is critical to community and economic development  as it encourages investment  creates jobs  improves productivity  fosters innovation  and increases consumer benefits in every corner of our nation  A recent study found that adoption of current generation broadband would increase the gross domestic product by  179 7 billion  while adding approximately 61 000 jobs per year over the two decades   The study also projected 1 2 million jobs could be created if next generation broadband technology were rapidly deployed        We need to close the digital divide  ensuring that rural Americans are not left behind in the 21st Century   s digital economy     Durbin noted     Whether it is through telephone wire  cable  fiber  satellite  wireless or any other medium  we need every existing and future broadband service provider to step up to the national challenge        Durbin said his bill includes four major provisions  Each is designed to focus on identifying obstacles that hinder broadband deployment in rural America today  and to find innovative solutions to address those concerns     Creates Broadband Trust Fund  creates a new federal program specifically targeted at assisting individuals  businesses and co ops working at the earliest stages to bring broadband to their communities  Eligible entities include nonprofits  academic institutions  local governments and commercial companies that work to identify broadband access needs in unserved areas of the country  Projects to be funded through this new program will include feasibility studies  mapping  economic analysis  and other activities done to determine the reasons for the current lack of service  and the scale  scope  and type of broadband services most suitable for the particular unserved area     Reforms USDA Rural Broadband Program  the current USDA broadband loan program provides below market rate loans and loan guarantees for the construction and improvement of broadband facilities and equipment in rural areas  This program expires in 2007  Durbin   s bill does three things with regard to the broadband loan program    extends the life of the program for another five years until 2012  refocuses the program solely on rural areas where it is most needed  and establishes a grant program to be administered by the same USDA office that currently runs the rural broadband loan program     Wireless Broadband Spectrum  requires the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to make new spectrum available for wireless broadband services in rural areas as soon as practicable  The bill also requires the FCC to evaluate its spectrum auction plans and to divide some of the frequency allocations into smaller area licenses so that regional and rural wireless companies can compete in the bidding process  Making additional spectrum available holds tremendous potential for wireless broadband to be deployed in rural areas  especially in large geographic regions where it would be cost prohibitive to build out wires and cable      Creates Broadband Task Force  establishes a task force consisting of experts in federal  state  and local governments  trade associations  public interest organizations  academic institutions  and other areas to study best practices for rapid deployment of broadband services in states  particularly those with large unserved rural areas  The bill requires the task force  within 6 months  to provide to Congress and to each governor a report detailing a comprehensive list of specific measures adopted by state or local governments that helped deploy broadband services in areas that lacked such services      The legislation has been referred to the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee
