November 2  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   Concerned with reports that Marion VA Medical Center employees may be fearful of retribution  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to inform all current and former employees of their rights under the Whistleblower Protection Act  I need your help to fully understand the situation at the Marion Illinois Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC   The employees at the hospital need to be assured that their openness and honesty about what happened and when and how events unfolded will not be held against them  Durbin wrote  We must get to the root of whats happening at Marion and candid conversations with VA employees will help us do that  I hope that you will take great care to protect those who wish to voice their concerns  Last week  during a meeting with Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs Gordon Mansfield  Senator Durbin announced that the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs will convene a hearing in less than two weeks on hiring practices and quality control of patient care at VA medical facilities  The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday  November 6  2007  Senator Durbin has worked closely on this issue with U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Last week they called on Acting VA Secretary Gordon Mansfield to respond to new information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  While asking follow up questions to the response that they received from the VA  the Illinois Senators insisted that any concerns over healthcare quality at the facility must be addressed immediately  The text of the letter is below  November 2  2007 The Honorable Gordon Mansfield  Acting Secretary  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Mansfield  I need your help to fully understand the situation at the Marion  IL Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC   The employees at the hospital need to be assured that their openness and honesty about what happened and when and how events unfolded will not be held against them  Please take specific  proactive steps to reach out to employees of the Veterans Administration  particularly those in Marion  IL to fully inform them of the rights and remedies available to them under whistleblower protection laws  including the Whistleblower Protection Act  The Inspector General is completing its own report and additional information about questionable hiring  management and medical practices at the Marion Veterans Affairs Medical Center continues to emerge  A thorough investigation that allows investigators to truly get to the bottom of the situation rests largely on what people who worked at the hospital can tell us  I am concerned that the employees at Marion are too fearful of retribution to fully disclose what that they have seen  Consistent with the Notification and Federal Employee Anti discrimination and Retaliation  No FEAR  Act of 2002  I urge you to provide Marion  IL VA employees  former employees and applicants for employment written notification of federal whistleblower protection  anti discrimination and retaliation laws  I also ask that you provide a public notification  widely disseminated  that there will be no retribution or adverse employment action taken against anyone who provides truthful disclosures about what has happened and is happening at the Marion VAMC  In addition  the No FEAR Act requires you to provide training sessions to your employees to advise them of their rights under relevant whistleblower  anti discrimination  and retaliation laws  Given the recent history and the ongoing IG investigation at the Marion facility  I ask that you quickly provide appropriate whistleblower protection training to current VA employees  particularly at the Marion VAMC  We must get to the root of whats happening at Marion and candid conversations with VA employees will help us do that  I hope that you will take great care to protect those who wish to voice their concerns
