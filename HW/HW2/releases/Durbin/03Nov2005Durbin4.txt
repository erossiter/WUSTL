Thursday  November 3  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  along with U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R SC  and 38 of their colleagues today sent a letter to President Bush expressing alarm at serious equipment shortages now faced by National Guard units in Illinois and across the nation   The letter calls on President Bush to immediately implement a plan to replace the missing items and to fully fund the needs of the National Guard       A report released on Thursday by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   which is the investigative arm of Congress  showed that Army National Guard units face severe equipment shortages at home partly because they have been told to leave critical items such as armored Humvees  light trucks and other gear in Iraq for replacement troops          This is a serious problem     it impacts the ability of these units to respond as they should in a crisis  it affects their ability to conduct training exercises  it affects the morale of the units     said Durbin     Replacing this equipment has been slow  and the replacement items are often not adequate in terms of quality or quantity  We must not allow this to continue          The GAO report showed that  on average  National Guard units have only 34 percent of the equipment they need to be at full readiness  which could leave them vulnerable in a domestic emergency       Durbin said National Guard units in Illinois often fare even worse than the national average and equipment inventories of Illinois National Guard units have been seriously depleted  For example  the inventory tallies show that Illinois Guard units are assigned only      4 percent of the medium trucks needed to maintain full readiness  6 of 166 medium trucks   8 percent of the heavy trucks needed to maintain full readiness  6 of 79 heavy trucks   47 percent of night vision devices  1503 of 3220 night vision devices   63 percent of radios  766 of 1218 radios     While these numbers alone are cause for serious concern  the situation may actually be much worse   Some of this assigned equipment is unavailable for use by the state because it is currently in Iraq or elsewhere       Officials interviewed by the GAO believe the National Guard s response to Hurricane Katrina    was more complicated because significant quantities of critical equipment such as satellite communications equipment  radios  trucks  helicopters and night vision goggles were deployed to Iraq          In their letter to President Bush  Durbin and Graham asked that his Administration    fully equip    the Army National Guard with the equipment necessary to respond to state emergencies and to include sufficient funding in his budget request   Durbin said that bringing Guard unit inventories up to full levels will cost as much as  10 billion over what the administration intends to spend          Right now  the budget analysts at the Department of Defense are preparing next year   s budget for the President   The Department of Defense needs to take into account the cost of replacing this equipment before the problem gets worse     said Durbin       Signatories include

000 pieces of equipment worth more than  1 2 billion overseas  and according to the GAO report  the Army cannot account for more than half of that equipment  The report said that in addition to what was left overseas  more than 100 000 pieces of equipment from units on the home front have been transferred to deploying units       The full text of Durbin and Graham   s letter to the President appears below         November 3  2005  The President   The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N  W   Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    As you prepare your budget request for Fiscal Year 2007  we ask that you include funding which will fully equip the Army National Guard with combat equipment which has dual use by the States for domestic emergencies       We also ask the administration to address the recommendations of the Government Accountability Office with respect to the need to improve National Guard equipment readiness and its integration into Army transformation initiatives       The Army National Guard plays a crucial role in State response to domestic emergencies   The greatly diminished percentage of equipment on hand in our Guard units carries with it the risk of not only denying these units the equipment needed to conduct good training for their combat mission but also leaves them with fewer tools to support State responses to natural disasters  terrorist incidents or other emergencies  While it is possible to shift equipment from State to State  it is clear that National Guard response will be faster if the needed equipment is available for training and closer to the point of need       Specific items of National Guard equipment are of particular value for homeland security purposes  These include trucks of various sizes  communications equipment  night vision devices  engineer equipment and helicopters  Unfortunately  the National Guard has troubling shortages in all of these areas  Nationwide the Guard has only 2 3 of the Humvees  3 4 of the radios  half of the night vision devices and 1 4 of the moderm medium trucks it needs to be mission responsive  Moreover  due to combat wear and the operational need for returning units to leave some equipment behind in the combat zone  these shortages are getting worse       Please give full consideration to the homeland security value of National Guard equipment and include in your budget request a plan to bring our Guard up to 100  of key assets
