March 2  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin is urging President Bush to take immediate action to help low income Americans by releasing the  101 5 million remaining in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  fund   Durbin was joined by 37 Senate colleagues of both political parties in signing the letter to the President       Illinois currently has less than  20 million in available funds remaining in its account and Illinois LIHEAP officials say that will not be sufficient to cover the remaining eligible applications received   Of the 800 000 Illinoisans eligible  only 350 000 have applied for help from LIHEAP and 300 000 are receiving assistance   According to recent reports  12 states have now exhausted their funds for the regular winter heating season while several other states like Illinois are reporting that they are running dangerously low        With heating bills up 41 percent in the Midwest this winter  many people face the choice to heat or eat   Durbin said      LIHEAP was created to assist our lowest income families and seniors  but Illinois LIHEAP officials tell us they have serious concerns that remaining funds will not be enough to cover 50 000 Illinois applicants who have applied for payments  And with heating bills that cost the average Illinois family  1 200 to stay warm  the need is greater than ever   LIHEAP is severely under funded and we have asked the President to release the money that has already been set aside for this program but not yet spent        The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  is a federally funded program which provides heating and cooling assistance to almost 5 million low income households  including the working poor  those making the difficult transition from welfare to work  disabled persons  the elderly and families with young children   Assistance comes in the form of block grants to state programs that help eligible households pay for home energy costs   Often  those living in poverty and low income seniors must choose between buying fuel to heat their homes and buying food for themselves and their families   Durbin noted that the program targets people who need help the most       In Illinois  requests for government help to pay heating bills were up  over 40 percent in 2005   So far 344 700 Illinois residents have applied for LIHEAP assistance  293 725 of whom have received assistance   In Illinois  several city offices are receiving dramatically more calls from people who cannot afford to pay their heating bills   Some offices report that seniors are forgoing purchasing their prescriptions or not buying food in order to attempt to pay the energy bill          Experts tell us that the top two underlying reasons for homelessness in America are inability to pay for rent and inability to pay for utilities     said Durbin     The costs of not providing help to those who need it in our state and other states facing similar problems are far greater than the cost of adequately funding the LIHEAP program          Last year  LIHEAP allowed the states to help about 5 million people out of an estimated 32 million eligible for assistance nationwide   As part of the energy bill signed into law last summer  Congress authorized  5 1 billion annually for the program for fiscal years 2005  2006 and 2007   However  the final spending bill for fiscal 2006  which began in October  contained only  2 16 billion for the program despite attempts by Durbin and other Democrats to increase LIHEAP funding
