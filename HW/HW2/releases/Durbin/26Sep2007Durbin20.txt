

6th Letter to Consumer Safety Commission on Unsafe Products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wednesday  September 26  2007        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  wrote to the Consumer Product Safety Commissions  CPSC  acting Chairman  Nancy Nord  late yesterday  expressing concern over the slow recall process of 1 million cribs  following the death of an infant in 2005  This is Durbin s 6th letter to the Commission in the past 6 months regarding the CPSC s oversight of safety matters related to children  Durbin has also convened two Congressional hearings into the CPSC s actions on recalled and unsafe products    The current letter highlights the unacceptable time lag between when incidents were reported to CPSC and when CPSC took action to protect consumers  Durbin asked the CPSC to produce a detailed timeline of events between the first reports of hazards in 2003 to their announcement last week of a major recall  He also asked that the CPSC explain whether a lack of resources or statutory authority played a role in delaying this recall    It is unacceptable that it takes months and even years for the CPSC to recall a product that has injured and killed children    this recall took 4 years  We may never know how many innocent children and families were at risk during that time  Durbin said  The Senate is working on giving this agency the resources and authorities they need  but there must be a change  why dose it take a year after an injury or fatality for this agency to respond with a recall to protect Americas families    Two weeks ago  Durbin chaired a hearing on toy safety following months of recalls of Chinese manufactured toys  At the hearing  Durbin noted that since it s inception in 1973  the CPSC s staffing levels have decreased by almost 60 percent  from an all time high of 978 inspectors and full time employees in 1980 to 401 today  the lowest level in history  Meanwhile the number of products over which the CPSC has jurisdiction is enormous  the 401 employees at the agency today are responsible for overseeing more than 15 000 types of consumer goods  Today  a single individual is responsible for testing all toys at the CPSC    Earlier this summer  Durbin introduced the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act  which addresses some of the resource and regulatory issues facing CPSC  Additionally  Durbin introduce the Childrens Product Safety Act  which would require that all childrens products undergo rigorous third party testing and certification from independent laboratories     Durbin is the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  the panel with oversight over CPSCs budget and has been one of the leading Congressional advocate for reforming the commission  Durbin joined Senators Pryor and Inouye in cosponsoring the CPSC Reform Act  a comprehensive reform bill aimed at making the CPSC the type of watchdog agency that American consumers need    A copy of the letter Durbin sent to the CPSC can be found below     September 25  2007   The Honorable Nancy Nord  Acting Chairman  U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  4330 East West Highway  Bethesda  Maryland 20814   Dear Chairman Nord    I am writing in response to a recent series of newspaper stories regarding the recall of several types of cribs manufactured by Simplicity  Inc  of Reading  Pennsylvania  that caused the deaths of at least three young children  According to the articles  there were significant hardware problems and flaws in the crib design    Like the Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets recall process  the articles describe an inexcusable time lag between when incidents were reported to CPSC and when CPSC took action to protect the public  Between the first report of the products hazard in July 2003 and the recall announcement last week  hundreds of thousands of these faulty  dangerous cribs were used by parents  Even after the first report of an infants death in April 2005  it appears that the CPSC did little to investigate the hazard or take steps to protect the public     It is inconceivable to me that the CPSC could have allowed this situation to occur  At several points in the process  the CPSC sent investigators to look into the deaths of these young children  Dozens of reports were submitted to the CPSC  In addition  families were pursuing legal action against the manufacturer of these products  The fact that it has taken more than four years from the date of the first incident report and more than two years since the first report of an infants death to announce a recall of these products is alarming  It is unacceptable for the public to have to rely on journalists for this Commission to act in a timely fashion     In order to better understand what transpired in this case  I ask that you provide me with a detailed timeline of events between 2003 and the present regarding the Simplicity cribs  In addition  I ask that you explain in detail how this could have occurred and what steps you plan to take in order to prevent a similar situation  Also  did the Commissions Section 6 b  requirements hinder its ability to notify the public of this danger  If so  would statutory language similar to the expedited information release provision in S  1847 improve the Commissions ability to protect human health  Lastly  I ask that you explain whether a lack of resources or authorities played a role in this incident  and if so  what resources or authorities are needed to improve the CPSCs performance     I ask that you provide me with this information no later than October 17  2007  If you cannot meet this deadline  I ask that you immediately contact me with a detailed written explanation as to why you are unable to fulfill this request    Sincerely    Richard J Durbin  United States Senator
