 July 26  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  into the process used by the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to estimate the number of patients expected to seek health care services when making their annual budget determinations   Durbin was joined in his request by Senators Daniel Akaka  D HI   Ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee  Patty Murray  D WA  and Ken Salazar  D CO        Last month  the Senate passed emergency supplemental funding for the VA to fix a shortfall of more than  1 billion for fiscal year 2005   One of the primary reasons for the shortfall was the VA   s significant underestimation of the number of recently returned veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who would seek health care from the VA       In a letter to the GAO  the senators noted that for the current fiscal year  VA had forecasted an annual growth in demand for health care of 2 3 percent   In April of 2005  the agency discovered that growth has actually reached 5 2 percent   The VA   s budget had assumed that 23 553 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would come to the VA system for care   The most recent estimate of patients who fought in Iraq or Afghanistan is 103 000   Overall  the VA has underestimated the number of veterans seeking health care in three of the last four years          While we understand that estimates can be wrong when actual conditions turn out to be different than projected  we are concerned that there may be a systemic problem in the way that the Department develops and validates its patient estimates and that this may in turn be producing faulty budgets     wrote the Senators      This recurring miscalculation of projected patient numbers suggests that VA   s means for determining such estimates may be flawed in methodology or subject to external influences that the Office of Management and Budget and VA failed to take into account for various reasons          A review of the Department   s most recent budget submissions reveals that in three out of the past four years  the VA has significantly underestimated the number of patients in four areas   acute hospital care  medical visits  inpatient hospital care for dependents and survivors  and dependent and survivor outpatient care       In their letter  the Senators specifically asked the GAO to investigate VA   s processes for developing patient estimates to determine if there are systemic problems in the Department   s methodology or if the estimates are subject to inappropriate political pressure to conform to the Bush Administration   s budgetary limits and policies       The senators also requested that GAO make recommendations for how to improve the VA   s budgeting process so that veterans can receive the care they deserve and members of Congress are not surprised by budget shortfalls in the future       Full text of the letter to GAO is appears below       _______________________________________________      July 27  2005      The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  441 G Street  NW  Washington  D C  20548   Dear Mr  Walker       Recently  the President asked Congress to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  in order to make up a funding shortfall in veterans    health care for the current fiscal year   One of the primary reasons cited by the Department for this shortfall was its large underestimation of the number of recently returned veterans of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom  OIF OEF  who would seek its medical services       VA officials have revealed that the actuarial model they used to make their budget determinations forecasted a 2 3 percent annual growth in healthcare demand in fiscal year 2005 and that in April of 2005  it was discovered that growth has accelerated to 5 2 percent   In addition  VA says its budget assumed that 23 553 OIF OEF veterans would come for care   The number of these patients in 2005 is now estimated to be 103 000       While we understand that estimates can be wrong when actual conditions turn out to be different than projected  we are concerned that there may be a systemic problem in the way that the Department develops and validates its patient estimates and that this may in turn be producing faulty budgets       A review of VA   s most recent budget submissions reveals that in three out of the past four years  the Department has significantly underestimated its patient load in four areas  acute hospital care  medical visits  dependents and survivors hospital census  and dependent and survivor outpatient care   The Department has underestimated the number of psychiatric patients in two of the past four years   Attached for your reference is a summary analysis of these estimated and actual measures from the Department of Veterans Affairs section of the Appendix to the Budget of the U S  Government for fiscal years 2001 through 2006   This recurring miscalculation of projected patient numbers suggests that VA   s means for determining such estimates may be flawed in methodology or subject to external influences that the Office of Management and Budget and VA failed to take into account for various reasons       As such  we request that the Government Accountability Office conduct an investigation of VA   s processes for estimating patient load to determine if there are systemic problems in the methodology for making such estimates  or if the estimates are subject to inappropriate political pressure to conform to executive budgetary constraints and policies  thereby excluding major components such as the ongoing conflicts abroad and long term care       Specifically  we would like you to examine      The decision making process that led to the FY05 shortfall   The strengths and weaknesses of VA   s process for monitoring healthcare demand and for updating its assumptions and models for estimating future demand  including OIF OEF veterans   VA   s failure to accurately model Long term Care  Prosthetics  Dental Care and Mental Health Care   The strengths and weaknesses of VA   s two year forward budgeting model and the degree to which the budget request is shaped by       estimates of future patient demand and or         interaction between OMB and VA      The strengths and weaknesses of VA   s process of notifying Congress of changes to budget assumptions    We also request that GAO make recommendations for how to improve the VA   s budgeting process so that veterans receive care they deserve and members of Congress are not surprised by budget shortfalls in the future   Thank you in advance for your attention to this request                                                                                                       Sincerely       Richard J  Durbin  United States
