million over 10 years to make federal grants available for preservation  education and economic development activities across the Heritage Area   Rep  Ray LaHood  R IL  also introduced companion legislation in the House today        Illinois is known as the Land of Lincoln   said Durbin    This state shaped his character from youth to adulthood   Designating a National Heritage Area will allow us to bind together the elements of Lincoln s life in Illinois   We want to tell the whole Lincoln story to our students  families and visitors        Durbin said he wants Illinois communities to work together to tell the whole Lincoln story   The Looking for Lincoln project is designed to connect Illinois  natural  historic  cultural and recreational resources touched by the life and influence of the nation s sixteenth President   Durbin is working closely with the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition  focusing on the places where Lincoln spent his formative years   His goal is to let each community tell its unique story  so tourists have the opportunity to visit a series of historic places that can provide a complete look at Lincoln s life in Illinois   In the end  the communities involved will benefit from job creation and new tourism revenue  as well as a renewed sense of pride about their role in Lincoln s heritage       The Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area would encompass an area spanning 41 Central Illinois counties  including Presidential sites in Springfield as well as other notable sites including the Lincoln Douglas Debate Museum in Charleston  the Macon County Log Courthouse in Decatur and the Carl Sandburg Home State Historic Site in Galesburg       The legislation protects private property rights and would not require any private citizen or entity to be affiliated with the Lincoln Heritage Area   The bill names the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition as the management authority for the National Heritage Area  but does not grant any zoning or land use power to the Coalition  Up to  10 million in federal grants would be available under this legislation  with no more than  1 million awarded in any single year   Any amount awarded
