     SENATE APPROVES MINE SAFETY BILL BASED ON DURBIN PROPOSAL

MINE SAFETY BILL BASED ON DURBIN PROPOSAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wednesday  May 24  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      The U S  Senate today unanimously approved a bipartisan bill to help protect the lives of miners in Illinois and throughout the nation   Major provisions in the bill were based on mine safety legislation introduced in March by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL    Today s measure  the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act will improve enforcement of safety regulations  raise minimum and maximum penalties for serious violations and provide funding for safety training grants          The tragic events at coal mines in West Virginia and Kentucky captured the nation s attention and exposed the serious dangers our miners face every day  Safety violations often result in life threatening and fatal injuries to miners   Safety inspectors tell me that the fines need to be higher when a company violates our safety laws and that we need to put more resources into training inspectors     said Durbin      We have more than 3 500 miners in Illinois   We owe it to them and to their families to ensure all 25 mines in Illinois are being held to the highest standards of safety          Durbin said the legislation approved today will      Give the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  the power to shut down a mine if it refuses to pay a fine   Require mine owners to install wireless communications and tracking equipment in all mines within three years   Require coal mines to create new emergency response plans and require that these plans be continuously reviewed  updated and re certified by MSHA every six months   Require each mine to make available two experienced rescue teams capable of responding to an emergency within an hour   Substantially raise minimum fines for serious safety violations   Raise the maximum fine to  250 000 for first offenses and  500 000 for second offenses  as well as raise the maximum civil penalty for flagrant violations to  220 000   Create grant programs to improve safety training     Durbin s original bill  S  2448  also called for increased fines for mine safety violations  improved mine safety training grant programs and a tightened fines collection process     I commend my colleagues for addressing these issues in the largest overhaul of mine safety legislation in 30 years     said Durbin      With over 50 mine related deaths in the past two years  the Senate recognized the need to act   I urge the House to approve these critical reforms as soon as possible        According to recent reports  since 2001  almost half of all fines have not been collected   Federal records also show that in the last two years the federal mine safety agency has failed to hand over any delinquent cases to the Treasury Department for further collection efforts  as is supposed to occur after 180 days  Today   s mine safety bill tightens up fine collections and authorizes MSHA to close mines that don   t pay       Over the years  funding for education health and training grants has steadily declined    seriously impacting the agency   s ability to meet the training needs of the Illinois mining industry   Nationally  MSHA awards up to  10 million in grants annually   Last year  Illinois received  209 250   down from  274 781 approximately ten years ago   The Illinois Office of Mines and Minerals  OMM  uses the funds it receives from MSHA to purchase safety vehicles  rescue training equipment and to help train new coal mine employees   Not only is OMM unable to purchase new equipment as old equipment wears out  but the agency is having trouble purchasing modern mine rescue training equipment   Today   s Senate passed legislation includes a new grant program for education and training  authorizing    such sums that may be necessary    which allows the Illinois Office of Mines and Minerals to apply for grants as they see fit       Durbin has also written to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them for a review of mine safety records in Illinois and elsewhere  In his letters he asked the agencies to examine two issues     the impact funding cuts for mine safety inspections have had on mine safety  and a status report on safety conditions at all of Illinois    mines   President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the five years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 130 mine inspectors since 2000       The State of Illinois recently passed legislation that would require mine operators to install communications technology that tracks miners below ground and requires the miners to wear oxygen canisters   The bill is awaiting the Governor   s signature
