 January 21  2008    HAZEL CREST  IL   Illinois will soon receive approximately  1 5 million in federal funding for Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  prevention activities  U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  announced today in Hazel Crest  the site of the most recent EAB discovery  Durbin successfully included the funding in the omnibus appropriations bill signed into law by President Bush in late December  Illinois could also benefit from the Senators invasive species bill  which is attached to the Senate passed farm bill and now being considered by a House Senate Conference Committee    Illinois has more than 131 million ash trees  with about 20 percent of the trees in the Chicago area  said Durbin  The additional funding will help Illinois officials develop and implement a plan to address the current situation and avert a potentially devastating one  In the past few years  this insect has killed tens of millions of trees throughout the Midwest  we need to do everything we can to get ahead of this infestation spreading further in Illinois    It has been a year and a half since the first case of Emerald Ash Borer was found in Illinois  said Durbin  Since then  the infestation has worsened  Its crucial that we reverse this trend  The legislation the Senate passed will make the funds available for communities to get ahead of this problem and others caused by similar invasive species    Durbins Invasive Species Revolving Loan Fund is a bill designed to help municipalities defray the costs of invasive species management activities normally performed by the federal government  EAB management activities  for instance  include surveying trees  removing infested trees and replacing removed trees  The bill creates a low interest revolving loan fund for communities for the purchase of capital equipment and replacement trees to perform duties on municipal government land within quarantine areas  Communities would have a 20 year window to repay the loan  In addition  the bill would allow states to contract with local units of government to perform invasive species management duties    The current federal program does not reimburse municipalities for expenses related to invasive species prevention  While states are able to contract with the U S  Department of Agriculture  for cost sharing assistance  the funding does not reach the municipal level  States are not directed to enter into cooperative funding agreements with local governments    Immediately following the first sighting of the ash borer in Illinois  Durbin called on the USDA to develop a plan to curb the spread of this pest and helped secure federal funding to combat and prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer  Durbin has also urged that certain affected locations in Illinois be declared federal emergency quarantine areas so that they can apply for low interest emergency loans to help eradicate the Emerald Ash Borer  Recently  Durbin announced a  100 000 USDA Forest Service grant to the Illinois Emerald Ash Borer Wood Utilization Team     The Emerald Ash Borer  which is currently present in Cook County  DuPage County  Kane County and LaSalle County  is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  Infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years    The Emerald Ash Borer was first sighted in 2002 in Michigan  Forestry experts estimate that the Emerald Ash Borer has been responsible for the devastation of than 12 million ash trees in Michigan  Ohio  and Indiana
