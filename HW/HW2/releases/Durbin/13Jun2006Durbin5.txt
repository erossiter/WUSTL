                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday  June 13  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Treasury Secretary Nominee  Henry Paulson  to discuss the need to protect Illinois manufacturing jobs by addressing China   s currency manipulation   In the meeting  Durbin and Paulson discussed a number of approaches to the problem including bipartisan legislation that would penalize the Chinese for its undervaluation of the yuan  This manipulation of China s currency has played a major role in the loss of 2 6 million U S  manufacturing jobs since March 2001  Paulson has extensive experience working with China  having made over 70 trips to the country in the past 15 years          One of every six manufacturing jobs in Illinois is tied to exports  and when a major trading partner like China devalues its currency to undercut our products on the world market  our government should act     said Durbin      The current situation is killing manufacturing jobs in the U S   including thousands of jobs in Illinois   Today I made it clear to Mr  Paulson that we must do more to address China   s currency manipulation so that businesses in Illinois  and throughout the country  can compete fairly in the world market          Durbin told Paulson that the U S  should send an unmistakable signal to the Chinese     stop the market manipulation or pay the price with your trading partners  One measure now under consideration would apply a  symmetrical  tariff of 27 5  in line with China s currency undervaluation that would be applied across the board to products from China   It would allow the President to remove sanctions once he certifies that China has moved to a market based currency   The tariffs would commence after a grace period of 180 days to ensure that Treasury officials have adequate time to work with the Chinese to institute reforms       Durbin said the yuan    sometimes known as renminbi    has been tightly pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994  approximately 8 28 yuan to the dollar    During that period of time  China   s economy has grown dramatically  averaging over 8  growth per year   If China   s currency freely floated in the market  as is the case with virtually all major world currencies  it would have appreciated substantially reflecting this economic strength   However  it has remained at the same value  and many economists estimate that the yuan is now undervalued as much as 15 to 40 percent       The undervaluation of the yuan makes China s exports relatively less expensive for foreigners  and it makes foreign products relatively more expensive for Chinese consumers and discourages imports to that country   The practice of    currency manipulation    to gain a trade or competitive advantage violates World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund agreements  of which China is now a party       As the United States largest export industry  manufacturing has felt the impact of the yuan   s undervaluation most dramatically   Illinois has lost over 11 000 manufacturing jobs since April of this year and now has only 681 100 manufacturing jobs statewide       Paulson  a resident of Illinois  has been the Goldman Sachs  Chairman and CEO since 1994   He joined the firm s Chicago office in 1974 and was elected a partner eight years later  rising through the ranks as head of the Chicago office and partner in charge of the Midwest investment banking region    Paulson also briefly served at the Pentagon as Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam war and as a member of the White House Domestic Council under President Nixon   Mr  Paulson is currently Chairman of the Board of the Nature Conservancy and he and his wife Wendy are active on environmental issues
