                                                                                                                                                                                                    Friday  September 22  2006   CHICAGO  IL      The threat of another E  coli outbreak in the nation   s food supply could be substantially reduced if Congress acts quickly to approve legislation introduced by U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL    Durbin was joined today at a news conference at the Chicago International Produce Market by Caroline Smith DeWaal  the director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest  Martin Cole  Director of the National Center for Food Safety and Technology  Brian Imus  State Director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group  and Lynda DeLaforgue  Co Director of Citizen Action       Durbin   s legislation  the Safe Food Act of 2005  is designed to ensure the safety of our nation   s food supply by making one federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring   The legislation  as introduced  would include      Requiring food producers to code their products so that those products can be quickly traced in the event of a foodborne illness outbreak Requiring that food processing plants have procedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination Requiring regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk Giving the FDA recall authority  If the food safety system is centralized in one agency  the agency could quickly respond to an outbreak   Under current U S  law  food safety monitoring  inspection and labeling functions are spread across 12 federal agencies and sub agencies including  the U S  Department of Agriculture   s Food Safety and Inspection Service which regulates meat  poultry and processed egg products  the Food and Drug Administration   s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and Center for Veterinary Medicine which regulates produce and other food products  and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  which tracks foodborne illnesses          This mismatched  piecemeal approach to food safety could spell disaster if we do not act quickly and decisively     said Durbin      That   s why since 1997  I have been pushing for a single food safety agency with the authority to protect the food supply based on sound scientific principles          Today  Durbin sent a letter to Mike Leavitt  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  asking for an update on the status of the outbreak and urging the Administration to support the creation of a single food safety agency   Durbin also wrote to Sen  Saxby Chambliss  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  urging him to hold a hearing on the Safe Food Act of 2005   Durbin also circulated a letter among his Senate colleagues urging them to support the bill       Durbin also asked the Government Accountability Office to evaluate and recommend changes that should be made to our current food safety system in order to better contain  respond to and prevent future deadly outbreaks similar to the current E  coli outbreak   Next week  Durbin will meet with the nominee for FDA Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach  and will ask him how FDA plans to minimize future deadly outbreaks          The current E  coli outbreak points to serious  but correctable  weaknesses in our food safety system    Durbin said      Quick action is needed at the federal level   Today  we have 12 different federal agencies stumbling over each other to ensure the safety of our food supply   Turf battles  overlap and inconsistencies are inevitable          One example of the inconsistencies in our food safety system is the lack of standardization for food inspections   Processed food facilities may be inspected by the FDA once every five or six years  while meat and poultry operations are inspected daily by USDA          The CDC estimates that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year   Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized and more than 5 000 will die  Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to foodborne pathogens
