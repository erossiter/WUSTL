                                                                                                                                                                                            Thursday  April 12  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    At a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing today  U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  called on the Bush Administration and the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to take meaningful action in addressing problems in federal regulation of the pet food industry  The hearing comes in the wake of a widespread recall of contaminated pet food        Many cats  dogs and other pets  considered members of the family are now suffering as a result of a deeply flawed pet food inspection system   said Durbin    The FDA s response to this situation has been wholly inadequate   we need to establish standardized inspections  impose penalties on companies who delay reporting health problems and increase communication between the FDA and the state inspectors so that we can catch potential problems more quickly  These sound like basics steps but the FDA has failed to put them in place        At the hearing  Durbin heard testimony from FDA officials and outside experts including Dr  Stephen F  Sundlof  the Director of the FDA s Center for Veterinary Medicine  Duane Ekedahl  Executive Director of the Pet Food Institute  Eric Nelson  President of the American Association of Feed Control Officers  Dr  Elizabeth Hodgkins  Veterinarian and Dr  Claudia A  Kirk  Associate Professor of Medicine and Nutrition at the University of Tennessee s College of Veterinary Medicine       Durbin said the FDA s response to the problem has been problematic and urged the FDA to take action in three specific areas      Delay in reporting   According to materials supplied to Durbin s office  it appears Menu Foods  Inc  first noticed a potential problem on February 20  2007 but did not contact FDA until March 15  2007   In the meantime  other companies were selling tainted product and the supplier wasn t aware that it had provided wheat gluten contaminated with melamine   Durbin wants companies that delay reporting to the FDA and endanger human and animal health to face penalties   Lack of inspections   According to testimony today  the Menu Foods facility in Emporia  Kansas where many of these products were made had never been inspected by the FDA   The agency has been relying on the states to conduct inspections  but the FDA has jurisdiction over all pet food manufacturing facilities and the ultimate responsibility to ensure facilities comply with FDA standards   Where there should be federal regulation  there is instead a patchwork of state inspection systems and voluntary guidance   Durbin wants to require the FDA to work with the states to establish a standardized set of regulations and inspection requirements   Incomplete data and reporting from the FDA   Blogs and nonprofit websites have filled a gap and become the most efficient way to share information on contaminations   Durbin wants to direct the FDA to create a similar information sharing system that would allow state veterinarians  pet owners and others to alert the FDA of possible contaminations    Durbin said the list of problems associated with food safety   both pet food and safety of the human food supply   is growing and the federal government must act       The Illinois senator said legislation he has introduced to consolidate all federal food safety responsibilities into a single  independent agency has taken on new urgency because of a possibly heightened need to respond quickly and effectively to any acts of bioterrorism or agroterrorism  Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues        I did not call this hearing to create false concern  but we heard testimony today that the melamine tainted wheat gluten was supplied as a  food grade  additive and may have made it into the human food supply  but was pulled before anyone was harmed  This is very serious problem and we need to make changes to a system in which chronic shortcomings could turn critical   Durbin said       The non partisan U S  General Accounting Office  GAO  has been unequivocal in its recommendation for consolidation of federal food safety programs   In February of this year  the GAO deemed federal oversight of food safety as  high risk  to the economy and public health and safety  Over the past two decades  GAO has also issued numerous reports on topics such as food recalls  food safety inspections and the transport of animal feeds   Each of these reports highlights the current fragmentation and inconsistent organization of the various agencies involved in food safety oversight       Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  have introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  S 654   The Safe Food Act    Durbin and DeLauro have worked on this effort for over a decade in Congress and the bill has gained momentum from recent events
