August 2  2005   Harrison Street Improvements and Continued Expansion of IL 336 Top List     QUINCY  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representative Lane Evans today announced  10 million in new federal funding for Quincy area transportation projects   The funding was secured through the TEA 3 bill recently passed by Congress          A total of  8 million  evenly split between the Senate and House  will be used to continue building the Macomb bypass  linking U S  67 and IL 336      The development of IL 336 is vital to Western Illinois because it will help hook towns like Quincy and Macomb to the national transportation system     said Durbin      The towns along IL 336 will benefit from the economic development that goes hand in hand with major national roadways           The Senate portion of the bill includes  1 5 million for Harrison Street improvements   The funding will be used in part on West Harrison Street from 1st Street to IL 57   The project is designed to improve safety at the railroad crossing  give trucks the ability to maneuver more efficiently and safely and to upgrade the roadway to a hard surface so cars and trucks using the roadway suffer less wear and tear   The funding could also be used at the discretion of the City of Quincy for a modern roundabout for vehicles  pedestrians and bicyclists at 48th and Harrison Street near the entrance to John Wood Community College          The Senate also allocated  500 000 for illumination of the Mississippi River Bayview Bridge   The City of Quincy has been studying the idea of lighting the bridge since the early 1990   s   Joe    Mr  Quincy    Bonansinga was the driving force behind illuminating the bridge before he passed away   The community intends to raise the additional  70 000 needed to complete the project in honor of Bonansinga          Securing this funding for Quincy is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     said Obama     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges             The new Transportation Bill is a jobs bill     Evans said      It will provide an important boost to job creation and spur economic opportunities for our state and nation   The legislation will also help us address the problems of congestion  traffic safety and crumbling roads and bridges   It will make our roads and highways safer for the traveling public   I was pleased to work with area citizens  state officials  and the congressional delegation to increase the flow of transportation funds to Illinois          Congressman Ray LaHood worked to secure funding for Route 336 in the bill and underscored the importance of continuing to fund this project until it is completed to Peoria      Route 336 has long been a priority for the entire Congressional team which represents Western Illinois     LaHood said      I am pleased we could combine to provide significant resources for this project   Once completed  with 336 from Quincy to Peoria  and 67 from Alton to the Quad Cities  Western Illinois will have a tremendous highway network           The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21         Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level        Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families           It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois              This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
