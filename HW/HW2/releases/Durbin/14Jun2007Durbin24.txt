June 14  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the President asking him to take disciplinary action in line with recommendations made by the Office of the Special Counsel regarding the inappropriate activities of the Administrator of the General Services Administration  Lurita Doan  Senator Durbin called on the President to take action in the next few weeks prior to the markup for the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee    In todays letter  Senator Durbin noted  The actions of this Administrator  since her commencement at this agency approximately one year ago  do not reflect well on your Administration and on your standards for ethics and integrity  In our view  she has violated the public trust and failure to hold her accountable for her actions would send a regrettable signal that such actions can be tolerated    Senator Dick Durbin currently serves as Chairman of the newly created Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee which has jurisdiction over GSA  the U S  Treasury Department  Internal Revenue Service  the Federal Trade Commission  the Securities and Exchange Commission  the Small Business Administration  the Commodities Futures Trading Commission  the U S  Mint and the Bureau of Printing and Engraving among others    The text of the letter appears below     June 14  2007    The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave   N W   Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government Appropriations  with jurisdiction over the General Services Administration  GSA  and the Office of the Special Counsel  OSC   I have been following the inappropriate and disturbing activities of the Administrator of the General Services Administration  Lurita Doan  I write to express my deep concern and to urge your disciplinary action prior to my Subcommittee markup  which could be as soon as two weeks time    I am aware that the OSC has completed its investigation of allegations that the Administrator engaged in political activities in violation of the Hatch Act  Special Counsel Bloch has now determined that Administrator Doan violated the Hatch Acts prohibition against using her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election where she solicited the political activity of more than thirty subordinate employees and implied that GSA could be used to help elect Republican candidates    Also disturbing is the finding by Special Counsel Bloch that despite engaging in the most pernicious of political activity prohibited by the Hatch Act  Administrator Doan has shown no remorse and lacks an appreciation for the seriousness of her violation  The Special Counsel has recommended that Administrator Doan be disciplined to the fullest extent for her serious violation of the Hatch Act and insensitivity to cooperating fully and honestly in the course of his investigation    These findings come on top of questionable actions the Administrator has taken in the past year with regard to procurement protocols  For example  the GSA Inspector General  IG  has found that the Administrator  who is chief of a procurement agency  did not follow procurement rules in attempting to award a sole source contract to a former colleague  In addition  the GSA IG has testified that Administrator Doan inappropriately expedited a complex contract with a major contractor that she knew was under investigation by the IG and referred to the Justice Department    Furthermore  the Administrator has threatened the independence of the Inspector General by undermining the IGs ability to perform its oversight function and inappropriately interfering with the IGs budget  I am troubled that she has repeatedly made statements about streamlining oversight  which could result in undermining compliance with procurement rules    In the past year  morale has been dampened at GSA and valuable employees have departed  The actions of this Administrator  since her commencement at this agency approximately one year ago  do not reflect well on your Administration and on your standards for ethics and integrity  In my view  she has violated the public trust and failure to hold her accountable for her actions would send a regrettable signal that such actions can be tolerated    For all of the above stated reasons  I urge you  Mr  President  to ask for the resignation of the Administrator of the General Services Administration immediately  It is my hope that you will take this action so that I will not be compelled to take punitive action in the appropriations bill    Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  Chairman  Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government
