CUTS COLLEGE LOAN INTEREST RATES IN HALF FOR ILLINOIS STUDENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Tuesday  April 18  2006    NORMAL  IL      U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  today unveiled the Reverse the Raid on Student Aid Act of 2006  RRSA Act   which would make a college education more accessible and affordable   The bill cuts interest rates in half on college loans for student borrowers with the most financial need and for parent borrowers  increases Pell Grant awards and gives students the opportunity to choose the best deals when consolidating loans   Durbin introduced the bill on Friday  April 7  just before the spring recess began   He was joined in his efforts by U S  Congressman George Miller  D CA  who has introduced similar legislation in the House          Unless we act now  the price of a college education will increase dramatically for Illinois students on July 1st     said Durbin      New interest rates on student loans could make the price of a higher education unaffordable and cost students the opportunity to get a college education          Earlier this year  the Republican led Congress cut  12 billion out of the federal student aid programs in order to help finance tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans   Durbin said that his bill reflects the kind of serious investment that America must make if it wants to ensure college access for all students and remain the world s economic leader       Durbin   s bill would      Cut new interest rates that are scheduled to go into effect on July 1st in half  from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent for students and from 8 5 percent to 4 25 percent for parents  The Durbin bill would apply to all student subsidized Stafford loans and parent loans   Increase the maximum Pell Grant award from  4 050 to  4 500 in 2007 and increase the maximum award to  6 000 by 2011   It would also make the Pell Grant Program a mandatory program  which would guarantee that Pell Grants would be fully funded each year   Repeal the    single holder rule    that prevents students from shopping around for the best deal when they consolidate their student loans   Allow students to consolidate their loans while in school in order to lock in low interest rates   Ensure the future of the Direct Loan Program by making it a mandatory spending program    Under this new legislation  the typical undergraduate student borrower with  17 500 in student loan debt would save  5 600 over the life of his or her loan       Recent reports indicate that  from 2001 through 2006  the price of tuition  fees  and room and board at four year public institutions has increased by 44 percent   However  over that same five year period  the maximum Pell Grant award has stayed the same   The President s 2007 budget proposed to freeze the maximum Pell grant at  4 050 again this year   Senate Democrats fought to increase the Pell Grant award  but were defeated along party lines   Durbin   s bill would ensure full funding for this important program       Today   s students either borrow from Direct Loan Programs  where they are borrowing money directly from their schools at fixed rates  or through the Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  Program  where students are provided with a list of lenders from which to pick   Under the current    single holder rule    students who have all their loans with one lender are prevented from consolidating with other lenders at better rates when they graduate       Durbin noted that many high school seniors have to make student loan decisions on their own      Seventeen year olds    some of whom have never had a bank account    are asked to choose a lender from a list of private companies and banks     said Durbin      Once students graduate  they are often more familiar with the lending process  may discover a company that offers them a lower interest rate   but find themselves locked in with their current lender          The Durbin bill repeals the    single holder rule    which makes it possible for students to consolidate  or work with  an alternate lender after they graduate   The bill also allows students to consolidate while still in school in order to take advantage of lower interest rates       The President   s 2007 budget proposed to make the administrative costs associated with the Direct Loan Program  a discretionary or optional spending program   The Durbin bill secures the future of the Direct Loan Program by making administrative costs part of the Federal Government   s mandatory spending       Durbin   s bill has been endorsed by Young Democrats of America  Rock the Vote  USAction  SEIU  US Students Association  AFSCME


