                                                                                                                                                                                          Monday  December 17  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Impact Aid Coalition  today announced that the final omnibus spending bill includes a Durbin authored amendment to allow the five public schools serving the Naval Station Great Lakes to pool their students and maximize federal education assistance through the Impact Aid program  The bill will be considered in the Senate this week and could be sent to the President for his signature as early as this weekend  This change in federal funding will protect schools near Naval Station Great Lakes from losing important federal funding  Nearly  9 million in Impact Aid funding will now be available to North Chicago  Highland Park  Highwood  Glenview and Glenbrook schools  Durbin said  This will help to assure that the children of Navy families and the affected school districts continue to have access to the best educational opportunities  The school districts serving the students living in military housing in northern Illinois are grateful to Senator Durbin for his leadership role in passing this measure  This Congressional action demonstrates the federal governments commitment to the education of military dependent children  said Dr  Maureen Hager  Superintendent of North Shore School District 112  The new funding will allow us to keep our schools financially strong  We will continue to work with the federal government to provide military dependent students a high quality education  This effort also recognizes the local commitment put forth on behalf of military families living in our community  It is our honor and pleasure to welcome and educate every child who comes to our schools  Many local school districts across the U S  serve students affiliated with military families and include federally owned land exempt from local property taxes which fund public schools  These school districts face special challenges  they must provide a quality education to the children in the area and meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act  while often operating with less local revenue than is available to other school districts  Impact Aid is a source of federal funding that supplements the cost of educating those students whose families are part of the U S  military  The Durbin provision will help the federal government fully reimburse North Chicago  Highland Park  Highwood  Glenview and Glenbrook schools for the cost of educating military affiliated children  This includes the over 1 500 children of Great Lakes personnel who attend public schools in the area  We need to make sure that school districts have the funds they need to provide each student with a quality public education  said Durbin  Many local school districts  like those serving Naval Station Great Lakes  cover areas that include federally owned land exempt from local taxes which fund public schools  Impact Aid fills this gap in funding to make sure that no student is left behind  Senator Durbin has consistently supported higher funding for Impact Aid  Earlier this month  he met with representatives from the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools  NAFIS  in order to discuss the pressing need for increased Impact Aid in schools serving the Great Lakes Naval Base  Scott Air Force Base and other federal lands  Durbin and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  first introduced legislation to allow the five school districts serving the Naval Station Great Lakes to pool their students to maximize federal education assistance through the Impact Aid program
