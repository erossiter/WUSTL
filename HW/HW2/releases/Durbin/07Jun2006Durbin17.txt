                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  June 7  2006        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United Airlines  Glenn Tilton  urging United to keep their corporate headquarters in the Chicago area          The Chicago area and United Airlines have been partners for many years   This relationship has helped United become the nation   s second largest airline and has generated  1 billion in wages annually for United employees in our state     said Durbin      I urge United to choose Chicago as their new corporate headquarters if they decide to relocate   United should remain Chicago   s    Hometown Airline             United Airlines has been exploring the possibility of moving their corporate headquarters and has been searching for a new location   Recently  there were reports that the airline s parent company  UAL Corp   was looking to move its headquarters from Elk Grove Village  Ill   near Chicago  to Downtown Chicago  Denver or San Francisco          Moving United   s headquarters out of our state would not only hurt over 16 000 United employees in the Chicago area  it would be a major setback for the airline     said Durbin       United is as dependent on the contributions of their highly trained professionals and partnership with O   Hare as the people of Chicago are on its business          United has announced that a decision whether to relocate and where will come this year  and that the airline is likely to move in 2007       Text of letter attached           June 7  2006   Mr  Glenn Tilton  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  United Airlines   Dear Glenn    I am writing to you regarding United Airlines    reported search for a new location for its corporate world headquarters   As you know from various discussions over the years  I support United   s continued presence in the Chicago area  both as a central hub for the airline and as a home for its corporate headquarters       Chicago   s O   Hare International Airport is United   s global gateway to the nation and the world  and United should maintain its headquarters near its global hub   I strongly believe that the Chicago area offers United a variety of first rate locations for its new corporate headquarters   The nation   s third largest city has utilized its central location to become the crossroads of the aviation system  as Chicago has become a non stop global gateway to 69 international destinations  offering more flights worldwide than any other city  Clearly  United has benefited from this location in becoming one of the world   s leading airlines       While I understand your desire to select a new headquarters to house roughly 400 corporate employees  which will enable you to consolidate out of state workers into the vacated office space in Elk Grove  it would be a setback to the region and United if the airline were to move its corporate headquarters to another state   United is one of the largest employers in Illinois  employing 16 000 workers in the region and 3 600 at its Elk Grove complex   These workers bring roughly  1 billion in economic activity to the region   While most of these jobs would remain in Illinois for the near future  if United   s headquarters move elsewhere  over time many of United   s operational employees may also move to the new headquarters   This  in turn  will undermine United   s operations at its flagship hub at O   Hare       Therefore  I hope you agree with me that United should remain as Chicago   s    Hometown Airline      Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any assistance       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
