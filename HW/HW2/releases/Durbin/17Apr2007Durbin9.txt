     DURBIN  HAGEL  GLOBAL WARMING POSES SERIOUS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY

GLOBAL WARMING POSES SERIOUS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  April 17  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  today offered an amendment to the 2007 Intelligence Authorization bill now on the Senate floor for consideration   The amendment would require a National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  to assess the security challenges presented by the world s changing climate   NIEs are the federal government s most authoritative written judgments concerning national security issues and are developed to address the most serious of threats  They contain the coordinated judgments of all U S  intelligence agencies regarding the likely course of future events        For years  too many of us have viewed global warming as simply an environmental or economic issue   We now need to consider it as a security concern   said Durbin    Many of the most severe effects of global warming are expected in regions where fragile governments are least capable of responding to them  Failing to recognize and plan for the geopolitical consequences of global warming would be a serious mistake  This intelligence assessment will guide policymakers in protecting our national security and averting potential international crises         As I have said for many years  the way forward is to responsibly address the issue of climate change with a national strategy that incorporates economic  environmental and energy priorities   These issues are inextricably linked and changes to one will affect the other two   These priorities are also an integral part of U S  national security   said Hagel    Risk assessment is essential to putting our national resources in the places where they will be most effective   This is even more important when assessing risk to national security   This amendment will provide information we need to continue to help make our country secure in the years to come        A National Intelligence Estimate is a comprehensive review of a potential security threat that combines  correlates and evaluates intelligence from all of the relevant U S  intelligence agencies  Various intelligence agencies   the CIA  NSA  the Pentagon  FBI  etc    must pool data  share perspectives and work together to assemble an accurate picture of threats to U S  security       On March 28th  Senators Durbin and Hagel introduced a broader version of this amendment  the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act  which asks the intelligence community to provide a strategic estimate of the risks posed by global climate change for countries or regions that are of particular economic or military significance to the United States or that are at serious risk of humanitarian suffering   This National Intelligence Estimate will assess the political  social  agricultural  and economic challenges for countries and their likely impact   That legislation will also fund additional research by the Department of Defense in order to examine the impact of climate change on military operations       Senators Durbin and Hagel said an NIE is essential to accurately compare and contrast strategic intelligence gathered by different intelligence agencies  Without an NIE  the various agencies may never have an opportunity to examine each other s data  and any differences or similarities between the reports could provide important information for policymakers       Environmental changes caused by global warming represent a potential threat multiplier for instability around the world   Scarce water  for example  may exacerbate conflict along economic  ethnic  or sectarian divisions   Water shortages  food insecurity  or flooding   all of which may occur as a result of rising global temperatures   could also displace people  forcing them to migrate   The NIE will look beyond the short term and require the intelligence community to analyze these issues in the context of the next thirty years       Last year  the Bush Administration acknowledged that environmental issues pose national and international security challenges   The President s 2006 National Security Strategy stated that  environmental destruction  whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic mega disasters such as floods  hurricanes  earthquakes  or tsunamis   Problems of this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities to respond  and may even overtax national militaries  requiring a larger international response   These challenges are not traditional national security concerns  such as the conflict of arms or ideologies  But if left unaddressed they can threaten national security   The National Security Strategy is a comprehensive report to Congress laying out the broad strategic vision of the President for the security of the U S
