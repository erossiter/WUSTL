December 11  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  led a bi partisan group of Illinois Senators and Representatives today in sending a letter to Secretary Alphonso Jackson of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  asking for the immediate extension of its Moving to Work agreement with the Chicago Housing Authority  CHA  for a minimum of an additional five years  Illinois delegation members who have signed on to the letter include Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Representatives Judy Biggert  R IL   Danny Davis  D IL   Rahm Emanuel  D IL   Luis Gutierrez  D IL   Jesse Jackson  D IL   Peter Roskam  R IL  and Jan Schakowsky  D IL     The Moving to Work agreement has allowed flexibility and funding for the CHA to implement its Plan for Transformation  a ten year plan to revitalize public housing in Chicago and transition dilapidated homes and high rises into sustainable mixed income communities  A number of factors including shortfalls in promised funding and unforeseen growth in costs have forced the CHA to make adjustments to the project and extend the timeline for completion  The Plan for Transformation was approved by HUD in 2000 and was originally scheduled to be completed in 2010      HUD s continued commitment to the project is critical to helping CHA move forward with the reconstruction of the 25 000 public housing units  An extension would also enable CHA to secure other sources of long term funding for the project  the Illinois members wrote  The Plan for Transformation is an important step forward in breaking the cycle of poverty and rebuilding the lives and communities in Chicago  We urge HUD to immediately extend the MTW agreement with CHA to at least 2015     Text of the letter appears below    December 11  2007   The Honorable Alphonso Jackson  Secretary  U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 7th St   SW  Washington  DC 20410   Dear Secretary Jackson     We write to urge the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to extend its 10 year Moving to Work  MTW  agreement with the Chicago Housing Authority  CHA  for a minimum of an additional five years  This agreement has been critical in providing CHA with the local flexibility and federal funding necessary to build new and better communities for Chicagos low income families     CHA provides assisted housing for more than 130 000 residents in approximately 67 000 homes  making it the third largest housing authority in the nation  Under the Plan for Transformation  a 10 year MTW agreement with HUD  CHA will construct or rehabilitate 25 000 units of public housing in Chicago as it revitalizes and transitions dilapidated homes and high rises into sustainable mixed income communities  This agreement is set to expire on January 6  2010    Unfortunately  a number of factors have changed the estimated completion date from 2010 to 2015  Cuts to the HUD budget have also led to shortfalls in promised funding  In 2007  only  118 million of the  139 million for capital secured under the MTW agreement was allocated to CHA  and only  153 million of the  183 million for operating costs  Meanwhile  changing quality standards for mixed income developments have added to an unforeseen growth in construction and labor costs  These budgetary constraints have forced CHA to make adjustments to the project  including the timeline      Although HUD has agreed in its meetings with CHA to extend the agreement  HUD has yet to do so  The agencys continued commitment to the project is critical to helping CHA move forward with the reconstruction of the 25 000 public housing units  An extension would also enable CHA to secure other sources of long term funding for the project    The Plan for Transformation is an important step forward in breaking the cycle of poverty and rebuilding the lives and communities in Chicago  We urge HUD to immediately extend the MTW agreement with CHA to at least 2015  Thank you for your attention to this matter     Sincerely    Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
