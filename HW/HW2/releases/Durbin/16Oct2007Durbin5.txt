Obama Seek Assurances During Investigation Of Dr  Veizaga Mendez

October 16  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the Secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation  IDFPR   Dean Martinez expressing their concerns with Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez practicing in the state of Illinois and urging the IDFPR to disclose what action they are taking to protect the health and safety of patients in Illinois during the course of this investigation    While we commend the IDFPR for initiating an investigation of Dr  Veizaga Mendez  we understand that the next hearing in this investigation is not anticipated until December 2007 and would like to know what action the Department is taking to protect the health and safety of patients in Illinois during the course of this investigation  the Illinois members wrote  Please promptly inform us about the current status of Dr  Veizaga Mendezs license to practice medicine in Illinois  Please also inform us of any steps the IDFPR will take to ensure that no further Illinois patients are endangered pending the outcome of the IDFPRs investigation of Dr  Veizaga Mendez     On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths  Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice    On October 11  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Gordon Mansfield asking questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who has been linked to some extent to the recent spike in deaths at the Marion VA Medical Center  A cursory check of publicly available information by staff members from both Senate offices uncovered questionable information that should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation by the VA     In an October 3 meeting with Senator Durbin  Dr  Michael Kussman  Under Secretary of VA for Health and Dr  Gerald Cross  Principal Deputy Under Secretary insisted that the VA could not have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed     Both Senators Durbin and Obama have actively pressed the VA for information on the situation at the Marion VA Medical Center  Last month  they sent a letter to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  asking specific questions about the VAs response to the increase in deaths at the center  They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August     This followed a September 17 letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation  In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated     October 16  2007   Secretary Dean Martinez   Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation   320 W  Washington  Springfield  IL 62786   Dear Secretary Martinez    We are writing with great concern regarding Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who has been licensed to practice medicine in Illinois since 1973  and his potential role in the unusual spike in deaths of surgical patients at the Marion  Illinois Veterans Administration Medical Center during a six month period from 2006 to 2007  While we commend the IDFPR for initiating an investigation of Dr  Veizaga Mendez  we understand that the next hearing in this investigation is not anticipated until December 2007 and would like to know what action the Department is taking to protect the health and safety of patients in Illinois during the course of this investigation    We have strong reason to caution against Dr  Veizaga Mendez practicing in the state of Illinois  He has already surrendered his license to practice in Massachusetts pending allegations by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine of gross incompetence and malpractice  Furthermore  a cursory examination of his record by our offices has raised serious concerns about his fitness to practice medicine  yet we have learned recently that Dr  Veizaga Mendez is now seeking a license to practice in North Dakota    Please promptly inform us about the current status of Dr  Veizaga Mendezs license to practice medicine in Illinois  Please also inform us of any steps the IDFPR will take to ensure that no further Illinois patients are endangered pending the outcome of the IDFPRs investigation of Dr  Veizaga Mendez     We also appreciate your responses to the additional questions about licensing standards and practices  which are enclosed    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin
