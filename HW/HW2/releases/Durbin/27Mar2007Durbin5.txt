INTRODUCES PAUL SIMON STUDY ABROAD FOUNDATION ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Tuesday  March 27  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation to establish a study abroad program for undergraduate students that would help build global awareness and international understanding  Durbin s bill  the Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act  was inspired by the work of the late Senator Paul Simon and is based on recommendations published by the bipartisan Lincoln Study Abroad Commission      The legislation creates a program that encourages non traditional students    such as low income students and those who attend community college    to spend part of their undergraduate careers studying abroad   The bipartisan bill was co sponsored by Sen  Norm Coleman  R MN     Last year Durbin and Coleman introduced similar bipartisan legislation        Senator Paul Simon was one our nation s great public servants   said Durbin    He had a vision    to strengthen the role of the U S  as a world leader by investing in the education of our young people   The international study abroad program we are introducing is based on his vision and advances his work  This program will instill in the next generation of Americans a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of other nations  This  in turn  will enhance the United States  capacity to lead in the 21st Century        The goal of the Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act is to make study abroad in high quality programs in diverse locations around the world the routine  rather than the exception  for American college students    The bill authorizes  80 million for grants to individual students  colleges and universities and nongovernmental institutions that provide study abroad opportunities   The foundation will also be able to leverage funds through support from the private sector   The new legislation creates an independent government entity  the Senator Paul Simon Foundation  to administer the program       Durbin s bill would      Help at least 1 million undergraduates study abroad annually within 10 years Expand study abroad opportunities for students who are currently underrepresented Increase the number of students that study abroad in non traditional destinations    Over the next 50 years  the majority of the world s population growth will occur outside of the United States and Europe   It is essential to our security and economic success that tomorrow s leaders understand this changing world   said Durbin    Every student should have access to study abroad and be encouraged to pursue research in developing countries   With swift passage of this bill  Congress has the opportunity to make international education a national priority        This marks the second year in a row that Durbin and Coleman have teamed up to address the importance of study abroad programs  last year the two senators introduced similar legislation known as the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Act   The Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program established in the 2004 budget  presented recommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity for college students to study abroad  with special emphasis on studying in developing nations   In addition  the 9 11 Commission Report recommended that the United States should increase support for scholarship and exchange programs   The Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2007 has the support of the academic and educational exchange communities   A companion bill was introduced on March 12  2007 in the House and referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee
