REGIONAL SUMMIT TO PROMOTE BROADBAND AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Saturday  February 24  2007      IL    Today  U S Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  hosted a Regional Broadband Summit in Central Illinois to help raise awareness of broadband as a regional economic development tool   Durbin says a national policy is needed to accelerate the deployment of broadband internet service to rural areas       The Summit was an opportunity for representatives from the business  education  healthcare and network provider sectors of Central Illinois to share broadband successes  identify needs and help chart a collaborative course for a connected Illinois   Durbin also discussed legislation he intends to introduce to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas        Broadband is an essential component of our lives  at work and at home  It has become an essential service like water  gas and electricity  Our homes and businesses need affordable access to high speed internet connections  in the same way our homes and businesses need traditional utility services   said Durbin   Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality        Two recent reports    one issued by the U S  Department of Commerce and the other by the U S  Department of Agriculture   found that rural and farm households have access to broadband internet at approximately half the level of all U S  households nationwide  Another respected research organization  the Pew Internet and American Life Project  found similar results   In its 2006 report  Pew found that only 18  of rural adults reported a home broadband connection  compared to 31  of urban adults   All of these studies point to a consistent conclusion   Americans living in urban areas are almost twice as likely to have home broadband access as do their rural counterparts        We need to close the digital divide  ensuring that rural Americans are not left behind in the 21st Century s digital economy   Durbin noted   Whether it is through telephone wire  cable  fiber  satellite  wireless or any other medium  we need every existing and future broadband service provider to step up to the national challenge        Durbin said broadband is critical to community and economic development  as it encourages investment  creates jobs  improves productivity  fosters innovation  and increases consumer benefits in every corner of our nation   A recent study estimated the widespread adoption of basic broadband could add  500 billion to the U S  economy and create 1 2 million new jobs per year   The study also projected 1 2 million jobs could be created if next generation broadband technology were rapidly deployed       Durbin noted that one of the main obstacles in the drive toward rural broadband adoption is the availability and price of broadband service in the rural regions in the state and across the nation   Even when broadband service is available in rural areas  the service is frequently more expensive and of lower quality than broadband offered in more populated areas   He also noted that President Bush s fiscal year 2008 budget cuts a mandatory broadband assistance loan program by  203 million and that the Federal Communications Commission does not have a bureau dedicated to facilitating the build out of broadband networks  which has contributed to the FCC s failure to study the problem and issue recommendations to expand access       Durbin pointed to a consortium of schools  universities  hospitals  economic development units  elected leaders and internet service providers that have come together in Southern Illinois to form an entity  Connect SI  tasked with mapping out resources  building demand  and working with providers to build out infrastructure    Connect SI is the type of public private partnership that can break through the significant proprietary concerns that providers have about sharing their network resources in order to build detailed maps important to build out   Durbin said       He also referenced Connect Kentucky  one of the most innovative organizations in the country   Since its formation in 2001  Connect Kentucky has brought state government  providers  technology companies  and economic development units together and  on a budget of only a couple million dollars per year  built incredibly detailed maps throughout the state   Just last year  broadband access increased 28 percent in Kentucky       Durbin said the legislation he is crafting will likely include five major provisions  detailed below  Each is designed to foster competition and innovation  take advantage of public private partnerships and expand access      The bill establishes a new source of federal funding to provide seed money to statewide or regional public private partnerships designed to increase broadband access and build demand   Groups like Connect Kentucky and Connect SI would benefit from this funding source   A nationwide rollout of these types of partnerships would be less expensive and far more effective than directly paying for infrastructure   The bill reauthorizes and modifies the USDA s rural broadband grant  loan and loan guarantee program   Modifying the USDA s statutory authority would help ensure that federal funds and financing would be provided only to entities that will serve truly rural and underserved regions of the nation   The bill would also aim to streamline the application process by forcing USDA to issue a shorter  simpler application and decreasing the capital requirements to open the program to more applicants   The bill would encourage the FCC to open currently unused blocks of spectrum in order to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband uses  especially in rural areas   The bill would help promote the build out of municipal wireless or wired high speed internet service systems analogous to municipal water or power services for municipalities that are not served or underserved by telecom companies   Champaign and Rochelle each have active and economically sustainable municipal broadband systems  which speaks to the viability of this approach   Last  the bill would study the viability of setting aside Universal Service Fund dollars for the build out of broadband networks to areas that are not economically viable for private providers       In August 2006  Durbin introduced similar legislation  the Broadband for Rural America Act  in the 109th Congress
