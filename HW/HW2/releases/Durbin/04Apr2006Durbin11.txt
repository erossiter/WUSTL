     DURBIN SAYS ACTION BY KEY COMMITTEE COULD BRING RELIEF TO ILLINOIS FARMERS

ACTION BY KEY COMMITTEE COULD BRING RELIEF TO ILLINOIS FARMERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Tuesday  April 4  2006           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said Illinois farmers are a step closer to receiving federal disaster assistance after he helped secure  4 billion in emergency aid as part of the Supplemental Appropriations bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee today  The relief package would assist farmers and ranchers in Illinois and across the nation by extending federal aid to states confronted with drought  hurricanes and floods        Today  Illinois farmers are a step closer to receiving the federal assistance that they so desperately need after suffering significant losses due to natural disasters   Durbin said   We have had a terrible drought in the Midwest     in my home state of Illinois  in Missouri and in parts of Iowa and Minnesota   We   ve had the worst drought in 105 years in some parts of Illinois and every county but one in the state has been designated a disaster area by the Secretary of Agriculture          The amendment approved by the Committee would      Provide over  1 billion in Crop Disaster Assistance  which would give farmers who have lost more than 35 percent of their crop a payment of 50 percent of the established crop price   Provide  1 6 billion in Supplemental Economic Loss Payments to help compensate farmers for significantly higher energy and fertilizer costs in 2005   Provide  600 million for livestock producers facing increased feed costs   Provide additional assistance to farmers to compensate for sugarcane  sugarbeet  and other specialty crop losses and conservation programs    Durbin has worked to provide critical relief for Illinois farmers whose crops have suffered in one of the worst droughts in a century  This fall  Durbin introduced a bill to extend the 2003 2004 disaster relief package through the 2005 crop year  Durbin said he was disappointed that  House conferees dropped the drought assistance for Midwest and other farmers in the supplemental package in December   despite the clear will of the Senate to provide this much needed emergency funding       Last month  Durbin renewed efforts to help Illinois farmers by introducing  along with 24 other Senators from both parties  S  2438  the Emergency Disaster Assistance Act of 2006   Durbin also sent a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran  R MS  and Ranking Member Senator Robert Byrd  D WV   asking for the inclusion of disaster assistance funds in this year   s emergency appropriations bill for Illinois farmers who incurred significant losses due to natural disasters        Most Illinois farms are run by families who depend on farming for their livelihood     said Durbin      Last year   s drought and this year   s high gas prices could put struggling Illinois farmers out of business   This crop year may not reverse last year   s fortunes    and Illinois farming families should not be forced to pay the price          Today  Durbin joined a bipartisan effort  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  to secure disaster aid in this year   s Emergency Supplemental bill  The bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon and will now go on to be considered for a vote on the Senate floor       Drought conditions reduced crop yields in Illinois in 2005   According to the USDA s National Agricultural Statistics Service  NASS   the value of Illinois  corn crop decreased by more than  1 1 billion  or about 25 percent  from 2004 to 2005 even as corn acreage increased   At least 10 counties in Northeast and Western Illinois sustained greater than 20 percent losses in corn yields   Soybean production was down 10 percent last year and valued  900 million less than 2004   In addition to these losses  there may be impacts on other crops and pasture as well       The  4 billion disaster relief package for farmers and ranchers was included in a emergency appropriations bill that provided funds for the war in Iraq and Katrina recovery efforts
