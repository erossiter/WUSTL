HEALTH GROUP STUDY SAYS BUSH ENZI BILL IS BAD MEDICINE FOR OVER 3 9 MILLION ILLINOISANS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Monday  May 8  2006        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  pointed to a study released today by one of the nation s foremost consumer health advocacy groups  Families USA  showing that a Republican health insurance plan could cost 3 9 million Illinoisans critical health insurance benefits that are currently guaranteed by state law       The study shows that small business health insurance legislation introduced by Senator Mike Enzi  R WY   S 1955  which is scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week  would have a negative impact on millions of health care consumers all across the nation by bypassing state mandated coverage for many important health needs          Far too many people cannot afford basic health insurance    46 million people nationwide and 1 8 million people in Illinois   Hundreds of thousands more are under insured     said Durbin   The Bush Enzi bill will strip millions of Americans  even those currently insured  of basic health protections like mammographies  diabetes supplies  many cancer screenings and emergency health services        Families USA supports legislation Durbin has introduced as an alternative to the Bush Enzi bill  Durbin   s bill  the Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP   will give small businesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans and expand access to health care coverage for their employees without attempting to dodge state benefit mandates       The Families USA study notes that the Enzi bill would supersede state law  effectively bypassing state mandated coverage for many important health needs and allow insurance companies to define benefits packages       In Illinois  this legislation would remove basic health care guarantees for 3 899 000 residents  including  cervical cancer screening  diabetic supplies education  mammography screening  ovarian cancer screening  bone density screening  alcoholism treatment  colorectal screening  contraceptives  dental anesthesia  emergency services  infertility treatment  minimum mastectomy stay  mental health care  general   mental health  parity   off label drug use  parental HIV testing  prescription inhalants  prostate cancer screening  and TMJ disorders       In contrast  under Durbin   s bill  SEHBP enrollees will be covered by state consumer protection laws  including all state mandated benefits   Durbin s measure would allow small businesses across America to band together for lower health care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading their risk over a large number of participants  Employers would qualify for an annual tax credit to partially offset contributions on behalf of low income employees       The SEHBP proposal is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   which has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees  including members of Congress and their staffs  a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years  SEHBP would give employees of small businesses access to a comparable range of private health plans       Contrary to popular belief  Durbin noted that most of the people in Illinois who don   t have insurance are not out of work    they work full time in small businesses struggling with double digit premium increases and who cannot afford insurance for their workers  Congress must bring prices down to help these small business owners provide their employees with health insurance  but it does not have to be done at the expense of health benefits  This bill uses the power of the marketplace solve the price problem and still retains full coverage no matter where you live       In addition to Families USA s support  Durbin s SEHBP proposal has been endorsed by an array of organizations including   the American Academy of Family Physicians  the American Medical Association  the American Osteopathic Association  the Consumers Union  the Federation of American Hospitals  the National Association of Community Health Centers  the National Association of Women Business Owners  the Small Business Majority  the American Diabetes Association  the American Cancer Society  the National Mental Health Association  the American Academy of Pediatrics  and the National Women  s Law Center       Durbin said he plans to offer his SEHBP proposal as an alternative to the Republican health insurance bill   Durbin has offered similar legislation in the past       Families USA is a national nonprofit  non partisan organization dedicated to the achievement of high quality  affordable health care for all Americans   For over 20 years  working at the national  state  and community levels  the group has earned a reputation as an effective voice for health care consumers
