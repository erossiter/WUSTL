BILL FOR MORE THAN  61 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO HELP ILLINOIS RESIDENTS HEAT THEIR HOMES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  March 8  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  hailed Senate passage of legislation which makes more than  61 million in additional funds available to help Illinois residents pay for heating bills through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    Under the bill passed late last night  these funds  which were set aside for use starting in October 2006  would be made available immediately to help residents pay for heating bills this winter          With heating bills up 41 percent in the Midwest this winter  many people face a terrible choice    heating or eating  In some cases  the situation is so dire that residents have been evicted because they can t afford to pay for rent  food and their heating bill   Durbin said      LIHEAP was created to assist our lowest income families and seniors  but Illinois LIHEAP officials tell us they have serious concerns that remaining funds will not be sufficient to cover Illinois residents who have applied for payments   This bill will make the money which is so desperately needed now available now          The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  is a federally funded program which provides heating and cooling assistance to almost 5 million low income households  including the working poor  those making the difficult transition from welfare to work  disabled persons  the elderly and families with young children   Assistance comes in the form of block grants to state programs that help eligible households pay for home energy costs       Illinois currently has less than  20 million in available funds remaining in its account  and Illinois LIHEAP officials say that will not be sufficient to cover the remaining eligible applications   Of the approximately 800 000 Illinoisans eligible  only 344 700 have applied for help from LIHEAP and 293 725 are receiving assistance   According to recent reports  12 states have now exhausted their funds for the regular winter heating season while several other states like Illinois are reporting that they are running dangerously low   Last month  Durbin joined Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the President urging him to release the  101 5 million remaining in the LIHEAP contingency fund          Experts tell us that the top two underlying reasons for homelessness in America are inability to pay for rent and inability to pay for utilities     said Durbin     The costs of not providing help to those on the brink of homelessness are far greater than the cost of adequately funding the LIHEAP program          In Illinois  requests for government help to pay heating bills were up over 40 percent in 2005   In Chicago  several offices are receiving dramatically more calls from people who cannot afford to pay their heating bills   Some offices report that seniors are forgoing purchasing their prescriptions or not buying food in order to attempt to pay the energy bill       Last year  LIHEAP allowed the states to help about 5 million people out of an estimated 32 million eligible for assistance nationwide   As part of the energy bill signed into law last summer  Congress authorized  5 1 billion annually for the program for fiscal years 2005  2006 and 2007   However  the final spending bill for fiscal 2006  which began in October  contained only  2 16 billion for the program despite attempts by Durbin and other Democrats to increase LIHEAP funding       The funding in the bill the Senate passed yesterday  S  2320  will now go to the House for consideration
