                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  August 2  2005   Four Lane Road Will Allow for Quicker Travel     EAST DUBUQUE  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Rep Don Manzullo today announced  8 2 million in federal funding for the enhancement and improvement of U S  20 between Freeport and Galena   The funding was secured through the TEA 3 bill recently passed by Congress          The project is designed to turn two lanes into four lanes  making travel easier from Rockford to Dubuque              Galena is one of Illinois    most popular tourist destinations   People drive from Wisconsin  Minnesota  Iowa and every corner of Illinois to enjoy the town     Durbin said      The hills of Galena are renowned in the Midwest  but the winding roads often make for slow road trips   The improvements to U S  20 will allow travelers to drive 55 or 60 miles per hour  so they can start enjoying their vacations    and spending their money    sooner             Securing this funding for U S  20 is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     said Obama     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges             This money is badly needed for safety reasons along the winding Route 20 and to boost economic development in the area     said Manzullo      I especially want to thank Senators Durbin and Obama for their leadership and teamwork in securing the money for this vital project  which is a priority for the people of northwest Illinois          The Illinois Department of Transportation is completing the preliminary engineering phase for the widening of U S  Route 20 from two to four lanes from Freeport to Galena  including the Freeport and Galena bypasses  The 50 mile widening project will spur economic development and create jobs throughout the region and improve safety along the winding corridor  which is traveled by more than one million visitors each year       The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21         Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level        Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families           It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois              This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
