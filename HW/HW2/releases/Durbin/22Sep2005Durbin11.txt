     DURBIN STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS

STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thursday  September 22  2005   Statement of Sen  Richard J  Durbin  Senate Judiciary Committee  Executive Business Meeting  September 22  2005   Nomination of John G  Roberts  Jr  to be  Chief Justice of the United States   Senator Durbin   Thank you  Mr  Chairman       Mr  Chairman  the greatest compliment one can pay a judge is not that he is smart  it is not that he has a great intelligence   The greatest compliment one can pay a judge is that he is wise and that in his work on the bench he has shown the wisdom of Solomon       In the Scriptures  Solomon was often described as the wisest man who ever lived  but in Chapter 3 of the first Book of Kings  we learn what Solomon wanted more than wisdom   It is written   In Gibeon  the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night  and God said   Ask what you wish me to give you    Then Solomon said   So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people  to discern between good and evil  for who is able to judge this great people of Yours         Many questions were asked of John Roberts   If there was any effort to determine whether or not he had a great legal mind and great intelligence  he certainly satisfied every questioner   But then if you look at the questions more carefully and more closely  you will find that we were asking more fundamental questions of John Roberts   We were trying to determine whether or not he has wisdom  whether or not he has an understanding heart       Some have argued that it is unfair to raise this question   Senator Graham  a friend of mine  said it is not fair to get into this whole question of what is in your heart       In 1991  at his confirmation hearing  Justice Souter said   Some human life is going to be changed in some way by what we do  whether we do it as trial judges or as appellate judges  as far removed from the trial arena as it may possibly be   The second lesson I learned in that time is that if indeed we are going to be trial judges whose rulings will affect the lives of other people and who are going to change their lives by what we do  we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and our beings to get these rulings right        Justice Breyer in 1994 said   That is why I always think that law requires both a heart and a head   If you do not have a heart  it becomes a sterile set of rules   Removed from human problems  it will not help   If you do not have a head  there is a risk that in trying to decide a particular person s problem in a case that may look fine for that person  you cause trouble for a lot of other people  making their lives yet worse    So it is a question of balance       I asked John Roberts whether he could meet the test that Paul Simon brought before this Committee years ago in questioning nominees   Is he personally committed to expanding the freedom in America or restricting it   And I asked him whether he had the courage of Frank Johnson  an Alabama Federal judge who was condemned as a judicial activist  Judge Frank Johnson  the courage to stand up for civil rights   And what did we learn       There was an interesting exchange involving Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein about the rights of a family at the last moment of life of someone that they loved   Senator Biden asked John Roberts to speak not as a lawyer  not as a judge  but as a father   How would he approach the end of life of a family member who left express instructions not to be kept alive with a feeding tube   Sadly  Judge Roberts gave us a styptic response  suggesting he had no opinion on how one should face a real life challenge thousands of Americans will face every day       I asked Judge Roberts as a private attorney when he took the case before the Supreme Court of Rush Prudential HMO v  Moran  where he advocated a position which  if it had prevailed  would have denied millions of Americans health insurance  whether he had any reservations about making that argument  and he said that he did not       I went to the pro bono cases  which Judge Roberts pointed to with pride  where he stood and spoke for the powerless in the District of Columbia  for welfare mothers trying to assert their rights  where he spoke on behalf of those who are gay and lesbian who were fearful they would be discriminated against by a law in Colorado  and where John Roberts stood with them in fighting for their rights  I asked him   Would you have taken the other side in that case    And he said   Yes    He said he would take the first client who walked in the room       That was unfortunate   It was unfortunate that John Roberts was so cautious  so guarded  so mindful of his political vulnerability that he was careful not to express the most basic human emotions  careful not to say that there was any bright line where he would refuse to use his legal skills for some legal end   And there were important questions we all asked about civil rights  about workers  rights  about women s rights  about the right to privacy  about protecting the environment       Why did we ask those questions and why was it important to get some indication of his values   It has been stated over and over   He will be Chief Justice for the rest of my natural life   When he is confirmed  this will be the Roberts Court   And we know that this Court has changed dramatically       Senator Schumer alluded to the fact that now this Court is so evenly divided that one Justice can make a significant difference   In the past 10 years  193 cases have been decided by a 5 4 margin   Many of our core rights  our personal freedoms  and our liberties hang in the balance of one vote on the Supreme Court  rights to reproductive freedom  remedies to discrimination victims  and the rights of workers and consumers   That is why this decision is so critical       At the beginning of this process  Senator Thompson and Judge Roberts were kind enough to come by my office  and I had a chance to get to know him   I like John Roberts   I looked at his wife and I saw his children  and I saw a man that I knew that I could like   There was never any question about it   I had voted against him for the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals   I did not like the political gambit that kept those vacancies on the D C  Circuit Court during the Clinton administration   Perhaps my rhetoric was too strong about Judge Roberts because of my feelings on that political issue   But I lamented at the time that he just did not tell us much about what he believed       I promised John Roberts in this process I would give him a clean slate   I did   But at the end of the process  sadly  it was largely an empty slate       Next to a vote on whether America goes to war  the most important votes we can cast as Senators are for Justices on the Supreme Court   That Court is the single most important institution when it comes to America s rights and liberties   The decisions made by those nine Justices can change the face of democracy in America and the lives of American people far more than any law that we pass in Congress  and the vote for a Chief Justice is even more significant       I sincerely wish that I believed that John Roberts was the right person for this historic appointment   I will vote no  and I will pray that John Roberts will prove as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States that he has not only a great legal mind but also an understanding heart
