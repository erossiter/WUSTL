Approves  3 Million for Troops to Nurse Teachers Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  October 4  2007       With both the military and civilian sectors unable to increase the nursing supply unless nursing schools are able to increase student capacity  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  led a bi partisan effort to adopt a pilot program aimed at encouraging nurses retiring from the military to become nurse educators  Three million dollars for the Troops to Nurse Teachers program was approved as part of the 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill that was passed by the Senate late last night  The legislation was cosponsored by Senator Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Even as America is experiencing an acute shortage of nurses  qualified students who wish to dedicate their future to nursing are being denied that opportunity  Durbin said  Nursing schools last year turned away 40 000 qualified applicants  including 2 000 in Illinois  because they dont have enough teachers on staff  Unless we address this lack of faculty  the shortage of nurses will only worsen  Durbins Troops to Nurse Teachers proposal seeks to increase the number of nurse faculty members so nursing schools can expand enrollment and alleviate the ongoing shortage  both in the civilian and military sectors  Additionally  it is meant to help military personnel make successful transitions to second careers in teaching  Nurse Corps leaders in the Army  Navy and Air Force have pointed to a serious shortage of military nurses  at least a 10 percent shortage across the board and nearly 40 percent in some critical specialties  Civilian hospitals face similar challenges  72 percent of hospitals experienced a shortage in 2004  Nurses who have spent time in the military can help fill a critical gap that hurts both military and civilian health care facilities  Their service to our country will go beyond their work in military hospitals and include our classrooms and lecture halls  Durbin said  The Troops to Nurse Teachers program will provide transitional assistance for service members who have served at least 20 years and are already qualified to teach  Eligible service members will receive career placement assistance  transitional stipends  and educational training from accredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition  The Troops to Nurse Teachers proposal will also establish a scholarship program that will provide financial assistance for attendance at an accredited school of nursing to members of the Armed Forces  who have served at least 20 years on active duty  are eligible for retirement and intend on becoming nurse faculty  Tuition  stipends  and financing for other educational expenses will also be provided  Recipients must also undertake activities deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Defense to encourage current and prospective nurses to pursue a career in the Nurse Corps  With a projected shortfall of one million nurses by 2020  Durbin said a program like the Troops to Nurse Teachers offers an innovative solution that will help place more qualified nurses in faculty positions  which will in turn  increase the pool of trained nurses sought by civilian and military facilities  The military faces the same difficulty in recruitment and retention of nurses as civilian medical facilities  If we are going to address the nursing shortage over the long term  and ensure that Americans have the quality nursing care they deserve  we must increase the number nursing faculty members  he added  Finally  the Troops to Nurse Teachers program will provide nurse officers in the Armed Forces with a graduate degree in nursing an opportunity to serve a two year tour of duty as faculty member at a school of nursing  In exchange  the school agrees to provide scholarships for nursing students who agree to serve as a nurse officer in the military after graduation  Last year  Durbin introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization to address the nursing shortage that was modeled after the Troops to Teachers program  The Troops to Teachers program  created in 1994  operates in 30 states and has supplied more than 8 000 new educators since the programs inception  The amendment passed by voice vote on June 15  2006  Unfortunately  the amendment was dropped in conference  This year  Durbins Troops to Nurse Teachers program was again included in the 2008 Department of Defense Authorization bill which passed earlier this week  Durbins proposal is endorsed by the American Nurses Association  American Association of Colleges of Nursing  American Organization of Nurse Executives  American Health Care Association  and the National League of Nursing  It is also supported by the Nurse Corps at the Air Force  Army and Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense


