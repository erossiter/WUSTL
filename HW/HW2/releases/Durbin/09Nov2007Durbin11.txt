Obama Ask Licensing Board To Confirm Illinois Doctor s Role In Massachusetts Deaths                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Friday  November 9  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   Responding to the recent announcement that Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who is being investigated in connection with a string of deaths at a VA hospital in Marion  IL  has resigned his right to renew his medical license in Massachusetts  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to confirm the doctors role in seven cases under investigation in Massachusetts  two of which ended in deaths  Unfortunately  the most recent news reports confirm our suspicions  information sharing is not happening in a way that protects our veterans  said Durbin  It now appears that Dr  Veizaga Mendez was not only involved in ten patient deaths in Illinois  but he may have also botched several cases in Massachusetts that resulted in patients deaths  Every new piece of information in this investigation paints an increasingly frightening picture of what happened  We must get to the bottom of what happened with the hiring process of Dr  Veizaga Mendez and how he was able to practice in Marion  said Obama  The veterans and their families affected by the Marion tragedy deserve to know the facts  We will continue to press the VA for answers to make sure situations like this one wont happen at other VA facilities  In today s letter  Durbin and Obama wrote Recent media reports indicated that an investigation into Dr  Veizaga Mendez s tenure in Massachusetts reveals that he was being investigated for botching seven cases  two of which ended in deaths  Is that press report accurate  Please describe the circumstances associated with these cases and subsequent investigations into these cases  Senators Durbin and Obama have been actively engaged in this issue since the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the Marion VA Medical Center on August 31 due to an unusual increase in deaths  Several times  they have called on the former Secretary of Veterans  Jim Nicholson and the current Acting VA Secretary  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  Durbin and Obama also sent a letter last month to the Secretary of the IDFPR  Dean Martinez expressing their concerns with Dr  Veizaga Mendez practicing in the state of Illinois  They asked to be informed of the status of Dr  Veizaga Mendezs license to practice medicine in Illinois and the steps that IDFPR plans to take to ensure that no further Illinois patients are endangered pending the outcome of the IDFPRs investigation of Dr  Veizaga Mendez  On October 17  the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation  IDFPR  decided to suspend the license of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who is being investigated in connection with a string of deaths at a VA hospital in Marion  IL  Text of the letter appears below  November 9  2007 Nancy Achin Audesse  Executive Director  Commonwealth of Massachusetts  Board of Registration in Medicine  560 Harrison Avenue  Suite G 4  Boston  MA 02118 Dear Ms  Achin Audesse  We understand that Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez has resigned his right to renew his medical license in Massachusetts  which will permanently bar him from practicing medicine in the state  In light of recent revelations about Dr  Veizaga Mendezs qualifications and record  we have become increasingly concerned not only by his employment tenure in Marion but the information sharing process in the Veterans Healthcare system  The information we have indicates that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had a history of malpractice allegations and reports of incompetent performance in Massachusetts  We hope to better understand what information was provided by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to the Marion VA regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez  To that end  we respectfully request answers to the following questions  1  Recent media reports indicated that an investigation into Dr  Veizaga Mendez s tenure in Massachusetts reveals that he was being investigated for botching seven cases  two of which ended in deaths  Is that press report accurate  Please describe the circumstances associated with these cases and subsequent investigations into these cases  2  At what point did the investigation into Dr  Veizaga Mendez s work in Massachusetts begin  Were officials at the Marion VA or at the Illinois Medical Licensing Board notified that a serious investigation into Dr  Veizaga Mendez s practice was on going  If no authorities in Illinois or elsewhere were advised of this investigation  why not  We would appreciate a reply to these inquiries by November 26  2007  Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator Barack Obama  United States Senator


