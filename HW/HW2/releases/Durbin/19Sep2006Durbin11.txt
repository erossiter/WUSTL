GUARDIAN AWARD FOR WORK COMBATING SUBSTANCE ABUSE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Tuesday  September 19  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   who serves on the Senate Anti Meth Caucus  today received the Guardian Award from the Partnership for a Drug Free America to recognize his work in combating substance abuse   The award was presented by Steve Pasierb  president   CEO of the Partnership and Dr  Michael Maves  executive vice president   CEO of the American Medical Association at an awards ceremony held in the U S  Capitol today        I am honored to receive this award and will continue to work with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help combat drug abuse     said Durbin      Methamphetamine abuse has been a big challenge for the state of Illinois and is often cited as the number one challenge facing law enforcement officials in Illinois   We need to help them meet this challenge by increasing public awareness of this drug   s dangers   Education plays a critical role in combating meth           Durbin has successfully secured funds for local meth awareness campaigns in Illinois   This March  he announced  180 000 in federal funding for the Illinois Sheriff   s Association to help raise meth awareness   These funds were secured through the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program in the 2006 Justice Department spending bill   Durbin is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee       The number of meth labs seized by law enforcement authorities in Illinois has more than doubled between 2000 and 2005   from 403 labs to nearly 1 000   Since 1997  the quantity of methamphetamines seized annually by the Illinois State Police has increased more than tenfold       This spring  Durbin also helped pass legislation that funds training for state and local prosecutors and law enforcement agents to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine offenses   Durbin cosponsored the Combat Meth Act which was included as part of the PATRIOT Act and signed into law   The bill included funds set aside for prosecutors and law enforcement agents for rural communities          Durbin said that methamphetamine is the only drug for which rural areas in Illinois have higher rates of drug seizures and treatment admissions than urban areas   In fiscal year 2003  rural counties accounted for 79 percent of persons sentenced to prison for meth related offenses          Durbin recently worked with colleagues from both political parties to secure Senate approval for an amendment to allocate  99 million for meth    hot spots    The funding will help train state and local law enforcement officials dealing with meth related crimes  It will also provide money for personnel and equipment for enforcement  prosecution  and environmental clean up   Durbin also sought to restore  900 million in funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program   Illinois law enforcement agencies depend on Byrne funds to help support regional drug task forces  including efforts to tackle the meth problem   The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group pays almost half of its agents with funding from Byrne grants         In 2004  this regional task force was responsible for more than 27 percent of the State   s meth lab seizures  In a recent example of Byrne grant funding  Glen Carbon Police coordinated with the Illinois State Police Meth Task Force to discover the largest lab in the village   s history  In this incident  local authorities raided a meth lab that proved to be capable of producing up to 6 000 grams of finished methamphetamine       Durbin is currently working on legislation to help state and local prosecutors prevent  investigate and prosecute drug related offenses and gang crimes   Durbin   s bill  S 1322  promotes the recruitment and retention of highly qualified prosecutors and public defenders   The legislation establishes a student loan repayment program and would authorize  862 5 million in grants over the next five years to provide local and state prosecutors with essential tools to combat drugs  gangs  and violent crime            Pretending methamphetamine is a regional problem or one that only happens somewhere else is a grave mistake   Law enforcement is telling us they have a major problem on their hands in almost every county in the nation   It   s time for Congress to provide them with the resources they need           The Partnership for a Drug Free America exists to help reduce illicit drug use in America by encouraging people to live healthy  drug free lives and by reaching out to those whose lives have been changed forever by drug abuse  The Partnership is a non profit coalition of communications professionals from around the country whose expertise lies in the development and delivery of national drug education campaigns
