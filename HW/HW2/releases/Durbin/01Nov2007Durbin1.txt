Negotiation Improves ACR Program   Boosts Nutrition Funding by  1 Billion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thursday  November 1  2007     Washington  D C    An additional  1 billion will be devoted to boosting USDA nutrition assistance in the Senate version of the new farm bill  the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007  under an agreement concluded among Chairman Tom Harkin  D IA  and other members of the Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  The additional funding became available when the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimated additional cost savings from the Average Crop Revenue  ACR  program as details of an amendment by Senator Pat Roberts  R KS  were worked out  The Committee agreed last week to devote any surplus funds generated from the ACR related amendment to nutrition assistance  This week  it was determined that additional ten year budget savings under the modified ACR would be  1 092 billion  The ACR program included in the farm bill reported from the Committee closely reflect legislation authored by Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Sherrod Brown  D OH      The improved ACR program that was recently negotiated will save us an additional  1 billion while providing better protection for farmers by protecting revenue rather than merely price as the current system does  said Durbin  The proposal included in Chairman Harkin s bill is a significant step forward and it will help us make our support programs work better for both producers and taxpayers    The agreement we were able to work out among members of the Committee re invests these critical farm bill dollars in one of our nations most urgent needs  nutrition assistance to low income Americans  said Chairman Harkin  Throughout this farm bill process I have advocated for additional funding to improve our USDA food assistance  The ACR savings allow us to raise the food stamp asset limit and thus allow low income Americans to nutrition assistance before hitting rock  increase the minimum food stamp benefit  which is especially important to seniors  and also strengthen federal help to our nations food banks    During the deliberations in the Agriculture Committee over the Roberts amendment  my goal was to improve ACR and  if possible  expand nutrition programs  Todays compromise goes beyond my initial expectations  it will feed the hungry by providing more people with more benefits while improving the ACR option for farmers  said Brown  the first Ohio Senator in 40 years to serve on the Agriculture Committee  However  there is much work left to done to give farmers a real choice in farm programs  I will continue to work on behalf of Ohio farmers to strengthen the program as it moves to the floor of the Senate    The savings determined by CBO will not only strengthen nutrition  but also improve the ACR program by raising the fixed payment on base acres from 85 percent to 100 percent  The savings are from the reduced payment acres for the revenue portion and from the one time signup  i e   producers can enroll in either 2010  2011  or 2012  but once a producer signs up  the producer has to stay in the ACR through the end of the farm bill  Other savings occur because there is less participation in the direct and counter cyclical payments  and loan benefits  and from the 2 percentage point reduction in administrative and operating expenses for crop insurance    According to the agreement  the savings will be allocated as follows   Increase food stamp asset limit from  2000 to  3500 for most households  From  3000 to  4500 for households containing an elderly individual or an individual with a disability    Increase food stamp minimum benefit to 10 percent of the maximum benefit for a household of one  This matches the minimum benefit agreed to in the House passed farm bill  This would raise the minimum monthly benefit from  10 to  18 by 2012    Provide an additional  10 million annually for The Emergency Food Assistance Program  TEFAP  and food banks over the committee mark  This brings the annual increase for TEFAP to  110 million annually   The Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee Thursday  October 25th and is scheduled for floor consideration the week of November 5th  The funding changes agreed to will be incorporated into the bill through procedural  technical changes before floor consideration
