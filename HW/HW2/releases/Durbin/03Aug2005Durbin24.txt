ANNOUNCE  1 MILLION IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR NEAR WEST SUBURBS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Wednesday  August 3  2005    RIVER FOREST  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today announced  1 million in federal funding for transportation related projects in River Forest  Elmwood Park  Oak Park  North Lake  River Grove  Franklin Park and Stone Park   The funding is part of  215 million Durbin and Obama have secured for Illinois in the TEA 3 transportation bill recently passed in Congress        The funding I   ve secured will help extend the life of these critical roads in these communities     Durbin said      Each community has different needs   The money included in this bill tries to meet the specific need of each community   For instance  the families in Oak Park will benefit from an extended bike trail  while community members and businesses in North Lake will benefit from flood mitigation measures           I was pleased to work closely with State Senator Don Harmon to secure the federal funding   Senator Harmon is a good friend and a strong advocate for the communities he represents     Durbin said      When he requested the funding  I knew the communities would truly benefit from federal help           Securing funding for these communities is a result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     Obama said     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges           I   ve had very little luck securing appropriations for critical infrastructure improvements from state sources     Harmon said      With the state struggling to fulfill past commitments  securing new commitments is a challenge   With the transportation bill pending  it seemed an opportune moment to ask for federal assistance   There are still many critical projects we haven   t been able to fund and we are still exploring state funding sources        The communities will use the funding as follows  North Lake  flood control construction on Diversey Avenue  Oak Park  resurface Augusta Boulevard as part of an Illinois Bike Trail  River Grove  street scaping and restoration in their historic business district  Elmwood Park  street scaping on North Avenue  River Forest  reconstruction of Park Avenue from Division to North Avenue   Park Avenue is the eastern boundary of Dominican University  Stone Park  resurfacing and curb work for some of the most damaged streets  Franklin Park  construction of a left turn lane onto Belmont Avenue near the new North Central Metra Station     The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21      Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level     Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families        It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois           This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
