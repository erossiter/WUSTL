FUNDING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE POOL IN ILLINOIS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  July 13  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   along with 16 other senators from both political parties  sent a letter last night to the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee urging them to set aside funds for grants that will help states fund high risk pools   High risk pools provide health insurance options to individuals with medical conditions that make it impossible for them to qualify for health insurance coverage in the regular market          With 1 8 million people in Illinois  and millions more across the country who don   t have access to health insurance  we need to do everything possible to make sure that high risk pools receive the funding they need     said Durbin       The State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act  H R  4519  was signed into law in February  The law authorizes Congress to spend  75 million for each year  from 2007 2010  for this program  However  the program was unfunded in the President Bush   s FY2007 budget       Thirty three states  including Illinois  have established high risk pools which are funded through the Qualified High Risk Pools Grant Program   Durbin   s letter asks the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee leadership to provide the full  75 million that has been promised for the State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act         Text of letter is attached       June 19  2006      The Honorable Arlen Specter  Chairman      The Honorable Tom Harkin  Ranking Member      Senate Appropriations Subcommittee      Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor    Health   Human Services  Education and   Related Agencies      184 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  D C   20510      Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin       We are writing to express our strong support for grants to State high risk insurance pools as provided through the Qualified High Risk Pools Grant Program   Thirty three states have established these pools   The State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act  which passed in February  authorized  75 million for each fiscal year from 2007 through 2010 for this important program   We are requesting that the Subcommittee provide  75 million for the program in FY07  the same amount provided through mandatory spending last year       This program was originally established in the Trade Assistance Act of 2002 to provide federal seed and operational funding to states struggling to offer an affordable insurance option to their residents with a history of chronic or serious illness   Since then  high risk pools have become a critical safety net for more than 180 000 Americans with serious medical conditions who have been denied  or cannot afford  traditional insurance    Most beneficiaries of high risk pool funding are disabled or seriously ill  and are self employed  unemployed  or work for businesses that don t offer insurance         The premiums charged by high risk pools are  by the nature of the program  more expensive than premiums for healthy people in the traditional insurance market   This makes it difficult for chronically ill people to afford even this option of last resort   Unfortunately  high risk pools also face the same cost increases plaguing the general health insurance market  raising the specter that future premium increases may exceed many beneficiaries    ability to pay   These trends make federal funding for seed grants and operational funding ever more important       We urge you to include full funding for the state high risk pool grant programs in your FY07 Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies Appropriations legislation   Full funding for these programs will ensure the sickest Americans continue to have access to affordable health coverage       Sincerely
