 THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX WIN THE WORLD SERIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  October 27  2005   Say it is so  Joe       Eighty six years after the 1919 Black Sox scandal  and 88 years after they last beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series  the Chicago White Sox are bringing the World Series crown home to Chicago   Amazing   The ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson can finally rest in peace       Last night the White Sox completed their magical World Series quest with a 1 to nothing win to complete a four game sweep over the Houston Astros   White Sox fans in my home state of Illinois  and all around the world  are rejoicing  as White Sox nation will cherish this victory for decades to come       The White Sox won 11 out of 12 playoff games to earn the crown  but for those of us who watched every pitch  we know it wasn t easy   The Sox  in their typical win or die trying fashion  fought for every base hit  for every out  and for every win   Just like in the regular season  the White Sox took us on a roller coaster ride  and in the end  made it all that much more worthwhile for their fans       The season started out with a bang  as the White Sox sprinted out of April and kept up the pace through July  climbing to a 15 game lead in the American League Central Division   But as happens in any sport  the White Sox encountered their share of bumps and bruises       The White Sox lead dwindled as the Cleveland Indians got hot   By the time the Indians came to Chicago in late September  most pundits agreed it was all over for the Sox    They don t have enough relief pitching   they said    They don t have enough power in the lineup    Disappointment was inevitable  they said       But don t tell the White Sox or their fans what is inevitable    because this season  players made plays and didn t listen to the  experts   or believe in curses  or succumb to pressure       In a key late season game with the Indians  Sox third basemen Joe Crede    one of the many Sox players who battled through injuries this season    finished off a two home run night with a dramatic 10th inning blast  sending the Sox faithful into a frenzy       Crede was mobbed at home plate by his teammates  as the crucial playoff type victory gave the Sox and their fans a sense that this was the season to believe  The Sox finally silenced the pundits and finished off the season with a 5 game winning streak       Their winning streak continued into the playoffs   First  they swept the defending World Series Champion Boston Red Sox       Next up were the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim   The White Sox rode clutch hitting and stellar starting pitching to clinch the American League Pennant for the first time since 1959   White Sox fever was starting to overtake all of the city of Chicago  as even the lights at the Cubs own Wrigley Field read   Go Sox        The Sox took us on another roller coaster ride in the World Series   The Astros were a great team  and they made the White Sox earn every victory   Game 1 showcased Chicago s oft maligned bullpen  as Neil Cotts and Bobby Jenks pitched the White Sox out of a late game jam       Game 2  played in a bitter cold  hard driving rain in Chicago  is one of the most memorable in World Series history   After riding a grand slam from slugger Paul Konerko to a two run lead  the Sox withstood a furious Astros rally  and it appeared as though the game was going into extra innings    Despite bone chilling weather  the faithful fans stayed late into the night   They were rewarded with an astonishing sight   a walk off home run from Scott Podsednik  who had hit no home runs during the regular season  but in a freezing rain  lifted the ball into the right field bleachers  sending Sox fans into delirium       Game 3   a back and forth  see saw struggle in which the White Sox relievers continually got themselves out of trouble   ended with the impossible happening     again   In the 14th inning of the longest game in World Series history  little used reserve utility player Geoff Blum lined a shot down the right field line into the bleachers and into baseball lore   The White Sox withstood yet another Astros  threat in the bottom of the 14th inning to claim a 3 0 series lead       Last night s dramatic  series clinching victory  won with the help of shortstop Juan Uribe s outstanding glove work in the 9th inning  answered the prayers of generations of White Sox fans   For the first time in 88 years  White Sox fans could say something that hadn t been said in most people s lifetimes    The Chicago White Sox are World Champions        How did they do it   Sox General Manager Kenny Williams put it best last night    Everybody was looking for big theories from us  to explain the team s success    All we ve got are 25 hard working  grind it out guys        In closing  I would like to congratulate the Chicago White Sox players  manager Ozzie Guillen  pitching coach Don Cooper  and a cadre of former White Sox stars turned coaches such as Tim Raines  Greg Walker  Harold Baines  and Joey Cora  General Manager Kenny Williams  himself a former Sox player who made key moves not only in the offseason  but during the season  such as adding closer Bobby Jenks and Game 3 hero Geoff Blum to the roster  owners and my friends Eddie Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf  and everyone in the White Sox organization on a richly deserved World Series victory   In addition  as players themselves last night mentioned  this World Series was not only for them  but for past White Sox icons such as Bill Veeck and stars Luke Appling  Luis Aparicio  Billy Pierce  Nellie Fox  Minnie Minoso  and Carlton Fisk who never got a chance to experience a World Series championship       The Sox organization has made the citizens of Chicago and the State proud in bringing home the World Series crown   And to those generations of White Sox fans who have stayed faithful to their team  even in the darkest of days  I say rejoice   The Chicago White Sox are World Champions
