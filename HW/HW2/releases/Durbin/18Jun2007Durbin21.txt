18  2007       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  was joined today by more than a third of the U S  Senate in sending a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin  D IA  and Ranking Member Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA  urging them to strengthen federal anti hunger and nutrition initiatives  particularly the Food Stamp Program  in the upcoming reauthorization of the Farm Bill  Durbin was able to secure the signatures of 34 other senators on the letter he sent today  It is unacceptable that in the wealthiest nation  37 million people live in poverty  nearly 1 5 million in Illinois  said Durbin  a co chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus  These Americans are often undernourished or go without a real meal for days  The Food Stamp Program provides a safety net for working families who struggle to meet their most basic needs  By helping them put food on the table  people of all ages are able to lead healthier and more productive lives  The letter urges the committee to consider strengthening the upcoming Farm Bill in three specific ways benefit levels should be adjusted because they are currently insufficient for families to obtain an adequate diet the cap on child care costs that eligible households can deduct from their income education should be eliminated entirely  or at least raised  asset limits should be raised and tax preferred retirements and educational savings should be excluded completely    In addition  the letter stresses the need to reduce unnecessary paperwork  streamline eligibility rules and invest in outreach and enrollment efforts  In a letter sent to the Senate and House Agriculture Committees on May 24  2007  Durbin and members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation noted the impact of the Food Stamp Program in Illinois  The Food Stamp Program is an essential part of the safety net for individuals struggling to meet their most basic needs      The program is critical to Illinois  where more than 1 2 million people rely on food stamps every month  In 2006  the program generated more than  1 5 billion into the states economy  benefiting farmers  grocers  small businesses  and communities throughout our state  Other signatories to today s letter include  Senators Daniel Akaka  D HI   Joseph Biden  D DE   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Maria Cantwell  D WA   Ben

the letter appears below      June 18  2007  The Honorable Tom Harkin The Honorable Saxby Chambliss Chairman Ranking Republican Member Committee on Agriculture Committee on Agriculture U S  Senate U S  Senate Washington  D C  20510 Washington  D C  20510   Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss  As the Senate Agriculture Committee prepares to reauthorize the Farm Bill  we write urging you to strengthen federal anti hunger and nutrition initiatives  particularly the Food Stamp Program  We recognize that the current state of the federal budget complicates efforts to improve food assistance and other programs authorized in the Farm Bill  However  we believe that the economic challenges facing low income Americans  together with pressing unmet needs in the Food Stamp Program  compel the Congress to make much needed improvements  By a number of measures  the current economic expansion has been disappointing for low income families  Overall poverty remains relatively high  with the number of Americans living in poverty increasing by over 5 million people between 2000 and 2005  A total of 37 million individuals  including nearly 13 million children  are currently living in poverty in this country  Real wages for low wage workers have been largely stagnant  and the expenses that many low income households face  such as for rent and gasoline  have increased  The number of Americans experiencing food insecurity  as measured by the U S  Department of Agriculture  increased from 31 million individuals in 1999 to more than 35 million individuals in 2005  As a result of these and other factors  the number of Americans receiving food stamps has gone up  As the number of households participating in the Food Stamp Program has increased  there are several areas within the Food Stamp Program that we urge you to consider strengthening in the upcoming Farm Bill  Benefit Erosion  Food stamp benefits for most participating families are eroding over time  Current food stamp benefits average a mere  1 per person per meal  and the minimum monthly benefit is stuck at the thirty year old level of  10  These levels are insufficient for families to obtain an adequate diet    Child Care Costs  For purposes of income and benefit calculation  current Food Stamp Program rules allow eligible families to deduct up to  175 of the cost of child care each month  This deduction covers slightly more than one quarter of the average cost of child care in the United States  This deduction amount has been adjusted only marginally since it was established and is not currently indexed for inflation  The cap on the child care costs that eligible households can deduct from their income calculation should be eliminated entirely  or at least raised     Asset Limits  As with child care costs  current asset limits in the Food Stamp Program have not kept pace with inflationary increases  If the 1977 asset limit of  1 750 was adjusted each year to keep pace with inflation  the asset limit in the Food Stamp Program today would be nearly  6 000  Instead  it has been raised by only  250 to a meager  2 000  The asset limit should be raised and tax preferred retirements and educational savings should be excluded completely     In addition  far too many people in our communities need food stamps but cannot receive them  Changes to current eligibility restrictions are needed to include legal immigrant adults and unemployed childless adults  Moreover  nearly half of all currently eligible people are missing benefits  often due to a lack of information or red tape barriers  Congress should continue efforts started in the 2002 Farm Bill to reduce unnecessary paperwork  streamline eligibility rules  and invest in outreach and enrollment efforts  We understand that you must meet a number of priorities in the Farm Bill  However  securing an adequate diet to meet the basic needs of all Americans should be a top priority  We urge the Committee to strengthen the Food Stamp Program and other federal anti hunger and nutrition initiatives in the Farm Bill  and we look forward to working with you on these important issues  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin U S  Senator
