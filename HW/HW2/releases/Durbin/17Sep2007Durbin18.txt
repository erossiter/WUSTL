September 17  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to FDA urging them to look into contaminated fish found in Thailand  Vietnam and Indonesia  On June 28th  FDA issued an import alert banning five species of fish imported from China  While recent news reports highlight the presence of similar contaminants found in fish imported from Thailand  Vietnam and Indonesia  the FDA has not pursued similar regulatory actions for these countries  The text of the letter appears below  September 17  2007 Andrew C  von Eschenbach  M D   Commissioner  U S  Food and Drug Administration  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  Maryland 20857 Dear Dr  von Eschenbach  I am writing in response to a newspaper story that appeared in The Chicago Tribune on September 16  2007  that questions the effectiveness of the Food and Drug Administrations  FDA  recent actions to protect consumers from contaminated seafood imports  The article raises the point that although imported seafood products from Indonesia  Vietnam  Thailand  and China have all been found to contain unapproved antimicrobials  the FDA has only taken steps to detain and require testing for shipments of seafood imported from China  On June 28  2007  the FDA issued an import alert to detain and require the testing of farm raised seafood from China due to the presence of the antimicrobials nitrofuran  malachite green  gentian violent  and fluroquinolone  Under this import alert  shipments are stopped at points of entry until at least five consecutive shipments have been accepted by FDA based on third party laboratory analysis and documentation has been provided that shows that the seafood was processed in compliance with FDAs Seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point  HACCP  regulations and Chinese government requirements for exporting seafood to the United States  It appears that this import alert was issued following a period of testing and investigation that included targeted sampling  site visits to China  and the issuance of interim alerts  According to documents on the FDA website  this investigative process revealed that Chinas residue control program was ineffective and that inspections repeatedly found residues of unapproved substances in seafood imported from China  During the same period of time  FDA inspections of seafood from Thailand  Vietnam  and Indonesia were finding residues of similar contaminants and other major seafood importing countries were taking steps to prevent these contaminated imports from entering their countries  However  unlike the June 28  2007  import alert for Chinese seafood  FDA has not pursued similar regulatory actions for imports from Thailand  Vietnam  and Indonesia   In order to better understand the reasons for this discrepancy  I ask that you answer the following questions  1  What were the methodologies and results of the targeted sampling of Chinese seafood products from October 2006 to May 2007  2  Over the last 18 months  how many import alerts has the FDA issued for seafood imports from China  Thailand  Vietnam  and Indonesia  3  Over the last 18 months  how many shipments of seafood products from China  Thailand  Vietnam  and Indonesia have been refused by FDA  4  With regard to this investigation  how did FDA use information from the Prior Notice System to target sampling and inspections  5  What percentage of shipments of seafood from China  Indonesia  Thailand  and Vietnam are inspected by FDA  6  What are the major differences in the regulatory systems  residue management standards  and export controls in place in China  Indonesia  Thailand  and Vietnam  Is FDA pursuing efforts to harmonize residue standards with these countries  7  What percentage of shipments of seafood from China  Indonesia  Thailand  and Vietnam are inspected by the regulatory agencies of Japan and the European Union  8  What steps has FDA taken to engage the governments of China  Indonesia  Thailand  and Vietnam in order to improve the quality of their seafood exports  Thank you for your attention to this matter  I ask that you provide a response within 20 days  If you have any questions  please contact my staff  Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
