NEW FEDERAL PROGRAM TO SUPPORT MATH SCIENCE EDUCATION AND HELP U S  COMPETE GLOBALLY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Tuesday  January 3  2006    SCHAUMBURG  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  visited Roosevelt University today to discuss recent progress in his efforts to attract more students to the fields of math  science and technology   Durbin announced a new grant program for college students who are studying math  science or a critical foreign language   The SMART Grants  Science and Math Access to Retain Talent  program was included in the Higher Education Act passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in late December and builds on two different bills that Durbin worked on this year  one with Senator Ted Kennedy  D MA  and another with Senator John Warner  R VA    The Higher Education Act is included in the budget reconciliation package  which will be completed when the Congress reconvenes later this month       SMART Grants  which is authorized at  3 75 billion over 5 years  will provide direct subsidies to students who are eligible for Pell Grants and who are in good academic standing  as long as they are majoring in math  science  technology  engineering or a critical foreign language          Smart  eager students are one of the most abundant  valuable resources we have in this country   Many come from low and middle income families   Investing in those students will pay dividends for our country   s future   The SMART Grants program is designed to make it easier for them to take on the challenges of a technical academic program          Durbin also discussed his plans to continue pushing for legislation that will help maintain a solid base of math and science teachers at the K 12 level  so students are given the proper resources and consistently encouraged to excel in those areas          Science and technology are the engines of economic growth   Our economic future depends on the next generation of workers and their ability not just to keep up  but to innovate     said Durbin       The U S  graduates some of the world   s best engineers  scientists and mathematicians   But China  India  South Korea and Japan are educating a far higher proportion of their people in technologies  sciences and math   Since 1975  about a third of U S  undergraduate degrees have been in engineering or a hard or social science   In China  59  of undergraduate degrees are in the sciences   In South Korea  almost half of the college degrees are in a science or engineering          The need to strengthen our education pipeline in science and technology is well documented   I   ve introduced legislation in every Congress since 2001 that would make it easier for students to study math and science   Change is incremental  but we are making a difference          Durbin will continue to push for a series of legislative proposals designed to help recruit the best possible teachers  prepare those teachers to teach well and support those teachers throughout their careers so they stay in the classroom          When it comes to providing a high quality education  individualized attention from well qualified teachers cannot be underestimated   Small  focused  successful classrooms require a steady supply of good teachers     said Durbin      We need to take action now to recruit and retain the best possible teachers          According to the National Education Association  a historic turnover is taking place in the teaching profession  While student enrollments are rising rapidly  more than a million veteran teachers are nearing retirement   Experts predict that overall the U S  will need more than 2 million new teachers in the next decade       This teacher recruitment problem is most challenging in high need subject areas such as math  science  key foreign languages and special education   At the same time  almost a third of our new teachers leave the profession after only three years and about half exit after five years       Durbin will continue working to pass the following legislative proposals to address these challenges      The Teacher Excellence for All Children Act establishes grants for undergraduate and graduate students who agree to serve as teachers in high need schools   It also allows teachers and principals to exclude from gross income up to  15 000 from their income taxes if they serve in high need schools or teach high need subjects   The Pathways for All Students to Succeed Act establishes literacy and mathematics programs to improve overall student performance in middle school and secondary school  by hiring literacy and math coaches  at least one such coach for every 20 teachers  to work with classroom teachers   It also provides funds to hire a sufficient number of academic counselors  at least one for every 150 students    The Quality Education for All Act increases the maximum student loan amount for math and science teachers to  23 000 each year   The Math and Science Incentive Act provides  10 000 in loan interest forgiveness for students who commit to teaching or working in science  technology  mathematics  or engineering for at least 5 years after graduation
