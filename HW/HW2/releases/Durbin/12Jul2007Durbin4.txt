for Immediate Reform of FDA Import Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  July 12  2007    WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation to strengthen the Food and Drug Administrations  FDA  ability to monitor and inspect goods that enter the United States from abroad by imposing a fee on companies and countries exporting food products to the United States  These fees would generate revenues for inspections of imported foods and food safety research  The legislation would also require foreign firms and governments to apply for certification with FDA  only those that met standards equivalent to those of the United States would be eligible   One of the biggest obstacles FDA faces in the struggle to ensure food safety is the lack of funding they need to get the job done right  said Durbin  While the volume of imports has nearly doubled over the last three years  the number of FDA inspectors has been steadily decreasing  Meanwhile  seventy six million Americans are getting sick each year from food borne illnesses  The system needs to be fixed immediately   Durbin noted that under the current system  any country and any company can export food products to the United States as long as they inform regulators of the shipment  There are currently no checks done to ensure that our trading partners have adequate regulatory systems  The FDA does not ensure that trading partners have equivalent standards or inspect overseas plants when problems arise  When the FDA needs to investigate an outbreak  it can be delayed by uncooperative foreign governments  During the recent pet food recall  U S  regulators were delayed three weeks in their request for visas to inspect Chinese facilities   Durbin added  If you want to sell in America  you have to meet American standards  His legislation would  Require FDA to collect user fees on imported food products  Revenues would be used for inspections of food imports and food safety research  While the bill would give the Administration the responsibility for determining the dollar amount of the fee  it would limit it to a maximum of  20 per line item  Require FDA to dedicate a portion of this funding for research on testing technologies and methods that would accurately detect the presence of pervasive contaminants such as E  Coli and listeria    Require FDA to establish an Imported Food Certification Program  Under this program  foreign governments and firms interested in exporting food products to the United States would be required to apply for certification  Entities would only be certified if they meet standards equivalent to those of the United States for food safety  inspection  labeling  and consumer protection and agree to allow regulators to inspect foreign facilities  Regulators would have the ability to pull certifications if companies or countries failed to comply and detain products if they failed to meet U S  standards    TIMELINE OF RECENT FOOD SAFETY ACTIONS  Two weeks ago  Sen  Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  sent a letter urging the FDA Commissioner  the Secretary of Agriculture  and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a food safety Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  between the U S  and China  An MOU is a legal document describing a bilateral agreement between parties  On June 1st  Durbin sent a letter to FDA Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach  asking for answers to recent reports that a number of domestic feed manufacturers announced voluntary recalls of their products which contain melamine  On May 10th  Durbin and DeLauro called for the U S  Trade Representative  Susan Schwab  to examine the U S  trade relationship with China in light of the questions being raised in connection with the pet food recall about Chinas poor sanitary conditions and lax food safety regulations  Two companies in China were identified as the source of the contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate in the pet food recall  In the letter  Durbin and DeLauro requested that Ambassador Schwab provide information about food safety standards included in current free trade agreements and other permanent trade relations  as well as what recourse is taken when imports threaten public health  On May 9th  Durbin and DeLauro met with FDA Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach  and Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong  of the Peoples Republic of China  to discuss the recent food safety problems  including several contaminated shipments of food products imported from China  During the meeting  Durbin also learned of a second importer of rice protein concentrate that had received shipments of contaminated product from China  According to Commissioner von Eschenbach  Cereal Byproducts located in Mt  Prospect  Illinois  had imported contaminated rice protein concentrate from Binzhou Futian in China  and issued a recall on May 4  2007 of all products it distributed  On May 2nd  the Senate passed  by a vote of 94 0 as part of the FDA Reauthorization bill  the amendment introduced by Durbin that will strengthen the nations food safety system  Durbins amendment establishes an early warning and notification system for human food  as well as pet food  establishes fines for companies that dont promptly report contaminated products  improves inspections monitoring of imports  and provides better  more uniform pet food safety standards  Durbins amendment passed  as part of the FDA Reauthorization bill  by a vote of 94 0   On May 1st  Durbin and DeLauro introduced a food safety bill in anticipation of the FDA Reauthorization bill  S 1082  coming to the floor  Durbin worked with Senators Kennedy and Enzi  and negotiated to offer a version of the bill as an amendment to the FDA reauthorization bill  On April 23  Durbin learned that a second  unnamed  company had imported rice protein from China  Durbin asked for full disclosure of the names of all companies involved  On April 18th  Durbin met with FDA Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach  At the meeting  Eschenbach told Durbin that his inspectors were having trouble acquiring visas to go inspect plants in China  Durbin wrote to the Chinese Embassy that day  asking that they expedite the process  The letter was sent on the 18th and the Chinese Embassy granted the visas on the 22nd  On April 12th  Durbin held a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing with FDA officials and industry experts to address problems in federal regulation of the pet food industry  Durbin called for the hearing on April 5th  as the wake of a widespread recall of contaminated pet food grew  On March 26th  shortly after the first pet food recall  Durbin wrote to FDA  asking them for an analysis of their oversight of pet food manufacturing facilities and a report of actions taken since the recent pet food recall  Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety  With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues
