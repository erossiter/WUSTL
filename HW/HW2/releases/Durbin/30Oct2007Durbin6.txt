                                                                                                                                                                                            Tuesday  October 30  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today hosted a meeting with representatives from the Illinois Corn Growers Association  ICGA   including ICGA President Steve Ruh of Sugar Grove  to discuss the 2007 Farm Bill  the Energy Bill and the Water Resources Development Act  Illinois farm land is among the most productive in the world  It is important that we work to pass a Farm Bill and ensure we have infrastructure to bring our agricultural products to market  said Durbin  Durbin also discussed the importance of the 2007 Farm Bill  Last week the Senate Agriculture Committee passed a version of the 2007 Farm Bill containing language that creates an optional revenue counter cyclical program designed to improve the safety net for farmers by replacing current price support programs with a comprehensive revenue protection program  The program  called Average Crop Revenue  ACR   is based in large part on legislation introduced by Senators Durbin and Brown in late July called the Farm Safety Net Improvement Act  The ACR was originally included in the Chairman s Mark of the 2007 Farm Bill  The program would have provided farmers with a state based revenue counter cyclical program to protect against losses in both yield and price  In lieu of direct payments  farmers opting into the program would be provided with a fixed payment of  15 per acre  The program also would have been integrated with farmers  crop insurance policies to reduce duplicative payments and provide producers with relief on the cost of crop insurance  During the Senate Agriculture Committee action  an amendment was accepted that weakened the original language by removing a provision that allowed farmers to reduce their crop insurance premiums  Although the average crop revenue program was weakened in committee  the inclusion of an optional revenue based counter cyclical program will help Illinois farmers  said Durbin  The proposal included in Chairman Harkin s bill will help us make our support programs work better for both producers and taxpayers  While I am disappointed that the Committee failed to include the whole ACR package  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the program provides producers with a real choice  At the meeting  Durbin updated the farm leaders about the Water Resource Development Act  WRDA  which includes lock and dam construction along the Mississippi River  Both chambers of Congress passed the legislation with veto proof majorities  381 40 in the House and 81 12 in the Senate  The bill was sent to the President under the threat of a veto  If no action is taken  WRDA will become law next week  The Mississippi River transports  12 billion worth of products every year  affecting agriculture  commercial  and labor interests across the state of Illinois  said Durbin  I joined senators from both parties to pass a bill that will create over 50 000 new jobs for our region  shorter shipping times  and improved business for Midwest producers along the River  A veto by this Administration will mean yet another delay for important projects in Illinois  With broad bipartisan support from both the House and the Senate  I fully expect that Congress will override that veto  The WRDA bill includes Congressional authorization for locks and dam modernization on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and authorizes specific projects for navigation  ecosystem restoration  and flood and storm damage reduction  A significant provision in the bill increases lock and dam capacity and improves the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  Congress generally authorizes Army Corps projects in WRDA bills every two years  but Congress has not enacted WRDA legislation since 2000  Finally  Durbin and the representatives from the ICGA discussed the ongoing negotiations taking place between Senate and House members in the Conference Committee on the Energy bill  The Senate bill includes appliance efficiency standards  an increase in corporate average fuel economy  CAFE  to 35 mpg by 2020 and an increase in the renewable fuel standard  RFS  to 36 billion gallons by 2022  The Senate RFS standard would save 1 4 million barrels of oil per day and reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the environment  It will also drive the market toward the next generation of biofuels    cellulosic ethanol that can be produced from any feedstock
