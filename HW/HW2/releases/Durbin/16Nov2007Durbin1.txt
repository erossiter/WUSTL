Durbin And Burr Introduce Medical Homes Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Friday  November 16  2007    Washington  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Richard Burr  R NC  today introduced The Medical Homes Act of 2007 to improve health care quality by helping states implement patient centered medical home programs under Medicaid and SCHIP  At a time when both health care costs and chronic illnesses are on the rise  we need a better way to provide care that is accessible  comprehensive  coordinated  continuous  and cost effective  said Durbin  The Medical Homes Act of 2007 would make federal funding available for states to provide care to our nations most vulnerable   low income children and families  The medical home model can reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare services for every child in America    For a long time I have supported efforts to help Americans have greater peace of mind about their health care  and that certainly includes families who participate in the Medicaid program  said Burr  In my home state  Community Care of North Carolina gives Medicaid patients a medical home to coordinate their health care needs  This one stop shop for medical care provides patients with the coordination to ensure they have complete care  The Medical Homes Act provides the start up funds to grow and expand successful programs like CCNC nationwide  Senator Durbin and I agree that health care can improve when patients have a medical home   The Patient Centered Medical Home Program would be created to assist Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries who are most likely to hop from provider to provider  without a continuous source of care  records and follow up  To participate  beneficiaries will be assigned a personal primary care provider as their source of first contact  That personal primary care provider  who has signed up to participate in the medical homes program  will go the extra mile in care by spending more time with the patient during visits  keeping close records of the patients personal health history  communicating with other health care providers when patients go elsewhere to seek care  following up with the patients with phone calls  making referrals to other health services as needed  and creating an ongoing relationship to provide first contact  continuous and comprehensive care  The Medical Homes Act of 2007 would also encourage local input in the delivery of healthcare  creating a local steering committee and a medical management committee  The model incorporates social services  public health  public hospitals  community health centers  and physicians to take responsibility for all of the patients health care needs or for appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals  Providers participating in the model will receive a per member per month care management fee to subsidize the extra costs associated with patient centered care  Medical homes would also increase the use of key health care staff  such as case managers  Case managers often arrange transportation  follow up with patients that visited the ED for non emergency care  send reminders about flu shots and check ups  and provide referrals to social services or public health department programs  In addition to improving care for patients  one of the primary goals of the medical home program is to increase cost effectiveness of health care  According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  4 million hospitalizations could be prevented and billions of dollars could be saved each year by improving the quality of primary care and getting more Americans to adopt healthy behaviorsboth key elements of the medical home model  Since instituting the medical home model  the state of North Carolina has seen savings of  224 million year since 1997  From July 1  2003  June 30  2004 the state spent  28 5 million on payments to networks and physicians and there was  124 million in savings  The medical home program also aims to improve communication among primary care providers  increase school attendance  decrease duplication of health care services provided  inappropriate emergency room utilization  and avoidable hospitalizations  Medical homes have been accepted by leaders of four primary care professional associations representing 330 000 doctors  the American Academy of Family Physicians  the American College of Physicians  Internal Medicine  the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Osteopathic Association
