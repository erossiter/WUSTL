     DURBIN CALLS ON TUNA INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS MERCURY LEVELS

TUNA INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS MERCURY LEVELS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  February 2  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today urged the U S  tuna industry to address concerns about mercury levels in canned tuna   In a letter sent to the CEOs of the three largest U S  canned tuna companies  Bumble Bee  Starkist and Chicken of the Sea  and the U S  Tuna Foundation  the Senator asked for a response to findings of high mercury levels in light tuna  which consumers have been told is safe  The studies show that the contamination has occurred largely because another species of fish known as yellowfin tuna has been packaged as  light tuna           Reports show that we are dangerously uninformed about potentially toxic levels of mercury present in fish we purchase at our local supermarkets     said Durbin      It is unacceptable  given the risks associated with mercury poisoning  that the FDA does not have a routine testing program for this   I am also concerned that the American public has been misinformed about the safety of eating canned light tuna   Without both a routine mercury testing program for all fish and a separate study on the packaging of light tuna  even individuals following the FDA   s seafood consumption guidelines may be ingesting unsafe quantifies of mercury          In the letter to the tuna industry  Durbin addressed current problems with the packaging of canned light tuna   Historically  tuna with lower levels of mercury  such as skipjack  is packaged as canned    light tuna  while tuna that contains higher levels of mercury  such as albacore and yellowfin  is sold as    gourmet tuna      Yellowfin tuna generally has three times the amount of mercury found in skipjack because it is a larger species of tuna that eats smaller fish   Recent reports indicate that the tuna industry has been packaging yellowfin tuna as canned    light    tuna instead of    gourmet    potentially misleading consumers about what is safe to consume       The FDA has a history of responding to fears raised by independent investigations with isolated periods of testing   However  there is currently no program that routinely tests for mercury levels at either ports or marketplaces       If fish is found to have more than 1 part per million of mercury  the FDA can issue a recall   In the early 1970s  the FDA  spurred on by media reports on the high levels of mercury found in canned light tuna  conducted tests and issued a recall of 12 million cans of tuna   Thereafter  the FDA declared tuna safe to eat again   No mercury testing occurred throughout the 1980s and only after the National Academies issued a critical report in 1991 did the FDA resume some testing for mercury   The FDA has not maintained the mercury testing program       Durbin said that the current system may not be sufficient to adequately safeguard public health    The American people count on the federal government to be their watchdog when it comes to protecting their health and the health of their families  We should not have to wait until children or families are poisoned before we act  and I will be working with the FDA to improve our efforts when it comes to mercury   said Durbin       Durbin said high risk groups such as young children  pregnant women and nursing mothers are most vulnerable to the effects of mercury   Mercury affects the central nervous system  and is more pronounced in the case of children and fetuses   Children who have had exposure to mercury may experience delays in walking and talking as well as decreased attention span and memory   Adults suffering from mercury exposure can experience headaches  fatigue  numbness in the hands and feet and a lack of concentration       Text of the letter appears below        The following letter was sent to the CEOs of the three largest U S  canned tuna companies  Bumble Bee  Starkist and Chicken of the Sea  and the U S  Tuna Foundation     The Chicago Tribune recently reported in a series on mercury in seafood that it is not uncommon in the tuna industry to include yellowfin tuna in canned light tuna   Since yellowfin tuna contains higher levels of mercury than the skipjack tuna that has historically been used for canned light tuna  including yellowfin in the product would be troubling to consumers   They might be unknowingly ingesting unsafe quantifies of mercury even if they are following the Food and Drug Administration   s seafood consumption guidelines       The Tribune acknowledged what appears to be a contradiction within the industry regarding the alleged practice   John Stiker  a former Bumble Bee executive and industry spokesman who was contacted by the Tribune for comment on the articles  claimed that it was common practice to include in canned light tuna excess yellowfin tuna that cannot be sold as gourmet tuna   However  in a follow up article  the U S  Tuna Foundation denied the practice and disagreed with Stiker  who has since left the tuna industry       In light of the uncertainty regarding this important matter  please clarify whether or not your company currently includes or in the past has included yellowfin tuna in your canned light tuna   If it does or has done so  what percentage of the product  on average  has been yellowfin tuna at times when yellowfin tuna has been present in the product       I appreciate your prompt response to these questions       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator
