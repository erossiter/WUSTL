Wednesday  November 14  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   who serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  today discussed Illinois priorities in a meeting with Ed Schafer  nominee for Secretary of the Department of Agriculture  In today s meeting  I spoke at length with Mr  Schafer about the needs of Illinois farmers  including a better safety net and improved access to high speed internet in rural areas  said Durbin  If he is confirmed  I look forward to working with Mr  Schafer and the USDA on future Illinois priorities  In today s meeting  Durbin discussed the importance of the 2007 Farm Bill now being debated on the Senate floor  The current version of the farm bill already includes a proposal introduced by Senators Durbin and Brown to improve the safety net for farmers by replacing current price support programs with an optional revenue protection program  called the Average Crop Revenue  ACR  program  The ACR was originally included in the Chairman s Mark of the 2007 Farm Bill  In its initial version  the program would have provided farmers with a state based revenue counter cyclical program to protect against losses in both yield and price  In lieu of direct payments  farmers opting into the program would be provided with a fixed payment of  15 per acre  The program also would have been integrated with farmers  crop insurance policies to reduce duplicative payments and provide producers with relief on the cost of crop insurance  During the Senate Agriculture Committee action  an amendment was accepted that weakened the original language by removing a provision that allowed farmers to reduce their crop insurance premiums  Although the average crop revenue program was weakened in committee  the inclusion of an optional revenue based counter cyclical program will help Illinois farmers  said Durbin  The proposal included in the current Farm Bill will help us make our support programs work better for both producers and taxpayers  While I am disappointed that the Committee failed to include the whole ACR package  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the program provides producers with a real choice  At the meeting  Durbin also noted the importance of broadband as a critical component to both community and economic development  The current version of the farm bill includes Durbin s proposal to help make rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service more readily available  especially in rural areas  Durbin s initiative will create a matching grant program to be administered through the Department of Commerce to assist statewide or regional public private partnerships increase broadband access  map resources and build demand  It will encourage investment  create jobs  improve productivity  foster innovation  and increase consumer benefits in every corner of our nation  The importance of high speed internet access cannot be overstated  Durbin said  Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality  When I travel in downstate Illinois  people tell me there is no broadband service available to them right now  This bill will help to change that  Ed Schafer served as Governor of North Dakota from 1992 to 2000  Born and raised in Bismarck  North Dakota  he received a bachelors degree from the University of North Dakota and an M B A  from the University of Denver  He is married and has two children  Tom Schafer and Ellie Schafer  and two stepchildren  Eric Jones and Kari Jones
