CARE PLAN FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE DEMOCRATIC CENTERPIECE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tuesday  March 7  2006          U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today was joined by fellow Senate Democrats in introducing legislation to give small businesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans and expand access to health care coverage for their employees    Durbin said that his bill  the Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP   will be offered as an alternative to the Republican health insurance bill scheduled for consideration in the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee on Wednesday   Durbin has offered similar legislation in the past       As the lead sponsor of the bill  Durbin said     There are 1 8 million people in Illinois with no health insurance and thousands more who are under insured   Contrary to popular belief  most of the people in Illinois who don   t have insurance are not out of work    in fact  they work full time in small businesses that cannot afford health insurance for their workers  Small business owners in Illinois and across America are trying to do their part to help provide their employees with health insurance  but they are struggling with annual double digit premium increases  This bill helps solve that problem           The Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP  would allow small businesses across America to band together for lower health care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading their risk over a large number of participants  Employers would qualify for an annual tax credit to partially offset contributions on behalf of low income employees       The SEHBP is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   which has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees  including members of Congress and their staffs  a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years  SEHBP would give employees of small businesses access to a comparable range of private health plans       Durbin said that when he meets with small business owners across Illinois  he frequently hears stories of how skyrocketing health insurance costs are hurting both small business owners and their employees   Take the story of Jeff Ryan  a regular fixture around the University of Illinois campus  and owner of Rock   s  a local restaurant in Champaign  Illinois       After working for over 16 years in the beverage distribution business  Ryan was able to make a life long dream come true  opening Rock   s in 2003  employing approximately 60 people  Last December  Ryan   s kitchen manager slipped on the ice and separated his shoulder  resulting in over  2 000 in emergency room costs and doctor bills   Shortly after that incident  one of the cooks needed expensive antibiotics and a young man employed as the dishwasher required costly surgery   Jeff Ryan  like thousands of small business owners across the state and the country  wants to cover his employees    health care costs but simply cannot afford to        The simple fact is health insurance for these employees  in our situation  is unaffordable  I can t cover my guys  and it hurts me   Ryan wrote in a letter to Durbin    I would contribute as an employer what we can afford  but the situation as it exists today is impossible  We must remain profitable to remain open  but if we were to pay the premiums quoted for the individuals needing coverage we would not remain profitable           With today   s coverage options  small businesses are unfairly forced to make a choice between taking care of their employees and paying the bills that keep their doors open     said Durbin      The high cost of health insurance is the top concern for small businesses in Illinois and across America   My Small Business Health Benefits Program will give employees of small businesses the same kinds of health care choices Members of Congress already have  for less than they pay now  while making it affordable for owners to provide it   With 46 million uninsured Americans in our country  SEHBP could be a lifeline to millions of workers who are without affordable  quality health insurance          The revised version of the bill incorporates technical changes and adds additional cosponsors to the measure   Co sponsors include U S  Senators Harry Reid  D NV   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Hilary Clinton  D NY   and Blanche Lincoln  D AR
