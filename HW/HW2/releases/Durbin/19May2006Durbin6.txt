DISSATISFIED WITH EPA RESPONSE TO ILLINOIS SUPERFUND SITE QUESTIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Friday  May 19  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today expressed their dissatisfaction with the response they received from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  regarding information about Illinois Superfund sites    Last year  the EPA released data showing that at 103 Superfund sites nationwide     human exposure is currently not under control       In a recent letter to the Senators  the EPA explained human exposure as being under control when    there are no completed exposure pathways to contaminants at unsafe levels under current site conditions      Illinois is number one on the list  with 11 sites where people are at risk for exposure to hazardous contaminates       Durbin and Obama sent a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson last July  requesting that EPA take immediate steps to provide information on each of the 11 Illinois sites in which EPA has not controlled human exposure to hazardous materials   The senators requested that EPA analyze the exposure threat and human risk factors at each site  evaluating which sites pose the greatest risk of human exposure  Durbin and Obama requested a detailed plan outlining how and when EPA plans to fully control human exposure at the listed sites       In today   s letter to EPA Administrator Johnson  Durbin and Obama asked for more complete answers to critical questions outlined in their initial letter          After 10 months  we are disappointed that many of our questions remain unanswered     Durbin and Obama wrote      In fact  we are surprised that Assistant Administrator Susan P  Bodine   s response yielded less information than we were able to gather from the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  website   We are genuinely concerned about these sites and what seems to be EPA   s inattention to the human exposure that may be occurring   We continue to have serious questions regarding the failure to take necessary action  at these sites to protect Illinois citizens        In today   s letter  Durbin and Obama asked for additional information on the following sites  a vacant lot used as a playground in Ottawa  the municipal water supply in Belvedere  a site near residences in Rockford  a site in Kess Creek West Branch of the DuPage River and at the Lenz Oil Service site in Lemont          Given that our initial request for information was made in July 2005  we believe comprehensive responses to that request are long overdue     Durbin and Obama wrote      Accordingly  we expect a response to this letter by no later than June 5  2006          According to an official publication of the EPA      human exposure is currently not under control at the following Illinois sites      Parsons Casket Hardware Co   Belvedere De Pue New Jersey Zinc Mobil Chemical Corp   De Pue Kerr McGee  Kress Creek West Branch of DuPage River  DuPage County Jennison Wright Corportation  Granite City Lenz Oil Service  Inc   Lemont Ottawa Radiation Areas  Ottawa Southeast Rockford Ground Water Contamination  Rockford Beloit Corp   Rockton Outboard Marine Corp   Waukegan Kerr McGee  West Chicago  Residential Areas  Kerr McGee  West Chicago  Sewage Treatment Plant    Full text of Durbin and Obama   s letter is attached and below           May 19  2006   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    We are in receipt of your response to our July 14  2005  request for information regarding Illinois National Priority List  NPL  sites where uncontrolled human exposure may be occurring       After 10 months  we are disappointed that many of our questions remain unanswered   In fact  we are surprised that Assistant Administrator Susan P  Bodine   s response yielded less information than we were able to gather from the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  website   We are genuinely concerned about these sites and what seems to be EPA   s inattention to the human exposure that may be occurring   We continue to have serious questions regarding the failure to take necessary action  at these sites to protect Illinois citizens       Cancer is the number one killer in America   According to the American Cancer Society  2  of American cancer cases and deaths are attributable to man made and naturally occurring environmental pollutants   The 11 000 deaths each year represent cases for which we understand the cause   The cause of many cancers remains unknown  and there remains much to learn about how pollutants interact with each other as well as with human genetics       While we are concerned about the population at large  we have a special concern for the children in the communities where possible human exposure sites are located   We want to ensure that every measure is taken to prevent access to these sites by children until clean up at these sites has been completed and the sites no longer pose a health threat   In some cases the information the EPA has provided makes it clear that the site has been secured  but the information is more ambiguous regarding other sites       We would appreciate additional information regarding the following      Ottawa Radiation Areas NPL Site     EPA   s response notes that operable unit 11 is a vacant lot in a residential area which children use as a playground   Contamination is 6 feet below the surface   Does the depth of the contamination protect the children from exposure   Your website includes information that other units were decontaminated to the 10 feet level   Is there any chance that the inhalation exposure pathway described could affect children playing on this site now or in the future   Are there steps that can be taken to fence off the area to protect the children   EPA   s response further notes that there is a skateboard park adjacent to the site with contamination from the surface to 3 feet deep   Does the skateboard site encapsulate the contamination    How are the child and adult skateboarders protected from needless exposure   Is the EPA regularly monitoring this site to ensure that no contamination is migrating  According to constituent reports  people continue to suffer from cancer caused by the contamination in Ottawa   This community lost a generation of women due to radium exposure  they should not have to bear the consequences of continued exposure   Parsons Casket Hardware  Belvedere      The EPA website notes that the U S  Geological Survey found contamination of the underground aquifer to be more extensive than originally thought   EPA   s response indicates that a record of decision  ROD  for the groundwater operable unit has been signed   Please elaborate on the current potential threat to Belvedere   s municipal water supply and what steps are being taken now that the ROD has been signed   Interstate Pollution Control  Inc   Rockford      EPA   s response states that human exposure currently occurs at this site and that there are residences as near as 600 feet   While the response indicates that those residences are hydraulically up gradient from the site  it does not indicate whether or not the inhalation pathway could be affecting residents   The EPA website indicates that cleanup construction was scheduled to begin in early 2006   Please provide additional information about the current risks to nearby residents and what progress has been made in cleaning up the site   Kerr McGee    Kress Creek West Branch of the DuPage River  West Chicago      Please provide an updated report on the clean up work that was scheduled to begin in 2005   EPA   s response indicates that affected residents may be exposed to gamma radiation in both residential and recreational areas   We request information on why EPA is doing nothing to control such exposure   Lenz Oil  Lemont      EPA   s response indicates that the most significant cancer risk for current and future residents on or adjacent to the site is inhalation of contaminants   Given that the ROD for the site was signed in 1999  what steps has EPA taken to protect nearby residents from inhalation exposure      Given that our initial request for information was made in July 2005  we believe comprehensive responses to that request are long overdue   Accordingly  we expect a response this letter by no later than June 5  2006   Thank you       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator
