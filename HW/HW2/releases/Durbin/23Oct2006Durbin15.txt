QUESTIONS APPOINTMENT OF NEW MINE SAFETY CHIEF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Monday  October 23  2006   Chicago  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today questioned the recess appointment by the Bush Administration of Richard E  Stickler as Administrator of the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  even though the Senate did not confirm him due to widespread opposition        In a letter to President Bush  Durbin wrote that following the Sago and Alma coal mines disasters  Congress overwhelmingly passed and the President signed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response  MINER  Act of 2006  legislation to update mine safety laws in order to stop the unnecessary loss of life   During his Senate confirmation  however  Stickler had stated that existing mine safety laws were adequate and the duty to comply with safety laws falls on the shoulders of the mine companies and not MSHA       Durbin wrote     I believe  as do many other Senators  that Mr  Stickler   s statements at his confirmation hearing are an insult to the 40 families who have lost miners in accidents this year  many of which could have been prevented   His statements are also deeply troubling to the thousands of miners who rely on MSHA to help keep them safe in a difficult and dangerous occupation that is vital to the American economy   I was not alone in opposing his nomination  and the vote on the MINER Act demonstrates that the Senate and the vast majority of House Members disagree with his views          Durbin urged the Administration    to carefully monitor Mr  Stickler   s performance and ensure that  under his leadership  both the spirit and the letter of the new MINER law are aggressively enforced    The 3 500 miners in my home state of Illinois and the over 100 000 miners across the nation deserve no less          The full text of the letter to President Bush is below         October 23  2006   George W  Bush  President  United States of America  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    I am writing to express my disappointment and concern regarding your recess appointment of Richard E  Stickler as Administrator of the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA    The Senate did not confirm Mr  Stickler due to widespread opposition to his nomination       In response to the tragic deaths at the Sago and Alma coal mines  in June of 2006 Congress passed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response  MINER  Act of 2006   This law  which the Senate passed by unanimous consent  was a recognition by every Senator and over 380 House Members that mine safety laws needed to be updated in order to stop the unnecessary loss of miners    lives  Mr  Stickler  however  did not agree that this new law was necessary  He stated before passage of the measure that the laws on the books  which had not been updated in 30 years to adjust for new technology  were adequate   He also testified at his confirmation hearing that the duty to comply with safety laws falls on the shoulders of the mine companies and that MSHA plays no role       I believe  as do many other Senators  that Mr  Stickler   s statements at his confirmation hearing are an insult to the 40 families who have lost miners in accidents this year  many of which could have been prevented   His statements are also deeply troubling to the thousands of miners who rely on MSHA to help keep them safe in a difficult and dangerous occupation that is vital to the American economy   I was not alone in opposing his nomination  and the vote on the MINER Act demonstrates that the Senate and the vast majority of House Members disagree with his views       Even though the Senate did not confirm Mr  Stickler  you have decided to recess appoint Mr  Stickler as head of MSHA  which will allow Mr  Stickler to serve through the end of 2007   I hope that you and the Department of Labor will carefully monitor Mr  Stickler   s performance and ensure that  under his leadership  both the spirit and the letter of the new MINER law are aggressively enforced    The 3 500 miners in my home state of Illinois and the over 100 000 miners across the nation deserve no less       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
