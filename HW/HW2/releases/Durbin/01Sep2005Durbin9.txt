     DURBIN AND OBAMA URGE BUSH TO REJECT BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

URGE BUSH TO REJECT BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

September 1  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to President Bush  urging him to reject the flawed recommendations made by the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission and to return the report to the Commission for revisions          The Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act clearly states that the number one criterion for BRAC decisions is military value     Durbin and Obama wrote      Unfortunately  the report that has been approved by the BRAC Commission failed to abide by that crucial standard   We urge you to return the report to the Commission for further revision          In their letter to the President  Durbin and Obama cited several examples affecting Illinois military installations where the BRAC Commission appears to have deviated from the    military value    standard set by law   As a result  the Commission moved to send jobs and aircraft from Illinois bases to out of state military installations that are ranked with a lower military value          We believe that the report submitted to you by the Department of Defense is deeply flawed     wrote Durbin and Obama      The inconsistencies  contradictions and outright violations of BRAC criteria outlined above demonstrate the need for further revision   In its current form  this is not a report that advances our national interest   We urge you to return it to the Commission to correct these and other fundamental errors          Base Realignment and Closure is the congressionally authorized procedure for the closure of U S  military installations   The Department of Defense makes its recommendations to a bipartisan BRAC Commission appointed by Congressional leaders and the President       Last week  the BRAC commission completed their recommendations and sent them to the President for his review   The BRAC Commission is required to make its final recommendations to Congress on closures and realignments by October of this year   The Commission   s recommendations must be voted down or accepted as a whole by the House and the Senate within 45 days       The text of Durbin and Obama s letter appears below      __________________    September 1  2005      President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President       The Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act clearly states that the number one criterion for BRAC decisions is military value   Unfortunately  the report that has been approved by the BRAC Commission failed to abide by that crucial standard   The set of recommendations approved by the Commission substantially deviates from the criteria established by law   As such  we urge you to return the report to the Commission for further revision       Specifically  we write to you today about a set of recommendations involving Springfield   s Capital Airport and Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois   As part of a larger vote involving Air National Guard facilities  the Commission elected to send the 15 F 16s of the Illinois Air Guard 183d Fighter Wing to Fort Wayne  Indiana   Capital Airport  home of the 183d  has a higher military value than Fort Wayne  this fact alone marks a deviation from BRAC criteria   In its evaluation  the Department of Defense alleged that the downgrading of military value would be justified by superior recruiting in Indiana   The evidence that members of the community and congressional delegation presented to the BRAC Commission clearly exposed the fallaciousness of this justification  the 183d enjoys outstanding recruiting in Illinois and is over 100 percent critically manned   Furthermore  as the U S  District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania recently ruled  the Defense Department should have obtained the consent of the Governor before seeking to deactivate a flying wing       Decisions involving Rock Island Arsenal also defy the central criterion of military value and the paramount objective of enhancing national security through the more effective allocation of military resources   The Defense Financial and Accounting Services at Rock Island was the top ranked unit in the country   But the Commission decided to transfer this agency from Rock Island to a substantially inferior facility  according to Department of Defense data  while defending the retention of three lower ranked sites  allegedly on the basis of enhanced military value combined with economic impact    Shutting down a top ranked facility  which had ample physical room and local capacity to grow  while maintaining and expanding the 12th  17th  and 19th ranked units flies in the face of all logic   Moreover  the economic impact of this move on the communities in and around Rock Island also outweighs the prospective impact at two of the three lower ranked recipient sites   Similarly  the decision to move the Tank Automotive and Armaments Command from Rock Island to Michigan will fail to yield promised dividends  with projected costs exceeding  150 million  the Department of Defense will never see returns on this investment       We believe that the report submitted to you by the Department of Defense is deeply flawed   The inconsistencies  contradictions  and outright violations of BRAC criteria outlined above demonstrate the need for further revision   In its current form  this is not a report that advances our national interest   We urge you to return it to the Commission to correct these and other fundamental errors       Sincerely       Dick Durbin   U S  Senator
