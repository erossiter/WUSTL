May 10  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter  along with senators from both political parties  to the leaders of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Democrat  Joe Lieberman  D CT   urging them to set aside funds for grants that will help states both prepare for and respond to disasters   In the letter  the senators asked the committee to incorporate Durbins bill  the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act  into legislation on disaster preparedness  Durbins bill  which would provide states with grants for evacuation exercises and for the implementation of emergency response plans  is co sponsored by Senators Thad Cochran  R MS  and Ken Salazar  D CO   both signatories of todays letter   Our first responders and emergency preparedness officials back home need to know that the Department of Homeland Security will provide them with the tools they need  said Durbin   As we witnessed with recent natural disasters  communities large and small face special challenges and vulnerabilities when disaster strikes   This bill will help them with the proper planning  preparation  and resources they need to ensure that their citizens will be evacuated quickly and safely should a natural disaster or terrorist attack occur   Durbin s bill  the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act  would establish a  250 million a year grant program that will allow states to develop comprehensive evacuation plans  stage drills and exercises to practice and perfect evacuation procedures and stockpile materials needed to supply evacuation staging areas and evacuation routes   Experts say that if evacuation procedures such as those envisioned in the Durbin bill had been in place prior to Hurricane Katrina  many of the problems experienced in that evacuation could have been avoided   According to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the National Emergency Managers Association  only a limited amount of homeland security funding can be used for evacuation planning  and that money is generally earmarked for essential personnel  with little money left for the planning and staging of evacuations   Durbins bill addresses this issue by creating a separate stream of money for preparedness planning   Text of letter appears below   May 10  2006  The Honorable Susan Collins  Chairman  Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee  340 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510  The Honorable Joseph Lieberman  Ranking Member  Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee  601 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510  Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman   We are writing to you in order to request that you incorporate our bill  the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act of 2005  S  2043   into your forthcoming legislation improving the nations preparedness and response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks   S  2043 implements the recommendation in the committees recently released report  Hurricane Katrina   A Nation Still Unprepared  that federal agencies work with state and local officials to develop evacuation plans   Our legislation addresses a gaping hole in our nations disaster preparedness by providing grants for evacuation exercises and for the implementation of emergency response plans   S  2043 would establish a grant program to ensure that cities across America have the resources they need to   Develop comprehensive evacuation plans  Stage drills and exercises to practice and perfect evacuation procedures  and Stockpile the materials needed to supply evacuation areas   In addition  the legislation helps cities prepare for future emergencies and evacuations to ensure that their citizens will be evacuated quickly and safely should a natural disaster or terrorist attack occur   Otherwise  like the victims of Hurricane Katrina  citizens can easily become trapped without food or water in a devastated area or along an escape route   The Department of Homeland Security recently reported to Congress that many states  territories  and urban areas lack confidence in the adequacy and feasibility of their plans to deal with catastrophic events   The Departments report also highlighted the importance of exercises in preparing first responders for disasters and revealing shortcomings in disaster plans  The Washington Post recently called for increased attention to evacuation exercises and disaster preparation to prevent the disaster that followed Hurricane Katrina   According to the Post  the insufficient federal and local response to Hurricane Katrina was a failure of execution  not prediction   As you draft legislation to improve future responses to natural disasters and terrorist attacks  we would appreciate your consideration of S  2043   The grants for mass evacuation exercises and the execution of emergency response plans provided in the bill complement your efforts to establish a stronger emergency management structure   Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  D IL   United States Senator  Thad Cochran  R MS   United States Senator  Ken Salazar  D CO   United
