     DURBIN ASKS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO HELP ILLINOIS RESIDENTS HEAT THEIR HOMES

IMMEDIATE ACTION TO HELP ILLINOIS RESIDENTS HEAT THEIR HOMES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Friday  January 27  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin joined Democratic colleagues in sending a letter this week to Senate Majority Leader  Bill Frist  R TN   urging him to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP         With heating bills up 41 percent in the Midwest this winter  many people face the choice to heat or eat   Durbin said      LIHEAP was created to assist our lowest income families and seniors  but this year   s funding isn   t covering even half of those who need help   Of the 800 000 Illinoisans are eligible  only 300 000 are receiving assistance   And with dramatically higher utility bills this winter  costing the average Illinois family  1 200 to stay warm  the need is greater than ever   LIHEAP is severely under funded and we must take immediate action to put additional money into the program        The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  is a federally funded program which provides heating and cooling assistance to almost 5 million low income households  including the working poor  those making the difficult transition from welfare to work  disabled persons  the elderly and families with young children   Assistance comes in the form of block grants to state programs that help eligible households pay for the costs of home energy   Often  people living in poverty and low income elderly must choose between buying fuel to heat their homes and buying food for themselves and their families   Durbin noted that the program targets people who need help the most       In Illinois  requests for government help to pay heating bills were up  over 40 percent in 2005   As of mid December  a total of 236 131 Illinois residents had applied for LIHEAP assistance  compared with 166 965 applications at that time the year before   In Illinois  several city offices are receiving a dramatically higher number of calls from people who cannot afford to pay their heating bills   Some offices report that seniors are forgoing purchasing their prescriptions or not buying food in order to attempt to pay the energy bill          Experts tell us that the top two underlying reasons for homelessness in America are inability to pay for rent and inability to pay for utilities     said Durbin     The costs of not providing help to those who need it in our state and other states facing similar problems are far greater than the cost of adequately funding the LIHEAP program        During fiscal year 2005  LIHEAP allowed the states to help only about 5 million people out of an estimated 32 million eligible for assistance   As part of the energy bill signed into law last summer  Congress authorized  5 1 billion annually for the program for fiscal years 2005  2006 and 2007   However  the final spending bill for fiscal 2006  which began in October  contained only  2 16 billion       The text of the letter appears below         The Honorable William H  Frist                                      Majority Leader                                                                        United States Senate                                                                    Dear Majority Leader Frist    High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   as supported by the majority of the Senate       Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted six times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate   s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans   These families and seniors deserve help from the federal government       As you know  the Department of Defense  DoD  Appropriations Conference report originally provided an additional  2 billion for LIHEAP   The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD conferees was designated as emergency funding   The emergency designation funding is warranted given the high cost of energy this winter  and the lack of growth in workers    wages   Unfortunately  other more controversial matters included in the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP money in final action on that bill       The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private non farm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education       We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the Senate floor at the end of this month  or at the latest  early February  that funds LIHEAP at the  5 1 billion level supported by the Senate   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request
