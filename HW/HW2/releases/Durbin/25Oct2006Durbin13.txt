Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  R  David Paulison  the members wrote     The Governor   s appeal is based on additional information provided by the State of Illinois and the City of Rockford that

released after the Congressional offices met with state  local and FEMA representatives  the members also wrote     The commitment by FEMA staff during this morning   s meeting not to make a final

FEMA thoroughly and fairly reviews the request for federal disaster assistance          They added     We also believe that FEMA   s commitment to share with State and local officials factual data used in its damage assessment will help the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the City of Rockford compile and present the best possible case for federal disaster assistance          The full text of the letter is below         October 25  2006   The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  FEMA  500 C Street  S W   Washington  D C   20472   Dear Director Paulison    We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich s appeal for reconsideration of his September 11  2006  request for federal disaster assistance for the City of Rockford and portions of Winnebago County affected by significant Labor Day flash flooding   As you may know  this morning  staff from our offices met with State and local officials and representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to discuss the appeal   The commitment by FEMA staff during this morning   s meeting not to make a final decision about the appeal until the State of Illinois  in coordination with the City of Rockford  has had the necessary time to compile additional information is an important step in ensuring that FEMA thoroughly and fairly reviews the request for federal disaster assistance   We also believe that FEMA   s commitment to share with State and local officials factual data used in its damage assessment will help the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the City of Rockford compile and present the best possible case for federal disaster assistance       The Governor   s appeal is based on additional information provided by the State of Illinois and the City of Rockford that indicates that the damage to the private sector was of such severity and magnitude that effective recovery is beyond the capability of the State and local governments   The cost to homeowners  renters  and businesses as a direct result of the flash flood is likely to be at  8 5 million   Some of Rockford   s poorest residents living in the impacted areas are uninsured and need housing assistance grants to repair their flood damaged homes   Neither the City of Rockford nor the State of Illinois is able to provide this type of grant assistance to those severely affected by the flood   Only a federal disaster declaration will open the programs necessary to help underinsured and uninsured homeowners recover from the impact of the flood on their property and provide the needed assistance       We respectfully request that you reconsider Governor Blagojevich s request and review all the information submitted by the State to FEMA s regional office       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator   Donald Manzullo  United States Representative
