LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE MISSISSIPPI RIVER NAVIGATION AND ECOSYSTEM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wednesday  July 19  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today hailed the Senate   s approval of the Water and Resources Development Act  WRDA   which includes Congressional authorization for locks and dam modernization on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  WRDA authorizes specific projects for navigation  ecosystem restoration  and flood and storm damage reduction  The bill is supported by agriculture  environmental and labor organizations          Today I joined Senators from both parties to pass a bill that will create over 50 000 new jobs for the region  shorter shipping times  and improved business for Midwest producers along the River     said Durbin     The Mississippi River transports  12 billion worth of products every year  affecting agriculture  commercial  and labor interests across the state of Illinois          The most significant provision in the bill would increase lock and dam capacity and improve the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  The legislation would authorize  2 03 billion for replacing and upgrading locks and dams and another  1 65 billion for ecosystem restoration     Updating these locks is critical for industry and agriculture in Illinois   more than half of Illinois  annual corn crop is shipped to export markets on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers  Shipping via barge on the River keeps exports competitive and reduces transportation costs for Illinois farmers and businesses     said Durbin          This bill also includes a critical project that protects the Great Lakes ecosystem   Today  the Asian Carp threatens a  4 1 billion sport and commercial fishing industry in the Great Lakes   The bill passed today recognizes the threat of the Asian Carp by authorizing the permanent operation of the barrier system to prevent the Asian Carp from entering the waters of the Great Lakes     Durbin added       Durbin also supported a bipartisan amendment offered by Sens  John McCain  R AZ  and Russ Feingold  D WI  that would establish independent review panels for U S  Army Corps of Engineers projects  This issue has received significant attention in the wake of the Gulf Coast hurricanes  which showed that major levee failures in New Orleans occurred because of faulty design  construction or maintenance       The amendment would establish an independent panel of experts to review projects costing more than  40 million  projects requested by a state governor  projects for which the director of a federal agency has said could have a significant adverse impact  or projects that the Army s secretary has found to be controversial  The amendment also calls for an independent safety review for critical flood damage reduction projects  The independent review process will not lengthen the time line for projects to be completed       Specifically  the bill includes         1 795 billion for the construction of seven new 1 200 foot locks at Locks 20  21  22  24  and 25 on the Upper Mississippi River and at LaGrange Lock and Peoria Lock on the Illinois Waterway          1 65 billion for true ecosystem restoration  allowing the Corps authority to do island building  construction of fish passages  floodplain restoration  water level management  backwater restoration  side channel restoration  wing dam and dike restoration  island and shoreline protection  topographical diversity  use of dredged material for environmental purposes  tributary confluence restoration  land easement authority  and land acquisition         235 million for small scale and non structural improvements such as traffic management and boats that push the barges through locks faster              We have been waiting six long years for a bill to reauthorize navigation projects all over the country  Today  I commend my colleagues for working together to pass this bill and to modernize the Mississippi waterway so our region can remain competitive in the years to come     said Durbin
