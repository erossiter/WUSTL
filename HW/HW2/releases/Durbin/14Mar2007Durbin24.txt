AND FEINSTEIN INTRODUCE BILL TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR AGRICULTURE INSPECTIONS FROM DHS BACK TO USDA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wednesday  March 14  2007   Washington  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Dianne Feinstein  D CA  today introduced a bill that would transfer responsibility for conducting agricultural inspections at all points of entry in the United States from the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  back to the U S  Department of Agriculture s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS        APHIS controlled agriculture inspections prior to March 2003   But the responsibility was transferred to DHS as part of the Homeland Security Act  which combined the inspection activities of the Department of the Treasury s Customs Service  the Department of Justice s Immigration and Naturalization Service  and USDA s APHIS into the newly created Department of Homeland Security s Customs and Border Protection  CBP         When inspection rates at key American points of entry decrease  the threat of infestation dramatically increases   said Durbin    We owe it to the American people to make sure our government is doing all it can to control the spread of invasive species         Inspections are the first line of defense against exotic pests   Yet inspections have dropped dramatically since responsibility has been vested with the Department of Homeland Security   Senator Feinstein said    It is time to put USDA back in charge of inspections and ensure that keeping these pests out remains a top priority        A Government Accountability Office  GAO  report released in 2006  revealed that since the USDA transferred responsibility for port inspections  fewer agricultural inspections have been conducted at key points of entry and the morale of agriculture specialists has been low       The USDA estimates that agricultural pests cost the American agricultural industry  41 billion annually   In California alone  pest infestations cost farmers about  3 billion a year       In Illinois  a destructive insect known as the Emerald Ash Borer has been discovered in several areas  The Ash Borer is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees  ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  Infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years        The discovery of the Emerald Ash Borer in Illinois is troubling news   said Durbin    In the past few years  this insect has killed tens of millions of trees throughout the Midwest  and we need to get ahead of this infestation before it gets worse        California farmers continue to battle against serious agricultural pests  such as the glassy winged sharpshooter  the Asian long horned beetle  the Mediterranean fruit fly  among others        Once these pests and diseases have entered the country  it is very difficult and expensive to control the damage   The best way to prevent damage to our crops is to stop agricultural pests from entering our country in the first place   Senator Feinstein said       During the time that DHS has been in charge of agriculture inspections  Fresno County  Calif   experienced its first fruit fly outbreak  quarantine  and eradication   According to the Fresno County Department of Agriculture  the pest was the Peach Fruit Fly  which is indigenous to Asia   This pest is not known to occur in Mexico and had to enter the country through one of the federal ports of entry in smuggled fruit carried in by a passenger   The eradication effort cost approximately  1 million dollars       The legislation is supported by      California Secretary of Agriculture A G  Kawamura  California Farm Bureau  The American Landscape and Nursery Association  Jerry Prieto Jr   President  California Agriculture Commissioners and Sealers Association  The Nisei Farmers League  The Nature Conservancy  Environmental Defense  National Wildlife Federation  Union of Concerned Scientists  Defenders of Wildlife  and The San Diego County Agriculture Commissioner  and The Contra Costa County Agriculture Commissioner   Background   The Agricultural Quarantine Inspection  AQI  program is charged with inspecting U S  ports of entry to seize prohibited material and intercept foreign agricultural pests from international passengers and cargo  Prior to 2003  the AQI program was administered by the USDA s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS        In 2002  Congress passed the Homeland Security Act  combining the inspection activities of the Department of the Treasury s Customs Service  the Department of Justice s Immigration and Naturalization Service  and USDA s APHIS into the newly created Department of Homeland Security s Customs and Border Protection  CBP        The 2006 GAO report   Homeland Security  Management and Coordination Problems Increase Vulnerability of U S  Agriculture to Foreign Pests and Disease   found      Inspection rates at several key American points of entry have significantly decreased  Inspections decreased in Miami by 12 7 percent  in Boston by 17 9 percent  and San Francisco by 21 4 percent   60 percent of agriculture inspection specialists believed they were doing either  somewhat  or  many fewer  inspections since the transfer   63 percent of agriculture inspection specialists did not believe that their port had enough agriculture specialists to carry out agriculture duties   64 percent of the agriculture inspection specialists reported that their work was not respected by Customs and Border Patrol    A copy of the GAO report can be found
