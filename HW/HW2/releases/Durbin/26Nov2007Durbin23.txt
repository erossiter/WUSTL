November 26  2007    CHICAGO  IL   Anti gang legislation approved by the U S  Senate creates a crucial balance between enforcement and prevention by providing federal resources for local police and prosecutors to investigate gangs and protect witnesses from retaliation  and by enhancing gang prevention and intervention efforts  United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said at a roundtable discussion in his Chicago office  Communities in Illinois and across the country deal with senseless gang violence every day  Durbin said  The bill we passed in the Senate takes much needed steps towards addressing the persistent problem of gang violence in our communities  The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act  passed by the full Senate on September 21  2007  makes a number of gang activities a federal crime  while increasing penalties for existing crimes and increasing funding for prevention and intervention efforts  The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is working on their version of an anti gang bill  which Durbin hopes will include many of the same provisions  The anti gang bill includes several Durbin led initiatives  including funding of over  175 million over five years for gang prevention programs  These resources would go to groups on the front lines who are working to prevent gang involvement and violence  The bill also creates High Intensity Gang Activity Areas  HIGAAs  that will be set up by the Attorney General  These HIGAAs would receive special funding to increase law enforcement efforts in the form of new Department of Justice block grants  Other components of the bill include  New Federal Crimes Against Gang Members  Makes recruiting of criminal street gang members a federal crime  Current federal law contains no penalty for recruiting others to participate in illegal gang activity  This bill makes the recruitment or solicitation of others to participate in criminal gang activity a federal crime  with the penalty doubled if a minor is recruited  Creates a new federal crime for murder and other violent crimes committed in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime  This provision creates a new criminal offense for violent crimes that are committed during and in relation to drug trafficking crimes  with the U S  Sentencing Commission also directed to craft new federal sentencing guidelines that will ensure that those convicted of this offense receive a suitably consecutive sentence  Creates a new federal crime of interstate interference with witnesses in state court proceedings  Provides a federal prosecutorial tool to states and county criminal courts that prosecute state offenses but may lack the resources needed to investigate and prosecute cases of witness intimidation that cross state lines   New Federal Penalties for Gang Members  Establishes new penalties for gang related crimes  Under current law  a felons criminal street gang involvement can be treated at most as a mere sentencing enhancement  adding no more than 10 years to a sentence  This bill establishes far higher penalties for the new federal gang crimes it creates  including the possibility of life imprisonment without parole for murder  kidnapping  aggravated sexual abuse  or maiming  If the gang crime is a serious violent felony  the criminal can receive up to 30 years in prison  And for any other violent gang crimes  the criminal can receive up to 20 years in prison  Increases penalties for racketeering violence  Increases the maximum penalties for violence committed in furtherance of racketeering  so that the gang and racketeering laws will complement one another  Creates tougher laws for certain federal crimes like carjacking  conspiracy  and other existing offenses in which gang members may be involved  Increases penalties for criminal transfer of firearms for use in crimes of violence and drug trafficking  This section increases the maximum penalty from 10 to 20 years if the seller knows that a gun he transfers will be used in a violent or drug trafficking crime   Law Enforcement  Prevention and Intervention Collaboration  and Funding  Sets aside at least  361 5 million in authorized funding over five years for gang prevention and intervention efforts  These funds include  187 5 million  half  of the HIGAA authorized funds  a new  175 million program of gang protection block grants  and  49 million in two new provisions providing expanded or new authorized funding for mentoring and after school programs  Authorizes  100 million over five years to expand the Project Safe Neighborhood program  with an expansion of prosecutors and law enforcement agents focused on reducing violence and gun crimes by gang members  Prior gang initiatives under the Project Safe Neighborhoods program have also historically included a gang prevention component  Authorizes  50 million over five years for expansion of the FBIs Safe Streets Program  to investigate and prosecute violent street gangs and criminals  Authorizes  100 million over five years to expand crime control grants to state and local governments  so they can hire additional prosecutors  staff and technology as needed to bring more cases against gangs and violent criminals  Authorizes an additional  270 million over three years for witness protection needs  including those of state and local prosecutors
