 October 24  2006    CHICAGO  IL      In a letter spearheaded by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   members of the Illinois Congressional delegation today called on Canadian National Railway Company  CN  to honor its agreements with Amtrak   Under the agreement finalized in July and set to go into effect on October 30  2006  CN would grant Amtrak access along routes that begin in Chicago and end in St  Louis and Carbondale in order to meet growing ridership demand          We were notified last week that CN will no longer agree to allow one of the additional roundtrips to St  Louis via Joliet  is threatening to withhold access to the Carbondale route  and may seek to terminate all of the newly added trains in Illinois after just one year   Such an action would violate the agreement between CN and Amtrak     the members wrote in a letter to E  Hunter Harrison  CN   s President and Chief Executive Officer       Due to increased ridership  Illinois doubled its Amtrak operating subsidies from  12 to  24 million to    allow the State to operate two more roundtrip trains on its Chicago to St  Louis route  and one more roundtrip train on its Chicago to Carbondale route    On behalf of the State of Illinois  Amtrak negotiated an agreement with CN along CN   s 37 mile portion of the 284 miles on the Chicago to St  Louis corridor and along the whole 310 miles of track from Chicago to Carbondale          The members concluded     We hope that CN and Amtrak can resolve this issue before the October 30th start date for new Amtrak service   If this issue is not resolved by then  we request that you meet with us in Washington to discuss this issue the week of November 13th          The letter was signed by U S  Senators Dick Durbin and Barack Obama and U S  Representatives Jerry

Railway Company  935 de La Gaucheti  re Street West  Montreal  Quebec H3B 2M9   Dear Mr  Harrison    We are writing to you regarding Canadian National s apparent decision to violate its agreement with Amtrak to operate additional Amtrak train frequencies in Illinois   Specifically  Canadian National  CN  and Amtrak finalized a series of agreements in July that would grant access to Amtrak along routes that begin in Chicago and end in St  Louis and Carbondale   That service is scheduled to begin October 30th       In May  due to a double digit percent ridership increase on its intrastate Amtrak routes  the State of Illinois decided to add new trains to its Amtrak routes   The state doubled its Amtrak operating subsidies from  12 to  24 million  which would allow the State to operate two more roundtrip trains on its Chicago to St  Louis route  and one more roundtrip train on its Chicago to Carbondale route       On behalf of the State of Illinois  Amtrak negotiated an agreement with CN along CN   s 37 mile portion of the 284 miles on the Chicago to St  Louis corridor and along the whole 310 miles of track from Chicago to Carbondale   We were notified last week that CN will no longer agree to allow one of the additional roundtrips to St  Louis via Joliet  is threatening to withhold access to the Carbondale route  and may seek to terminate all of the newly added trains in Illinois after just one year   Such an action would violate the agreement between CN and Amtrak       CN   s actions are an affront to Amtrak  the State of Illinois  and the millions of rail passengers across Illinois   Amtrak has hired and trained employees  renovated train equipment  purchased advertising and mounted a series of public events   in some of which your railroad was a participant   supporting the new train frequencies   In addition  since the Carbondale service expansion was announced by the Governor at an event attended by CN on September 25  tickets have gone on sale for the additional frequencies and some trains have already sold out       Amtrak has been in communication with CN officials since March and had amended its train schedule in order to accommodate CN   Agreements between CN and Amtrak were finalized in July   Therefore  we do not understand why CN has decided to violate its access agreement with Amtrak less than two weeks before the planned launch of the new state supported roundtrip trains       We hope that CN and Amtrak can resolve this issue before the October 30th start date for new Amtrak service   If this issue is not resolved by then  we request that you meet with us in Washington to discuss this issue the week of November 13th       Please have someone from your office contact Senator Durbin   s office or Representative Costello   s office to let us know if the issue has been resolved or for a time and date to meet with us       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  U S  Senator Barack Obama  U S  Rep  Jerry
