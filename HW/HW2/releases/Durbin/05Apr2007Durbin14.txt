

SENATE HEARING ON PET FOOD CONTAMINATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  April 5  2007    CHICAGO  IL    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced the U S  Senate will hold an oversight hearing on the ongoing investigation and the regulatory mechanisms that govern the pet food industry as the widespread recall of contaminated pet food continues        Many cats  dogs and other pets  considered members of the family are now suffering as a result of a deeply flawed pet food inspection system   said Durbin    The FDA s response to this situation has been tragically slow   Pet owners deserve answers   The uncertainty about what is safe to feed their pets has gone on far too long   I want to learn exactly when the FDA knew about the contamination  who is inspecting pet food manufacturing plants  and whether we need to force the FDA to update their regulations to protect our pets   Most importantly  I want to hear how the FDA is going to work to resolve the current crisis and ensure this doesn t happen again        Durbin  a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  is working with Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   the Chairman of the Subcommittee  to schedule the hearing shortly after the Senate returns from recess next week   Hearing witnesses will include FDA officials who will be questioned on the timeline of the investigation  the source of the contamination  and the agency s regulatory and inspection responsibilities   The hearing will also include outside experts who will discuss the current state of the pet food industry  as well as regulatory or resource shortfalls that led to the widespread recall of tainted pet food       While the FDA is reporting 15 animal deaths due to poisoning  the agency has received more than 10 000 complaints over the last several weeks   Reports of the actual number of animal deaths due to tainted food vary widely from other sources       Durbin is urging the FDA to take action in three specific areas      Delay in reporting   Menu Foods  Inc  first noticed a potential problem on February 20  2007 but did not contact FDA until March 15  2007   In the meantime  other companies were selling tainted product and the supplier wasn t aware that it had provided wheat gluten contaminated with melamine   Durbin wants companies that delay reporting to the FDA and endanger human and animal health to face penalties   Lack of inspections   The Emporia  Kansas Menu Foods facility where many of these products were made had never been inspected by the FDA   The agency has been relying on the states to conduct inspections  but the FDA has jurisdiction over all pet food manufacturing facilities and the ultimate responsibility to ensure facilities comply with FDA standards   Where there should be federal regulation  there is instead a patchwork of state inspection systems and voluntary guidance   Durbin wants to require the FDA to work with the states to establish a standardized set of regulations and inspection requirements   Incomplete data and reporting from the FDA   Blogs and nonprofit websites have filled a gap and become the most efficient way to share information on contaminations   Durbin wants to direct the FDA to create a similar information sharing system that would allow state veterinarians  pet owners and others to alert the FDA of possible contaminations     Timeline   On March 16  2007 Menu Foods  Inc  initiated a voluntary recall of 60 million cans and pouches of wet pet food   The recall involves 42 varieties of cat food and 53 varieties of dog food made at its Emporia  Kansas facility between December 3  2006 and March 6  2007       The FDA  which has jurisdiction over the regulation and inspection of pet food processing facilities  announced the recall on March 17  2007   According to FDA  it was first notified of the contamination on March 15  2007       In addition to the Menu Foods recall of 95 different labels of pet food  the recall was expanded between March 16 and March 31  2007 to at least 4 more makers of pet food  all well respected premium brand companies   Nestle Purina  maker of Alpo  Hill s Pet Nutrition  maker of Prescription Diet  P Pet Care  maker of Iams and Eukanuba  and Del Monte       On March 26  2007  in response to reports that Menu Foods and FDA were underreporting the number of animal illnesses  acute kidney failure  and deaths attributed to the contamination  Durbin and Congresswoman DeLauro sent a letter to Andrew von Eschenbach  Commissioner of the FDA  requesting that within 15 days the FDA provide information on the number of pet food manufacturing inspections and violations  a detailed timeline of the situation  an analysis of FDA s oversight of pet food manufacturing facilities and a report of actions taken since the recent pet food recall   A response is due by April 10  2007       On March 30  the FDA discovered that the source of the contamination was a melamine contaminated batch of wheat gluten imported from China by a Chinese company called Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co  Ltd  which is based in Wangdien  China   The same day  in response to the Xuzhou discovery  FDA issued guidelines blocking imports of wheat gluten from that company and stepped up inspections of all Chinese wheat gluten shipments       On April 3  Nevada based ChemNutra announced that it was the firm that had imported the contaminated wheat gluten and that it then provided the gluten to pet food companies   According to ChemNutra  all the wheat gluten went to pet food companies and should not be in the human food supply   ChemNutra initiated a nationwide recall of the contaminated wheat gluten product on April 2  2007
