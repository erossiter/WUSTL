                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  February 8  2006   WASHINGTON  DC    After a meeting with Illinois National Guard Leadership today  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  expressed concern with recent proposals by the Department of Defense which would have a direct influence on the future of the Illinois Guard and its ability to respond to state and national crisis   The Administrations proposed cutbacks of the Guard would result in the loss of up to 1 000 of Illinois 9 500 Army National Guard members   This loss would significantly handicap the Illinois Guards ability to respond to everything from natural disasters to terrorist attacks  Durbin said   Our nation and our state are more dependent on the Guard for our safety and security than ever in our history  Durbin said   This is the wrong time to eliminate more than 10 percent of Guard strength in Illinois   In a January 25th press conference  the Secretary of the Army  Francis J  Harvey  proposed to reduce the authorized end strength of the Guard from 350 000 members to its current operating level of 333 000 members   essentially proposing to abandon critical recruitment goals   Authorized end strength refers to a recruitment goal which the Department of Defense has defined as the number of members necessary for the National Guard to successfully carry out its responsibilities   The Secretarys proposal would result in a significant reorganization of the Guard and an initial loss of approximately 1 000 soldiers from the Illinois National Guard   Some of that force could be eventually replaced with a different mix of units and capabilities   It is currently unknown how that reorganization would be structured   This proposal was laid out as a part of the Quadrennial Defense Review and the 2007 Defense Budget   The Department of Defense continues to mislead the public with the claim that this proposal does not require a cut to our Guard forces  noted Durbin  Abandoning national recruitment goals will require a restructuring of the Guard  and that could translate into real and significant cuts for the state of Illinois   In addition  Durbin noted that the Illinois National Guard is still experiencing severe equipment shortages   The Illinois Army National Guards commitment to combat operations overseas means that a great deal of its equipment is unavailable for use at home   The operational demands of the war have caused the Illinois Army National Guard to leave more than 400 vehicles and generators behind in Iraq so far  This compounds significant shortages that already existed  with a lack of trucks  radios  night vision devices and tactical generators   In November of 2005  Durbin spearheaded a bipartisan letter to President Bush  signed by 41 other Senators  expressing alarm at serious equipment shortages now faced by National Guard units in Illinois and across the nation   The shortages were documented in a report released in November by the Government Accountability Office  GAO     The letter called on the President to immediately implement a plan to replace the missing items and to fully fund the needs of the National Guard   This is a serious problem  it impacts the ability of these units to respond as they should in a crisis  it affects their ability to conduct training exercises  it affects the morale of the units  Durbin noted in 2005   Replacing this equipment has been slow  and the replacement items are often not adequate in terms of quality or quantity   The Department of Defense still has yet to outline how it plans to replenish these critical supplies   Todays meeting was attended by Major General Randall Thomas  the Adjutant General for the state of Illinois  Brigadier General Dennis Celleti  the Assistant Adjutant General of the Illinois Army National Guard and Brigadier General Hal Keistler  the Assistant Adjutant General of the Illinois Air National Guard   Senator Durbin is a member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee   He met yesterday with Army Secretary Harvey  Army officials  and the Senate Army Caucus  of which he is also a member
