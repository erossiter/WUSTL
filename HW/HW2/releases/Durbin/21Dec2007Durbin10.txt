Genocide Accountability Act Becomes Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Friday  December 21  2007        President George W  Bush today signed into law a measure written by Senator Dick Durbins  D IL  that cracks down on war criminals seeking refuge in the United States  Durbin s legislation  the Genocide Accountability Act  closes the legal loophole that prevented the U S  Justice Department from prosecuting individuals in the United States who have participated in genocide in other countries     There is no safe haven for the hundreds of thousands of Sudanese who have faced genocide in Darfur and yet without this law  our country could become a safe haven for their killers  said Durbin  Today s action by the President makes it crystal clear  the legal loophole in our law is closed and perpetrators of genocide who come to our country will now face significant consequences     The bill is the first piece of legislation produced by the new Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  which Durbin chairs  to become law  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   the subcommittees ranking member  Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Senator John Cornyn  R TX  joined Senator Durbin as original cosponsors of the bill  Before today  genocide was only a crime if it is committed within the United States or by a U S  national outside the United States  The Genocide Accountability Act closed this loophole by amending the Genocide Convention Implementation Act to allow prosecution of non U S  nationals found in the United States for genocide perpetrated outside the U S    Under no circumstances should an individual who participated in genocide be allowed to enjoy safe haven within the United States  Our country has served as an example of democracy and individual rights  Allowing these individuals to freely wander our streets is unacceptable  Persons who committed these heinous crimes should be punished to the fullest extent of the law  While it may sometimes be better to seek such punishment in a violators home country  we should at least have the ability to prosecute violators here when it is prudent to do so  said Dr  Coburn    The Justice Department has identified individuals who participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and who are living in the United States under false pretenses  Under the previous law  these individuals could not be prosecuted for perpetrating genocide  because they are not U S  nationals and the genocides in which they were involved did not take place in the United States  In contrast  the laws on torture  material support for terrorism  terrorism financing  hostage taking  and many other federal crimes cover offenses committed outside the United States by non U S  nationals    This is a bill that underscores the importance of the rule of law in upholding human rights standards that are embedded in our core beliefs and principles  I am pleased that the President has signed this important bill into law  Leahy said  The Senate Judiciary Committees new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law already is making significant contributions to the fight against genocide  and I commend Senator Durbin for his efforts  I am proud of the work of our new subcommittee and am confident that it will continue to fulfill its purpose in confronting pressing human rights issues in the United States and abroad      The United States has made strides in helping victims of genocide  but we can and must do more  We must hold those guilty of atrocities responsible and ensure they are brought to justice  By closing the current loophole in federal law  this bill takes important steps to rid the world of genocide  Cornyn said     The Genocide Accountability Act is one of three bills introduced by Senator Durbin that gives our government the authority to prosecute individuals found in the United States who have participated in serious human rights abuses anywhere in the world  The other bills  The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act and the Child Soldiers Accountability Act  have both been unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee  The full Senate passed the Child Soldiers Accountability Act earlier this week     Senator Durbin became the Chairman of the first ever congressional committee or subcommittee dealing specifically with human rights law this January  The Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law has jurisdiction over all human rights laws and polices  including genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes  torture and human trafficking  The Subcommittees first hearing was on genocide  It has also held hearings on human trafficking  child soldiers  U S  enforcement of human rights law and a provision in immigration law know as the material support bar
