Wednesday  January 23  2008    Washington  D C    All ten Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today sent a letter  written by Assistant Majority Leader and Judiciary Committee member Dick Durbin  D IL   to Attorney General Michael Mukasey asking that he provide an opinion as to whether the interrogation technique known as waterboarding is illegal under U S  law  Mukasey was repeatedly asked questions by about waterboarding by Senate Judiciary Committee members during his confirmation hearings last October  He promised that if confirmed  he would review waterboarding and other interrogation techniques to determine whether or not they were illegal  In the letter  Durbin and the other senators wrote  On October 23  2007  we wrote to you to ask you whether the abusive interrogation technique known as waterboarding is illegal     You said that you could not offer an opinion on the legality of waterboarding based on hypothetical facts and circumstances because you had not been briefed on the government s interrogation techniques        and  you committed that  if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law        It has been over two months since  you were confirmed   ample time for you to study this issue and reach a conclusion  The senators noted that Mukaseys silence on the issue poses a threat to American servicemembers  Why is this important  Because the way we treat our prisoners determines how captured Americans are treated  said Durbin  It matters because Americans expect the top law enforcement officer in the country to give a straight answer  Next Wednesday  January 30  Mukasey will make his first appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee since his confirmation  Text of the letter appears below   Dear Attorney General Mukasey  On October 23  2007  we wrote to you to ask you whether the abusive interrogation technique known as waterboarding is illegal  On October 30  you responded that waterboarding and other abusive techniques seem over the line or  on a personal basis  repugnant to me  You said that you could not offer an opinion on the legality of waterboarding based on hypothetical facts and circumstances because you had not been briefed on the government s interrogation techniques  Legal opinions should treat real issues  I have not been briefed on techniques used in any classified interrogation program conducted by any government agency  However  you committed that  if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law  You were confirmed as Attorney General on November 8  2007  On November 9  Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham sent you a letter stating  The scenarios you previously described as hypothetical are no longer so  and you now have the benefit of full access to classified programs and memoranda  We urge you to acquaint yourself immediately with these matters and take the opportunity to make clear that waterboarding is illegal and can never be employed  It has been over two months since then  ample time for you to study this issue and reach a conclusion  On November 27  State Department Legal Advisor John Bellinger said you were giving high priority to reviewing interrogation techniques  claiming  I think there is a growing recognition     about the need for greater clarity about what is permitted and what is prohibited  Your failure to say whether waterboarding is legal has placed Judge Mark Filip  the nominee for Deputy Attorney General  in a difficult position  When Judge Filip was asked at his confirmation hearing whether waterboarding was unlawful  he was unwilling to answer because you were studying the issue   T he Attorney General of the United States is presently reviewing that legal question   I dont think I can  or anyone who could potentially  be  considered for his deputy  could get out in front of him on that question while its under review  We are concerned that your silence poses a more serious threat to American servicemembers  As we noted in our October 23rd letter  Your unwillingness to state that waterboarding is illegal may place Americans at risk of being subjected to this abusive technique  If the United States does not explicitly and publicly condemn waterboarding  it will be more difficult to argue that enemy forces cannot waterboard American prisoners  This concern was highlighted recently during The Legal Rights of Guantanamo Detainees  What Are They  Should They Be Changed  and Is an End in Sight  a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Terrorism  Technology and Homeland Security on December 11  Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann  Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions  refused to say whether it would be legal for the Iranian government to subject an American citizen to waterboarding  He also testified that it is possible that information obtained through waterboarding could be introduced as evidence in a military commission  In stark contrast to Brigadier General Hartmanns refusal to say whether it would be illegal to waterboard an American  Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell recently opined that waterboarding would be torture if used against him  According to The New Yorker  DNI McConnell said  If I had water draining into my nose  oh God  I just can t imagine how painful  Whether its torture by anybody elses definition  for me it would be torture  Please respond to the following questions  Is the use of waterboading as an interrogation technique illegal under U S  law  including treaty obligations  Based on your review of other coercive interrogation techniques and the legal analysis authorizing their use  what is your assessment of whether such techniques comply with the law  Thank you for your time and consideration  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  Patrick J
