                                                                                                                                                                                                 Thursday  August 24  2006   Chicago  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and U S  Representative Daniel Lipinski  D IL  today said President Bush   s Executive Order requiring the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  and three other agencies to disclose to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries the cost of medical procedures    did not go far enough      Durbin and Lipinski urged HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt    to exercise the option President Bush has given you and publish these prices in a manner easily accessible to all Americans          In a letter to Secretary Leavitt  Durbin and Lipinski wrote     It is the 46 million Americans without health insurance who most need this information   Not only are uninsured Americans often paying out of pocket for their care  they are paying rates far higher than insured Americans because they do not have access to the reduced rates negotiated by insurance companies          Durbin and Lipinski noted that the Executive Order failed to address another important issue   the price Medicare is paying for prescription drugs      Given the investment the federal government is now making in prescription drugs  it is imperative that we receive the best possible price   Without knowing the actual prices that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  is paying for pharmaceuticals in Medicare and Medicaid  it is impossible to compare     they wrote       Lipinski and Durbin are the chief sponsors of bipartisan legislation requiring hospitals to report the prices of the 25 most frequently performed in patient and out patient procedures and the 50 most commonly prescribed drugs  The Hospital Price Reporting and Disclosure Act will provide uninsured Americans with information to protect them against price gouging         The full text of the letter to Secretary Leavitt is attached        August 24  2006      The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  U S  Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave   SW Washington  DC 20201      Dear Secretary Leavitt       As the lead Democratic sponsors of the Hospital Price Disclosure Act  we applaud the President   s Executive Order of August 22  2006  requiring your agency to make available to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries information regarding the prices paid for medical procedures   However  we are concerned that the Order did not go far enough       We were disappointed the Order failed to require your agency to make pricing information available to the general public   It is the 46 million Americans without health insurance who most need this information   Not only are uninsured Americans often paying out of pocket for their care  they are paying rates far higher than insured Americans because they do not have access to the reduced rates negotiated by insurance companies         As you know  there is often a great disparity between what different hospitals charge for specific procedures and drugs   When California implemented a price disclosure law  they found that one hospital charged only  120 for a chest x ray while a neighboring hospital charged more than  1 500   With many American families faced with the prospect of bankruptcy as a result of medical illness  the savings they could achieve by comparing prices is meaningful   We urge you to exercise the option President Bush has given you and publish these prices in a manner easily accessible to all Americans       We were also disappointed that the Executive Order did not require pharmaceutical price transparency   Given the investment the federal government is now making in prescription drugs  it is imperative that we receive the best possible price   Without knowing the actual prices that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  is paying for pharmaceuticals in Medicare and Medicaid  it is impossible to compare       As you know  your agency only requires plans to report rebates  in the aggregate    Therefore  CMS has no knowledge of the drug specific rebates the plans are receiving   Why is your agency not requiring this information so we can compare the net price CMS is paying for Lipitor in Medicare against the net price state Medicaid  programs are paying for Lipitor   Or  compare prices between the Veterans Administration   s program and the Medicare program   We urge you to implement price transparency in pharmaceutical pricing       We would appreciate hearing your thoughts on these two important issues         Sincerely         Richard J  Durbin      United States Senator        Daniel Lipinski      United States Representative
