Thursday  August 10  2006   TUSCOLA AND MATTOON       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   U S  Representative Tim Johnson  R IL   DCEO Director Jack Lavin and others met today with local officials in Tuscola and Mattoon to discuss the recent selection of local sites as finalists for the location of a  1 billion  first of a kind  near zero emissions coal fueled power plant known as FutureGen   In today   s meeting  local  state and federal officials came together to discuss potential next steps for the project        FutureGen is the number one federal energy priority for downstate Illinois  and we are here today to work with local  state and federal officials to make downstate Illinois the number one choice for the FutureGen Alliance     said Durbin      Tuscola and Mattoon have the coal and the commitment needed to make this vision a reality           I am encouraged at the coordination among local  state and congressional offices     Johnson said      There are certain elements that must be in place to make this project occur  such as the geology  transportation network  a positive policy framework and economic incentives  From both sides of the aisle  our leaders have worked hard to make this happen  There are less tangible assets in these communities that may be less quantifiable but are nonetheless essential ingredients  and those involve the integrity and Midwestern work ethic of the people who will build and operate this state of the art facility that is so critical to our economies and our environment        Two weeks ago  The Department of Energy selected two Illinois communities     Tuscola and Mattoon     to move forward to the next step of the selection process  Sites were evaluated on criteria  including the size of the site  the site   s access to transportation routes  and the site   s proximity to geographically well suited areas  Since April  teams of renowned U S  and international scientists have reviewed the proposals from 12 communities vying for the FutureGen project     FutureGen is a  1 billion government industry project which will produce the first emissions free coal generation plant of its kind  The Department of Energy developed a short list of the most qualified states earlier this year  and is expected to make a final site selection in mid  to late  2007     The President   s FY2007 budget made a commitment of  54 million for FutureGen  An additional  200 million will become available on October 1  2007 to support continued funding   Non Federal sources will be required to match funds for initial planning and research at least 20 percent     Illinois has almost one eighth of the coal reserves in the United States and one quarter of the nation   s bituminous coal reserves  The Illinois coal industry produces approximately 35 million tons of coal and generates more than  1 billion in gross revenues  Currently  recoverable coal reserves in the state of Illinois amount to more than 30 billion tons  The valuable mineral underlies 65 percent of the state   s surface     Durbin and Johnson noted that Illinois geology is also well suited for the carbon trapping technology that the FutureGen project would need to develop   Illinois is home to oil and gas reserves and deep saline aquifers that can capture and sequester carbon dioxide     In addition  Southern Illinois University operates its Coal Research Center in Carbondale  one of the top such centers in the country   which conducts a wide range of studies that deal with the commercial development of coal  The center   s work includes improvements of coal cleaning processes  the reduction of air pollution from coal fired power plants  the reduction of solid waste residues from coal burning  and the development of products from those residues     In early December of 2005  Secretary Bodman announced that the Department of Energy would be moving forward with the project  after signing an agreement with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance  a group of coal and energy companies with investment commitments to the project  The FutureGen Initiative was initially announced by President Bush in February 2003  Over the next year  site selection  design activities  and environmental analyses will lay the groundwork for final project design  construction  and operation


