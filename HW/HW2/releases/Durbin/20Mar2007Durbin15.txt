20  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Arlen Specter  R PA  and Congressman John Tierney  D MA  today unveiled two bipartisan bills   one dealing with Senate races  the other focused on House contests   to restore public confidence in the Congressional elections process  Both bills would allow qualified candidates to receive campaign financing from a public fund instead of from lobbyists and other special interests   Today the amount of money spent in top ten competitive Senate races averages  34 million per campaign   double what it was just four years ago  It takes a mountain of money   about  7 million on average   even to lose a Senate campaign  This is not sustainable  said Durbin  People who say the public shouldn t have to pay for elections are missing the point   The American people already pay for elections   in ways that favor incumbents and special interests and in a Congressional agenda spawned too many times by those who finance our campaigns  Public financing will cost us only a fraction of what the current system costs   Durbin s legislation  known as the Fair Elections Now Act would create a voluntary system that gives Senate candidates the option to stop dialing for dollars and attending fundraisers  without unilaterally disarming against a well financed opponent   For those who participate  fundraising would be limited to raising seed money in amounts of no more than  100 per person to pay for campaign start up costs   In addition  participating candidates would be required to demonstrate sufficient public support to merit Fair Elections funding by raising qualifying contributions of  5 each from a minimum number of state residents  based on the population of the state    Having demonstrated their viability  the candidates would be eligible to receive Fair Elections funds   This legislation establishes a formula for determining the level of public funding provided to qualifying candidates for the primary and general election cycles   The amount would vary based on the population of the state  with the allocation for the primary equaling two thirds of the allocation for the general election  The allocations would also be adjusted for the cost differences in the various media markets covering each state   Participants would receive vouchers for purchasing broadcast air time and would receive a 20  discount below the lowest unit cost on all advertising purchased near the end of the primary and general campaigns   The legislation is modeled after the Fair Elections type systems that have already been implemented at the state and local levels such as those in Arizona and Maine   Five years ago today  the Senate passed the McCain Feingold campaign finance reforms banning huge soft money donations to political parties  Earlier this year  we passed lobbying reforms  said Durbin  But the truth is  we can pass all the lobbying and ethics reforms in the world and it won t solve the real problem   Special interest money will always find new loopholes to work its way into campaigns until we change the system fundamentally   The Fair Elections Now Act is supported by a wide range of
