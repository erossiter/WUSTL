 2007        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent a letter today to the Acting Chairman of the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   Nancy Nord  asking for information on the steps taken by the Commission regarding a toy which has caused more than two dozen life threatening injuries to children and at least one death  The toy  Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets  uses powerful magnets which  if dislodged  can be swallowed and attract internally  causing severe internal injuries        These events raise serious concerns about the ability of CPSC to protect consumers from products that have proven to be dangerous   Durbin said   This case in particular is critically important because children and their parents rely on the agency to ensure the products they use are safe  We need to know went wrong in this instance and make the needed changes to protect our children        In March of last year  the CPSC announced a voluntary recall of nearly 4 million sets of the popular toy   The move was prompted by the death of a 20 month old child in November of 2005 who was killed after swallowing tiny magnets that had broken loose from a Magnetix toy   Rose Art Industries continued to sell the product  despite the known hazard  and on April 19th  2007 an additional recall of another 4 million units was announced  The case was profiled in a recent series of articles in the Chicago Tribune       Text of the letter appears below         May 8  2007   The Honorable Nancy Nord  Acting Chairman  U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  4330 East West Highway  Bethesda  Maryland 20814   Dear Chairman Nord    I am writing in response to a recent series of newspaper stories about the recall of a toy that has caused more than two dozen life threatening injuries to children and been responsible for the death of at least one child   The toy described in the articles is Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets  a construction toy that uses powerful neodymium magnets       On March 31  2006  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  and the manufacturer  Rose Art Industries of Livingston  New Jersey  announced a recall of approximately 3 8 million sets of the toy   The recall announcement identified the toy as a hazard because the tiny magnets in the building sets can fall out and  if ingested by small children  can attract to each other and cause internal perforation or blockage  which can lead to serious illness or death   The announcement followed a series of reported incidents involving the small magnets  including the death of a child in November 2005 and four serious injuries       For some reason  following the March 31  2006 voluntary recall  Rose Art Industries  Inc  continued to sell Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets that still contained small powerful neodymium magnets that easily separated from the building pieces   Again  these products caused serious  life threatening injuries to children who ingested the magnets   On April 19  2007  Rose Art Industries  Inc  and CPSC announced an expanded recall of 4 million units  Reportedly  fifteen of these injuries occurred after the child s death       Following both recalls  retailers were quoted as saying that they had not been notified of a recall   The product continues to be available on the shelves of toy stores   In addition  consumer advocates and others have criticized the manufacturing and testing standards promulgated for toys that use small magnetic pieces       This recall has raised concerns about CPSC s actions in this case and the Commission s ability to protect the public from risks associated with the consumer products under its jurisdiction   Please respond to the following questions in writing      1  Please provide a timeline of incidents  complaints  notification of injuries  actions by CPSC  actions by the retailers  actions by the company  and other pertinent events regarding Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets   2  Has the CPSC lab tested any of these Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets to ensure their safety   If not  why not   3  Between the March 31  2006 recall and the April 19  2007 recall  Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets continued to be available to consumers   What steps did CPSC take between these two recalls to ensure that the product did not continue to pose a health risk to children   4  According to media reports  the manufacturer of Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets  Rose Art Industries  Inc   did not notify or attempt to notify some of the largest toy retailers about the recall of its product   What are the requirements for recalling firms to notify distributors and retailers of recalls   Did Rose Art Industries  Inc  comply with this requirement   Beyond issuing a press release  what can the Commission do to notify consumers and retailers   5  Did CPSC conduct any surveillance of Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets at retail stores to ascertain whether defective products had been removed from store shelves   What are the Commission s policies on auditing product recalls   How frequently do audits occur   6  From reviewing the CPSC recall website  it appears that small magnets in toys have posed a health risk to children in other products as well   In promulgating voluntary standards for manufacturers of toys using small  powerful magnets  what testing standards and labeling suggestions is the CPSC considering   Is the CPSC considering banning in toys magnets small enough to easily ingest   What is the CPSC s timeline for generating these standards   7  Other products  including playpens and soapmaking kits  have also repeatedly caused injuries over lengthy periods of time   In fact  of the more than 360 000 injury reports CPSC receives annually from hospital emergency rooms  only approximately 1 percent are the subject of CPSC investigations   Have you sought additional resources for compliance and enforcement activities   If not  why not   8  In issuing a recall  what is the Commission s responsibility to work with the recalling firm   Can the Commission issue a press release announcing a recall without the recalling firm s permission   How much time does the recalling firm have to review and edit the language in a CPSC press release   How much does it slow the work of the CPSC if the Commission doesn t accept a firm s edits   9  If a firm fails to take action to recall a dangerous product  what authorities does the Commission have to order a recall   How quickly could the Commission act in these instances   10  From media reports  it appears that the Commission was notified multiple times by consumers about the dangers of this toy   However  the Commission failed to recall the product until after the death of a young child   What are the Commission s policies once it receives a consumer report of a dangerous product   How many of these complaints did the CPSC receive on this product and on magnetic toys in general   How many of these types of complaints does CPSC receive annually   How many are investigated by the Commission   11  Do you believe current federal statutory authority restricts CPSC from being able to take action quickly and decisively in order to prevent further injuries or death in a given situation such as this   12  Based on your experience with Magnetix  what steps do you plan to take to  or are considering  to better protect consumer safety    Thank your for your attention to this matter   I look forward to a response within 15 days       Sincerely   Richard J Durbin  United States Senator
