December 7  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today were joined by a bipartisan group of Senators in calling on the Federal Transit Administration to conduct a study to determine the infrastructure needs of Americas largest rail transit systems  The study is intended to provide funding recommendations on what is needed to bring these rail lines up to a state of good repair  A request for this rail study was included in this years Senate Transportation Appropriations bill  In todays letter  the Senators wrote  Unfortunately  the demands of increased ridership and aging infrastructure along our largest rail transit lines are preventing us from achieving the full economic  environmental  and congestion relief benefits of these existing systems  As we begin to consider the next transportation bill  it is important to have a full accounting of what it will take to bring these older rail transit systems to a state of good repair  Cities like Chicago  New York  San Francisco and Philadelphia estimate their capital needs in the billions of dollars for rail lines that are 100 years old in some cities  For example  in Chicago  the average rail car is 23 years old  and nearly one third exceeds the 25 year maximum recommended by federal authorities  The Chicago Transit Authority estimates that it needs more than  8 7 billion to fix or replace track  bridges  signal and stations as well as to buy new trains in order reach a state of good repair  Other Senators signing on to todays letter include  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Robert Casey  D PA   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Christopher Dodd  D CT   John Kerry  D MA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Joe Lieberman  I CT   Robert Menendez  D NJ   Charles Schumer  D NY   and Arlen Specter  R PA   The text of the letter appears below  December 7  2007 The Honorable James Simpson  Administrator  Federal Transit Administration  1200 New Jersey Ave  SE   4th  5th Floors   East Building  Washington  DC 20590 Dear Administrator Simpson  We are writing to request that the FTA conduct a study to determine the infrastructure needs of our countrys largest rail transit systems  The countrys ten largest transit agencies facilitate almost 5 5 billion passenger trips every year  Most of these trips take place along aging rail that are in dire need of capital investment  Cities like New York  Chicago  San Francisco  Philadelphia  and others estimate their capital needs in the billions of dollars for rail lines that are 100 years old in some cities  This aging rail infrastructure is not keeping up with demand  There were 78 million more trips taken on public transit during the first six months of 2007 compared to the same time last year  Heavy  light  and commuter rail carried the most passengers and had the largest percentage increases in ridership over this time  Unfortunately  the demands of increased ridership and aging infrastructure along our largest rail transit lines are preventing us from achieving the full economic  environmental  and congestion relief benefits of these existing systems  As we begin to consider the next transportation bill  it is important to have a full accounting of what it will take to bring these older rail transit systems to a state of good repair  During consideration of the FY 2008 Transportation HUD Appropriations bill  the Senate adopted an amendment that directed FTA to study and determine the state of our oldest and largest rail transit systems  This study also included an analysis of the federal investment into rail modernization and asked the FTA to report back with funding recommendations to bring these rail lines up to a state of good repair  The damage to the livability and economic viability of our urban areas would be severe if our rail transit systems are allowed to deteriorate  Understanding the scope of what it will take to modernize our rail transit infrastructure will allow us to plan for the future and ensure that workers  employers  students  and senior citizens can have a clean  efficient  and inexpensive mass transportation system that will keep us competitive in the global economy  Sincerely  Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
