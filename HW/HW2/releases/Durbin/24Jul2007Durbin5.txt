                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  July 24  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   Today  the U S  Senate passed the Higher Education Act which included a proposal authored by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  to create a student loan repayment program for law school graduates who commit to serve as criminal prosecutors or public defenders  Todays Senate passed bill also included key components of Durbins Sunshine Act and Campus Safety bill    Today prosecutors and public defenders offices are having serious difficulty hiring and retaining good lawyers because students are leaving law school with mortgage sized student loan debts  said Durbin  When prosecutor and public defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep experienced ones  their ability to protect the public is compromised  The federal government has a responsibility to help make public service law an affordable option for talented  experienced lawyers who want to work in the criminal justice system    With the average law graduate carrying a staggering amount of student loan debt  78 763 for those who attended private schools  and  51 056 for public schools  Durbins bill would establish a student loan repayment option for full time State and local prosecutors and State  local and Federal public defenders who agree to serve for a minimum of three years  Federal prosecutors are already eligible for loan relief through existing Federal programs    This legislation is incredibly important to prosecutor and defender offices throughout the country  It will help us tremendously in attracting and retaining the best and brightest attorneys to work in the criminal justice system  This will contribute to the safety of our citizens  said Paul A  Logli  State s Attorney for Winnebago County and Chairman of the Board of the National District Attorney s Association    Durbin cited the contrast between the loan burdens carried by today s law school graduates and the entry level salaries for prosecutors and public defenders as evidence of the need for relief  More than 80  of law students borrow to pay for their law degree  and the amount borrowed by many students exceeds  100 000  Many law graduates also carry unpaid debt from their undergraduate studies  At the same time  the median entry level salary for State prosecuting attorneys is  46 000  and the median entry level salary for public defenders is  43 000     This is an important step to assist in both the recruitment and retention of quality lawyers for both prosecutor and public defender offices  said Ted Gottfried  the Illinois State Appellate Defender     Todays Senate passed Higher Education Act also included major provisions from a bill Senator Durbin introduced earlier this year  the Student Loan Sunshine Act  The Student Loan Sunshine Act reforms the student loan system by making sure that lenders will be prohibited from providing payments  gifts  and other inducements to colleges and financial aid administrators that create conflicts of interest  It will also ensure that students and their families have all the facts and can feel confident that theyre receiving the best deal on their college loan  The proposal provides students and their families access to information about preferred lender lists  special arrangements between lenders and colleges and terms and conditions of loans     The Higher Education Act also included key provisions from legislation Durbin introduced shortly after the Virginia Tech shootings earlier this year  the Campus Law Enforcement Emergency Response Act  The proposal would ensure that all colleges and universities develop emergency response procedures and campus notification systems  and test them at least annually
