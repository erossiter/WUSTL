ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ILLINOIS SHERIFF   S ASSOCIATION METH AWARENESS CAMPAIGN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Friday  March 24  2006    MOUNT VERNON  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced  180 000 in federal funding for the Illinois Sheriff   s Association to help raise awareness about methamphetamine   one of the deadliest  most powerfully addictive and rapidly spreading drug threats facing our country   Durbin included funding in the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program in the Fiscal Year  FY  2006 appropriations bill for the U S  Departments of Commerce  Justice and State        Methamphetamine is often cited as the number one challenge facing sheriffs     Durbin said      This funding will help the Illinois Sheriff   s Association spread the word about the dangers of meth in rural communities across Illinois        Durbin cosponsored the Combat Meth Act which was incorporated in the conference agreement to renew the PATRIOT Act and signed into law on March 9  Pub  L  109 177    This new federal law includes important provisions which will provide critical new tools and resources to help combat methamphetamine        It   s not just the drugs themselves and the users     Durbin said      It   s the clean up of dangerous chemicals  the theft of anhydrous ammonia from farmers  the retail theft of cold medicines in bulk   The sheriffs are left to fight meth on several fronts and we need to provide the resources necessary to effectively combat the problem        Last week  Durbin co sponsored three amendments that were adopted in the U S  Senate on the FY 2007 budget resolution   One supports  99 million in additional funding called for in the recently enacted Combat Meth Act for meth    hot spots    to help train state and local law enforcement officials to investigate and lock up meth offenders and fund personnel and equipment for enforcement  prosecution  and environmental clean up   Another amendment increases the existing funds for meth hot spots to the fully authorized level of  63 million  which the Administration cut by  23 million  The third amendment calls for funding the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants at  900 million  which the Administration has sought to eliminate entirely     The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group pays almost half of its agents with funding from Byrne grants  In 2004  this regional task force was responsible for more than 27 percent of the State   s meth lab seizures  In a recent success of Byrne grant funding  Glen Carbon Police coordinated with the Illinois State Police Meth Task Force to discover the largest lab in the village   s history  In this incident  local authorities raided a meth lab that proved to be capable of producing up to 6 000 grams of finished methamphetamine        When you look at the successes law enforcement has had using Byrne Grants  it is baffling that this Administration seeks to eliminate these critical funds in its budget proposal     Durbin said     The number of meth labs seized by law enforcement authorities in Illinois grew from 24 labs in 1997 to 403 labs in 2000 to 1 099 labs in 2003   Illinois State Police reported 962 lab seizures in 2004 and nearly 1000 meth labs in 2005   more than double the number uncovered in 2000   Since 1997  the quantity of methamphetamines seized annually by the ISP has increased over tenfold     The number of methamphetamine submissions to the Illinois State Police crime laboratories increased from 628 in 1998 to 3 250 in 2003     more than a five fold increase  The number of counties submitting meth also increased during that period  from 73 in 1998 to 96 in 2003     When specific regions were examined  findings indicate that rural counties have experienced the greatest impact of methamphetamine  Rural counties have been greatly impacted by the presence and growth of methamphetamine  and are responsible for driving the escalating levels of methamphetamine arrests  drug seizures and submissions  clandestine lab seizures  methamphetamine commitments to Illinois Department of Corrections and methamphetamine treatment admissions     Methamphetamine is the only drug for which rural areas in Illinois have higher rates of drug seizures and treatment admissions than urban areas   In fiscal year 2003  rural counties accounted for 79 percent of persons sentenced to prison for meth related offenses     Another disturbing implication is the effect on families   In 2004  more than half of the children entering foster care in some areas of rural southeastern Illinois were forced into the program because their caretakers were meth abusers  Officials expect to encounter even more children in homes where meth labs exist in coming years
