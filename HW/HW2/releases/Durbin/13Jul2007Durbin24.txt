13  2007       A major amendment was unanimously passed by the Senate late yesterday  which included United States Senator Dick Durbins  D IL  efforts strengthening the rights of service members and veterans suffering from traumatic brain injuries  TBI   Durbin  a leader in the Senate for improved care for victims of TBI  added provisions developing a standard of care for TBI cases  introduced a bipartisan bill  The Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act  S 1349   which requires the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  to implement a comprehensive program to diagnose  treat and rehabilitate service members and veterans who have suffered a service related traumatic brain injury  Todays amendment includes all of the major provisions of Durbins bill  Durbin added additional provisions developing a standard of care for TBI cases  allowing for medical referrals for TBI patients  and establishing a set of patients  rights for medical care  We ve promised these brave men and women that if they take an oath to defend America  we ll stand by them when they come home  Sadly we ve broken our promise time and again  Durbin said  This amendment will help  Today we re taking an important step forward by introducing a comprehensive military and veterans health care bill that will aid thousands of Americas service members and veterans dealing with TBI  Durbins TBI provisions were part of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  which was added as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill  currently on the floor  Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IEDs  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBIs are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases  The Durbin added the following provisions to the Wounded Warriors Act  Establishes a Standard of Care   Each individual in the program shall be provided the highest quality of care possible based on the medical judgment of qualified medical professionals in facilities that most appropriately meet the specific needs of the individual  And they shall be rehabilitated to the fullest extent possible using the most up to date medical technology  medical rehabilitation practices  and medical expertise available    Referrals   DOD would be required to provide a referral to a medical professional inside of DOD or the VA when requested by a TBI patient  This will allow patients to get a second opinion with regards to their care if they feel the standard of care is not being met    Patient Rights   DOD would be required to inform patients and their families of their rights with respect to the receipt of medical care  options available to such members for rehabilitation  referral for second opinion if the patient and family feels they are not receiving the standard of care  and an administrative review of any decision with regard to care provided by DOD  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act includes the following provisions from Senator Durbins original bill  Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists    Outreach   The act will also require DOD to conduct education and outreach to families of members of the Armed Forces on a range of matters relating to TBI including detection  mitigation  and treatment  as well as train family members with respect to care for combat disabled service members    Seamless Transition  The bill requires the DOD and VA to develop a joint plan for the seamless transition of service members from DOD health care to VA health care and require the government to use electronic medical records to ease the transition    Enhanced Availability of Care  Under this bill  any former or current member of the Armed Forces with a severe combat related injury or illness will be entitled to medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services as if they were a member of the Armed Forces for a period of 3 years beginning on the date they leave active duty    Partnerships  The bill allows the DOD to enter into partnerships  agreements  or other arrangements with the VA  institutions of higher education  and other appropriate public and private entities to prevent  diagnose  mitigate  treat  and rehabilitate service members suffering from a traumatic brain injury  The partnerships can also be used to help train medical staffs  accomplish research  and develop outreach strategies    Authorization   The bill authorizes  5 million for the creation of a Center of Excellence in Prevention  Diagnosis  Mitigation  Treatment  and Rehabilitation of Traumatic Brain Injury  It also authorizes  50 million relating to the improved diagnosis  treatment  and rehabilitation of members of the Armed Forces with traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder     17 million of which shall be available for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center    Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbins urging  That amendment as well as Senator Durbin s bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America
