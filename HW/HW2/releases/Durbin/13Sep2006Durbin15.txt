WITH TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY NOMINEE MARY PETERS TO DISCUSS ILLINOIS PRIORITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  September 13  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Transportation Secretary Nominee  Mary Peters  to discuss a number of Illinois transportation priorities  including funding for Amtrak  modernization at Chicago   s O   Hare International Airport and Chicago transit improvements          Mary Peters has had a 16 year career in the Arizona Department of Transportation and a strong record of working closely with former Transportation Secretary Mineta when she served as Chief of the Federal Highway Administration     said Durbin      She understands the importance of investing in transportation infrastructure  and I am hopeful she will bring that understanding to her work at the Department of Transportation          In today   s meeting  Durbin stressed the need to provide full funding for Amtrak   President Bush released a budget earlier this year that included only  900 million  of the  1 6 needed to maintain the railroad s current operation   Last month  the House of Representatives set aside  1 1 billion for Amtrak while the Senate version of the bill boosted funding to  1 4 billion   The final version of the bill will be negotiated in coming weeks          Amtrak is vitally important to Illinois     said Durbin      Unfortunately  the President and his Administration are once again attempting to privatize and eventually eliminate Amtrak rail service   Year after year  these political games drive Amtrak to the brink of insolvency and Congress is forced to ride to the rescue   I look forward to working with Ms  Peters to secure full funding for Amtrak this year          Durbin noted that more than 3 million people in Illinois boarded Amtrak in 2005  making the passenger rail line one of the most important modes of transportation in the state  Every intrastate route in Illinois has seen significant increases in the past few years in ridership  and it is vital that Amtrak receive the proper level of federal funding          Last year  Amtrak service in Illinois saw a major increase in ridership     Durbin said      This year  the state recognized the need for expansion and responded by offering to work with Amtrak to increase service to nearly 30 communities   The State   s commitment will provide for the first Midwest Amtrak expansion in almost 20 years and has even prompted proposals to reinstate service in large metropolitan areas  such as Rockford   If the House and the President   s proposals are adopted  Illinois    Amtrak expansion will be stopped dead in its tracks          In today   s meeting  Durbin also asked Peters to support the O Hare Modernization Program   A modernized O Hare will mean an additional 195 000 jobs and  18 billion in annual economic activity in Chicagoland   That is on top of the existing 450 000 jobs and  38 billion in economic activity that O   Hare already creates for the region and the state of Illinois   Moreover  the project is expected to save the airlines approximately  370 million and passengers  380 million each year          Last November  former Secretary Mineta announced over  300 million for the O   Hare Modernization Program     said Durbin      The Administration has a strong record of supporting expansion at O   Hare and I am hopeful that Ms  Peters will recognize O   Hare expansion as an investment that benefits both regional aviation travel and the national and world   s passenger aviation system          Durbin and Peters also discussed critical transit funding for the Chicago area   CTA  Metra  and Pace make up the 2nd largest transit system in the country with over 575 million rides each year   CTA has 1 5 million trips per weekday  Metra makes 299 thousand trips per weekday  Pace makes 119 thousand trips per weekday   The Illinois lawmaker noted that as more cities begin to realize the importance of transit in the 21st Century  the Department of Transportation is receiving an increasing number of applicants looking to draw from a limited amount of money   It is important that Chicago continue to receive their fair share of transit funding       Mary Peters spent sixteen years with the Arizona Department of Transportation  and for three years  she headed the agency   In 2001  she became the Chief of the Federal Highway Administration  FHWA   and was widely praised for working closely with Secretary Mineta and Congress to win approval for the  286 billion highway and surface transporation legislation   Since she left the FHWA in November of 2005  Peters has been national director for transportation policy and consulting in the Phoenix office of Omaha based architectural  engineering and consulting firm HDR Inc   Ms  Peters is a fourth generation  native Arizonan   She and her husband  Terry  have three grown children
