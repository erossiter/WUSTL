REPAIRING THE NEW MEDICARE PLAN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  January 25  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced legislation to repair the new flawed Medicare drug plan that is currently preventing many low income seniors and disabled individuals from purchasing their prescription drugs   Durbin called for immediate action to eliminate gaps in prescription drug coverage that low income seniors and individuals with disabilities are experiencing and to reimburse states  pharmacies  and individual beneficiaries for costs they have had to pay out of pocket          Thousands of low income and disabled seniors have been told by pharmacies across Illinois that they are not eligible for the low income program  or that the drugs they need are not available on their formulary   These are our most vulnerable seniors  yet many have walked away without their medication          Durbin said it has been estimated that as many as 20 000 of Illinois    most vulnerable seniors are having problems getting access to their medicines because of the bureaucratic confusion caused by the new Medicare drug benefit   Approximately 217 000 seniors in Illinois who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid were supposed to be automatically enrolled in a plan through the new Medicare prescription drug benefit and required to pay only  1 for generic drugs and  3 for brand name drugs       Durbin is an original co sponsor of the Requiring Emergency Pharmaceutical Access for Individual Relief  REPAIR  Act  which was authored by Sen  John D  Rockefeller  D WV  and would      Require all prescription drug plans to provide new enrollees with at least 30 days of prescription drugs during their transition to Medicare   Provide federal reimbursement for states  pharmacies  and beneficiaries for out of pocket costs because the Medicare prescription drug benefit has failed to cover their costs   Require CMS to have one dedicated employee stationed at every Senior Health Insurance Plan site to assist beneficiaries and counselors    and to act as a liaison for oversight and enforcement of the prescription drug benefit   Require the spending of necessary resources to reduce the wait times on calls to 1 800 Medicare     Durbin has advocated a series of improvements assist Medicare beneficiaries       Last November  Durbin asked Secretary Leavitt to alert seniors visiting the Medicare Web site that drug prices are subject to fluctuation and recommend they check them regularly      I   m troubled by the fluctuation of drug prices   Seniors are locked into a plan for one year  but they are making decisions based on a momentary snapshot of drug prices   Plans are allowed to change prices and seniors are stuck paying them        Last year  given the difficulty many seniors were having with the complicated enrollment process  Durbin introduced legislation to give beneficiaries until December 31  2006 to make a decision about a plan     with no financial penalties   Currently  financial penalties start to incur in May 2006   The bill would also give seniors a one time chance to change plans or drop coverage in the first year in case they make a mistake and buy a plan that turns out to be wrong for them   Finally  it would prevent employers from dropping retiree coverage for anyone who enrolls in a Part D drug plan without knowing it could cause them to lose their existing benefits       Durbin has also introduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act  which creates a drug benefit in Medicare so seniors have the added choice of receiving their drugs through Medicare   The bill also requires that Medicare use its purchasing power to negotiate discounts with the pharmaceutical companies       Both bills have been endorsed by senior citizen and consumer groups like the Alliance for Retired Americans  the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  and Consumers Union       Durbin said he would like to introduce legislation that would require plans to stick by their original quotes unless the price decreases  so seniors  many of whom are on a fixed income  will not be hit with unexpected additional charges that may wreak havoc on their budgets          Even as we work to improve the Medicare drug benefit  I want to help Illinois    seniors deal with the existing program     Durbin said      We need simplicity  efficiency  convenience and access   The private market has not provided that  it is time to let Medicare try          Extensive information about the Medicare drug benefit is posted on
