30  2006           In a bipartisan letter to President Bush  more than 30 Senators called on the Administration to expand its efforts to help end the    continuing genocidal violence in Darfur  Sudan      The letter was spearheaded by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL           The situation     the Senators wrote     remains disastrous and the lives and well being of millions hang in the balance   We write to strongly urge that you take immediate steps to develop options for deploying additional international peacekeepers  sustain pressure on the Government of Sudan  and ensure adequate funding of the peacekeeping mission in Darfur        The Senators added that the African Union  AU     has made a strong effort  but needs immediate and sustained assistance and support from the international community  including the U S   European Union  and NATO countries      They noted  however  that troubles facing the AU  including budgetary shortfalls and equipment shortages     undermine the effectiveness of the mission          The Senators urged the President to work with the international community to create    a plan for deploying a transitional support force for the AU     as    additional peacekeeping options are being explored       The letter also urged the President to  maintain sanctions on the government and to extend individual sanctions to those members of the Sudanese government  Janjaweed  and rebel groups who are responsible for the atrocities        President Bush is expected to raise the situation in Darfur  Sudan during his state of the Union address tomorrow       The full text of the letter appears below      January 30  2006   The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    We are writing to you about the continuing genocidal violence in Darfur  Sudan   Over two million people have been driven away from their homes and remain displaced  many in camps that offer little refuge from routine and targeted violence   Systematic gender based violence against women and girls continues unabated  and basic safety and security continue to be denied to Darfurians   Humanitarian organizations trying to work in the region face increasing difficulties in fulfilling their mission   The situation  in short  remains disastrous and the lives and well being of millions hang in the balance   We write to strongly urge that you take immediate steps to develop options for deploying additional international peacekeepers  sustain pressure on the Government of Sudan  and ensure adequate funding of the peacekeeping mission in Darfur       While it has made some progress on the ground  the African Union has struggled to field the personnel  equipment  and command and control functions needed to fulfill its mission   The AU   s effectiveness remains handicapped by a range of problems which were highlighted by the Joint Assessment Team of the European Union  the United Nations  the United States  and the AU   In addition  equipment shortages hamper its mobility and limit communications and thus undermine the effectiveness of the mission   A projected budget shortfall for the AU at the end of March of this year also poses a significant risk to the effectiveness of the mission  and could potentially hamper any further progress in establishing peace       The AU has made a strong effort  but needs immediate and sustained assistance and support from the international community  including the U S   European Union  and NATO countries   We urge you to work with these countries to develop a plan for deploying a transitional support force for the AU   We also urge you to take advantage of the chairmanship of the United Nations Security Council to develop plans for transitioning the AU force to a UN peacekeeping mission  as well as work toward complete implementation of current Security Council Resolutions  including the ban of all offensive military flights over Darfur   Current discussions are already taking place in New York and Brussels  and in light of the drastic nature of events on the ground  urgent and concerted action is required       Stopping violence in Darfur is critical to advancing a comprehensive peace in Sudan   Peace and stability in Sudan is very much in our own strategic interest  and ending the genocide in that country represents a humanitarian and moral imperative   We can no longer wait for existing efforts to improve    We urge you to develop a comprehensive strategy for introducing new peacekeeping forces in to Darfur and to develop options for dealing with deteriorating security conditions in light of continued AU shortcomings       We commend you for your Administration   s commitment to the North South peace process and recognize that its success is highly precarious   The multiple crises of Sudan  especially the ongoing violence in Darfur  demand a sustained commitment from the United States government   Unfortunately  the Government of Sudan continues to engage in and support violence against its own people   It is clear that no progress can be made in Darfur  and elsewhere in Sudan  unless the Government of Sudan cooperates fully in ending its support of violence   We strongly urge you  therefore  both to maintain sanctions on the government and to extend individual sanctions to those members of the Sudanese government  Janjaweed  and rebel groups who are responsible for the atrocities   It must be clear that the U S  and the international community will accept nothing less than a complete cessation of support for violence       We also strongly urge you in both the budget for fiscal year 2007 and the upcoming supplemental appropriations request to seek specifically designated and robust funding to meet the emergency needs in Darfur    The African Union will continue to need assistance after it depletes its operational funds in March  2006  even as additional peacekeeping options are being explored  they are the only forces on the ground now and will serve an essential bridging role if additional international forces join the mission       We look forward to continuing to work with you to make our mutual hopes for peace a reality       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senate   et al
