October 28  2005           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  called on Wal Mart to    reject the harmful strategies    revealed in a secret internal memo that outlines a plan to cut health care expenses by discouraging people with less than perfect health from working for the retail giant       The memo  written by Wal Mart   s Executive Vice President M  Susan Chambers  also discusses a possibility

Lee Scott  Durbin writes     I was pleased earlier this week to read about your recent speech in which you acknowledged that an important part of 21st Century leadership is making quality health care affordable and accessible to working Americans      Durbin added  however  that he was disappointed by the recent confidential memo by Ms  Chambers where she outlined a strategy to push    out less healthy employees    and retain    only those who are less likely to need health care            Durbin also questioned policies outlined in the confidential memo that would increase the gaps in the company s health insurance coverage  saying     Increasing the number of people who are underinsured is not a model of 21st Century leadership             The goals in your speech and the tactics outlined in Ms  Chambers    memo cannot co exist   I urge you to disassociate Wal Mart from Ms  Chambers    report and clarify Wal Mart   s position on health care benefits     Durbin concluded       The full text of Durbin   s letter to CEO Scott appears below         Mr  H  Lee Scott  Chief Executive Officer  Wal Mart  Inc    702 S W  8th Street  Bentonville  AR 72716   Dear Mr  Scott    I was pleased earlier this week to read about your recent speech in which you acknowledged that an important part of 21st century leadership is making quality health care affordable and accessible to working Americans  In that same speech  you discussed a sweeping new plan by Wal Mart to conserve energy  as well as your personal support for an increase in the minimum wage       I have since been disappointed to learn of the confidential  internal memo by Wal Mart  Executive Vice President M  Susan Chambers outlining a plan to cut Wal Mart s health care expenses by discouraging people with less than perfect health from working at your stores and even forcing out some long time  loyal workers  In her memo  Ms  Chambers refers to the  troubling  reality that  the least healthy  workers are  interested in long careers at Wal Mart        The goals in your speech and the tactics outlined in Ms  Chambers  memo cannot co exist   I urge you to disassociate Wal Mart from Ms  Chambers  report and clarify Wal Mart s position on health care benefits       Forty six percent of the children of Wal Mart associates are already uninsured or on Medicaid  And  as Wal Mart acknowledges  38 percent of your workers already spend more than one sixth of their income on health costs  They can t afford to pay more for health care  Lower premiums cannot make up for significantly higher out of pocket expenses  Increasing the number of people who are underinsured is not a model of 21st century leadership       Ms  Chambers is right on one point   Growth in benefits costs is unacceptable   This problem is not limited to Wal Mart  and it can t be solved by Wal Mart alone  All American companies  large and small  are struggling under the weight of ever escalating health care costs       Faced with stagnant wages  declining benefits and skyrocketing energy and health care costs  Wal Mart employees and other hard working Americans can t afford to take on more financial risk or pay sharply higher health care costs       Rather than cleverly packaged but damaging cuts in employee benefits  American workers need a rethinking of how health care is financed and provided  This may include an examination of utilization trends  hospital costs and consolidation  prescription drug spending  medical errors  information technology and other factors  However  at the root  what is needed is a new national commitment to providing affordable health care to all Americans  Ms  Chambers  strategies for pushing out less healthy employees and retaining only those who are less likely to need health care will only exacerbate the problem  not move us toward a solution  Wal Mart  as a leader in the retail industry  can do better       I strongly urge you to reject the harmful strategies secretly outlined in Ms  Chambers  memo and instead embrace the values you outlined in your leadership speech       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  Assistant Democratic Leader  United States
