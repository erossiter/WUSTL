SENATE PASSED BUDGET A  LOSER  FOR ILLINOIS FAMILIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Friday  March 17  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  labeled the budget passed by the Senate as a loser for Illinois families  Durbin said that the budget falls short of making critical investments in education  energy and homeland security   Initiatives championed by Durbin and his Democratic colleagues to make middle class life more affordable  to help veterans and seniors and to keep America secure through policies that are both tough and smart were rejected by the Senate during the budget debate   The budget was approved last night by a largely party line vote of 51 to 49   The federal budget is the spending roadmap for Americas priorities  but this budget is way off course  Durbin said   It is out of sync with the priorities of Illinoisans    doing virtually nothing to make education  health care and energy costs more affordable  It also fails the test when it comes to providing real security from terrorism and ensuring our veterans get the care they need when they return home   Durbin said that the Senate missed an opportunity to make America more energy independent and more secure by voting down an amendment to increase by  500 million funding for biofuels and alternative fuels  like ethanol   More than 40  of the ethanol consumed in the U S  annually is produced from corn grown in Illinois   Increasing the use of domestically produced renewable fuels  like ethanol  is good for Americas economy  good for our energy security  and good for Illinois farmers  Durbin added   Durbin also said that he was disappointed that the Senate failed to provide real relief to seniors and persons with disabilities by improving the Medicare drug benefit   The Senate defeated an amendment to provide Medicare the authority to negotiate directly for better drug prices and to give seniors a choice to receive a drug benefit directly from Medicare  A recent study found that drug prices offered by ten leading private drug plans under the current Medicare drug program are more than 80 percent higher than the prices negotiated by the Veterans Administration   Medicare beneficiaries are stuck with a confusing  costly plan that is a giveaway to the special interests  drug companies are reaping the profits while seniors are paying the price  Durbin said   Seniors deserve a simple  affordable and guaranteed Medicare drug benefit   Vital additional resources for port security were also not approved by the Senate  Durbin noted   Democrats proposed a port security measure that provides an additional  600 million for port security grants   100 million for new inspectors and staff and  105 million for new technologies   Americans are shocked that only six percent of the nine million containers arriving at U S  ports are scanned or inspected each year  Durbin said   With 400 million tons of freight on 7 800 miles of open rail lines in Illinois and another 800 million tons of freight on Illinois 140 000 miles of roads and highways  we must guarantee that every container coming into our ports is inspected   What could be more important than investing in the safety and security of Americans   An effort to make college education more affordable and accessible was also rejected   The amendment would have increased the maximum Pell Grant to  4 500 and restored the Perkins Vocational Education program   In 2005  194 895 Illinois students received just over  449 million in Pell grants   The Senate turned back attempts to improve health care for veterans  Durbin noted   The amendment would have added  1 5 billion for VA health care and rejected increased fees and co payments for some veterans   Durbin said many of these veterans make as little as  26 900 a year   The amendment would have also increased needed funding for mental health care  readjustment counseling and rehabilitative care
