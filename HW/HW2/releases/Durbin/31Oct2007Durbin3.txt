Democrats Discuss Consumer Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wednesday  October 31  2007        United States Senators Mark Pryor  D AR   Dick Durbin  D IL   Bill Nelson  D FL   Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Bob Casey  D PA  held a press conference today to discuss recent remarks by the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  and touted a strong reform package to strengthen the faltering watchdog agency    This year alone  more than 20 million toys have been recalled because they pose hazards to children  The CPSC  which is responsible for overseeing the safety of more than 15 000 consumer goods  employs fewer than 425 full time staff  relies on antiquated testing facilities and employs just one full time toy tester     In a letter to the Commerce Committee last week  however  CPSC Chairwoman  Nancy Nord  called the Senate bill unnecessary and urged lawmakers to oppose the legislation    When I hear statements like Chairwoman Nord s  I m struck by the similarities to another bureaucratic failure   the planning and response to Hurricane Katrina  More than 20 million toys recalled  the lowest staff levels in over a decade and one person responsible for testing the safety of toys  and changes are unnecessary  That s a heckuva statement  Nancy  said Durbin  Katrina taught us that when the head of a public safety agency ignores reality  refuses to act and is unwilling to heed the advice of professionals  ordinary families pay the price  Our bill gives CPSC the tools and resources necessary to deal with the flood of dangerous products before the situation gets worse    Were one step closer to answering the call of moms and dads around the country who want the CPSC to stop dangerous toys and products from ending up in their homes  I can appreciate the industrys gut reaction to act in their interest  but Congress and the President need to act in the public interest  Moreover  the acting Chair of the CPSC should be leading the way  not dragging her feet  Our kids safety is at stake  Pryor said    The Senates package of reforms  The CPSC Reform Act of 2007  will more than double the agencys budget from  62 7 million to  141 7 million by 2015  increase staffing levels by nearly 20 percent  dramatically increase the cap on fines from  1 8 million to  100 million and give the CPSC greater authority to inspect and recall products  The bill also contains a third party testing requirement for children s products  bans lead in childrens jewelry  and makes it illegal to knowingly sell a recalled product    After millions of toys have been pulled from shelves  we ve taken action to effectively ban lead from all children s products  said Klobuchar  It will keep unsafe toys off our shores and out of our stores  As the holiday season approaches  parents ought to know that toys are safe before they reach the toy box    Toy safety is not only important with the upcoming holidays  but a year round concern  said Nelson  We need to pass this bill to make sure the toys and other products consumers bring into their homes are safe    What happened to the Consumer Product Safety Commission putting safety first  said Casey  As a former Auditor General  I know what it is like to be a watchdog and protect the public  We need to improve our inspection and enforcement  and we need to give the Consumer Product Safety Commission all the resources they need to protect parents and consumers    In her letter  Nord argued that the proposed funding increase contained in the Senate bill would harm product safety and put American people at greater risk  The senators responded by pointing out that the clich less is more often cited by Nord  has done little to improve consumer safety  Instead  the senators argued  it has done a great deal to protect industrys bottom line     Since 1980  the CPSCs staff levels have been halved and funding kept nearly stagnant  at the same time  foreign imports have dramatically increased  The lawmakers argued that the dramatic increase in funding they proposed will allow the agency to increase staff for the inspection of childrens products and free up manpower to investigate reported hazards    The senators also responded to White House Press Secretary  Dana Perino  who suggested at yesterdays press briefing that whistle blower protections in the Senate bill would incentivize people to wait until a problem is too great to be stopped in an effort to reap a financial reward  The senators noted that whistle blower protections in the Pryor bill are modeled on other similar laws already in place and which have proven successful  Similar statutes have encouraged people to come forward and report problems with consumer products before they reach the marketplace     The Senate Commerce Committee yesterday approved comprehensive legislation to improve the CPSC which now goes to the full Senate for consideration  Durbin  Klobuchar and Nelson have all introduced stand alone measures to improve safety standards  many of which were included in the bill passed yesterday by the Commerce Committee  Senator Casey has co authored a bill to require importers  including toy importers  to carry the insurance necessary to carry out a recall and cover any liability arising from that product    This year  Durbin and Pryor have each held hearings on the issue of toy safety in their respective subcommittees  In June  the Appropriations subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  which Durbin chairs  held a field hearing in Chicago where CPSC Chairwoman Nancy Nord testified  In September  Durbin held a second hearing on the issue where he heard again from Nord and the CEOs of Mattel and Toys R Us  the nations largest toy manufacture and retailer     All the members at todays press conference have been actively engaged on the issue of consumer safety for some time and have worked with the CPSC to highlight and fix gaps in the system that have allowed for the recalls weve seen this year
