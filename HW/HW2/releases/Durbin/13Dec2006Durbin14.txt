Wednesday  December 13  2006        Earlier this week  the new leaders of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees  Senator Robert C  Byrd  D WV  and Congressman Dave Obey  D WI   announced a moratorium on all earmarks until a reformed earmarking process that stresses transparency and accountability is put in place   In response  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent a letter to his Illinois constituents regarding the recent decision       Durbin said that scandals involving congressional earmarks have recently been front page news and Congress needed to act to restore public trust     I support the Committees    insistence on transparency and accountability in all federal spending bills     said Durbin       Durbin said that the Democratic leadership hopes to restore an accountable  above board  transparent process for funding decisions and put an end to the abuses that have harmed the credibility of Congress     Throughout my time in the Senate  I have publicly announced all Illinois projects that I have helped secure funding for and provided background materials to all those who requested further information     said Durbin       Durbin said that he will continue to work to ensure that Illinois is included when potential appropriations projects are discussed and debated      I will continue to do my best to support worthy Illinois projects that conform to the new rules currently under development for the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process     said Durbin       Letter below         December 12  2006  Dear Constituent    The 109th Congress came to a close last week  without completing its important work on the majority of the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills  The Senate and House Appropriations Committees announced this week that rather than complete the bills next year  Congress plans to extend current year funding through the end of fiscal year 2007 by way of a joint funding resolution       Although the Senate Committee had recommended specific funding to support a number of worthy Illinois projects  the joint funding resolution for fiscal 2007 will not include these or other funding set asides  In fact  the Committees have announced a moratorium on project funding until a bipartisan reform of the earmarking process has been put in place  likely prior to the end of the fiscal year in September 2007   I support the Committees  insistence on transparency and accountability in all federal spending bills  Throughout my time in the Senate  I have publicly announced all Illinois projects that I have helped secure funding for and provided background materials to all those who requested further information       Congress has an important Constitutional role to play in federal spending decisions  I work hard to ensure that Illinois is not left behind when these decisions are discussed and debated  I will continue to do my best to support worthy Illinois projects that conform to the new rules currently under development for the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process       I have enclosed a copy of the announcement from incoming Chairmen Robert C  Byrd and David Obey of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees for your review       I wish I had better news  I am disappointed that the failure of the last Congress to pass these bills led to this result  I m confident that the reforms we are putting in place will lead to greater accountability and transparency and help restore the trust of the American people in the federal spending process       I look forward to working with you in the new year       Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
