BUSH ADMINISTRATION POSSIBLE ACTION TO STOCKPILE GASOLINE RESERVES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wednesday  November 2  2005           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  welcomed remarks by Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman that the Bush Administration is considering taking steps to create a stockpile of gasoline reserves and called for a meeting with the Secretary    as soon as possible to discuss the Administration   s plans at greater length and detail and to coordinate our efforts to create such a reserve          In a letter to Bodman  Durbin wrote     Shortly after Hurricane Rita  when more than 25 percent of the U S  refinery capacity was off line  I introduced a bill  S  1794  the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of 2005  that would create a national reserve of gasoline and jet fuel   My legislation requires that the Secretary of Energy  with the Secretary of Homeland Security  determine strategically significant regional locations for the storage of fuel reserves and develop a plan to manage and maintain the viability of these stocks          Durbin authored the legislation S 1794 in response to fuel shortages caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The bill will require the Department of Energy to hold and manage 40 million barrels of unleaded gasoline and 7 5 million barrels of jet fuel to be used in times of shortages that adversely impact the U S  economy          Over the past two months  the United States has imported record levels of refined fuel products     Durbin continued      While the availability of refined products from foreign nations has helped to ease the impact of fuel shortages in the United States  relying on the resources held by foreign nations in the future compromises our national and energy security             With an open dialogue between the Administration  Congress and industry representatives  we can create the appropriate infrastructure and supplies to ensure stability in our fuel market     Durbin concluded       The full text of the letter to Secretary Bodman is below           November 1  2005   The Honorable Samuel Wright Bodman  Secretary  United States Department of Energy   1000 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  D C   20585   Dear Secretary Bodman    I read with interest your statement before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the Administration is considering taking steps to create a stockpile of gasoline reserves similar to a proposal I introduced in response to fuel shortages caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita       You noted  however  that you believe the management of such refined product reserves may be challenging  I strongly believe that the challenge is surmountable  With an open dialogue between the Administration  Congress and industry representatives  we can create the appropriate infrastructure and supplies to ensure stability in our fuel market       Shortly after Hurricane Rita  when more than 25 percent of the U S  refinery capacity was off line  I introduced a bill  S  1794  the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of 2005  that would create a national reserve of gasoline and jet fuel   My legislation requires that the Secretary of Energy  with the Secretary of Homeland Security  determine strategically significant regional locations for the storage of fuel reserves and develop a plan to manage and maintain the viability of these stocks       The bill also gives the Secretary of Energy the authority to release fuel from these reserves at times when fuel shortages would adversely affect the United States economy   Finally  the bill empowers states by authorizing Governors to request that the Secretary release gasoline from the reserves if their state faces economic risks caused by fuel shortages within that state       Over the past two months  the United States has imported record levels of refined fuel products   While the availability of refined products from foreign nations has helped to ease the impact of fuel shortages in the United States  relying on the resources held by foreign nations in the future compromises our national and energy security       I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss the Administration   s plans at greater length and detail and to coordinate our efforts to create such a reserve    This project is important to the security of our nation   I look forward to hearing from you       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
