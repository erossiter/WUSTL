                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  September 8  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  has requested that the U S  Secretary of Agriculture issue a report on the status of shipping crops from Illinois and other Midwestern states after the damage to the Port of New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina          This has been a tough year for farmers coast to coast     said Durbin      Illinois and other Midwestern states have already been struggling with a damaging drought   Now Hurricane Katrina has decimated crop production throughout the Gulf Coast and the damage it has caused to the Port of New Orleans will increase shipping and energy costs for farmers nationwide   New Orleans processed more than 50 percent of the nation   s grain   The loss of the Port  even temporarily  could spell disaster for this year   s harvest             Damage to the Port of New Orleans will bring about increases in transportation and fuel costs for producers nationwide and it is not clear that other transportation options can fill the gap     wrote Durbin in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns      In Illinois  farmers who have already suffered through a summer drought are unsure now if their products will reach the market with commercial operations at the Port of New Orleans delayed             It is clear the export market will feel a lingering effect of Hurricane Katrina for some time and our farmers are looking to you to help them in this time of need     Durbin wrote      I look forward to a report from you on the state of shipping agriculture products via the Mississippi River          Full text of Durbin   s letter to Secretary Johanns appears below           September 7  2005      The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary of Agriculture  United States Department of Agriculture  14th Street and Independence Ave   SW   Washington  DC 20250      Dear Secretary Johanns       I am writing to respectfully request a report on the status of shipping agricultural products from Illinois and other Midwestern states in light of the damage to the Port of New Orleans   As the extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina becomes apparent it appears the Gulf based export market     an important part of the U S  corn and soybean market     may be affected       Damage to the Port of New Orleans will bring about increases in transportation and fuel costs for producers nationwide and it is not clear that other transportation options can fill the gap   In Illinois  farmers who have already suffered through a summer drought are unsure now if their products will reach the market with commercial operations at the Port of New Orleans delayed   It is my understanding that only daylight movement is expected for quite some time due to the destruction of 68 of 106 navigational aids by the storm   This cuts capacity by about 50  compared to previous levels with 24 hour operations       While the extent of the destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina will not be fully known for weeks or months  economists project a billion dollar price tag for farmers as a result of the growing waterway shipping crisis and soaring fuel prices   In my home state of Illinois  from August 26 31  farmers suffered a 5 15 cent basis drop for both corn and soybeans  depending on location       Thank you for your attention to this important issue   It is clear the export market will feel a lingering effect of Hurricane Katrina for some time and our farmers are looking to you to help them in this time of need   I look forward to a report from you on the state of shipping agriculture products via the Mississippi River       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator
