HEARING ON CHILD SOLDIERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  April 24  2007    Washington  D C     U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today held the first ever congressional hearing on the issue of child soldiers  Durbin  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  convened the hearing  entitled  Casualties of War  Child Soldiers and the Law   to address the persistent use of child soldiers  a practice widely acknowledged as a war crime   The hearing will focus on gaps in U S  law that make it more difficult to hold accountable individuals and governments that recruit or use child soldiers       Ishmael Beah  author of the bestselling book A Long Way Gone  Memoirs of a Boy Soldier  testified at the hearing  recounting his time as a child soldier in Sierra Leone s civil war and the need to prevent experiences like his own from befalling others   As I speak to you  there are thousands of children from ages 8 to 17   in Burma  Sri Lanka  Congo  Uganda Ivory Coast  Colombia  just to name a few places   that are being forced to fight and lose their childhoods and their families   Beah said   They are maimed and they lose their humanity  and these are the fortunate ones  Those who are less fortunate are killed in the senseless wars of adults        In over twenty countries  children are currently fighting as soldiers  Denied a childhood and often subjected to horrific violence  an estimated 200 000 to 300 000 children are serving as soldiers for both rebel groups and government forces  Physically vulnerable and easily intimidated  children typically make obedient soldiers and participate in all aspects of warfare  Many are recruited by force  and often compelled to follow orders under threat of death        There is a clear legal prohibition on recruiting and using child soldiers  and yet around the world hundreds of thousands of boys and girls are used as combatants  porters  human mine detectors and sex slaves   Durbin said   While most serve in rebel or paramilitary groups  some government forces use child soldiers as well and these governments must be encouraged to abandon their reliance on children as instruments of war  That is why I ve introduced  with Senator Sam Brownback  R KS   the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2007  legislation that would place limits on U S  military assistance to countries that are clearly identified in the State Department s Human Rights report as recruiting or using child soldiers        Durbin s bill would ensure that U S  taxpayer dollars are not used to support this abhorrent practice by governments or government sanctioned military and paramilitary organizations  The bill would allow for U S  military assistance to continue but only if the assistance is used to remedy the problem by helping countries successfully demobilize their child soldiers and professionalize their forces        One of the reasons why child recruitment has persisted as an awful aspect of contemporary warfare is the impunity enjoyed by individual recruiters   said Kenneth Roth  Executive Director of Human Rights Watch   Consistent with the US  own policies and practices  US law should criminalize any recruitment or use of child soldiers in violation of international law  This would enable the United States to prosecute military commanders who exploit children as soldiers abroad  and then seek refuge in this country        In the 2006 State Department Human Rights report  issued in March of this year  25 countries were singled out as nations that have recruited or are currently recruiting child soldiers  Of those 25 nations  16 countries have used child soldiers in direct hostilities with armed groups   either as part of government forces or in militias  Since 2001  14 of those nations have received U S  military assistance       The report also noted that of the 16 nations where child soldiers are currently being recruited or conscripted  10 nations used children as part of government security forces or government sponsored armed groups  9 of the 10 nations cited in the report have received U S  aid since 2001       Durbin said that the practice of providing military assistance to governments and militias who exploit children violates U S  policy and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict  which the United States Ratified in 2002  Nations which could be affected by this legislation include  Burundi  Chad  Colombia  The Democratic Republic of Congo  Cote d Ivoire  Sri Lanka and Sudan       Other witnesses at today s hearing were Anwen Hughes  Senior Counsel of the Refugee Protection Program at Human Rights First and Joseph Mettimano  Director of Public Policy and Advocacy at World Vision


