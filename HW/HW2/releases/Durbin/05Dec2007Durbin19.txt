                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  December 5  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  announced four new steps the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  should take immediately to alleviate parents concerns about toy safety and to improve the agencys effectiveness  In a speech at the National Press Club  Durbin also urged the Administration to dramatically increase the neglected agencys budget and to work with Congressional Democrats to fill three vacant positions on the commissions governing board    The CPSC has failed American families  Durbin said  Too many parents have no where to turn for reliable advice on safe toys    This year alone  more than 20 million Chinese made toys have been recalled because they pose hazards to children  The CPSC  which is responsible for overseeing the safety of more than 15 000 consumer goods  employs fewer than 425 full time staff  relies on antiquated testing facilities and employs just one full time toy tester    To help reverse the perception that the CPSC is putting the interests of business before the safety of consumers  Durbin called on the CPSC to declare a one year moratorium on industry paid travel after reports that CPSC Chairman  Nancy Nord  has taken dozens of trips paid for by the industry the agency is tasked with regulating     The CPSC needs to immediately ensure there is no conflict of interest when it comes to the safety of children  If Chairman Nord will not end industry paid travel voluntarily  I will offer legislation to make it mandatory  Durbin said    With funding stagnant  staff levels at their lowest since 1980 and foreign imports at an all time high  Durbin also called on the Administration to send a responsible budget request for the CPSC to Congress next year  Durbin asked for a 10 to 15 percent funding increase next year alone  as Congress works on the multi year task of rebuilding the agency  This summer  Durbin  Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the agencys budget  increased the CPSCs budget by  8 million over the Presidents request to keep 18 full time employees who otherwise would have lost their jobs  Durbin asked that the new funds be used for necessities like skilled staff and much need improvements to testing labs    Finally  Durbin asked the President to work with Congressional Democrats to fill the three empty slots on the CPSC  The agency currently has only two of five commissioner positions filled and was forced to receive a waver that allows them to take regulatory action without the presence of a quorum  Durbin added that the positions should be filled with qualified candidates who have a demonstrated commitment to consumer safety  not industry lobbyists  as proposed earlier this year with the nomination of Michael Baroody     It shouldnt take a waiver to make sure American consumers are protected  Durbin said  The CPSC needs a full commission to fulfill its obligation to protect American families and to show a true dedication to safety  The only thing worse than a CPSC that can barely function  is a CPSC that cant function at all    Durbin is an outspoken leader in the Senate on the issue of consumer safety  This year hes held two hearings on the issue of toy safety  In June  the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  which Durbin chairs  held a field hearing in Chicago where CPSC Chairwoman Nancy Nord testified  In September  Durbin held a second hearing on the issue where he heard again from Nord and the CEOs of Mattel and Toys R Us  the nations largest toy manufacture and retailer     He has introduced two pieces of legislation in an effort to reform the declining consumer protection agency  Both of Durbins bills were included in a package of reforms introduced by Senator Mark Pryor  D AR   That bill  The CPSC Reform Act of 2007  will more than double the agencys budget from  62 7 million to  141 7 million by 2015  increase staffing levels by nearly 20 percent  dramatically increase the cap on fines from  1 8 million to  100 million and give the CPSC greater authority to inspect and recall products  The bill also contains a third party testing requirement for children s products  bans lead in childrens jewelry  and makes it illegal to knowingly sell a recalled product    Chairwoman Nord has objected to the proposed funding increase  In a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee  Nord argued that the proposed funding increase contained in the Senate bill would harm product safety and put American people at greater risk  Durbin responded by pointing out that the clich less is more  often cited by Nord  has done little to improve consumer safety  Instead  he argued  it has done a great deal to protect industrys bottom line     The Senate Commerce Committee passed the CPSC Reform Act last month and Durbin urged his Senate colleagues to take up and pass the legislation before years end
