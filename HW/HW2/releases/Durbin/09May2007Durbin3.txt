     Durbin  DeLauro  Chinese Government Agrees to Toughen Food Safety Standards for Imports

Chinese Government Agrees to Toughen Food Safety Standards for Imports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  May 9  2007    WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today met with U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach and Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong of the People s Republic of China to discuss the recent food safety problems including several contaminated shipments of food products imported from China       During the meeting  Durbin and DeLauro secured a commitment from the Chinese government and the FDA that they would work towards a mutual agreement to improve inspections and overall safety of food products and drugs traded between the U S  and China  That agreement would likely take the form of a memorandum of understanding between the two governments  see letter below         This proposed agreement between the FDA and the Chinese government is a significant breakthrough in terms of food safety   and American consumers stand to be the big winners   said Durbin   China and the FDA currently do not have a binding agreement on food and drugs  there is no equivalency of safety regulations between the two systems  and there are no mechanisms in place to inspect food production facilities  secure visas for investigations  or otherwise facilitate relations when problems arise  A memo of understanding will help address those problems         Significant work remains to address the deceptive labeling  unsanitary conditions  and the intentional contamination of food products that have become commonplace in China   While equivalency standards for food safety between the U S  and China should be the ultimate goal  an agreement between the FDA and the Chinese government that would allow FDA inspectors to enter their country to investigate problems as they arise would provide some immediate assistance   I would urge the FDA to insist on strong terms that would prevent any delays in their investigations when a crisis occurs   said DeLauro    The problems derived from this pet food recall have enlightened us to the gaps in our food safety system and a memorandum of understanding between the U S  and China would represent a positive step forward toward improving the safety of imported foods        During the meeting  Durbin and DeLauro also learned new information regarding a second importer of rice protein concentrate had received shipments of contaminated product from China   According to Commissioner von Eschenbach  Cereal Byproducts located in Mt  Prospect  Illinois  had imported contaminated rice protein concentrate from Binzhou Futian in China  and issed a recall on May 4  2007 of all products it distributed   The Food and Drug Administration is currently working with the company to track down all shipments of the product       In a previous meeting with the Chinese Ambassador last month  Durbin and DeLauro were told that imported Chinese food products which were later found to be contaminated had been labeled as industrial grade and not for animal or human consumption   Today it was disclosed that that the Chinese government has detained the shippers of the tainted wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate and that they acknowledge that the products were improperly labeled       Durbin and DeLauro have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  This Congress they introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act   S  654 and H R  1148 in the Senate and House respectively   Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues       Text of letter attached and below         May 9  2007   The Honorable Andrew von Eschenbach  Commissioner  Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  Maryland 20857   Dear Dr  von Eschenbach    Thank you for attending today s meeting with the People s Republic of China s Ambassador to the United States Zhou Wenzhong to discuss how to improve the food safety relationship between the United States and China   Thank you also for providing us with the latest developments on the ongoing investigation into the recall of pet and human food products contaminated with melamine       This recall has illustrated many significant inadequacies in the U S  Food and Drug Administration s  FDA  ability to protect consumers and our food supply from hazardous products that originate overseas   Food imports now account for approximately 13 percent of the average American diet  including significant shares of fruits  juices  meat  and fish and shellfish       While FDA budgets have not kept pace with the increasing volume of agricultural imports that enter the United States  we believe that existing tools at FDA s disposal would allow the agency to pursue actions that would improve the safety and soundness of food imports entering the United States       Specifically  we encourage you to make it a priority to enter into cooperative agreements with our trading partners  including letters of intent and comprehensive Memoranda of Understanding  MOUs    It is our hope that these agreements will facilitate the establishment of standards and quality controls for our trading partners  as well as promote dialogue and technical assistance   Ultimately  these cooperative agreements will provide U S  inspectors with easier access to foreign facilities  and expedite information sharing and cooperation during product recalls       Currently  the FDA lacks these types of agreements with some of our largest volume trading partners   For example  only two MOUs involving China are in effect  and those concern standards for ceramic ware imported from China   Given that the United States imports approximately  2 2 billion of agricultural products from China annually and considering that manufacturers in China recently have been implicated in several serious contaminations of food and drug products  an MOU between the United States and China should be made a top priority   We are alarmed by recent media accounts that the highly toxic substance diethylene glycol has been marketed by Chinese firms as glycerine  which has resulted in mass poisonings in various parts of the world       Beyond MOUs  the recent pet food contamination has revealed significant gaps in the FDA s statutory authorities to protect our food supply from potentially hazardous imports   We request that  within 20 days of receiving this correspondence  the agency create a list of gaps in FDA s current authorities that hinder it from adequately regulating imports       Thank you very much for your prompt response to these questions       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin
