     Durbin  Nelson  Schumer  Klobuchar Urge CPSC Action on Chinese Toys

Schumer  Klobuchar Urge CPSC Action on Chinese Toys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thursday  August 2  2007       United States Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Bill Nelson  D FL   Chuck Schumer  D NY  and Amy Klobuchar  D MN   sent a letter today to Nancy Nord  Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   asking her to assess  within seven days  whether the United States should detain and inspect all childrens products from China that contain paint  This letter follows yesterdays announcement that nearly 1 million units of popular Fisher Price toys were recalled due to toxic levels of lead found on the painted toys  A copy of the letter is attached    How many more deadly toys do we have to recall before Washington responds  Durbin said  We need meaningful safety standards for imported products and a CPSC with the resources to do their job  American families should not be playing Chinese Roulette at the toy store    Recently  the FDA took a similar step with regard to Chinese seafood  Following the discovery of tainted seafood  the FDA stopped shipments at points of entry and required the exporter to pay for a series of 5 independently verified product safety tests before they would be allowed into the US     Durbin and Nelson are among the leaders on the issue of consumer safety in the Senate  Durbin introduced Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act  which will dramatically expand CPSCs ability to protect American consumers  This bill increases the authorized funding level for the agency over the next five years  repeals the requirement that the CPSC have a quorum to engage in regulatory actions  decreases the amount of time that firms have to respond to the information CPSC releases  institutes a civil penalty for retailers that knowingly sell a recalled product  and increases maximum fine for violations  Senator Nelson was an original cosponsor of that bill    Also  last month  Senator Nelson  with Durbin as a cosponsor  introduced the Childrens Products Safety Act which would require all childrens products to be certified as having met rigorous product safety standards by independent laboratories  Nelson met with CPSC Chairman Nord today    The most important thing at this point is to make sure these products dont get into the hands of our kids  said Nelson who met with Chairman Nord today  I told her that this isnt a partisan issue  we just need to stop these hazardous products before they come into this country    Senator Nelson is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee  which also has oversight authority over CPSC  Last month the committee held a hearing on the safety of Chinese imports    There is no question that these recalls call in to question our ability to keep dangerous toys out of the hands of our kids  Schumer said  The fact that every week we have to frantically pull Chinese goods off store shelves shows that our safeguards are failing and we need to act fast to fix them  Too many Chinese toy manufacturers put the bottom line ahead of safety as their government continues to look the other way  We need to beef up our safety inspections and standards before more kids and their families are put in danger    I am outraged that once again toys need to be removed from our homes and our stores because they have been coated with poisonous and lethal lead paint  said Klobuchar  It s clear that the CPSC doesn t have the tools it needs to adequately safeguard the public  Equipping the commission with authority and resources it needs must be at the top of our legislative agenda  and I m working with my Commerce Committee colleagues to make that happen    The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for protecting individuals and families from dangerous products including toys  child safety seats and power tools  Last month the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a Durbin drafted spending bill out of committee  Durbin  Chairman of the Financial Services and General Government subcommittee  included  70 million budget increase for CPSC  This increase is  7 2 million above last year and  6 8 million above the Presidents budget request  This new funding will allow CPSC to hire new employees in the areas of hazard identification and reduction  field operations and compliance  and funds for critically needed IT improvements          The text of the letter appears below        August 2  2007      The Honorable Nancy Nord  Acting Chairman  U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  4330 East West Highway  Bethesda  Maryland 20814   Dear Chairman Nord    We are writing in response to the recent string of recalls of defective products manufactured in China  Chinese manufactured goods have been found with a variety of health and safety violations  including millions of items that contain hazardous levels of lead that far exceed statutory limits    Yesterdays recall announcement of nearly 1 million units of popular Fisher Price toys  including popular Elmo  Ernie  and Dora the Explorer figurines  is merely the latest instance of hazardous Chinese made childrens products that endanger American consumers  In the last few months  1 5 million units of Chinese manufactured Thomas  Friends trains and accessories were recalled due to hazardous levels of lead in surface paint and more than 3 million units of Chinese manufactured Magnetix building toys were recalled due to the serious health risks associated with swallowing the easily dislodged magnets  A disproportionate number of recalled childrens products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  website were manufactured in China    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than adults  Swallowing large amounts of lead can lead to blood anemia  severe stomachache  muscle weakness  and brain damage  Even at lower levels of exposure  lead can affect a child s mental and physical growth     In multiple places  federal regulations and statutes ban the use of lead paint in childrens toys  For example  Title 16  Chapter II  Part 1303 of the Code of Federal Regulations  16 CFR 1303  bans toys and other articles intended for use by children that bear lead containing paint  In addition  the Hazardous Substances and Articles Administration and Enforcement Regulations  15 CFR 1500  ban the use of surface paints containing more than  05 percent lead in toys or other articles intended for use by children  These regulations are referenced in the American Society for Testing and Materials  ASTM  F963 Standard  Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety     We are very troubled by the numerous  flagrant violations of U S  safety standards found in products imported from China  We want to ensure that the CPSC is aggressively pursuing actions that will stop the flow of dangerous products  Several weeks ago  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  acted in response to a similar trend of dangerous seafood imports from China by detaining certain products at points of entry until they had been verified as safe by independent third party testing    We ask that the CPSC conduct a risk analysis of childrens products manufactured in China within seven days to determine whether there is sufficient risk of lead contamination to pursue a detain and test program similar to the FDAs approach to seafood  We would greatly appreciate it if you would share the results of this analysis and discuss with us what next steps would be appropriate    Thank your for your attention to this matter  We look forward to hearing from you within seven days    Sincerely            ______________________ ______________________      Richard J  Durbin Bill Nelson      ______________________ ______________________   Chuck Schumer Amy Klobuchar
