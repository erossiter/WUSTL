INTRODUCES SUDAN DIVESTMENT BILL TO PRESSURE KHARTOUM GOVERNMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  March 8  2007         U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced bipartisan legislation to provide federal support for state and local divestment efforts in Sudan   The genocide has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions of those in Darfur        The United States government has acknowledged that a genocide is taking place in Darfur but as important as that declaration is  it is not enough    said Durbin   We now need to use financial tools where words have failed        For the past four years  genocide has raged in Darfur  Sudan   Both Congress and the President have recognized this fact  and the United Nations Security Council has authorized a peacekeeping force of over 20 000 military and police personnel to protect the civilian population of Darfur   But that peacekeeping force has yet to be deployed  and the people of Darfur remain largely unprotected       Durbin s legislation affirms that it is the sense of Congress that states and other entities should be permitted to divest their assets of certain holdings as an expression of opposition to the genocide and polices of the Khartoum government   It also expresses the sense of government that such divestment laws are consistent with the Constitution   This authorization would expire in the event that the Khartoum government alters its behavior and federal sanctions are lifted       Durbin s legislation also recognizes that nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan on humanitarian efforts or companies that are operating under federal permit or to promote health or religious activities should not be classified as supporting the Sudanese government   We do not want to hinder the fine work that s being done by nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations   said Durbin    What we do want to do is put pressure on this government in Khartoum to change this deadly policy        Many institutions  individuals and state and local governments have joined in calling for peace and security in Darfur   Seven states   six municipalities and over forty universities have chosen to divest    removing companies that operate in Sudan to the benefit of the Khartoum government from their pension plans and other investments        Illinois has led the charge in passing divestment laws   said Durbin    Thanks to the efforts of State Senator Jackie Collins  and her colleagues  Illinois was the first of seven states to pass divestment laws  I also applaud the leadership of Northwestern University in Evanston  Illinois and their President who have already taken steps to divest and make a commitment to peace in the region   said Durbin        Today  more than 20 state legislatures are pursuing measures to restrict their states  investments in companies fueling genocide in Darfur  The passage of this bill will ensure that those states   and  hopefully  many others   are able to pursue responsible and fiscally prudent investment policies related to Sudan  We salute Senator Durbin for his important leadership   said Mark Hanis  Executive Director of the Genocide Intervention Network  parent organization of the Sudan Divestment Task Force        Last year  Senator Durbin co sponsored S 3884  the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006  which was signed into law on October 13th  This legislation imposes sanctions against  persons responsible for genocide  war crimes  and crimes against humanity  and supports measures for the protection of civilians and humanitarian operations   In addition  Senator Durbin met in December with the President s newly appointed Special Envoy to Sudan to discuss diplomatic efforts and the push for peace   In 2006  Senator Durbin was also the author of a successful amendment to provide an additional  50 million for the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur       Co sponsors of Senator Durbin s bipartisan legislation include Senator John Cornyn  R TX   Senator Arlen Specter  R PA   and Senator Joe Lieberman  I CT  and Senator Barack Obama  D IL
