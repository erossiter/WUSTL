                                                                                                                                                                               Thursday  June 15  2006    Washington  D C       With thousands of qualified students denied admission into America   s nursing colleges because of a shortage of faculty  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today led a bi partisan effort to adopt a six year pilot program aimed at encouraging nurses leaving the military to become nurse educators   The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program was included in the Senate FY   07 Department of Defense Authorization bill        Even as America is experiencing an acute shortage of nurses  qualified students who wish to dedicate their future to nursing are being denied that opportunity     Durbin said      Nursing schools last year turned away 35 000 qualified applicants  including 1 900 in Illinois  because they don   t have enough teachers on staff        At Northern Illinois University in DeKalb  for example  233 qualified applicants were rejected as a result of a shortage of teachers and financial resources  while Illinois State University was forced to deny admission to 100 qualified students because of limited faculty and resources     Durbin   s    Troops to Nurse Teachers    proposal offers incentives to nurses leaving the military to become nurse teachers   He noted that the American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing last year and found that sixty six percent of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty   An additional 15  said they were fully staffed  but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained        Nurses who have spent time in the military can help fill a critical gap that hurts both military and civilian health care facilities   Their service to our country will go beyond their work in military hospitals and include our classrooms and lecture halls     Durbin said     The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program will provide transitional assistance for service members who already hold a master   s or PhD in nursing or a related field  and are qualified to teach   Eligible service members will receive career placement assistance  transitional stipends  and educational training from accredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition     The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    proposal will also establish a scholarship program  on a pilot basis  that will provide financial assistance to members of the Armed Forces who have been involved in nursing during their military service in obtaining the education necessary to become nurse educators  Tuition  stipends  and financing for other educational expenses will also be provided   Recipients of scholarships must commit to teaching at an accredited school of nursing for three years in exchange for the educational support they receive    The Department of Defense may also require continuing service in the Selected Reserve  or some other form of public service     With a projected shortfall of one million nurses by 2020  Durbin said a program like the    Troops to Nurse Teachers    offers an innovative solution that will help place more qualified nurses in faculty positions  which will in turn  increase the pool of trained nurses sought by civilian and military facilities      The military faces the same difficulty in recruitment and retention of nurses as civilian medical facilities   If we are going to address the nursing shortage over the long term  and ensure that Americans have the quality nursing care they deserve  we must increase the number nursing faculty members     he added     Durbin   s initiative is based on the Troops to Teachers program created in 1994  which has trained 14 000 former service members to be math and science teachers   More than 6 000 have been placed in high poverty schools     Durbin   s proposal is endorsed by the American Nurses Association  American Hospital Association  American Association of Colleges of Nursing  American Organization of Nurse Executives  American Health Care Association  and the National League of Nursing
