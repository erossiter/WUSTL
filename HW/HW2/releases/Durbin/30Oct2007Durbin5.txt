                                                                                                                                                                                          Tuesday  October 30  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   Today  a bipartisan group of Senators approved legislation to reauthorize Amtrak funding for the next six years  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007  first introduced in January by U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Trent Lott  R MI   Daniel K  Inouye  D HI   Ted Stevens  R AL  and others  authorizes funding for Amtraks capital and operating needs to maintain current operations  upgrade equipment  and return the Northeast Corridor to a state of good repair  The bill also creates a new intercity passenger rail capital grant program for the states  Amtrak provides quick  cost effective  and reliable public ground transportation to 30 communities and more than 3 million people in Illinois  said Durbin  As investment in passenger rail has increased  more and more communities are clamoring for service  Federal  state and local leaders recently worked together to find a rail route for residents in Rockford that would serve as an alternative to the congested roads in and out of Chicago  We are now pursuing the same process of cooperation to provide Quad Cities with expanded service  This bill  in tandem with state funding  makes it possible for us to continue to expand rail service throughout the state and country  The new intercity passenger rail State Capital Grant program will allocate grants to states to help pay for the costs of facilities and equipment used to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail  The projects will be selected by the Secretary of Transportation based on criteria such as economic feasibility and expected ridership  The grants require a local funding match of 20   however  the bill allows each state to use half of their previous capital and operating investments in Amtrak toward the match  Amtrak set a new record for ridership this year with 25 8 million passengers  an increase of 1 5 million over fiscal year 2006  These record high ridership numbers on Amtrak show the general public feels that Amtrak is a vital element of our national transportation system  said Durbin  It is one of the most valuable transportation programs for Illinois and the nation  Passing this reauthorization bill on a bipartisan basis shows the Senate is committed to ensuring that Amtrak maintains and builds its system to meet the growing needs of the traveling public  Durbin noted that Illinois benefits  both directly and indirectly  from Amtrak jobs and service  An average of 48 Amtrak trains run each day on more than 1 000 miles of track in Illinois  Amtrak employs more than 2 000 Illinois residents and annually spends  56 million for goods and services in the state  Illinois is the central rail hub of the North American continent  bringing 2 5 million passengers through Amtraks Midwestern hub in Chicago each year  Last year  Durbin   a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee   helped secure a commitment from Amtrak to supply four new trains for additional roundtrip service on the three Illinois routes  Additionally  the 2007 Illinois budget committed to finance the service for these trains by doubling their Amtrak funding to  24 3 million  As result of this state and federal cooperation  new service on the Quincy  St  Louis and Carbondale lines began in October  2006    Over the past year  those three routes saw the greatest increase in ridership  more than any other line in the Amtrak system  The Chicago Quincy routes have seen a 41 4  growth in ridership  the Chicago St  Louis line saw a 55 8  increase in ridership  and the Chicago Carbondale routes have seen an outstanding boost of 67 4
