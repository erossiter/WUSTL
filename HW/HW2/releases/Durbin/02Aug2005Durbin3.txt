AND MANZULLO ANNOUNCE  15 6 MILLION IN FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING  FOR ROCKFORD AREA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Tuesday  August 2  2005    ROCKFORD  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  announced  13 2 million in federal funding for highway entry projects at South Main Street and West State Street  as well as  2 4 million for an alternatives analysis for the Northern Illinois Commuter Rail Initiative   The funding was secured through the TEA 3 bill recently passed by Congress       The highway entry projects are a key component to the City of Rockford   s neighborhood revitalization and business retention efforts   The federal funding will help construct a modern roundabout at the intersection of North Main Street and Auburn Street   It will be the first two lane modern roundabout constructed in Illinois   The intersection has been a source of congestion and business decline for more than 20 years   The roundabout is designed to solve the transportation problem and be a catalyst for neighborhood and business reinvestment  while preserving the integrity and fabric of older business districts and neighborhoods     The West State Street redevelopment project is focused on the stretch between Day Avenue and Rockton Avenue   It is designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve access to the downtown business district   The existing two lane road will be widened to a four lane arterial highway ad enhanced with both landscaping and street lighting          Economic development in Rockford is heading west   As the major entryway into downtown Rockford from the west  West State Street is traveled by thousands of people daily   Those people are going to begin to see an evolution that will ease traffic congestion and turn the neighborhood into a thriving business district     said Durbin     Durbin has long been an advocate for commuter rail service that would link the greater Rockford area to northeastern Illinois      It takes one drive down I 90 in rush hour to make it clear why the Rock River Valley needs rail service   This is about quality of life for families living in region   Their hopes and dreams should not be diminished by congestions and delays     said Durbin          Easing gridlock and expanding economic opportunities go hand in hand   The City of Rockford and the surrounding areas are working hard to meet the challenges of a changing economy   Transportation improvements are a crucial element of that evolution     said Durbin        Securing this funding for Rockford is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     said Obama     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges           This federal money will help ease traffic congestion  promote economic activity and improve safety in the greater Rockford area     said Manzullo      I especially want to thank Senators Durbin and Obama for their leadership and teamwork in securing the money for these vital projects  which are a priority for the people of northern Illinois         The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21       Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level      Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families         It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois            This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
