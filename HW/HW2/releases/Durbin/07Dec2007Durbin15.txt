December 7  2007       Today U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent the attached letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey asking him to open an official investigation to determine whether the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes violates the law  He wrote  I urge you to investigate whether CIA officials who destroyed these videotapes and withheld information about their existence from official proceedings violated the law      CIA Director Hayden asserts that the videotapes were destroyed  in line with the law   However  it is the Justice Department s role to determine whether the law was violated  Text of the letter appears below  December 7  2007 The Honorable Michael Mukasey  Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Mukasey  I was troubled to learn that Central Intelligence Agency officials destroyed videotapes of detainees being subjected to so called enhanced interrogation techniques  I urge you to investigate whether CIA officials who destroyed these videotapes and withheld information about their existence from official proceedings violated the law  In a statement yesterday  General Michael Hayden  the CIA director  acknowledged that the tapes were destroyed  stating  In 2002  during the initial stage of our terrorist detention program  CIA videotaped interrogations  and destroyed the tapes in 2005  The New York Times reports that  The tapes were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that video showing harsh interrogation methods could expose agency officials to legal risks  several officials said  The CIA apparently withheld information about the existence of these videotapes from official proceedings  including the 9 11 Commission and a federal court  According to Philip Zelikow  the Executive Director of the 9 11 Commission  The commission did formally request material of this kind from all relevant agencies  and the commission was assured that we had received all the material responsive to our request   No tapes were acknowledged or turned over  nor was the commission provided with any transcript prepared from recordings  CIA attorneys told the federal court hearing the case of Zacarias Moussaoui that videotapes of detainee interrogations did not exist  According to a letter from the U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to Karen Williams  the Chief Judge of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals  and Leonie Brinkema  the trial judge in the Moussaoui case   T wo ex parte declarations previously submitted by the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  in this case contain factual errors concerning whether interrogations of certain enemy combatants were audio or video recorded  The fact that audio video recording of enemy combatant interrogations occurred  and that the United States was in possession of three of those recordings is  as noted  inconsistent with factual assertions in CIA declarations dated May 9  2003  the May 9 Declaration   and November 14  2005  the November 14 Declaration   CIA Director Hayden asserts that the videotapes were destroyed in line with the law  However  it is the Justice Departments role to determine whether the law was violated  As Mr  Zelikow said  The Executive Branch and the Congress need to decide how much they care about this question  If they want to get to the bottom of it  its pretty easy for people to dig up the relevant records and answer the questions that either officials of the Executive Branch or the Congress could pose  Please notify me whether you intend to investigate the CIAs destruction of detainee interrogation videotapes  Due to the gravity of this matter  I request that you respond as soon as possible  and in no case later than Wednesday  December 12  Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin
