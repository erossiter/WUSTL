                                                                                                                                                                                                  Friday  July 28  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   a member of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission  introduced legislation this week to establish a study abroad program for undergraduate students that would help build global awareness and international understanding  Durbin   s bill  the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program is based on recommendations published by the Lincoln Study Abroad Commission last year   The bipartisan bill was co sponsored by Sen  Norm Coleman  R MN          Senator Paul Simon was one our nation   s great public servants     said Durbin      Senator Simon had a vision    to strengthen the role of the U S  as a world leader by investing in the education of our young people   The international study abroad program we are introducing is based on his vision and advances his work  This program will instill in the next generation of Americans a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of other nations  This  in turn  will enhance the United States    capacity to lead in the 21st Century        Durbin   s bill creates a study abroad program that encourages non traditional students    such as low income students and those who attend community college    to spend part of their undergraduate careers studying abroad   The program also concentrates on giving students opportunities to study in Asian countries and developing nations  The program provides direct fellowships to students  as well as financial incentives to colleges and universities to make internal policy changes that make it easer for students to study abroad   The changes implemented through the program will allow the U S  to sustain a steady growth in the number of students who experience other countries as part of their undergraduate education  The legislation was introduced Wednesday evening        I applaud Senators Durbin and Coleman for taking the lead in what I hope will become a significant and lasting tribute to my father   s vision of building bridges of understanding through study abroad     said Martin  H  Simon      I   m sure my dad would be proud of his colleagues for recognizing this important need and I encourage the rest of the Senate to join them in seeing the goals of the Lincoln Fellowship program realized        Durbin   s bill is based on the following objectives      To encourage 1 000 000 undergraduates to study abroad for academic credit within 10 years   To establish a  program that reflects the demographics of the undergraduate population  including students in technical and scientific fields of study   To establish a program that ensures an increasing portion of study abroad takes place in nontraditional destinations  with substantial increases in developing countries   To establish a program that is accessible to students at less traditional institutions of higher education      The Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program would be established at the Department of State and consist of two separate complementary programs    Lincoln Fellowships and Lincoln Institutional Leverage Grants   Lincoln Fellowships would provide direct financial assistance to undergraduate students  in good academic standing  to study abroad for credit   Lincoln Institutional Leverage Grants would provide financial assistance to institutions of higher education  85  of which must go directly to student awards and 15  of which would be used to reform academic programs and institutional policies that inhibit participation by students in study abroad
