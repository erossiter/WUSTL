OF CHICAGO TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Tuesday  November 28  2006   CHICAGO  IL   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  visited the Illinois International Port District today to discuss the importance of port security across the nation and the steps taken in 2006 to improve infrastructure protection in the ports in the Chicago area    2006 was the first year that Chicago was included on the critical seaports list since 2003  and the first year it received significant funding   Being excluded from the critical seaports list means the ports in the Chicago area were not eligible to apply for more than  168 million in port security grant funding for the protection of critical port infrastructure from terrorism   In February  Durbin met with and wrote to Department of Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff  urging him to add the City of Chicago to the Department of Homeland Securitys list of the nations 100 most critical seaports   In July  just four months after the Durbin Chertoff meeting  DHS made the decision to include the Port of Chicago in this years list   And in September  DHS awarded  11 496 456 in federal grant funding to ports in the Chicago area   The City of Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications received  7 529 016  the City of Joliet received  551 105  the Illinois International Port District received  3 416 335   The City of Chicago will spend its funds enhancing surveillance and sensor technology and access control   Chicago can now begin applying for and receiving the funds it needs to secure its waterways and its residents  said Durbin   Im hopeful that the DHS funding we received this year is an indicator that the department understands the important role the Port of Chicago plays in the national network and acknowledges that port security in the nations third largest city should remain a priority   The nations 100 most critical seaports  representing 95 percent of the foreign waterborne commerce of the United States  are eligible to participate in the port grant program  From 2002 to 2005  DHS provided more than  706 million through this program  The funding is dispersed through the DHS Office of Grants and Trainings Infrastructure Protection Program   The Port of Chicago is the 36th largest port in the nation and the largest on the Great Lakes   Chicago is also the largest inland general cargo port in America  and the city as a whole is the commercial transportation crossroads of the nation   Illinois and the Port of Chicago link waterborne commerce  foreign and domestic  via our vast rail and highway systems for distribution throughout all of North America  Canada  Mexico  and the world   In 2002  of the over  58 million requested by the City of Chicago  zero was awarded   In 2004  of the over  14 million requested  zero was awarded   The one project which received an award in the last four years was made in the amount of  300 000  a partial award made to the Chicago Police Department for a year round patrol   The award was so small that the CPD was unable to move forward with the proposed security measures   Chicago Port Security grant requests total  84 million over the past four years and include requests for surveillance equipment for the Chicago and Calumet River  Year Round Patrol Vessel for the Chicago Police Department and a Chicago Marine Safety Station   On a national level  Durbin said improving port security  achieving the goal of 100  container inspection and additional funding for port security grants   remains a top priority for him in the next Congress    Durbin supported the port security bill the President signed into law in October   It authorizes  400 million for port security grants based on risk for each of the Fiscal Years 2007 through 2011   It also implements a pilot program at three foreign ports for testing all containers bound for the U S  and requires the DHS Secretary to develop a strategy for the deployment of radiation testing equipment at all major ports by the end of next year   The legislation also provides a timeline for implementation of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  Program which requires secure identification badges for transportation workers   Durbin supports the 9 11 Commissions recommendation to do more to protect our nations infrastructure and secure our nations ports  developing unified communication standards and clear division of responsibilities among the various agencies responsible for port security  including U S  Customs and Border Protection  the Coast Guard  and the Transportation Security Administration   Port security is a multi layered system of defenses that includes monitoring the people  cargo and vessels entering our ports from the time they leave a foreign port to the time they arrive in the United States   Additional port security funding is needed to improve dockside and perimeter security  provide important security upgrades such as surveillance equipment  access controls to restricted areas  communications equipment  and the construction of new command and control facilities  Durbin said
