that there are more than 35 million people in the United States who live in households facing hunger  the Senators wrote  Boosting investment in federal food assistance programs and important local

Olympia Snowe  R ME   Arlen Specter  R PA   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI  and Ron Wyden  D OR     Text of letter appears below    Dear Senators  We write to urge your support for a strong investment in the Nutrition Title for the 2007 reauthorization of the Farm Bill  The nutrition provisions in H R  2419  The Farm  Nutrition  and Bioenergy Act of 2007  include more than  4 billion over five years in improvements for numerous food assistance programs oversight  reauthorization  and technical provisions  We encourage you to provide at least as much funding for federal food assistance activities as the House passed Farm Bill to better address the nutritional needs of low income families and to reduce hunger in the United States  In recent years  we have seen a rise in hunger and food insecurity as our fellow Americans struggle to make ends meet  USDA Census Bureau survey data show that there are more than 35 million people in the United States who live in households facing hunger  Rising food  housing  medical  and fuel costs have made it difficult for many families in our nation to afford a healthy and nutritious diet  The nutrition title of the new Farm Bill is critical to alleviating hunger in our nation  The value of Food Stamp benefits has eroded with inflation  and outdated eligibility criteria have made it difficult for many low income families to qualify for much needed food  Moreover  growing numbers of people ineligible for food stamps  or unable to make their food stamp benefits last throughout the month  are seeking help from food banks  pantries  and thousands of local emergency feeding organizations across the country  Boosting investment in federal food assistance programs and important local hunger relief activities will go a long way toward reducing hunger in cities and towns across the nation  The Nutrition title of this Farm Bill will touch every community in America and can do much to reinvigorate our bi partisan commitment to reducing hunger in our great nation  Hunger is not a partisan issue  and we now have the opportunity to repair the holes in our nations nutrition safety net  We strongly urge you to move our nation closer to a hunger free America and support a strong Nutrition title in the upcoming Farm bill  Respectfully   Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
