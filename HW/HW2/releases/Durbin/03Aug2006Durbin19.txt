                                                                                                                                                                                              Thursday  August 3  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Don Manzullo  R IL  today sent a letter to Governor Rod Blagojevich  urging the State of Illinois to request that Amtrak add new passenger rail service along the corridor that spans from Chicago to Dubuque and includes stops in Rockford and Galena   The letter asks the Illinois Department of Transportation  IDOT  to submit a formal letter to Amtrak asking the passenger railroad to study the potential route and associated costs          The  24 million commitment from the State of Illinois and four new trains from Amtrak have put Illinois Amtrak expansion on the right track     said Durbin     It   s time to take advantage of this momentum  bring northern Illinois on board and Amtrak service to growing regions of our state   Today  Amtrak provides quick  cost effective  and reliable public ground transportation to 30 communities and more than 3 million people in Illinois   We need to add the communities in northwest and north central Illinois to that list             Our July 3 meeting showed a commitment from officials throughout northern Illinois to work together to support renewed passenger rail service to our region     Manzullo said     Amtrak service running from Chicago through Rockford to Galena and beyond would spur economic development and give our residents another transportation option to get to their destinations  In this age of high gas prices  passenger rail is an excellent alternative  and I strongly encourage the Governor to request Amtrak service for northern Illinois          On May 17th  Durbin wrote to the Acting President of Amtrak  David Hughes  requesting a meeting between Amtrak officials and Rockford community leaders to discuss restoring Amtrak service to Rockford   As a result of this letter  a meeting was held at the Rockford Airport Administrative Building  on July 3rd   Senator Durbin was joined by Amtrak representatives  Congressman Manzullo  IDOT Secretary Tim Martin  labor officials  and community leaders from Boone  Winnebago  Stephenson  Jo Daviess  DeKalb and Ogle Counties       Durbin recently helped secure a commitment from Amtrak to supply four new trains for additional round   trip service on the three Illinois routes   The 2007 Illinois budget committed to finance the service for these trains by doubling their Amtrak funding to  24 3 million   As result of this state and federal cooperation  beginning this October  there will be new service on the Carbondale  Quincy and St  Louis lines  Durbin is a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee         Dear Governor Blagojevich       We are writing to respectfully request that the State of Illinois apply to Amtrak for new passenger rail service along the northern Illinois corridor that runs from Chicago to Rockford and terminates in the Galena and Dubuque region   We thank you for adding new roundtrip service on the state run Amtrak routes  and we hope that you agree with us that Amtrak should be expanded to north central and northwest Illinois         As you know  there is intense interest and broad community support for renewing service along this corridor that ceased operations in 1981   This region includes Rockford  the second largest metropolitan area in Illinois  and Jo Daviess County in Northwest Illinois  which is a popular tourist destination and has doubled in population since Amtrak ceased running its former Black Hawk train in 1981        Traffic on the I 90 corridor from Chicago to Rockford is nearing full capacity  as almost 100 000 cars travel daily on the toll road   Amtrak expansion to the Rockford area and northwest Illinois would help alleviate congestion on the region   s roads  just as an increase in service on the state   s Amtrak corridors signed into law by yourself this past Spring will help ease congestion throughout the state   s highways   Clearly  the citizens of northern Illinois are interested in an alternative form of reliable transportation  and Amtrak is the alternative of choice   We commend you and the state legislature for increasing the state support for Amtrak service to  24 million  and we hope to build on those efforts by bringing Amtrak to growing regions of the state that currently do not have high speed rail service        We hope the Illinois Department of Transportation will submit a formal letter to Amtrak in the near future asking the passenger railroad to study the potential route and associated costs   This will be the first step in a longer process to bring passenger rail service back to north central and northwest Illinois  and we look forward to working with you to restore Amtrak service to this corridor
