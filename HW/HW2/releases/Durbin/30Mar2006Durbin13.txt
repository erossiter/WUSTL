DISASTER DECLARATION FOR ILLINOIS WILL HELP TORNADO RAVAGED COMMUNITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thursday  March 30  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  today praised the decision by President Bush to declare central Illinois a disaster area  The President   s disaster declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people and municipalities recover from the tornadoes that devastated Springfield and other communities in central Illinois earlier this month          Although the power is back on  and things are beginning to return to normal  residents and business owners in Central Illinois are still picking up the pieces  This Presidential disaster declaration will now start the process of matching needs with money     said Durbin     There is a tremendous amount of work ahead of us  Damage estimates show that nearly 130 homes received major damage and another 840 homes received minor damage  Eighty businesses suffered major damage  I am hopeful that the federal restoration efforts will begin dealing with the most seriously affected residents first          But the Illinois lawmaker warned that disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  is not a    magic wand    and that residents and business owners need to be aware of the limits of the government   s ability to help          There are lessons to be learned from other disasters    even now that FEMA has arrived  we need to make sure that no promises are made that can   t be kept  that they help people cut through the red tape  and help find solutions to the personal  family and business problems that have resulted from this disaster     Durbin said       Durbin said federal disaster assistance falls into three general categories  Individual Assistance    aid to individuals and households  Public Assistance    assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster damaged public facilities  and Hazard Mitigation Assistance    funding for measures to reduce future losses to public and private property       Not all programs  however  are activated for all of the communities affected by the tornados  In this case  Sangamon County is eligible for all three types of help from FEMA     individual assistance  public assistance and hazard mitigation assistance  Greene  Logan  Morgan and Scott counties are eligible for public assistance and hazard mitigation assistance  All Illinois counties are eligible for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program       Durbin said that FEMA has a variety of programs that provide money and services to people in the declared area whose property has been damaged or destroyed and whose losses are not covered by insurance   In every case  the disaster victim must register for assistance and establish eligibility  The toll free telephone registration number is 1 800 621 FEMA  or TTY 1 800 462 7585 for the hearing or speech impaired   FEMA  or the providing state or federal agency  will verify eligibility and need before assistance is offered       Governor Blagojevich asked President Bush on March 17 to declare the storm damaged region a federal disaster area  Durbin  along with Sen  Barack Obama  Reps  Ray LaHood  Lane Evans  John Shimkus and Jerry Costello also wrote the President in support of federal disaster aid  Last week  Durbin joined Springfield Mayor Tim Davlin and hundreds of volunteers in helping the city clear debris and help clean up damaged neighborhoods       The governor s office estimated the cost to state and local governments at  37 million for debris removal  emergency protective measures  and damage to infrastructure  buildings  equipment and utilities  Blagojevich said yesterday that the state will continue to try to get federal assistance for individuals in areas beyond Sangamon County
