October 16  2007       United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent a letter to the Under Secretary of the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service  FSIS  today  asking for detailed information regarding their actions after learning that millions of pounds of beef were tainted with the bacteria  E  coli  Last month  the USDA announced that Topps Meat Company was recalling beef patties because of contamination  However  the USDA knew of a contamination more than 10 days before it pressed the company to recall the product     It s unacceptablethat the USDAwaitedmore than10 days before reporting that twenty three million pounds of beef were contaminated  said Durbin  These agencies need to be held accountable for sitting on information while people continued to get sick  I am also concerned that I have heard very little about what USDA is doing to follow up  We need to make sure thatevenwhen the recall storiesslow down the government s commitment to following up on the issue doesn t    The recall  announced last month and expanded 2 weeks ago  covers nearly 23 million pounds of beef patties  Over 40 people in 8 states were sickened from eating the tainted beef  This is the 16th recall of meat this year for E  coli contamination    In addition to asking for a detailed timeline of events surrounding the recall  Durbin asked the USDA to outline its inspection procedures at the Topps plant  explain its procedures when following up with suppliers following a recall  how many inspectors are employed by USDAs Food Safety Inspection Service and how many vacancies are there currently within FSIS    Durbin is a leader in the Senate in reforming our nations food safety system  Last month  the President signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act  which included food safety proposals  authored by the Senator  which will result in faster recalls  alerts  and notifications through the supply chain    Also last month  Durbin renewed his call for a single food safety agency and announced plans to amend the upcoming Farm Bill to sunset the 12 existing safety agencies in two years  This plan would allow for the planning and creation of a single agency responsible for the safety of our nations food supply    This Congress  Durbin has introduced legislation that calls for the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act  S  654   Durbin has also worked to increase funding for the FDA and USDA    The text of Senator Durbins letter appears below    October 17  2007   Dr  Richard Raymond  Under Secretary  Food Safety Inspection Service  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20250   Dear Dr  Raymond     I am writing in response to the recent string of recalls of ground beef contaminated with E  coli 0157 H7 bacteria  The safety of our nations food is dependent on the commitment and diligence of food manufacturers  combined with the insistent oversight of food safety inspectors  Any lapses must be swiftly addressed  We must not accept the status quo when it comes to foodborne illnesses      It is alarming that  following several years of reductions in the number of cases of E  coli infections  we are now witnessing a sharp rise in both the number of incidents requiring a recall and the number people infected by this harmful bacteria  In 2007 alone  there have been 16 separate and independent recalls of ground beef due to E  coli  resulting in dozens of cases of significant foodborne illnesses and more than 28 million pounds of product being removed from the stream of commerce  This spike warrants additional attention     My concerns with these recent developments are manifold  In the case of the Topps beef recall  it appears that an entire years worth of supply was contaminated  yet the USDA FSIS inspectors assigned to serve at that facility on a daily basis failed to detect the E  coli adulterant  In addition  once USDA FSIS became aware of cases of foodborne illnesses  it took more than 10 days for the agency to announce a recall  The PFGE gel test alone  conducted by labs to detect the presence of E  coli  took seven days      I believe that these recalls require immediate attention  and I appreciate hearing that you have already directed the agency to study these instances with the goal of taking action to correct deficiencies  In addition  I ask that you address the following questions    Please provide a detailed timeline of the Topps recall  including but not limited to consumer complaints  inspector actions  product testing  and effectiveness checks    2  Please provide all reports  follow up inspections and correspondence with Topps officials from 2000 to the present     3  When did Topps discover that there was a possible E  coli illness linked to its products  Once it realized the link  what actions did it take    4  How and when did the CDC establish that the first reported case in the Topps outbreak began on July 5     5  Did Topps seek advice or guidance related to a recall from USDA FSIS at any point between August 31  2007  when an illness was first reported and September 7  2007  when USDA first reported out a positive test     6  Did USDA FSIS ever suggest to Topps that a recall wasnt necessary  If so  why    7  Why did in plant inspectors fail to recognize the E  coli hazard in Topps ground beef production  Did Topps have a HACCP plan in place that addressed the risks associated with E  coli    8  What was the date of the last full USDA inspection report on the Topps plant and what did it find    9  How many tests for E  coli were conducted by USDA inspectors at the Topps plant over the past five years and what were the results of these tests    10  Did Topps co mingle multiple days of ground beef production  If so  how did USDA FSIS become aware of this practice  Were inspectors aware of this practice prior to the recall  Do any current USDA FSIS regulations prohibit this practice    11  Approximately how much time each day was an inspector present at the Topps facility  Over the past 12 months  did inspectors pursue enforcement actions or file reports about problems with Topps production  Did inspectors follow up on any recommendations that were made    12  How long had the USDA inspectors assigned to the Topps facility been inspecting that facility at the time of the recall  How long had they been working as USDA inspectors     13  How many follow up effectiveness checks have been performed by USDA FSIS employees during this recall  What was the success rate of the effectiveness checks  What was the recall rate     14  What follow up actions have been performed by USDA employees with Topps suppliers to ensure that the source of the adulteration is not continuing to enter into the stream of commerce  What are USDA FSIS policies with regard to post recall actions to check suppliers     15  How many inspectors are employed by USDA FSIS  How many establishments have daily inspection  How many posts are currently vacant  What is USDA FSISs annual budget  Please provide this data for the current year as well as each of the previous ten years    16  When is the last time that USDA FSIS updated its E  coli performance criteria and testing standards    Thank you for your attention to this matter  I ask that you provide a response within 20 days  If you have any questions  please contact my staff   Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
