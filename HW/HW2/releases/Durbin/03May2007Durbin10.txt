Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Combat Meth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  May 3  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Chuck Grassley  R IA   both members of the Senate Anti Meth Caucus  today introduced the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2007   This legislation will promote the use of electronic logbook systems by pharmacies to better track the sales of ingredients that could be used to make meth       Most of the chemicals necessary to produce methamphetamine are readily available in household products or over the counter cold or allergy medicines such as pseudoephedrine  Current law restricts the amount of these ingredients that can be purchased at one time by a single person   Some meth producers have been able to get around restrictions by  smurfing    purchasing illegal amounts of meth precursor drugs by traveling to multiple pharmacies and buying small quantities at each         Smurfing  now accounts for at least 90  of the pseudoephedrine used to make meth in Illinois   said Durbin    Electronic logbook systems provide a more effective method of tracking the purchases of these drugs  With the proper resources  pharmacies can keep their logbook information electronically and share that information with law enforcement   The information can then be used to identify and prosecute meth manufacturers attempting to beat the system         The Midwest has been hit especially hard by meth and the ability to buy the ingredients over the counter   Grassley said    Despite the positive impact the Combat Meth Act has had on lowering the production of home cooked meth  people are exploiting loopholes that allow one to smurf between different pharmacies   An electronic logbook will be a tremendous asset for local law enforcement and businesses as they work to end the devastating impact of meth on our communities        Today s legislation revises the technical logbook requirements found in the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act   Combat Meth Act     Enacted in 2006  the Combat Meth Act limits the amount of meth precursor drugs   drugs that can be used to make meth  such as pseudoephedrine   that a customer can buy and requires pharmacies to keep written or electronic logbooks recording each purchase of the drugs  This approach has led to a drop in the number of meth labs discovered in many states  however  meth producers are beginning to adapt to the current restrictions through the practice of  smurfing         For years  methamphetamine has been plaguing communities in Illinois and throughout the nation   said Durbin    Law enforcement agencies are forced to devote a large percentage of their time to finding  busting and cleaning up meth labs   taking away precious resources that should be used for crime prevention   Law enforcement experts agree that electronic logbook systems are an important tool in our efforts to combat meth  We can  and should  do more to help make these logbook systems work        Today s legislation     Creates a federal grant program that would provide money to states to create or enhance electronic logbook systems  Assists law enforcement in combating the meth epidemic by improving the effectiveness of the electronic logbook systems  Awards federal grants on a priority basis to encourage states to design logbook systems that will be effective in stopping smurfing across state and county lines  and Preserves existing privacy safeguards that are currently found in federal and state law    This bill has been endorsed by numerous organizations  including the National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies  the National Narcotics Officers  Associations  Coalition  the National Criminal Justice Association  the National Sheriffs  Association  the Major County Sheriffs  Association  the National Troopers Coalition  the National District Attorneys Association  the National Association of Countries  and the Community Anti Drug Coalitions of America       On March 15  Durbin and Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  introduced another meth related bill  the Family Based Meth Treatment Act of 2007 which seeks to improve comprehensive  family based substance abuse treatment for methamphetamine addiction   On April 25  Grassley and Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA  introduced legislation to increase federal penalties for drug dealers who entice children with candy flavored meth
