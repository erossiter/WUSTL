17  2007        United States Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Bill Nelson  D FL  sent a letter to President Bush today  strongly opposing his pick to chair the Consumer Product Safety Commission and urging the withdrawal of the controversial nomination  The nominee  Michael Baroody  is currently a lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM  and in that    Mr  Baroody s professional actions and background are inconsistent with the mission of the CPSC   Durbin said   Protecting our children and families is of the utmost importance  The CPSC deserves leadership that will protect consumers  Mr  Baroody has spent a career protecting industry from the agency he s now asked to run  and that raises serious concerns         We need someone who will make sure that the products that we bring into our homes are safe for us and our children   said Nelson    With this nominee s extensive record of opposing consumer protections  I have no confidence in his ability to safeguard the public from dangerous products        This letter follows one Durbin sent to the Acting Commissioner of CPSC  Nancy Nord  following the recall of over 8 million units of a popular magnetic toy  after one death and dozens of serious injuries of children  The case was profiled in a recent series of articles in the Chicago Tribune       Last week  Nelson  in a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   divulged his intent to block Mr  Baroody s nomination from reaching the Senate floor   Specifically  Nelson has placed a  hold  on Baroody  which is a formal notice given by a senator who doesn t want a particular person s nomination to reach the Senate floor for consideration   It s widely viewed as an effective blocking mechanism  because it takes the votes of at least 60 of the 100 senators to overcome it       Text of the letter appears below        May 17  2007   Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20500   Dear Mr  President    We are writing to express our concerns about the nomination of Mr  Michael Baroody to serve as Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC    Mr  Baroody is an inappropriate choice to lead the independent government agency tasked with protecting consumers from unsafe products   During his professional career  Mr  Baroody has supported numerous positions that would shield companies from liability and favor corporate interests over consumer protection   His actions suggest that he will be unable to independently protect the public interest against the risks posed by hazards associated with dangerous products       Mr  Baroody s nomination fails to meet the criteria set forth in the CPSC s governing statute  the Consumer Product Safety Act  CPSA    The CPSA provides specific direction to the President on the qualifications a nominee for the position of Chairman or Commissioner of CPSC must possess   Specifically  Section 4 a  of the CPSA states      In making such appointments  the President shall consider individuals who  by reason of their background and expertise in areas related to consumer products and protection of the public from risks to safety  are qualified to serve as members of the Commission    There is no evidence in Mr  Baroody s professional background to indicate that he meets these criteria   To the contrary  Mr  Baroody has worked against the  protection of the public from risks to safety  in his work for the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM    For example      NAM opposed a concrete proposal  before the CPSC that would have increased recall effectiveness for children s products by including product registration cards in products used by children  NAM supported diluting guidelines companies used to determine whether they must report substantial product hazards  and NAM worked to prevent government agencies from pursuing legal cases against companies that engage in harmful activities    R  David Pittle  who was appointed the first Chairman of the CPSC by Richard Nixon in 1973  wrote in a letter to the committee that   When I hold Mr  Baroody s background and skills up to this test  they fail   There is a woeful lack of experience in product safety or consumer protection   Quite the contrary  Mr  Baroody has earned his spurs over many years by protecting manufacturers from government regulatory efforts   often to the detriment of consumers   Mr  Baroody may well be a good candidate for a position at another agency  but as a candidate for Chairman of the CPSC  he is not qualified        In addition  it has recently come to our attention that Mr  Baroody will receive a  150 000 severance payment upon his departure from NAM   While it is rare that someone would receive such a payment upon a voluntary departure  what is even more significant is that this sum represents an  extraordinary payment  under applicable ethics rules  and will require Mr  Baroody to recuse himself from any CPSC matter involving NAM business   However  almost all business before the Commission involves a NAM member   either an individual manufacturer or a manufacturer trade association   and Mr  Baroody has argued that he does not need to remove himself from NAM member business   Both his work on behalf of NAM and its members for well over a decade and this large cash payout indicate that he cannot escape a serious conflict of interest in this position       A vacancy at the Consumer Product Safety Commission is an opportunity to provide new leadership for an agency that serves a critical child safety and public health mission  The role of the Chairman is critical for directing the agenda  operations  and priorities of the agency  including all of the executive and administrative functions of the Commission  such as the hiring and supervision of staff  and the expenditure of agency resources   This vacancy provides an opportunity for the Administration to clarify its support for the mission of the CPSC     and to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury from consumer products   Mr  Baroody s background clearly illustrates that he cannot provide this leadership       We therefore urge you to reconsider your nomination of Mr  Baroody to the position of Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  and to withdraw the nomination       Thank you for your consideration of our request       Respectfully      Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator     Bill Nelson  United States Senator
