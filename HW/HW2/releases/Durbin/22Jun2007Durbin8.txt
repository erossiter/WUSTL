 2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  today sent a letter to the President and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America  MPAA   Daniel Glickman  urging him to provide more information on the impact of smoking in movies on the health of children   In todays letter Durbin  Kennedy and Lautenberg noted that  Studies involving thousands of American adolescents have found that exposure to on screen smoking is a major contributor to smoking initiation by youth  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  repeatedly cites tobacco imagery in motion pictures as one reason why teen smoking rates have stopped their historic decline   Recently the MPAA  announced that their ratings rules for the Classification and Rating Administration would be updated and clarified to consider smoking as a factor in rating films  The Senators expressed their appreciation for the MPAAs willingness to take initiative on this issue  However  they also noted  the MPAAs adoption of a highly subjective policy is not enough to curb the influence of smoking in the movies on the health of children   American Legacy Foundation President and CEO Cheryl Healton  Dr  PH  testified this morning before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet about images kids see on screen  She called the MPAA s announcement wholly inadequate and a hesitant half step  Healton said the policy contains no objective standards or commitment to actually do anything   If it is to be effective  we would expect to start seeing a reduction in smoking in youth rated films in coming months  and we will be watching  she added  The American Legacy Foundation is the national public health foundation created out of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement  to keep kids from smoking and help all smokers quit   Specifically  Durbin and the supporting Senators request that the MPAA   Provide more specifics as to how they will implement the new ratings rule  including information on what  if any  impact it would have had on the ratings of films from 2004 2006      Provide detailed information explaining the sampling method and criteria used by the MPAA to arrive at its conclusion that between July 2004 and July 2006 there was a decrease in on screen smoking     Establish meaningful objective standards that will produce measurable reductions in smoking in the movies      Text of the letter appears below   June 22  2007 Honorable Daniel Glickman President and CEO Motion Picture Association of America 1600 Eye Street  NW Washington  DC 20006   Dear Mr  Glickman   We are writing to express our disappointment with the new movie ratings policy announced by the Motion Picture Association of America  MPAA  in April to address the issue of smoking in motion pictures  Although we appreciate the MPAAs initiative and willingness to take the lead in this matter  we believe that the proposal falls short of the steps necessary to reduce the exposure of children and adolescents to smoking in movies   Tobacco imagery  both branded and unbranded  continues to permeate the American movie industry  despite initiatives to reduce on screen smoking  From 1999 2005  41 percent of G  and PG rated live action films  75 percent of PG 13 rated live action films  and 88 percent of R rated live action films produced in the United States delivered an estimated 44 billion tobacco impressions to American audiences   Studies involving thousands of American adolescents have found that exposure to on screen smoking is a major contributor to smoking initiation by youth  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  repeatedly cites tobacco imagery in motion pictures as one reason why teen smoking rates have stopped their historic decline   Recently  smoking in the movies and its influence on children was highlighted in the May 24  2007  release of the Institute of Medicine report  Ending the Tobacco Problem  A Blueprint for the Nation  National Academies Press   Five chapters of the report mention smoking in movies as a contributing factor to the tobacco problem and thus as a path towards intervention and prevention  Concerning youth exposure to smoking in movies  the report notes that messages in the media can induce and even glorify unhealthy and risky behaviors such as smoking   We are concerned that the MPAAs adoption of a highly subjective policy is not enough to curb the influence of smoking in the movies on the health of children  The new policy merely calls for the Classification and Ratings Administration to consider smoking as a factor in the rating of films  but does not provide specifics as to the implementation of this proposal  We request that you provide us with more specifics as to how the MPAA will implement the new ratings rule  including information on what  if any  impact it would have had on the ratings of films from 2004 2006   In particular  we request clarification of information used by the MPAA to indicate a recent decrease in on screen smoking  A May 10  2007  press release from the MPAA stated  From July 2004 to July 2006  the percentage of films that included even a fleeting glimpse of smoking dropped from 60 percent to 52 percent  Of those films  75 percent received an R rating for other factors   However  publicly available research studies have indicated the opposite of such a trend  Analyzed by calendar year  the percentage of films of all ratings with smoking went from 67 percent  2004  to 72 percent  2005  to 66 percent  2006   Source  Polansky and Glantz  2007   This evidence was also cited in a June 5  2007  letter you received from Vermont Attorney General William H  Sorrell  As was also requested by the Attorneys General  please provide us with detailed information explaining the sampling method and criteria used by the MPAA to arrive at its conclusions so that this discrepancy can be resolved   The decision to change your policy to more accurately address the influence of smoking in the movies on the health of children is encouraging  However  if the results show no change in the susceptibility of children to such images  we encourage the MPAA to establish meaningful  objective standards that will produce measurable reductions in smoking in the movies  In particular  we encourage the adoption of policy enhancements to the rating system  such as those endorsed by the American Medical Association  the American Academy of Pediatrics  the American Legacy Foundation  the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  and the World Health Organization  among others   We thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter  We look forward to working together to place the health of our nations children and families first    Sincerely    ______________________________ ______________________________ Richard J  Durbin Edward M  Kennedy ______________________________ Frank
