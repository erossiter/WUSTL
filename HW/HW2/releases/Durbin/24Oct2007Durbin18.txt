Approves Durbin Legislation to Ease Nationwide Nursing Shortage by Training More American Nurses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  October 24  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced Senate approval of his legislation to address one of the major causes of the nationwide nursing shortage  an insufficient number of nurse educators  by providing grants to colleges to improve their ability to educate nursing students  The legislation  added late last night as an amendment to the Labor  Health and Human Services Appropriations bill  would create and fund a program modeled after the Nurse Education  Expansion  and Development  NEED  Act  which Durbin introduced on January 31  2007  Nurses care for our children and grandchildren  our parents and other loved ones  We know the difference nurses make in our lives  and increasingly we are noticing the difference when we do not have enough of these dedicated men and women when we need them most  said Durbin  More needs to be done to boost our nursing schools in order to train the nurses we will need in the years to come  Durbin offered his legislation as a second degree amendment to an amendment proposed by Senators Chuck Schumer  D NY  and Kay Bailey Hutchison  R TX   The Schumer Hutchison amendment would allow up to 61 000 foreign nurses to enter the country as green card holders  The Durbin second degree amendment requires each employer who successfully petitions for a nursing green card to pay a  1 500 fee  This fee would be used to fund Durbins NEED Act program to provide grants to U S  nursing schools for hiring nurse faculty  expanding training capacity and recruiting more students  Projections show that by the year 2020  our countrys nursing shortage will have grown to 1 million  Importing several thousand foreign nurses is only a band aid solution to this projected shortage  said Durbin  But it is also a step that deflates any momentum towards finding real solutions for our domestic nursing crisis  My amendment is a reasonable compromise that will help both the hospitals in the short term and the domestic nursing supply in the long term  Statistics paint a bleak a picture for the availability of nursing faculty now and into the future  Last year  the American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing  They found that 66  of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty  An additional 15  said they were fully staffed but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained  It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 through 2012  reducing nursing faculty while the need for qualified nurses continues to increase  In Illinois  the number of qualified applicants being denied admission to nursing schools is growing  From 2002 through 2003  there were 502 qualified students rejected from Illinois nursing schools  Last year  there were 1 900 students turned away because of lack of faculty and resources  And yet  in spite of the increasing number of eligible nursing school applicants  Illinois could be facing a shortage of over 21 000 nurses by 2020 because of a lack of nursing faculty  Durbins amendment also contains two provisions to enhance global healthcare cooperation and to safeguard against a crippling brain drain of foreign healthcare workers from countries where they are critically needed  The first provision would allow a healthcare worker who is a legal permanent resident in the U S  to temporarily provide healthcare services in a country that is underdeveloped or that has suffered a disaster or public health emergency without jeopardizing his or her immigration status in the United States  The second provision would require a foreigner who is petitioning to work in the U S  as a healthcare worker to attest that he or she has satisfied any outstanding commitment to his or her own country under which the foreigner received money for medical training in return for a commitment to work in that country for a period of years  The goal of this provision is to ensure that foreign countries do not invest money in healthcare workers who then renege on commitments to work in their country without satisfying their commitment in some way  such as by a new voluntary agreement  Durbins amendment is supported by the American Nurses Association and the American Association of Nursing Colleges


