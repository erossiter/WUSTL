TO NATIONAL PRESS CLUB  A MORE SECURE AMERICA  AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  January 26  2006   Durbin delivered the following speech to the National Press Club on Thursday  January 26  2006   It is entitled   A More Secure America    at Home and Around the World       Thank you  Leader Pelosi  for those excellent remarks   Leader Pelosi has done an excellent job rallying her House caucus behind good policy  and I hope that in 2006 the American people will give her a chance to make that good policy  good law       I also want to thank my guest  Mayor John Spring from Quincy  Illinois  for being here   Quincy sits on the banks of the Mississippi River  and a little more than a decade ago  Quincy was severely flooded   An amazing outpouring of community support and a well coordinated response from James Lee Witt at FEMA proved that natural disasters do not have to overwhelm us       For the last five years  with one brief interlude of enlightenment in the Senate  Republicans have controlled the White House  the House and the Senate   Since September 11  2001  virtually every major speech by the President and senior Bush Administration officials has had one theme   American security       But today  nearly five months after the Katrina catastrophe  more than 1 000 days after the invasion of Iraq  and one week after another taped threat from Osama Bin Laden  Americans are asking themselves this question   Are we as secure    at home and abroad    as we need to be  and deserve to be   Looking at the record  the answer is  unfortunately  no       It is time that President Bush works with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to address the real challenges to America   s security   Together  there is nothing Americans  cannot do   We ask the President to use these challenges to unite our nation       The needs are great   On national security  Osama bin Laden is still at large   Al Qaeda is resurging in Afghanistan   There was no Iraq al Qaeda connection before the war  sadly  there is one now   Iraq is now the training ground for a new generation of terrorists       The war in Iraq has diverted resources away from the war on terror  and damaged America   s standing in the world   It has limited our options to deal with other clear threats to our security     including the growing nuclear threats from both Iran and North Korea   And it stretched the finest military force in the world dangerously thin       Two new reports came out yesterday that underscore the danger   The first was written by a retired Army Officer under a contract with the Pentagon   He warned that the Army is    in a race against time    to adjust to its dramatically increased tempo of operations    or risk    breaking    the force in the forms of a catastrophic decline    in recruitment and re enlistment       The other report  by former Secretary of State Madeline Albright and former Defense Secretary William Perry  warned that the strains on our armed services must be relieved soon or they will have    highly corrosive and potentially long term effects on the force          Secretary Rumsfeld said yesterday that our troops battle hardened   America is justifiably proud of the strength and commitment of our men and women in uniform  but the Iraq war has taken its toll and we owe it to those brave soldiers not to ignore the reality of their sacrifice or the challenges we face in keeping our military strong       Is our homeland security as strong as it needs to be   Again  the answer is no       Last October  the 9 11 Commission released its final report card on the status of its recommendations to protect America from terrorism  It contained five Fs  12 Ds  nine Cs and only one A minus      Dismal    is how commission member Jim Thompson  the former governor of Illinois and a good Republican  put it       More than four years after 9 11  security personnel at America   s nuclear plants remain ill equipped and untrained to deter terrorist attacks   There are still 3 000 chemical plants in America where a terrorist attack could threaten more than 10 000 people and  in many cases  more than 1 million people   Yet  the chemical industry remains completely self regulated when it comes to terrorism   To quote a former Georgia Pacific security official      Security at 7 11 after midnight is better than that at a plant with a 90 ton tank of chlorine          Only a small fraction of the cargo that comes into America   s ports  and is loaded onto commercial airliners  is inspected   Firefighters  police officers and emergency health care workers still can   t communicate with each other in times of crisis     whether it   s a terrorist attack or a natural disaster   And the administration continues to call for cuts in programs to help communities hire new police officers and new firefighters     our first line of defense   They continue to ignore the reality that homeland security starts with hometown security       Why have so many homeland security vulnerabilities been neglected   9 11 Commission co chair Governor Tom Kean stated it clearly   Homeland security  he said  is     quote        not a priority for the government         God help     he added     if we have another attack        Is our health care as secure today as it should be       A record 46 million Americans are uninsured     5 million more since President Bush took office   Health care spending now consumes 16 percent of our nation   s total economic output     a record   Health care costs are rising more than twice as fast as inflation  and nearly three times faster than wages     and medical bills are the reason for half of all personal bankruptcies       Is our economic security as strong as it should be       Corporate profits are up dramatically  but real wages for American workers have declined for four years in a row   The average monthly employment growth in America since 2001 has averaged just one seventh of the average monthly jobs gain between 1945 and 2000   And that was before Ford Motor Company announced this week that it is cutting 30 000 jobs       People are putting in a lifetime on jobs    then losing their pensions to mergers  bankruptcies and corporate sleight of hand       Energy costs are skyrocketing       The president says this economic recovery is strong   Yet the number of Americans     and the number of American children     living in poverty has increased every year for the past four years       And America is  2 trillion deeper in debt   Our government has borrowed more money from foreign creditors under George W  Bush than all of our previous presidents combined   We   re mortgaging our children   s future to China  Japan and Saudi Arabia       This Administration must know the challenges facing America   But their priorities are much different   Along with Republican leaders in Congress  they have used their one party control to reward their friends and contributors and advance their narrow political agenda   Too often  they have treated America   s urgent security challenges not as problems to be solved  but as opportunities for special interests       The new Medicare prescription drug fiasco is one example  It   s called Medicare Part D   And apparently     D    stands for    disaster          The Medicare prescription drug benefit was hailed as the crown jewel of the Republican health care reform agenda   Instead  it is a costly  complicated mess that wastes tens of billions of dollars in handouts to pharmaceutical and insurance companies     two of the most profitable industries in the world       A month after the bill was passed  the Republican leader in charge of writing the legislation in the House began negotiating for a new job    earning  2 million a year as the Washington point person for the pharmaceutical industry    Almost a dozen other high placed government officials who helped push this disastrous prescription drug benefit through Congress also cashed in their chips for big jobs working for the pharmaceutical industry       Is it any wonder that Americans are cynical about a Washington scene dominated by Jack Abramoff  the notorious K Street Project  and these revolving door scandals       If we are truly focused on ending the culture of corruption in Washington  our first bill in the House and the Senate should repair the glaring problems in the Medicare prescription drug program     not reward some new special interest group       Next week  President Bush will speak to America about the state of our union  and the week after that he will send to Congress his proposed budget for the coming year   The President faces a choice  He can continue a tax policy which is unfair to working families and which rewards the wealthiest corporations and individuals   He can continue to protect his place in history as the first president to ever call for tax cuts in the middle of a war       But how can he ask for so much sacrifice from our soldiers and their families     and so little from those of us who are safe at home  It   s time for the President to change directions   It   s time for the President to work with both parties in Congress to meet America   s real security challenges     at home and around the world       When it comes to national security  we know that asking questions is not what undermines our troops    morale  What undermines troops    morale is being sent into war without a plan to win  and without adequate armor and equipment       More than 550 000 US service members have served in Iraq   More than 16 400 have been wounded   More than 7 000 have suffered amputations  traumatic brain and spinal injuries  many of them will require a lifetime of care  And more than 2 200 of American service men and women have died in Iraq  They have given their lives       Ninety of those fallen heroes were from my state of Illinois     from cities and towns like Albion and Aurora  Chicago  Rock Island  Crystal Lake  and Paris  Zion  Naperville  Bloomington  East Peoria  East Alton  and Woodlawn       Our troops have done everything we have asked of them  We owe it to them  and to their families  to hold our government accountable for a real plan to succeed in Iraq       Secretary Rumsfeld says we go to war with the Army we have   But three years into this war  it is inexcusable to still be sending troops to war without adequate body armor and equipment       Seventy nine Senators     Democrats and Republicans     have said 2006 must be a year of significant transition in Iraq   The President must make it clear to Iraqis  and the world  that America will not stay in Iraq indefinitely   Iraqis must assume responsibility for securing their own borders and protecting their own citizens       On homeland security  the President tells us he cannot both lead the nation and follow the law       Democrats have demonstrated time and again since 9 11 that we are prepared to work with this president to make America safe   But the president has the responsibility to come forward and tell us if laws need to be changed   Neither this president  nor any president  is above the law       On health security  unfortunately  instead of learning from the mistakes with the Medicare drug disaster  the President seems determined to repeat them   He   s pushing another special interest project for insurers disguised as a plan for covering the uninsured   They   re called    health savings accounts      They   re a leftover political favorite from the Golden Age of Newt Gingrich  dreamed up by     who else     an insurance company       One study of the President   s health savings account proposal     by an M I T expert     concluded that it would actually increase the number of uninsured Americans by 350 000     and cost taxpayers  25 billion   And  like the President   s Social Security privatization scheme  HSAs leave people with more risk and even less security       Democrats have better ideas       To start with  we believe the law must be changed to allow the federal government to bargain for lower drug prices on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities       In Illinois  thanks to the leadership of Governor Blagojevich  our state has made a commitment to provide basic health insurance for every child   Why won   t Congress make that same commitment       We can pass my Small Business Health Benefits Plan  to give employees of small businesses the same kinds of health care choices Congress has    for much less than they pay now       And Democrats support allowing people 55 and older to buy into Medicare       After five years of closed door deal making  we hope the President will listen less to people who have written big checks to political campaigns     and more to the people who are working hard just to write the checks to pay their bills       We hope to hear the President say he has a plan that will truly keep America safe and secure  at home and around the world   Democrats are ready to work with the President to pass that plan   Together  we can do better
