     DURBIN SAYS ILLINOIS FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE SAME ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5 9 2006                                                                                                                                                                            DURBIN SAYS ILLINOIS FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE SAME ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tuesday  May 9  2006           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on the Senate Republican leadership to allow a vote on his Small Employers Health Benefits Plan Act  SEHBP  during debate on the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act  S  1955        Durbin and other Senate Democrats spoke at a rally attended by health care advocates from the American Nurses Association  American Cancer Society  the Academy of Pediatrics and representatives from other organizations   These organizations support Durbin   s efforts to provide small businesses with access to affordable health insurance and are publicly opposed to S 1955 because it will weaken consumer protections and sweep aside requirements to cover cancer screening  well baby care  immunization  access to specialists and many other needed services       Durbin said his legislation  which he introduced with Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR   is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP    FEHBP has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees  including members of Congress and their staffs  a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years  SEHBP would give employees of small businesses access to a comparable range of private health plans          The model already exists that can help small business owners in Illinois and across the country provide health care to their employees and it   s called the Federal Employees Health Benefits program     Durbin said      FEHBP has worked for 40 years for every member of Congress  and 8 million federal workers  Small business owners and their employees should have the same opportunity             What   s good enough for members of Congress is good enough for American families     Durbin added       Durbin said his legislation is supported by health advocates and organizations in Illinois and across the country  including the American Diabetes Association  AARP and the National Mental Health Association because it provides consumers with a wide range of private health insurance choices without weakening state guaranteed coverage          The Durbin bill will give small businesses access to comprehensive health insurance options that will cover lifesaving diabetes treatments   It s real insurance that will be there when you need it   said Chicago area resident and American Diabetes Association State Advocacy Leader  Jim Radermacher       Gail Wilson  State Director of the March of Dimes Illinois Chapter said     We applaud Senator Durbin   s initiative  the    Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act   This bill is an important and creative solution that can help reduce uninsurance rates among small business employees without jeopardizing important consumer protections that many states  including Illinois  have worked hard to enact          Durbin warned that S 1955  introduced by Senator Mike Enzi  WY   would eliminate guaranteed protections for many important health needs and allow insurance companies to define benefits packages   According to a study released by Families USA  the Enzi legislation would remove basic health care guarantees for 3 899 000 Illinois residents who currently are covered for a host of basic treatments  including cervical cancer screening  diabetic supplies education  mammography screening  ovarian cancer screening  prescription inhalants  prostate cancer screening  and TMJ disorders  among others          The Bush Enzi legislation is the wrong medicine for a very serious problem   It will put the insurance companies  not doctors  in charge of health care  will make people worse off and will reduce protection for those already covered     Durbin said          Small business owners want to cover health care costs for their employees  but it is becoming more expensive each year   We can make health insurance for small businesses more affordable without slashing benefits or weakening consumer protections by expanding the pool of people protected   What SEHBP will offer is lower rates  greater choices and guaranteed protection     Durbin concluded
