ANNOUNCE  1 MILLION FOR GRAND AVENUE UNDERPASS IN FRANKLIN PARK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wednesday  August 3  2005    FRANKLIN PARK  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today announced  1 million in federal funding for construction of the Grand Avenue Underpass in Franklin Park   Durbin  who made the announcement at the construction site  worked with U S  Rep  Rahm Emanuel to secure the funding   Emanuel will announce the House appropriation soon   The funding is part of  215 million Durbin has secured for Illinois in the TEA 3 transportation bill recently passed in Congress         The Grand Avenue crossing has been named one of the most congested in the Chicago region     Durbin said      Emergency vehicles are often delayed while traveling from one side of town to the other   The underpass will mean improved access for fire trucks  ambulances and law enforcement  as well as increased productivity for commercial vehicles and less congestion for commuters           Securing this funding for the Grand Avenue Underpass is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     said Obama     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges           The Village of Franklin Park has been working to get this underpass built for decades     Emanuel said      When this project is complete  Franklin Park will no longer be forced to function as a bisected community when the trains are coming through   I   m proud to have worked with Senator Durbin to secure these funds   When this project is complete  traffic will flow more smoothly and the community will be safer        More than 4 000 vehicles are delayed due to the current  road level railroad crossing on a typical weekday   That translates to 223 hours of motorist delays   The combined cost of pollution and commuter delay is an estimated  880 000 per year      The Grand Avenue Underpass is urgently needed because the current traffic problems will only be exacerbated when plans are implemented to relocate and combine the IHB Railroad line with the existing CN Railroad line  which currently crosses Grand Avenue      Durbin secured  500 000 last year for grade separation at the Grand Avenue crossing   The total cost of the project is more than  40 million     The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21      Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level     Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families        It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois           This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
