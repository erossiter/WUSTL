    Friday  September 29  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today received assurances from the U S  Department of Defense  DOD  that the development of wind farms in Illinois will not be stopped by a DOD report released this week   Yesterday  the Illinois senators announced that they would lift the hold on Mr  Robert Wilkie  the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs  once they received a formal assurance from the Administration that the development of wind farms in Illinois will not be stopped by this report   The hold was lifted today          Nearly 5 months after it was promised  the Administration has finally assured us that Illinois wind farms do not interfere with military radar and are safe to operate without the threat of being shut down by the report   s findings     said Durbin      Now that we have the answers we have been waiting for  we will lift the hold on Mr Wilkie   The Illinois wind industry can now confidently move forward in contributing to the development of one of our nation s best sources of clean alternative energy             Wind power is an important part of our efforts to reduce America   s dependence on foreign oil  so I   m pleased that the DOD has indicated it will permit these projects to move forward  and I will release my hold on Mr  Wilkie   s nomination     Obama added       On March 21  2006  DOD and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issued a joint interim policy on the proposed windmill locations which states     The DOD DHS Long Range Radar Joint Program Office Interim Policy is to contest any establishment of windmill farms within radar line of site of the National Air Defense and Homeland Security Radars      Shortly thereafter  the Midwest Regional Office of the FAA sent    notice of presumed hazard    letters to wind farm sites that they had determined are in the line of site  The FAA defined    in the line of site    as any windmill within a 60 mile radius of a radar center or radar tower       On June 2  2006  Senators Durbin  Obama  Russ Feingold  D WI   Herb Kohl  D WI   Kent Conrad  D ND  and Byron Dorgan  D ND  wrote letters to officials at DOD and FAA voicing their support for the responsible development of wind power   Shortly after these requests were made to FAA  nearly all Illinois projects were given the go ahead from FAA to resume construction and operation   However  without the DOD report findings  any wind farm that resumed development did so at the risk of being shut down once the DOD report came out       On September 7  Durbin and Obama told Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that they would block a Senate vote on the nomination of Mr  Wilkie to be Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs until the DOD issued the long overdue report   Three weeks letter  the report was released       In the letter received today  the senators were told that    The FAA has determined that the wind turbine facilities currently operating in Illinois  as well as those facilities under construction reviewed by the FAA  pose no hazard to military radar  The Department of Defense report cannot and will not be used to change the current FAA determination of the projects in Illinois             text of letter below         September 29  2006   Dear Senator Durbin    Thank you for your inquiry as to the findings contained in the recent Department of Defense report entitled the  Effect of Windmill Farms On Military Readiness        The report concludes that although wind turbines located in radar line of sight of air defense radars can adversely impact the ability of those units to detect and track  by primary radar return  any aircraft or other aerial object  the magnitude of the impact is dependant upon the number and locations of the wind turbines       The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has the responsibility to promote and maintain the safe and efficient use of U S  airspace  The FAA has determined that the wind turbine facilities currently operating in Illinois  as well as those facilities under construction reviewed by the FAA  pose no hazard to military radar  The Department of Defense report cannot and will not be used to change the current FAA determination of the projects in Illinois       Finally  we want to assure you that the report fully complies with the requirements set forth in section 358 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FiscalYear 2006  P L  109 163        We appreciate your interest      Department of Defense
