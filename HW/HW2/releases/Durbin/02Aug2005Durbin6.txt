AND EVANS ANNOUNCE  20 75 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR QUAD CITIES AREA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  August 2  2005   I 74 Bridge and U S  30 Widening Top the List of Projects     MOLINE  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representative Lane Evans today announced  20 75 million in federal funding for the replacement of the I 74 Bridge  the widening of U S  30 between Fulton and Rock Falls  among other key projects   The funding was secured through the TEA 3 bill recently passed by Congress          Durbin and Obama secured a total of  5 million and Evans secured an additional  4 million for the replacement of the I 74 Bridge   The bridge is vital to the continued economic development of the Quad Cities area  connecting several locally important commercial and industrial centers and serving as a north south corridor of national significance   As it stands today  the bridge is substantially over capacity  carrying nearly twice its design at 74 000 vehicles per day             The number of people using the bridge and the structure   s functional problems leave little margin of error for safety and congestion     Durbin said      This funding will help the Quad Cities begin the work necessary to build a bridge that meets the demands of the communities using it today and decades into the future               Securing this funding for the I 74 bridge is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     Obama said     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges              The new Transportation Bill is a jobs bill     Evans said      It will provide an important boost to job creation and spur economic opportunities for our state and nation   The legislation will also help us address the problems of congestion  traffic safety and crumbling roads and bridges   It will make our roads and highways safer for the traveling public   I was pleased to work with area citizens  state officials  and the congressional delegation to increase the flow of transportation funds to Illinois           Durbin and Obama also secured  5 million and Evans secured an additional  1 5 million for the U S  30 project which would create a four lane route from Rock Falls to Fulton   The corridor is intended to be the final link in a four lane configuration connecting Interstate 88 in Illinois with Interstate 35 in Central Iowa   Industry and agriculture are both strongly linked to the quality of transportation routes that connect the county with its region and link it to the nation             As America   s first coast to coast highway  U S  30 has a rich history within Northwest Illinois     Durbin said      But today  U S  30 is congested and verging on unsafe   The project we   re helping to fund will help the communities along U S  30 maintain their historic character as a locations along the original Lincoln Highway   Beyond improving safety for residents and travelers  the improved route will assist Northwest Illinois in attracting new business and industry by creating a direct link to and from geographic markets to the east of Whiteside County to Chicago and to those west of the County through eastern Iowa to DesMoines          The TEA 3 bill includes the following funding for projects important to the Quad Cities are          The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21         Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level        Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families           It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois              This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
