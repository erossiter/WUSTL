This week  the State also requested low interest loans through the Small Business Administration  SBA   SBA loans can be provided under an    SBA disaster assistance    declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes two types of loans  physical disaster loans to homeowners and economic injury disaster loans for businesses   Physical disaster loans provide up to  200 000 at 4 percent interest over 30 years for homes damaged by flooding   Economic injury loans provide up to  1 5 million at 4 percent interest over 30 years for companies that can prove a loss in business because of the disaster   A federal disaster declaration would include SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA       Text of
