LEGISLATION FOR STUDENT LOAN RELIEF FOR YOUNG PROSECUTORS  PUBLIC DEFENDERS APPROVED BY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thursday  May 25  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      Bipartisan legislation introduced by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  to make public service more viable for law graduates was approved today by the Senate Judiciary Committee  Durbin   s legislation  co sponsored by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA  and Sen  Mike DeWine  R OH   is considered    the highest priority for criminal prosecutors and defenders          With the average law graduate carrying a staggering amount of student loan debt      97 763 for those who attended private schools  and  66 810 for public schools     Durbin   s bill would establish a student loan repayment option for full time prosecutors and public defenders who agree to serve as public interest attorneys for a minimum of three years          With the cost of law school continuing to climb  some of the best law students cannot serve as criminal prosecutors or defenders because of student loan obligations     Durbin said      Student loan assistance will help those outstanding law school graduates choose from public service          Durbin cited the contrast between the average loan debt for today s law school graduate and the average entry level salary for a prosecutor or public defender as evidence of the need for relief    In 2004  almost 87 percent of law students borrowed to finance their legal education  and the amount borrowed by many students exceeds  80 000   Many of these students also carried unpaid debt from their undergraduate studies  At the same time  the median entry level salary for public defenders is  39 000 per year and the starting salaries for local prosecuting attorneys is similar  starting at about  40 000 per year       From an employer   s prospective  low salaries and high debt make it extremely difficult to recruit and retain attorneys in prosecutor and public defender offices   The Department of Justice has found that almost one third of prosecutor   s offices reported problems with recruitment and retention of staff attorneys          Today s action by the Senate Judiciary Committee is very good news    not only for the young men and women who will benefit from this program directly  but also for the victims of crime     said Paul Logli  President of the National District Attorneys Association and States Attorney in Winnebago County  Illinois      If we want to attract the best and brightest young attorneys to handle significant cases  then we need legislation like this          In addition  results of a survey by Equal Justice Works and the Partnership for Public Service show that a majority of public interest law employers  including public defender offices  report significant difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention   In recruiting efforts  89 percent of employers identified low salaries and 88 percent identified high educational debt as major impediments          For our criminal justice system to function effectively  public defenders must have the ability to recruit and retain highly qualified attorneys to represent the accused  Under the current system  many young attorneys who want to practice public interest law simply cannot afford to do so   said Illinois State Appellate Defender  Ted Gottfried   Passage of this bill will make it easier for students interested in public law to both practice law for the common good and be able to pay their bills          Durbin s legislation     the Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act     is modeled after the student loan repayment program currently available to federal employees   Like the federal employee program  attorneys eligible for loan repayment could have of up to  10 000 per year of student loan debt repaid   Loan repayments are capped at a maximum of  60 000 per individual       The proposed loan repayment program is supported by the American Bar Association  the National District Attorneys Association  the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators  the National Legal Aid and Defender Association  and the American Council of Chief Defenders       Durbin   s bill will now be placed on the Senate floor calendar and could be considered by the full Senate this summer
