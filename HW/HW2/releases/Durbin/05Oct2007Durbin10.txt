                                                                                                                                                                                           Friday  October 5  2007   COLLINSVILLE  IL   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  called on members of the House of Representatives to help override the Presidents veto of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  Reauthorization Act  The bipartisan legislation  which reflects a House Senate compromise but was vetoed by the President on Wednesday  would provide health care to more than 10 million low income children  including 154 000 newly insured low income children in Illinois  The Senate passed the bill 67 to 29 with 18 Republican supporters  a veto proof majority   In the House  the bill was approved 265 to 159  with support from 45 Republicans  But  there are not yet enough votes in the House to override the Presidents veto  The President s proposal to add just  5 billion over the next 5 years isn t enough  At that level  hundreds of thousands of children will likely lose coverage  At that level  we start moving backward  pushing kids and families out of coverage and increasing the number of uninsured  Weve seen a dramatic increase of uninsured children in this nation for the first time since 1998  The number of uninsured children rose to 8 7 million in 2006  up from 8 million in 2005  a 9 percent increase in 1 year  said Durbin  I believe a strong America begins at home  And it begins with health care    to bring peace of mind to parents who otherwise worry that tomorrow that earache may turn into something worse  These are kids who need basic health protection and do not have it today  They are not the poorest of the poor  Those kids already have help from our government  These kids are the children of working families  families who  unfortunately  have no health insurance at their workplace  said Durbin  These families deserve the security that comes with knowing your children have health care  Durbin noted that the amount of money the U S  spends every day in Iraq could be used to cover 246 000 kids and the amount spent over 41 days in Iraq could cover 10 million kids  SCHIP was created in 1997 to provide health care coverage for children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid  but not enough to afford private insurance  This bill will give states the resources and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are currently eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP  Specifically  this bipartisan bill    Invests  35 billion in new funding for SCHIP  The bill reauthorizes the Childrens Health Insurance Program  investing an additional  35 billion over five years to strengthen SCHIPs financing  increase health care coverage for low income  uninsured children  and improve the quality of health care children receive    Ensures health care coverage for more than 10 million American children  First  the bill ensures that the 6 6 million children who currently participate in SCHIP continue to receive health care coverage  It also extends coverage to 3 8 million children who are currently uninsured  according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office    Improves CHIP benefits    ensuring dental coverage and mental health parity  Under the bill  quality dental coverage will now be provided to all children enrolled in SCHIP  The bill also ensures that states will offer mental health services on par with medical and surgical benefits covered under SCHIP    Improves outreach tools to streamline enrollment of eligible children  The bill provides  100 million in grants for new outreach activities to states  local governments  schools  community based organizations  safety net providers and others    Improves the quality of health care for low income children  The bill establishes a new quality child health initiative to develop and implement quality measures and improve state reporting of quality data  The SCHIP bill passed by Congress has been endorsed by more than 270 organizations  representing millions of Americans  ranging from groups such as the American Medical Association and Americas Health Insurance Plans to Families USA  the consumer advocacy group
