INTRODUCES BILL TO ENCOURAGE HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tuesday  April 24  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation   S  1190  the Connected Nation Act of 2007  to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas  The legislation creates a matching grant program to be administered through the Department of Commerce to assist statewide or regional public private partnerships increase broadband access  map resources and build demand        Broadband has become an essential service like water  gas and electricity  Our homes and businesses need affordable access to high speed internet connections  in the same way our homes and businesses need traditional utility services   said Durbin   Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality   When I travel in downstate Illinois  people tell me that they cannot wait to have broadband service  but that there is no service available to them right now  That must change        Durbin s legislation is modeled on public private partnerships now functioning successfully in Kentucky  North Carolina and a few other states   Durbin noted that this type of approach is one of the few successful models that bring together providers  advocates  and units of government   Proprietary information can be protected and detailed maps can be developed  which is an important first step to building out broadband networks   In addition  the model creates a statewide or regional clearinghouse of technical assistance  grant writing  and demand building expertise       In the case of Kentucky  this approach has brought large providers like BellSouth together with rural development advocates and state and local units of government to build incredibly detailed maps that include each individual cell tower  detailed market data  and other demographic and infrastructure information that helps companies better provide broadband and take advantage of existing infrastructure   As a result  access and use have increased dramatically in the state since the formation of the group in 2001   This approach leverages corporation and foundation dollars and is far less expensive than paying directly for infrastructure       Two recent reports    one issued by the U S  Department of Commerce and the other by the U S  Department of Agriculture   found that rural and farm households have access to broadband internet at approximately half the level of all U S  households nationwide  Another respected research organization  the Pew Internet and American Life Project  found similar results   In its 2006 report  Pew found that only 18  of rural adults reported a home broadband connection  compared to 31  of urban adults   All of these studies point to a consistent conclusion   Americans living in urban areas are almost twice as likely to have home broadband access as do their rural counterparts       Durbin said broadband is critical to community and economic development  as it encourages investment  creates jobs  improves productivity  fosters innovation  and increases consumer benefits in every corner of our nation  A recent study found that adoption of current generation broadband would increase the gross domestic product by  179 7 billion  while adding approximately 61 000 jobs per year over the two decades   The study also projected 1 2 million jobs could be created if next generation broadband technology were rapidly deployed        We need to close the digital divide  ensuring that rural Americans are not left behind in the 21st Century s digital economy   Durbin noted   Whether it is through telephone wire  cable  fiber  satellite  wireless or any other medium  we need every existing and future broadband service provider to step up to the national challenge        Durbin said his bill creates a competitive  matching grant program  with 80  of the funding from the federal government and the remaining 20  coming from state funds  for eligible statewide public private partnerships to evaluate current access and use  build detailed maps of service and create demand through grassroots teams   Grant applications would be reviewed through a peer review process and eligible entities would be limited to four years of participation   Collaboration is required between state agencies  service providers  and the relevant labor organizations  and community organizations to be considered eligible   Durbin s bill would provide a total of  40 million per year for the program       The legislation has been referred to the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee
