Bipartisan Legislation to Improve Mississippi River Navigation and Ecosystem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  May 16  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced the Senate passage of the Water and Resources Development Act  WRDA    The WRDA bill includes Congressional authorization for locks and dam modernization on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and authorizes specific projects for navigation  ecosystem restoration  and flood and storm damage reduction        Passing WRDA will mean over 50 000 new jobs for the region  shorter shipping times  and improved business for Midwest producers along the river   said Durbin    The Mississippi River transports  12 billion worth of products every year  affecting agriculture  commercial  and labor interests across the state   It is important to update and modernize the waterway to remain competitive in the years to come        The most significant provision in the bill increases lock and dam capacity and improves the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  The legislation authorizes  2 204 billion for replacing and upgrading locks and dams and another  1 717 billion for ecosystem restoration   Updating these locks is critical for industry and agriculture in Illinois   more than half of Illinois  annual corn crop is shipped to export markets on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers  Shipping via barge on the River keeps exports competitive and reduces transportation costs for Illinois farmers and businesses   said Durbin        We have included these environmental funds to make certain that at the end of the process we will leave a thriving river ecosystem for future generations   Durbin said       Today s legislation also includes language that will allow a federally funded feasibility study to investigate the options and technologies available to prevent the spread of invasive species  including Asian Carp  between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and other aquatic pathways   Durbin has worked closely with Congresswoman Judy Biggert  R IL  to enact legislation that would authorize federal funding for Asian Carp Barrier projects       Asian Carp threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem by consuming large quantities of phytoplankton and competing with native fish for habitat   Originally  Asian Carp were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities  The carp have made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River  Asian carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds  and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day       Also included is a provision that would establish independent review panels for U S  Army Corps of Engineers projects   This issue has received significant attention in the wake of the Gulf Coast hurricanes  which showed that major levee failures in New Orleans occurred because of faulty design  construction or maintenance  The Corps of Engineers is responsible for carrying out the majority of the projects contained in the WRDA legislation       The provision would establish an independent panel of experts to review projects costing more than  40 million  projects requested by a state governor  projects for which the director of a federal agency has said could have a significant adverse impact  or projects that the Army s secretary has found to be controversial  The provision also calls for an independent safety review for critical flood damage reduction projects  The independent review process will not lengthen the time line for projects to be completed       Specifically  the bill includes       1 948 billion for the construction of seven new 1 200 foot locks at Locks 20  21  22  24  and 25 on the Upper Mississippi River and at LaGrange Lock and Peoria Lock on the Illinois Waterway    1 717 billion for ecosystem restoration  providing the Corps of Engineers authority to do island building  construction of fish passages  floodplain restoration  water level management  backwater restoration  side channel restoration  wing dam and dike restoration  island and shoreline protection  topographical diversity  use of dredged material for environmental purposes  tributary confluence restoration  land easement authority  and land acquisition    256 million for small scale and non structural improvements such as traffic management and boats that push the barges through locks faster     We have been waiting seven long years for a bill to reauthorize navigation projects all over the country   Now the real work begins as we work on the floor of the Senate to pass this bill and to modernize the Mississippi waterway so our region can remain competitive in the years to come   said Durbin       On April 19th  the House passed a version of the Water Resources Development Act   The House bill and the Senate bill will now be sent to a conference committee to work through the differences
