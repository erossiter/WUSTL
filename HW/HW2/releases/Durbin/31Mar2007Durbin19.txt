     DURBIN  MANZULLO BRING AMTRAK OFFICIALS TO ROCKFORD TO DISCUSS FEASIBILITY STUDY RESULTS WITH REGIONAL LEADERS

MANZULLO BRING AMTRAK OFFICIALS TO ROCKFORD TO DISCUSS FEASIBILITY STUDY RESULTS WITH REGIONAL LEADERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Saturday  March 31  2007    ROCKFORD  IL    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and U S  Rep  Don Manzullo  R Ill   today brought regional leaders together for a briefing on a new report that evaluates possible Northwestern Illinois Amtrak routes between Chicago and Dubuque  Iowa  via Rockford        In July we held a meeting that showed us that Northern Illinois communities are committed to bringing Amtrak back to the area   Durbin said    Today  we have a feasibility study that shows us that adding rail service along the Chicago to Galena Dubuque corridor will give businesses and tourists a time competitive and convenient alternative to the Northwest Tollway rush hour        Amtrak already provides quick  cost effective and reliable public ground transportation to 30 communities in the state   it s time to add communities in Northwest and North Central Illinois to that list   Durbin concluded       The  Feasibility Report on Proposed Amtrak Service   was requested by the Illinois Department of Transportation  IDOT  following a July 2006 town meeting held in Rockford   Durbin  who hosted the meeting  was joined by Manzullo  Amtrak and IDOT representatives  labor officials and community leaders from Boone  Winnebago  Stephenson  Jo Daviess  DeKalb and Ogle Counties to discuss restoring Amtrak s passenger rail service in Northwest Illinois        With the completion of this report  we are now closer than ever before to restoring Amtrak service to Rockford and Northwest Illinois   Cong  Manzullo said   Daily passenger train service to Chicago will give our residents another great transportation option and bolster economic activity throughout northern Illinois  I want to thank Amtrak for completing this study  and I look forward to working with Sen  Durbin  our state officials  and our local leaders to make this new train service a reality        The report identified three possible routes from Chicago to Dubuque   Capital costs vary by route and the annual operating cost for any of the three routes is estimated at less than  5 million  based upon a single daily round trip frequency   Excerpts of the report are attached  and you can download a copy of the executive summary at     We appreciate all the effort that Amtrak has put into gathering the data assembled in this report   said IDOT Acting Secretary Milt Sees   This is a good first step  and gives us some of the information we need as we move forward and work with local communities  their elected leaders and Sen  Durbin to determine the best course of action        Nearly 100 000 cars travel on I 90 daily between Rockford and the Kennedy Edens split in Chicago  Durbin said    The region is ripe for an expansion of passenger rail service   Residents of this region want to be able to take a quick trip to Chicago by rail and they d also like to be able to tap into Amtrak s network via its Midwestern hub   Durbin said    Similarly  Chicagoans would like the opportunity to travel to Galena   the state s second most popular tourist destination   by rail        According to the report  Chicago Rockford travel times of about two hours and Chicago Dubuque travel times of less than 4 5 hours are possible and would be competitive with drive time  depending on the choice of routes  agreements with host railroads and required infrastructure improvements   Amtrak estimates two construction seasons would be needed to make the infrastructure improvements necessary to achieve these travel times       The last passenger train service through Rockford and Freeport to Galena and Dubuque was operated from February 14  1974  through September 30  1981  using the CN  former Illinois Central or Chicago Central  route  At that time  IDOT contracted with Amtrak to operate the daily round trip train known as the Black Hawk        Many parts of the country lost rail passenger service in the 70s and 80s   said Alexander Kummant  Amtrak President and CEO   With partners such as the State of Illinois   and with the support of Sen  Durbin  Cong  Manzullo and others   the Rockford area can again have the economic and environmental advantages of Amtrak service        We look forward to taking the next step  which would involve negotiations with host railroads  development of detailed capital plans and funding requests   Kummant added       Last month  IDOT asked Amtrak to deliver another feasibility report  this one to study state supported service to the Quad Cities  including Rock Island and Moline  Ill     which has never been served by Amtrak trains and which lost its passenger rail service in 1978  when the Rock Island Railroad discontinued operations  The findings of the study are expected by year s end  The IDOT request is the result of a meeting Sen  Durbin held several weeks ago in Rock Island  where public support was heard for a return of passenger trains to the region      About Amtrak  Amtrak provides intercity passenger rail service to more than 500 destinations in 46 states on a 21 000 mile route system  For schedules  fares and information  passengers may call 800 USA RAIL or visit Amtrak com     Excerpts   Feasibility Report on Proposed Amtrak Service   Rockford    The general population growth along the eastern portion of this corridor has been strong over the past decade  but passenger train service formerly provided by Amtrak ceased in 1981  Highway traffic volumes on Interstate 90  Northwest Tollway  between Chicago and Rockford are significant  with frequent backups the closer one gets to Chicago  Rockford is a major residential and commercial center and the largest metropolitan area in Illinois without passenger rail service   Between Rockford and the O Hare Airport area  many new residential developments have been established  Further west  Galena is a significant destination city for tourism  especially during the summer and fall  At Dubuque  there is an aggressive plan underway to redevelop the downtown property along the Mississippi River       Following receipt of the study request  a number of alternative rail routes were identified as candidates for this service  Physical evaluations of the routes were conducted with host railroad personnel  including inspections  assessments of capital needs  and identification of operational challenges  Revenue ridership forecasts were determined based on recommended schedules  and estimates of cost to operate the service were developed  The goal was to prepare a high level and objective report of the findings  in response to IDOT s request  for further discussion       Three alternative routes were identified as potentially feasible for establishment of Amtrak service between Chicago and Rockford  with only one route being practical between Rockford and Dubuque  Each requires a different level of capital investment to make the service a practical reality      Although there have been general discussions and field inspections with the host freight railroads  the specific infrastructure improvement proposals  draft schedules and other railroad related comments have not been negotiated or agreed to with the host freight railroads and reflect only the findings and best judgment recommendations of the study team  Should further progression of one of the alternative proposals be desired  detailed discussions and negotiations will have to be initiated with those rail carriers  emphasis added
