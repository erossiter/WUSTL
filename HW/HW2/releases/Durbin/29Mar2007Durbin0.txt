March 29  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    The U S  Senate today passed legislation introduced by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  Senator Tom Coburn  R OK   who serves as Ranking Member of the subcommittee  Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and Senator John Cornyn  R TX  that will close a legal loophole that currently prevents the U S  Justice Department from prosecuting people in the United States who have committed genocide in other countries        There is no safe haven for the hundreds of thousands of Sudanese facing genocide in Darfur and yet our country is providing a safe haven for their killers   said Durbin    The current loophole in our genocide laws has real life consequences  While genocide rages in Darfur  the United States must commit to holding those guilty of genocide accountable        Under current law  genocide is only considered a crime if it is committed within the United States or by a U S  national outside the United States   The Genocide Accountability Act would close the current loophole by amending the Genocide Convention Implementation Act to allow prosecution of non U S  citizens for genocide committed outside the U S        In America we are blessed with the most effective and just legal system in the world   It is contrary to our system of justice to allow perpetrators of genocide to go free without fear of prosecution    Fundamentally  we must decide if genocide is a bad enough crime  no matter where it happens  that it warrants the same treatment as terrorism related crimes   said Senator Tom Coburn  M D       The Justice Department has identified individuals who participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and who are living in the United States under false pretenses   Under current law  these individuals cannot be arrested or prosecuted  because they are not U S  nationals and the genocides in which they were involved did not take place in the United States   In contrast  the laws on torture  material support for terrorism  terrorism financing  hostage taking  and many other federal crimes are still considered crimes when committed outside the United States by non U S  nationals        This bill allows for prosecution of those found in the United States who have participated in horrific acts against humanity in places like Bosnia  Rwanda  and Darfur  and it gives federal prosecutors the tools they need to bring these people to justice   said Senator Leahy    I have long called for greater U S  involvement in resolving the crisis in Darfur and worked for greater accountability for those who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity  and it was a pleasure to work with Senator Durbin to set up a Human Rights Subcommittee in the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time   This bill is an indication of the important scope and work of the new subcommittee        Salah Abdallah Gosh  the head of security in the Sudanese government  has reportedly played a key role in the government s genocidal campaign in Darfur   In 2005  Gosh came to Washington to meet with senior Administration officials   Under current law  the FBI could not even interview Gosh about his involvement in the Darfur genocide  much less charge him with a crime        The genocide in Darfur has become the world s most dire human rights and humanitarian crisis   Sen  Cornyn said   We must hold those guilty of atrocities responsible and ensure they are brought to justice  By closing the current loophole in federal law  this bill takes important steps to rid the world of genocide        This bill is the first to be produced by the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law which was officially established at the Senate Judiciary Committee s first business meeting of the 110th Congress   The subcommittee has jurisdiction over all human rights laws and policies and will focus on issues such as genocide  human trafficking  war crimes  crimes against humanity  torture  and arbitrary detention  The Human Rights Subcommittee s first hearing was held in February and focused on the genocide in Darfur and other parts of the world       The Genocide Accountability Act has been endorsed by numerous organizations  including the Save Darfur Coalition  Genocide Intervention Network  American Jewish World Service  Armenian Assembly of America  Armenian National Committee of America  Human Rights First  Human Rights Watch  Alliance for Justice  Refugees International  and ENOUGH


