25  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL  and Congressman Jerry Costello  D IL  today praised the decision of the U S  Department of Energy to include two sites in downstate Illinois as contenders for the location of a  1 billion  first of a kind  near zero emissions coal fueled power plant known as FutureGen       The Department of Energy today selected two Illinois communities     Mattoon and Tuscola     to move forward to the next step of the selection process  Sites were evaluated on criteria ranging from the size of the site to the site   s access to transportation routes to the site   s proximity to geographically well suited areas  Since April  teams of renowned U S  and international scientists have reviewed the proposals from 12 communities vying for the FutureGen project       FutureGen is a  1 billion government industry project which will produce the first emissions free coal generation plant of its kind   The Department of Energy developed a short list of the most qualified states earlier this year  and are expected to make a final site selection in mid  to late  2007        FutureGen is the number one federal energy project for downstate Illinois  an area that has the coal and the commitment needed to make it a reality     said Durbin    Finding cleaner ways to generate power using coal will help ensure our country   s energy security and address global warming   I have been working closely with Senator Obama and Representative Costello to bring this project to Illinois   I was pleased to see that two of our downstate communities were selected to continue in the next critical stage of this project  Today   s announcement is a testament to the work of local officials and community leaders in Mattoon and Tuscola  and we will continue to work with them to make this effort a success             It   s often said that Illinois is the Saudi Arabia of coal  but it   s clear that we aren   t harnessing that potential     said Senator Obama     The FutureGen project is the future of coal in the United States  and with our vast coal deposits  skilled labor force  and technological know how  there is no better place than Illinois for this plant to be located           We have believed since the beginning that Illinois is the perfect place to locate FutureGen and the inclusion of Mattoon and Tuscola on the list of final sites brings us one step closer to that goal   said Costello    The cooperation of all levels of government   federal  state and local   has been critical to our getting this far and we will continue to work with the Governor and local officials as the final site is selected   Today is also important because it means FutureGen has reached another important milestone   FutureGen  no matter where it is located  is good news for Illinois coal        The President   s FY2007 budget made a commitment of  54 million for FutureGen   An additional  200 million will become available on October 1  2007 to support continued funding   Non Federal sources will be required to match funds for initial planning and research at least 20 percent       Illinois has almost one eighth of the coal reserves in the United States and one quarter of the nation   s bituminous coal reserves   The Illinois coal industry produces approximately 35 million tons of coal and generates more than  1 billion in gross revenues   Currently  recoverable coal reserves in the state of Illinois amount to more than 30 billion tons   The valuable mineral underlies 65 percent of the state   s surface       Durbin  Obama and Costello noted that Illinois geology is also well suited for the carbon trapping technology that the FutureGen project would need to develop   Illinois is home to oil and gas reserves and deep saline aquifers that can capture and sequester carbon dioxide       In addition  Southern Illinois University operates its Coal Research Center in Carbondale  one of the top such centers in the country   which conducts a wide range of studies that deal with the commercial development of coal  The center   s work includes improvements of coal cleaning processes  the reduction of air pollution from coal fired power plants  the reduction of solid waste residues from coal burning  and the development of products from those residues       In early December of 2005  Secretary Bodman announced that the Department of Energy would be moving forward with the project  after signing an agreement with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance  a group of coal and energy companies with investment commitments to the project   The FutureGen Initiative was initially announced by President Bush in February 2003   Over the next year  site selection  design activities  and environmental analyses will lay the groundwork for final project design  construction  and operation
