     DURBIN TRIBUTE TO RETIRING REPRESENTATIVE LANE EVANS

TO RETIRING REPRESENTATIVE LANE EVANS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday  March 28  2006          U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  gave the following statement today on the Senate floor following Rep  Lane Evans  announcement that he will retire at the end of the 109th Congres   The statement is entitled   Lane Evans   A man of moral and physical courage       A little over an hour ago  my friend and fellow Illinoisan Lane Evans announced that he will not seek re election in November to the House of Representatives   His decision     understandable as it is     is a loss not only for his district but for our state  and for all of America   From the Quad Cities to Quincy  Springfield  Decatur  Carlinville and towns throughout his district  Lane Evans is deeply respected and his service will be greatly missed       For over twenty years  Lane Evans has been my closest friend in the Illinois Congressional Delegation       There are two kinds of courage in this world   There is physical courage  which is rare enough   Then there is an even rarer moral courage   Once in a great while  you find someone who is both   Lane Evans is that sort of man       He grew up in Rock Island  Illinois  the son of a union firefighter   He joined the Marine Corps right out of high school and served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971    some of the most difficult years of America   s longest war       After the Marines  he went to college  and then to Georgetown Law School   He was elected to Congress in 1982       In his nearly quarter century in the House  the Marine who closed his announcement today with the vow    Semper Fi    has been a champion of America   s veterans       He was chairman of the Vietnam  Era Veterans  Congressional Caucus       He worked hard for years with our mutual friend  Tom Daschle  to get compensation for Vietnam veterans injured by exposure to Agent Orange       When veterans of a later war began suffering serious  unexplained illnesses  Lane Evans was one of the first in Congress to push for an investigation into what we now know as Gulf War syndrome       More recently  he joined forces with the Republican chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee to increase assistance for homeless veterans  to fund research on complex multi trauma injuries in combat  to increase G I  benefits for worker training  and to expand VA home loans       He has fought for veterans health benefits  and he has been a leader in the effort to help veterans suffering with post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health concerns which  if left untreated  can be as crippling as any wound caused by bullets or shrapnel       And no one has worked harder for active military  veterans  and civilian employees at the Rock Island Arsenal       Like others who fought in wars  Lane Evans has worked hard for peace       He has worked to ban landmines  which maim and kill thousands of people every year  years after wars end       He hung a portrait of the John Lennon in his office because  he said  John Lennon was often a better reminder than many people he met in Congress of the hopes of working class young people for peace and freedom       Lane Evans has been a champion of America   s workers       After the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended  he said that America could not simply abandon the workers at places like the Rock Island Arsenal whose labor had helped win the Cold War  our government should help those workers train for new jobs in a new economy       He has fought for fair trade       His district includes the town of Galesburg   Less than two years ago  the Maytag plant in Galesburg closed down and shipped 1 600 good jobs to Mexico   Some people might just shrug and say    that   s what happens in a global economy        but not Lane Evans   Once again  he said  in America  we don   t leave our workers behind   He has fought for policies and programs to help workers in Galesburg and across America who are displaced by globalization provide for their families and find new jobs       Lane Evans has fought for family farmers  and for the environment       He has consistently voted to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other pristine wilderness areas from oil and gas exploration  because he understands we can   t drill out way to energy independence  but we can get there       He is co chairman of the Alcohol Fuels Caucus and has been a leader in pro ethanol battles   He was for ethanol before ethanol was cool       Lane Evans was a legal aid lawyer the first time he ran for the House  in 1982   Almost no one thought he had a chance of winning  but a farm crisis was battering the rural communities in western Illinois and much of the rest of rural America back then   The people of Illinois    17th Congressional District decided they wanted someone in Washington who would fight for them  so they elected Lane Evans in 1982     the same year the 20th Congressional District elected a Springfield lawyer named Dick Durbin    and they have re elected him every two years since   He won his last two elections by nearly 2 to 1 margins       I have no doubt he would be re elected again if he had chosen to run in November   But Lane Evans is fighting a different sort of battle       Nearly eight years ago  Congressman Evans announced that he had Parkinson   s Disease   It had been diagnosed three years earlier  after he couldn   t wave his hand at a Labor Day parade in Galesburg     a parade I attended with Lane  When he made the announcement  he said he couldn   t stand long without pain or smile easily   But he could still fight       During his last race  in 2004  he told audiences      I may be slow  but I still know which way to go          Living with Parkinson   s made him a better Congressman because    I can understand what families are going through          Time and again  Lane Evans has shown extraordinary political courage fighting for the values that brought him to public service  But his greatest show of courage has been over the last ten years as he battled a cruel disease and those who tried to exploit his physical weakness       His determination to serve the 17th Congressional District he loves pushed him to work harder as his  Parkinson   s Disease became a heavier burden each day   His dignity and perseverance in the face of this relentless and cruel disease is an inspiration to everyone who knows Lane Evans       In his statement today  Congressman Evans said      I appreciate the support of people I never met before who would ask how I was doing and tell me to keep up the good fight      The truth is  Lane Evans whole adult life has been a series of good fights       Politicians come and go in the halls of Congress but this soft spoken son of Illinois will leave his mark as a man truly committed to securing the American dream for everyone in our nation       Thank heavens for Lane Evans
