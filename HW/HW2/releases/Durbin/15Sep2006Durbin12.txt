     DURBIN CALLS ON EPA TO COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF CRUISE SHIP POLLUTION

EPA TO COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF CRUISE SHIP POLLUTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Friday  September 15  2006          In a letter to the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today wrote that it is    critically important to understand whether the appropriate laws and practices are in place to ensure that our coastal waters are protected from pollution          Durbin called on the EPA to release its    thorough assessment of cruise ship waste streams  an analysis of the effectiveness of existing programs and identification of options for better management of cruise ship waste      Durbin said that a 3 000 passenger cruise ship generates over a million gallons of raw sewage  gray water and oily bilge water each week   Today  the cruise ship industry spews approximately four billion gallons of pollutants into U S  waters on an annual basis  an amount more than 350 times larger than the Exxon Valdez disaster   These pollutants have been found to cause severe damage to our oceans and marine life       Durbin  who is the author of the Clean Cruise Ship Act  added that he was open to revisiting the language of the legislation    based on the findings of the assessment report if it provides new information that is not currently in the public record      Presently  Durbin   s bill would create a 12 mile wide coastal zone in which cruise ships are prohibited from dumping wastes  and requires that any wastes dumped beyond this zone be treated  This bill would also create an effective mechanism to monitor compliance with applicable regulations     something that does not currently exist  Whistleblower protections for employees who report employers    noncompliance with the legislation are also included       The full text of Durbin   s letter to the EPA is below         September 15  2006  Mr  Benjamin Grumbles  Assistant Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  Office of Water  4101M   1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20460   Dear Assistant Administrator Grumbles    I am writing to request a status update from the Office of Water on the cruise ship pollution assessment report that your agency began developing in 2000   The Cruise Ship White Paper released by the EPA in August 2000 concluded that we need a more thorough assessment of cruise ship waste streams  an analysis of the effectiveness of existing programs and identification of options for better management of cruise ship waste   To date  this assessment report has not been released       The information that the assessment report will provide on cruise ship wastewater discharges and other pollution sources is urgently needed   As the cruise line industry continues its rapid growth  it is critically important to understand whether the appropriate laws and practices are in place to ensure that our coastal waters are protected from pollution       I introduced the Clean Cruise Ship Act in both this Congress and the last Congress in order to address the cruise ship pollution problem   It is a reasonable bill that would protect coastal waters from needless discharge of sewage  graywater and other wastewater discharges from cruise ships  While I am strongly committed to this legislation  I would consider revisiting the language based on the findings of the assessment report if it provides new information that is not currently in the public record       In addition  I would be open to receiving a briefing on the US EPA   s recent work on cruise ship wastewater in Alaska and learning more about your efforts on cruise ship pollution in general       I would like to know why the assessment report has not been completed  and whether the EPA has set a firm deadline for its completion   Please feel free to contact my staff if you have any questions  I appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to your response to this inquiry       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator
