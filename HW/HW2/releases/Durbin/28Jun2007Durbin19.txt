Ban Spurs Durbin and DeLauro to Call for Comprehensive Food Safety Agreement Between United States and China

June 28  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   In light of FDAs announcement today to ban five species of fish imported from China  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  sent a letter urging the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach  the Secretary of Agriculture  Michael Johanns and Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  Michael Leavitt to establish a food safety Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  between the U S  and China  An MOU is a legal document describing a bilateral agreement between parties  It expresses a convergence of will between the parties  indicating an intended common line of action  rather than a formal legal commitment   Todays announcement reaffirms that Made in China is rapidly becoming a warning label for American consumers  said Durbin  Todays ban highlights that we need something better than a food safety system that operates on a case by case basis  A Memorandum of Understanding between the U S  and China would give us a legal agreement that would hold the Chinese government and their exporters accountable for sending contaminated products   An avalanche of unsafe foods and products are entering the U S  on a daily basis and we need a regulatory system with the ability to manage and restrict this flow  A comprehensive MOU between the U S  and China would represent a very important component to such a regulatory framework  said DeLauro   In todays letter Durbin and DeLauro noted  Currently  the only two MOUs in place between FDA and its Chinese counterpart concern standards for ceramic ware imported from China  While the U S  Department of Agriculture has a Memorandum of Cooperation  MOC  in place with AQSIQ  the agreement does not have the weight of a legally binding document  In light of the fact that the United States imports about  2 1 billion of agricultural products from China annually and manufacturers in China have recently been responsible for several significant contaminations of food and drug products  we would like to reinforce our view that a comprehensive food safety MOU between the United States and China should be made a top priority   Text of letter below    June 28  2007   The Honorable Michael Leavitt The Honorable Michael Johanns Secretary Secretary Department of Health and Human Services Department of Agriculture 200 Independence Avenue  S W  1400 Independence Avenue  S W  Washington  D C  20201 Washington  D C  20250  The Honorable Andrew von Eschenbach Commissioner Food and Drug Administration 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville  Maryland 20857  Dear Sirs   One of the most startling aspects of the recent pet food recall is the increasing volume of food and food products that the United States imports each year and our regulatory frameworks ability to ensure the quality and safety of these products  Food imports now account for approximately 13 percent of the average American diet  including significant shares of the fruits  juices  meat  and fish and shellfish we consume  For the most part  food imports are safe and healthy  However  the attention brought to this issue due to the pet food recall has revealed multiple instances of unscrupulous food companies exporting flawed  dangerous products to the United States  We are concerned that the current regulatory framework and resource base might not be prepared to manage these problems   Just today  we learned that FDA issued a country wide import alert for imported Chinese farmed seafood products  including catfish  shrimp  and eel  These products were reported to be contaminated by unsafe residue levels of carcinogenic antimicrobials  malachite green  floroquinon  and other contaminants  This announcement is yet another event in an unfortunate series of disturbing food safety problems originating in China   In addition to pursuing legislative and funding solutions to fix these issues  we have also held several meetings over the past two months with FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach and the Peoples Republic of Chinas Ambassador to the United States Zhou Wenzhong to discuss the standards and agreements that govern food safety in the United States and in China  At our May 9  2007 meeting with Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong and Commissioner von Eschenbach  we specifically requested that the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and its Chinese counterpart  the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision  Inspection and Quarantine  AQSIQ   make it a top priority to develop a comprehensive  legally binding Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  in the area of food safety   Currently  the only two MOUs in place between FDA and its Chinese counterpart concern standards for ceramic ware imported from China  While the U S  Department of Agriculture has a Memorandum of Cooperation  MOC  in place with AQSIQ  the agreement does not have the weight of a legally binding document  Because the United States imports about  2 1 billion of agricultural products from China annually and manufacturers in China have recently been responsible for several significant contaminations of food and drug products  we would like to reinforce our view that a comprehensive food safety MOU between the United States and China should be made a top priority   We greatly appreciated hearing the May 25 announcement that during the recent U S  China Strategic Economic Dialogue  SED   representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture requested significant progress on the issue of food safety in China  This announcement requested cooperation from China in the following areas  information sharing  technical assistance  access to melamine test results  the imposition of mandatory registration requirements for firms that export to the United States  the prohibition of export to the United States from unregistered firms  and multi year  multi entry visas for FDA and HHS personnel to conduct inspections in China to protect public health in the United States   In light of the continued trend of contaminated Chinese food and agricultural products  we call on FDA and HHS to make a comprehensive U S  China food safety MOU a priority issue   Thank you very much for your attention to this matter    Sincerely
