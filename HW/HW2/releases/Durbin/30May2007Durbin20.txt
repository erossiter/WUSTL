Committee on Student Financial Aid Offers Solutions to College Affordability Problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  May 30  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  pointed to a study released today by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance which offered a set of solutions to increasing college textbooks costs  Some of the Advisory Committee s recommendations mirror a proposal introduced earlier this year by Durbin to deal with the high cost of college texts  namely providing price and purchasing information to students   In 2006 Congressmen David Wu and Howard McKeon requested a year long study into the factors contributing to rising textbook prices and recommendations for making textbooks more affordable   The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance is a federal advisory committee chartered by Congress to provide advice to the Secretary of the U S  Department of Education   The Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 ensures that the advice that the committees provide to the Executive Branch is both objective and accessible to the public   The average college student spends nearly  900 on textbooks every year and the cost of textbooks has been climbing at twice the rate of inflation  said Durbin  Previous studies have confirmed factors that contribute to the rising costs of textbooks   Today s report takes another step in the right direction by offering a set of solutions to the affordability crisis   I commend the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance for recognizing the importance of providing key information to students and parents   It is time to give them the information and options they need to make educated decisions about managing their finances in school   On March 20  2007  Senator Durbin introduced the College Textbook Affordability Act designed to ensure that college textbooks and supplemental materials are more available and affordable for college students   The legislation will help students manage costs by requiring publishers to provide certain information to faculty and requiring colleges that receive federal assistance to provide parents and students with more access to information by printing the price of textbooks and supplementary materials in the course schedules   The Advisory Committee s report notes that providing key information to students and parents is an essential component of making textbooks affordable   According to the report  two steps can be taken to ensure that information is readily available   First  information on the cost of textbooks and alternative purchasing methods can be sent early to parents and students for budgeting purposes   Second  textbook lists and the International Standard Book Numbers  ISBN  should be posted online prior to the start of the term   Both recommendations are covered in Durbin s bill   Additionally  Durbin s College Textbook Affordability Act  Requires publishers to include the price of textbooks and supplemental material when providing information to faculty  as well as the history of revisions and whether the textbook and supplemental material are available in a potentially lower priced alternative format Requires publishers who bundle course material to offer the textbooks and supplemental material in unbundled versions Requires colleges receiving federal assistance to include the ISBN and retail price of textbooks and supplemental materials in the course schedule Requires schools  when asked  to provide bookstores with access to the course schedule  ISBN numbers of course material  and the maximum and current course enrollment numbers
