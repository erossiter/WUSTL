with VA Secretary  Durbin Announces November VA Hearing on Veterans Healthcare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  October 25  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   At today s meeting with the Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Gordon Mansfield  U S  Senator Dick Durbin announced that the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs will convene a hearing in less than two weeks on hiring practices and quality control of patient care at VA medical facilities  The hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday  November 6  2007 at 10 00am  I am concerned that Marion VA did not have the information they needed before hiring Dr  Viezaga Mendez  More than that  I am concerned that this is indicative of a greater hiring issue at VA medical facilities across the country  said Durbin  Acting Secretary Mansfield has assured me that the quality of care that our veterans receive is of the utmost importance and the ongoing investigations will help to shed light on any cracks that may exist within the system  I have asked the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs to hold a hearing in order to make sure that what happened in Marion does not happen again  In todays meeting  Durbin pressed Mansfield for information regarding the progress of the ongoing investigation at the Marion facility  Acting Secretary Mansfield revealed that the investigation  originally looking into Dr  Viezaga Mendez background  uncovered questions involving a second doctors medical license in Idaho  Because the investigation is ongoing  Acting Secretary Mansfield declined to name the second doctor or comment further    On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the Marion VA Medical Center due to an unusual increase in the mortality rate at the hospital  The VA Inspector General initiated an investigation when questions arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  Four top hospital officials at Marion have also been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  Senator Durbin has worked closely on this issue with Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Last week they called on the Acting VA Secretary  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to new information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  While asking follow up questions to the response that they received from the VA  the Illinois Senators insisted that any concerns over health care quality at the facility must be addressed immediately  The two senators originally sent two letters to the VA    the first  looking into a spike in deaths at the VA Medical Center in Marion  Illinois  That letter was sent on September 17 to Secretary Nicholson asking for more information on the ongoing investigation  In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated  The second letter to Secretary Nicholson was sent on September 24 asking specific questions about the VAs response to the increase in deaths at the center  They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  was allowed to continue to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  On October 17  the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation  IDFPR  decided to indefinitely suspend the license of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who is being investigated in connection with a string of deaths at a VA hospital in Marion  IL
