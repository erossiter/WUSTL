

OPENING STATEMENT FOR NOMINATION HEARING OF JOHN ROBERTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Tuesday  September 13  2005   Judge Roberts  I welcome you and your family to the Judiciary Committee  and I congratulate you on your nomination to be the 17th Chief Justice of the United States       Twelve years ago  at the nomination hearings of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  my friend  Illinois Senator Paul Simon  made a comment worth repeating   He said to the nominee   You face a much harsher judge   than this committee  and that is the judgment of history   And that judgment is likely to revolve around one question  Did you restrict freedom or did you expand it        Senator Simon put his finger on how the United States Senate should evaluate a nominee for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench       Judge Roberts  if you are confirmed as the first Supreme Court Justice of the 21st century  will you restrict the personal freedoms we enjoy as Americans or will you expand them      Civil Rights   When we met together in my office  I gave you a biography of a judge whom I admire greatly   His name was Frank Johnson   He was a federal judge in Alabama  and a lifelong Republican       Fifty years ago  following the arrest of Rosa Parks  Judge Johnson ruled that African Americans in Montgomery  Alabama were acting within their constitutional rights when they organized a boycott of the city s segregated bus system and that Martin Luther King  Jr  and others could march from Selma to Montgomery       As result of those decisions  the Ku Klux Klan branded him the  most hated man in America    Wooden crosses were burned on his lawn   He received so many death threats that he and his family were under constant federal protection from 1961 to 1975   He was denounced as a  judicial activist  and threatened with impeachment       Judge Frank Johnson had the courage to expand freedom in America       Judge Roberts  I hope you agree America must never return to those days of discrimination and limitations on our freedom       Some of the memos that you wrote while serving in the Reagan Administration  however  raise concerns about your views on civil rights and women s rights  concerns that led many of our nation   s leading civil rights groups to openly oppose your nomination       So it is important that you give complete answers to questions about your views on civil rights  equality  and the role of the courts in ensuring those protections   This hearing is your opportunity to clarify the record and to explain your views on these issues today  We cannot assume that the time or maturity has changed the thinking in those Reagan era memos   The refusal of the White House to disclose documents about 16 specific cases which you wrote as Deputy Solicitor General deny this committee more contemporary expressions of your values   Only your testimony before this committee can convince us that the John Roberts of 2005 will be a truly impartial  open minded Chief Justice      Privacy Rights   Concerns have also been raised about your views on another issue critical to the American people  the right to privacy     a right which you disparaged as a young lawyer       Just forty years ago  married couples in Connecticut and other states could be convicted of a crime  fined  and sentenced to up to a year in prison for using birth control       But in 1965  the Supreme Court struck down the Connecticut law in the landmark case Griswold v  Connecticut   The Court held that some decisions were so intensely personal  and their consequences so profound  that the government could not intrude or impose its will upon individuals   That right to privacy was again acknowledged in 1973 in Roe v  Wade       You can search every sentence of the Constitution and never find the word  privacy   Yet the Supreme Court has said the concept of privacy was inseparable from our other individual rights and liberties  It is the foundation of many of our other rights       But the right to privacy is far from settled law in the minds of many   Today  forty years after the Griswold decision  you can see new efforts to restrict the right to privacy  You can see it in attempts to impose gag rules on doctors and other measures that make it harder for women to obtain information related to family planning   You can see it in the sad debate over the tragedy of Terri Schiavo     a debate which led some members of Congress to threaten judges who disagreed with their point of view with impeachment   And you can find it in the eagerness to authorize the government to pry into our financial records  our medical records and our library records       Whether the Supreme Court continues to recognize and protect Americans  right to privacy will have profound consequences for every person in this nation  from the moment of birth to the moment of death   In your early writings you referred to this right of privacy as    an abstraction      We need to know if that is what you sincerely believe      Congressional Power   We also need to hear your views on another fundamental issue   the power of Congress to pass laws that address our nation s most important challenges       In a series of rulings over the past decade  the Supreme Court has struck down an unprecedented number of federal laws including those that bar guns from our nation s schools and protect women from gender based violence     all of which were based on the authority granted to Congress under Article I  Section 8 of the Constitution     the Commerce Clause   In addition  the Supreme Court has adopted a narrow reading of the 14th Amendment which prevented state employees who are victims of discrimination a day in court       If the next Supreme Court takes a narrow view of the Commerce Clause  then the ability of Congress to pass laws on issues of national importance     environmental laws  laws protecting women from violence  even civil rights  workers rights and disability legislation     will be greatly diminished  Many of the most significant legal decisions of the last century could be in jeopardy  That would represent a radical shift in American law       It is important to learn your view of the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment   Do you believe that Congress has the power to pass laws that protect the most vulnerable  no matter where they live  Or do you believe the Supreme Court should remove the federal government from its historic role in setting national standards that protect basic rights      Executive Power   And we need to ask your views on executive power  This is not a subject taught in most law schools  It is not tested on any bar exam  It has not been a major focus in past Supreme Court nomination hearings  Yet it is a subject of great importance to our country today as we fight the war on terrorism       Judge Roberts  some aspects of your early record suggest that you might be overly deferential to the President  It is essential that we know where you stand       If confirmed  you will help determine what role  if any  the judicial branch will play in deciding whether the President or the Executive Branch has exceeded its authority under our Constitution       Throughout history  during times of war  Presidents have tried to restrict liberty in the name of security  At these times  the Supreme Court was the last guardian of the Constitution  The Court has usually been up to the task  but sometimes it has failed  That s why it s crucial that we ensure that nominees to the Court have the courage to say    no    to a President who violates the Constitution       We need Justices like those who stood up to President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War when he authorized the trial of American citizens by military commission rather than a jury of their peers   The words of those Justices still ring true   The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people  equally in war and in peace  and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men  at all times  and under all circumstances        Now  we are being tested again  Will we stand by our Constitution in the age of terrorism  That challenge falls especially on our Supreme Court  and on you Judge Roberts  if you are confirmed      Church and State   We must also learn your views on the First Amendment  particularly the rights relating to religious liberties   Over the past few decades  the Supreme Court has maintained a delicate     yet what I believe to be a proper     balance between the church and the state       In a recent case involving the Ten Commandments  Justice Sandra Day O Connor issued the following challenge    At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the assumption of religious authority by government  Americans may count themselves fortunate   Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails  while allowing private religious exercise to flourish        Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question   Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly        If confirmed  I hope you would not seek to renegotiate time honored church state boundaries but  rather  would maintain our proud tradition of religious freedom protected by the Establishment Clause      Burden of Proof   The burden of proof for a Supreme Court Justice nominee is on the nominee   This burden is greatest when a person is nominated to be the Chief Justice       If you are confirmed as Chief Justice  you would be the most powerful judge in America  You would have the power to write or assign any decision in which you are in the majority   You would have the power to appoint the 11 judges on the FISA Court  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court  which has authority to issue warrants for secret searches and wiretaps of American citizens  You would appoint the committees that determine the rules for civil and criminal procedures  And you would be the president and CEO of a 30 000 person bureaucracy with an annual budget of nearly  6 billion       No one has a right to sit on the Supreme Court  and no one has the right to be the Chief Justice   It is not enough for a nominee to be found well qualified by the American Bar Association     the ABA only looks at judicial temperament and professional competence   The Senate     and the American people     have a right to know whether a nominee has other critical qualities  such as an open mind and a measure of compassion       To meet this burden of proof  a nominee must answer our questions and give the American people insight into his core values and judicial philosophy       We certainly want Supreme Court Justices who are smart and capable   But it s not enough to have a Justice with a prestigious law school degree  Each justice must also have a degree of compassion       If a person who is close minded to the pleas of those who are disadvantaged on the basis of economic status  race  gender  sexual orientation or any other characteristic  that person does not belong on the Supreme Court   Our Justices must be fair and open minded   You will have an opportunity to address this issue directly  not as a lawyer speaking for any President  not as a lawyer speaking for his client     but rather as a person who if confirmed will speak for himself on the Court for decades      Conclusion   I spoke earlier about the courage of Judge Frank Johnson   A few months ago  another judge of rare courage testified before this committee   Her name is Joan Lefkow  and she is a federal judge in Chicago   Last February  her husband and mother were murdered in her home by a deranged man who was angry that Judge Lefkow had dismissed his lawsuit       In her remarks to this committee  Judge Lefkow said that the murders of her family members were  a direct result of a decision made in the course of fulfilling our duty to do justice without fear or favor        In my view  that is the only proper test for a Supreme Court Justice   Will he  do justice without fear or favor    Will he expand freedom for all Americans  as Judge Frank Johnson did       Again  I congratulate you  Judge Roberts  on your nomination and your accomplished career  and I look forward to these hearings and to hearing your answers to these important questions
