                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thursday  May 10  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation that will provide uninsured children with access to quality health care   The Healthy Kids Act will streamline the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  enrollment process and provide states with the resources they need to provide coverage to eligible children   Last week  Representatives Rahm Emanuel  D IL  and Jim Ramstad  R MN  introduced a bipartisan companion bill in the House        It is a moral priority for Congress to make health care accessible to the more than nine million uninsured children in America   said Durbin    Since the creation of SCHIP ten years ago  more than 6 2 million children have been covered including over 290 000 in Illinois   The Healthy Kids Act with expand the flexibility of states to continue to meet the specific health care needs of all their children   I urge Congress to move quickly to pass this legislation        SCHIP began in 1997 as a program designed to provide all children with health insurance and access to quality health care financed jointly by federal and state governments   It has made significant progress in reducing the number of uninsured children  yet nearly 9 million still lack coverage   Two thirds of these children are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP  but not enrolled   For the first time since 1998  the rate of uninsured children increased from 10 8 percent to 11 2 percent   The Healthy Kids Act will reverse this trend by directly addressing the lack of affordable health care for these children       Additionally  the SCHIP program is faced with insufficient federal funding that has forced Illinois and 13 other states to face the very real prospect of having to drop children from SCHIP   Across the country  over 600 000 children enrolled in SCHIP face losing coverage because of these ongoing federal funding shortfalls that total  745 million   In Illinois  the shortfall is almost  250 000 placing more than 200 000 children at risk   The Healthy Kids Act will make sure states have the funding they need to prevent this from happening       Durbin noted   Healthy children grow into healthy adults  which means less health care spending in the long run   We can not let these federal funding shortfalls continue  Reauthorizing SCHIP is critical to our nation s health and economic future        Based on feedback from the state of Illinois and children s advocacy groups  today s legislation takes important steps to expand and improve the current SCHIP   These efforts include      Providing an increase in the federal matching rate for states that increase enrollment as a result of implementation of model outreach and enrollment strategies   Eliminating certain barriers to coverage by providing greater flexibility for proof of citizenship or nationality for purposes of Medicaid eligibility  and additional reimbursement for language assistance services   Creating a grant program to support outreach and enrollment efforts designed to increase the participation of underserved and racial and ethnic minority  eligible children under Medicaid SCHIP   Establishing demonstration projects to improve the quality of pediatric care  including the establishment of medical homes for children  pediatric quality measures  and a disease prevention and treatment demonstration project for racial and ethnic minority children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP   Establishing a Commission on Children s Health Coverage to study all matters relating to children s health coverage  develop recommendations on policy improvements for public and private sectors and produce annual reports as well as a final report    Durbin has actively legislated for SCHIP coverage and funding   In 2005  he introduced the All Kids Health Insurance Coverage Act which aimed to make health insurance for all children a priority by expanding SCHIP   It was referred to committee
