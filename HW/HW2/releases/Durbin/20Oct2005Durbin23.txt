Korean American owned businesses to become the commercial and economic foundations in countless American cities and counties          January 13 was selected by the Centennial Committees of Korean

where the first Korean Americans arrived in Honolulu a century before   Wie has already become third highest paid female athlete in any sport and is a rising American celebrity      NOTE  Please find

Celebration of    Korean American Day         October 20  2005     Mr  President  I am pleased to join Senator Allen as an original cosponsor in introducing a resolution recognizing the contributions of Korean Americans and encouraging the celebration of    Korean American Day          On January 13  1903  a group of 102 men  women and children arrived on the shores of Honolulu  Hawaii  after a long journey across the Pacific Ocean from Korea   The story of these pioneers is a familiar one to all of us who trace our roots to a foreign nation       Like countless other immigrant groups before them  Koreans came to America in search of a better future   Others came to flee a devastating war  repressive government  and poverty   They traded in their sweat equity and homesickness for the priceless opportunity to achieve better economic and educational opportunities and freedom for themselves and for their families in America       During the past century  the Korean American population has grown to over one million  and Korean Americans now live in every single state of our union   Today  they represent one of the largest Asian American populations in the nation   I am proud to note that my State of Illinois is home to over 50 000 Korean Americans  making it the fourth most populated state for Korean Americans  according to the 2000 census data       The contributions made by Korean Americans to our nation include numerous achievements in the fields of economics  education  science  architecture  medicine  athletics  religion  and the arts   Their entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to hard work have allowed Korean American owned businesses to become the commercial and economic foundations in countless American cities and counties   The unique traditional customs  cultures  and the foods of the    Land of the Morning Calm    have enhanced the mosaic of our society       Thousands of Korean Americans have served in our Armed Services  from the two World Wars to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have also served in public and private ways to enhance the long standing relationship between the United States and Korea that is based on our shared economic and security interests       The 102 pioneers who made that fateful decision to leave their home country in 1902 for Hawaii probably wished for not much more than a chance to live on the rich American soil   Never in their wildest imagination could they have known that  a century later  and just a few miles from where they landed in Honolulu  a sixteen year old Korean American girl would announce to an eagerly awaiting world that she would become a professional golfer       Michelle Wie   s announcement from earlier this month instantly places her among the most recognizable American celebrities  and makes her the third highest paid female athlete in any sport  based on commercial endorsement deals she has accepted   Yet  in her very first act as a professional golfer  Michelle donated  500 000 to the hurricane relief effort   And  she will continue to attend high school where she is an honors student       Korean Americans have indeed come a long way in their rich one hundred year history   In January 2003  Korean Americans all across the nation celebrated this centennial anniversary   Leading up to that significant milestone  the United States Senate unanimously adopted a resolution during the 107th Congress       To continue recognizing this history of Korean Americans  I believe it is appropriate to celebrate the 13th day of each January as    Korean American Day      The Allen Durbin resolution would encourage such a tradition       I ask my colleagues to support this resolution honoring the continuing contributions of Korean Americans to our great nation
