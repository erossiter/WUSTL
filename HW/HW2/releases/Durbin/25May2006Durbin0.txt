IMMIGRATION REFORM LEGISLATION APPROVED BY SENATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thursday  May 25  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      The United States Senate today approved a comprehensive immigration reform bill   The bill balances enforcement     stronger border security  tougher sanctions on employers who knowingly hire undocumented immigrants     with provisions allowing undocumented immigrants who work hard and play by the rules to earn their way to legal status  The Senate approved the legislation by a vote of 62 to 36       U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  said that while the bill was not perfect  it was a compromise worthy of support     If we want to address the problem of illegal immigration effectively  we must take a comprehensive approach  We must strengthen border security  improve enforcement of our immigration laws  and deal with the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants who are in the United States today   In the final analysis  this bill achieves these goals          Durbin was the author of several key provisions of the immigration bill including      an amendment eliminating legislative language that would have criminalized nurses  volunteers and people of faith who provide humanitarian assistance to undocumented immigrants   the DREAM Act  a narrowly tailored  bipartisan measure that would permit a select group of undocumented students to earn their way to citizenship if they came here as children   the addition of 2 000 Department of Labor investigators to ensure that companies obey the law on guest workers  and  a program to address the increasing migration of health workers from the poorest countries in the world  This    brain drain    is considered the single biggest obstacle to fighting HIV AIDS in Africa    Criminalization provisions   In recent months  churches  charities and community organizations in Illinois and across the country have expressed serious concern over language in immigration legislation being considered by the Senate that could criminalize their humanitarian assistance to immigrants in need       Durbin said that while the original bill included an exception for humanitarian assistance  the exception only protected individuals  not organizations  such as churches  hospitals  or schools   Furthermore  the exception only applied to aid provided in emergency situations and aid given without compensation          Charitable organizations should be able to provide humanitarian assistance to immigrants without fearing prosecution     said Durbin      A domestic violence shelter should not be forced to decide whether the government would regard a situation as    an emergency    before they protect a battered mother and her children   A non profit hospital should not be required to provide medical care without compensation in order to avoid criminal prosecution          DREAM Act   This legislation also includes the DREAM Act  a narrowly tailored  bipartisan measure that Durbin sponsored with Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Senator Dick Lugar  R IN    The DREAM Act would permit undocumented students to become permanent residents if they came here as children  are long term U S  residents  have good moral character  and attend college or enlist in the military for at least two years          Our immigration laws prevent thousands of young people from pursuing their dreams and fully contributing to our nation   s future   These young people have lived in this country for most of their lives   It is the only home they know   They are American in every sense except their technical legal status     said Durbin      They are honor roll students  star athletes  talented artists and valedictorians   These children are tomorrow   s doctors  nurses  teachers  policemen  firefighters  soldiers  and senators          Brain Drain   Under Durbin   s amendment  those applying for legal status to work as health professionals in America must answer whether they signed a bond or made a promise to work in their home country in exchange for educational support   If the answer is yes  they must fulfill that commitment before being allowed to work in the U S       Additionally  the amendment would allow legal permanent resident doctors and nurses to travel to developing countries to assist with health emergencies without jeopardizing their own immigration status in the U S          We must find a way to allow immigrants to make a difference in global health crises without sacrificing their own American dreams   America is a land of opportunity  it is also a land of compassion   Any comprehensive immigration reform must reflect both     Durbin said       Department of Labor Inspectors   At Durbin   s request  the comprehensive legislation included an additional 2 000 Department of Labor investigators to ensure that companies obey the law on guest workers       Durbin cautioned that the fight for comprehensive immigration reform was far from over          Today is a historic day in the United States Senate  but there is still one more bridge to cross in order to enact comprehensive immigration reform   We must reconcile this bill  which takes a comprehensive approach  with the enforcement only legislation passed by the Republican controlled House of Representatives   The President says he supports comprehensive reform   Now he must exercise his leadership to make it a reality
