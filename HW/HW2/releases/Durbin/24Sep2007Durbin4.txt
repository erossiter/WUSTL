September 24  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama today sent a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Jim Nicholson asking specific questions about the VAs response to a recent spike in deaths at the Marion  Illinois VA Medical Center and why a doctor who had been barred from practicing in another state continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until just last month  The Department of Veterans Affairs has suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center until an investigation into the deaths is completed  Additionally  four top hospital officials have been reassigned  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez was allowed to practice medicine at the medical center until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  The Illinois Senators noted that  The recent revelation that VAMC employed a surgeon who had been barred from practicing in another state casts doubt on the adequacy of the VAs system of credentialing and quality control  It also raises serious concerns about the response to the unusual spike in deaths at Marion earlier this yearWe want to know when the spike in deaths first came to your attention  when you first learned about reports of Dr  Veizaga Mendezs incompetence  what you did about it  and what additional protocols should have been in place to prevent unnecessary risk to the veterans whose care is entrusted to you  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Secretary Nicholson on September 17 asking for more information on the ongoing investigation into a spike in deaths at the Marion facility from October 2006 to March 2007  In the letter  Senators Durbin and Obama sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated  They noted  We know you agree that we should avoid further complicating this situation by creating additional stress or delays for our veterans in need of surgery     Text of the letter appears below    September 24  2007 The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Nicholson  We are writing a second letter to you because we have been made aware of additional circumstances at the Marion  IL  Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC   It is extremely distressing to learn that Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez has been practicing medicine at this facility in light of documentation of numerous cases of malpractice on his part in Massachusetts  The recent revelation that VAMC employed a surgeon who had been barred from practicing in another state casts doubt on the adequacy of the VAs system of credentialing and quality control  It also raises serious concerns about the response to the unusual spike in deaths at Marion earlier this year  Given that Dr  Veizaga Mendez continued to practice at Marion until August 2007  it would appear that the VAs investigative response to this situation was neither quick nor decisive  We want to know when the spike in deaths first came to your attention  when you first learned about reports of Dr  Veizaga Mendezs incompetence  what you did about it  and what additional protocols should have been in place to prevent unnecessary risk to the veterans whose care is entrusted to you  Additionally  we would appreciate a response to the following questions by October 5  2007  1  Did Dr  Veizaga Mendez treat any patients who have died at the facility  If so  how many and what was his role in each case   2  How long has Dr  Veizaga Mendez been employed at the Marion VAMC  Please describe in detail the background check that the VA performed before hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez  including whether the National Practitioner Data Bank was queried    3  Was the VA aware that the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation was investigating whether to suspend or revoke his Illinois license  If so  when did you become aware of that fact and what action did you take   4  In general  what kind of background checks are performed by the VA before hiring medical staff who will be providing direct care to our veterans   5  What interim and long term steps is the VA taking to improve its system in order to ensure these problems do not arise in any other VA medical facilities   6  What plans are underway within the VA to discuss these tragedies with the affected families and provide compensation  We look forward to your prompt response  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator Barack Obama  United States Senator Cc  Dr  Michael Kussman   Dr  Gerald Cross
