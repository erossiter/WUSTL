Golden Triangle Award on Behalf of Illinois Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tuesday  September 18  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   who serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  today received the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers Union  NFU  for his attention to issues affecting rural Illinois  The award was presented at a meeting held today in Durbins U S  Capitol office with the Illinois Farmers Union  At todays meeting  the Illinois lawmaker discussed bipartisan legislation that will assist rural Illinois  including a new stronger revenue based safety net for Illinois farmers  the Energy Bill and legislation that would increase access to broadband in rural areas  I am honored to receive this award and will continue to work with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help our nations farmers  said Durbin  The Golden Triangle Award is based on the National Farmers Union symbola triangle with legislation and cooperation forming the sides and education the base  The Golden Triangle Award is awarded annually and was first established in 1988  Senator Durbin was also a recipient of the Golden Triangle Award last year  In todays meeting  Durbin discussed the 2007 Farm Bill which will likely contain a number of provisions important to Illinois farmers including improving protections for farmers in the event of natural disasters such as droughts and flooding  modifying the current commodity support programs  maintaining nutrition programs like Food Stamps and increasing federal support for innovative renewable energy projects  The House recently passed its version of the 2007 Farm Bill and the Senate Agriculture Committee may mark up legislation in the next few weeks  On July 25  2007  Senators Durbin and Sherrod Brown  D OH  introduced legislation to provide a better safety net for farmers by replacing current price support programs with a comprehensive revenue protection program  The Durbin Brown bill provides a better safety net for farmers by replacing price support programs with a comprehensive two tier revenue protection program  Under the bill  farmers rely on private revenue insurance at the individual level  while the government handles widespread losses at the state level where the private insurance market is ineffective  The intent of this new farm bill is the same as it was in 1933   to ensure that farmers can survive a bad year  said Durbin  Unfortunately  much has changed in the past 70 years and we havent revised our strategy  The current program wastes taxpayer dollars  doesnt enhance farmer profitability and makes commodity programs hard to defend  If market price isnt the only factor that affects what a farmer makes  it shouldnt be the only factor on which we base commodity calculations  This bill recalculates the way we allocate funding to correct program inefficiencies and target farmers in need  At the meeting  Durbin also noted that broadband is critical to community and economic development  as it encourages investment  creates jobs  improves productivity  fosters innovation  and increases consumer benefits in every corner of our nation  On April 24  2007  Durbin introduced the Connected Nation Act of 2007 to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas  The legislation  included in the Broadband Data Improvement Act and passed by the Senate Commerce Committee  would create a matching grant program to be administered through the Department of Commerce to assist statewide or regional public private partnerships increase broadband access  map resources and build demand  Broadband is an essential component of our lives  at work and at home  It has become an essential service like water  gas and electricity  Our homes and businesses need affordable access to high speed internet connections  in the same way our homes and businesses need traditional utility services  said Durbin  Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality  When I travel in downstate Illinois  people tell me that they cannot wait to have broadband service  but that there is no service available to them right now  My bill will change that
