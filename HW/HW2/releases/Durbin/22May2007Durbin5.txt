     Durbin Asks All Legislative Branch Agencies To  Conduct Energy Audit  Lead By Example

Legislative Branch Agencies To  Conduct Energy Audit  Lead By Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Tuesday  May 22  2007         United States Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent letters today asking eight major agencies of the legislative branch to voluntarily conduct energy audits to help Congress assess the environmental impact of their energy use and propose improvements to the current system  The letters sent today are the first meaningful step toward reducing the carbon emissions of the legislative branch  It also is an opportunity for the Congress to lead by example  by taking concrete steps to reduce its greenhouse emissions  Carbon emissions and greenhouse gases are major contributors to global warming       The letters follow a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  released at Durbin s request last month  which determined that the legislative branch was responsible for 316 000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions  That amount is equal to the emissions of over 57 000 cars  The report also noted that based on trends from fiscal years 1998 through 2001  legislative branch emissions are expected to grow by about 4   annually         What I ve asked the legislative branch to do today is take a responsible look at the way we consume energy   said Durbin   These audits will allow us to fully grasp our carbon footprint and give us the information necessary to reduce our impact  This is a meaningful step forward  I m asking Congress to lead by example by making small changes in the way we consume that will have long term payoffs for us all        The GAO reports that the largest single source of carbon emissions comes from electricity consumption  namely from the use of electricity created from the burning of fossil fuels by an outside provider  This alone accounts for over 60 percent of the carbon output of legislative branch operations   The remaining carbon output comes from natural gas  chilled water purchases  business travel in government owned and government leased vehicles and the Capitol Power Plant       As a member of the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch  Durbin has consistently promoted energy efficiency within the Capitol complex  Durbin s own office was one of the first in the Senate to join a pilot program  through the Architect of the Capitol   AOC   to reduce his office s energy consumption    The AOC has already started the process to  update his office  by installing modernized  energy efficient lighting which  when combined with occupancy sensors will result in a decrease in the electricity used by his office         The report also suggests some ways to reduce energy consumption  Agencies could purchase energy efficient appliances  increase the use of renewable sources of energy  and acquire fuel efficient vehicles and vehicles that run on renewable fuels        Durbin sent letters to the following agencies  The Architect of the Capitol  Government Accountability Office  Government Printing Office  Library of Congress  Congressional Budge Office  The US Botanic Garden  Senate Sergeant at Arms and the House Chief Administrative Officer  The text of Senator Durbin s letter to the Architect of the Capitol is attached         May 22  2007   Mr  Stephen T  Ayers  AIA  Acting Architect of the Capitol  Architect of the Capitol  SB 15  The Capitol  Washington  D C   20515   Dear Mr  Ayers    I have been privileged to serve as a member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee for several years   During this time  I have worked to reduce the negative environmental impact of the Capitol complex       In 2006  as ranking member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee  I included language in the Senate Legislative Branch appropriations bill directing the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the legislative branch and to identify a strategy for reducing these emissions       Four weeks ago  GAO released their report  entitled  Energy Audits Are Key to Strategy for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions    The Agency determined that legislative branch operations were accountable for roughly 316 000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions  an amount equal to the emissions produced by more than 57 000 cars in 2006   In addition  they estimated that the emissions have been increasing by 4  annually  based on trends from fiscal years 1998 through 2001   The majority of emissions stem from electricity consumption  which accounts for over 60  of the total legislative branch emissions       Global climate change is a real and growing concern   In the legislative branch  we have the opportunity to lead by example by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions   I urge you to carefully consider the GAO s recommendations to schedule and conduct regular energy audits and implement identified energy efficiency programs to reduce the carbon footprint of your agency       I look forward to receiving information from your agency regarding steps you will take to schedule and conduct regular energy audits   This information should include an estimate of the costs associated with such audits       As a principal strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  GAO recommends that each legislative branch agency conduct regular comprehensive energy audits   The first audit would allow each agency to establish an emissions baseline against which the efficacy of future energy conservation activities can be measured   In addition  a comprehensive energy audit would identify the most promising efficiency projects that each agency could then implement   Conducting regular comprehensive energy audits will allow each agency to determine the reduction in emissions due to implemented programs  realize the financial benefits of increased efficiency and identify additional projects to further increase energy efficiency or reliance on renewable sources of energy       In addition to conducting comprehensive energy audits  GAO also recommends that each agency implement programs that change purchasing decisions and behavioral practices that will result in immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions   Agencies could purchase only Energy Star appliances  procure flex fuel or hybrid vehicles when possible and increase the amount of renewable electricity they purchase   In addition  increasing usage of compact fluorescent light bulbs and turning off lights and computers overnight can result in large electricity savings       Many of the energy efficiency projects will be cost effective due to their reduction in electricity demand   The Architect of the Capitol  AOC  is beginning a pilot program in the Senate  in which my office is participating  to reduce energy consumption by installing more energy efficient lighting   The fluorescent lights are equipped with dimmable ballasts and light sensors so they can change intensity depending on the amount of natural light that is entering the office   It is estimated that the amount of energy required to light the office will decrease by 50  with these adjustments  which will save the Senate and the taxpayers money       I anticipate working with you in the future as we work toward a comprehensive plan to reduce energy use by the legislative branch   It is important that we lead by example and demonstrate to the American public the benefits both financial and environmental of reducing one s energy consumption       Thank you for your consideration and your efforts on behalf of the United States Congress        Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
