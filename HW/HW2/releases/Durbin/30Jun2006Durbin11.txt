     DURBIN   OBAMA   ILLINOIS MUST NOT BECOME A REGIONAL DUMPING GROUND FOR NUCLEAR WASTE

 ILLINOIS MUST NOT BECOME A REGIONAL DUMPING GROUND FOR NUCLEAR WASTE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Friday  June 30  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee  Pete Domenici  R NM  urging him to clarify that legislative language added to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill would not adversely affect states like Illinois          Senator Obama and I wanted to make it clear to the chairman that any plan to create regional nuclear waste sites without any local veto power is unacceptable   Illinois must not become a dumping ground      even a temporary one     for nuclear waste brought in from other states     said Durbin       Statutory language  which was added to the bill earlier this week  allows the Secretary of Energy to create a regional nuclear waste storage site in any state with a commercial nuclear reactor     even if that state does not want to host a regional site  Such sites would be    temporary    repositories for spent nuclear materials until a permanent national nuclear waste repository is completed       Durbin and Obama successfully added a provision to the report accompanying the appropriations bill which exempts states like Illinois who already have designated storage sites for nuclear waste generated within their own borders  But both senators say more changes are needed          Report language is used to guide the actions of the Administration  so the changes made at our request will stop Illinois from being designated a regional waste storage site in the short term  but we feel a more permanent statutory solution is called for     said Durbin       In the letter the two senators wrote     We would sincerely appreciate your personal commitment to work with us prior to consideration of this bill on the Senate floor to amend the statutory language to reflect the changes made to the report language   We strongly believe that states should not be unfairly burdened with decisions made at the federal administrative level         e very state should be afforded the opportunity to participate in this process in a means that benefits that state               The Honorable Pete V  Domenici  United States Senate  Washington  DC   Dear Mr  Chairman    We would like to address a concern we have with language included in the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Committee bill that creates a program for the    Consolidation of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel          We appreciate the inclusion of report language in the Manager   s Amendment that exempts those states that designate a state specific site from the Secretary of Energy   s ability to designate that state as host of a regional interim storage site unless the state specifically chooses to coordinate with surrounding states   However  we remain concerned that those changes are not currently reflected in the statutory language of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill   We would appreciate your personal commitment to work with us prior to consideration of this bill on the Senate floor to amend the statutory language to reflect the changes made to the report language       We strongly believe that states should not be unfairly burdened with waste from other states by decisions made at the federal administrative level when those states voluntarily designate an interim storage site to handle waste generated in that state   Currently the statutory language allows for the creation of a regional site within any state with a commercial nuclear reactor regardless of the willingness of that state to host a regional site or to designate its own site   Every state should be afforded the opportunity to chart a course that addresses its own interim waste storage in a manner that makes sense for that state       We look forward to working with you and believe that changes to the statutory language of the bill can be made that will address these initial concerns    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States
