September 19  2007        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to Senator Daniel Inouye  D HI   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense asking for a hearing on private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  specifically Blackwater Security  In todays letter  Durbin noted  Companies such as Blackwater have enjoyed enormous government contracts  Their ties to the Administration have allowed them to grow significantly and reap large wartime profits  Yet their accountability has been limited  Text of the letter appears below    September 19  2007   Dear Senator Inouye  The recent incident in Iraq involving Blackwater Security and the Iraqi governments decision to ban the company from operating in that country shines a light on yet another critical issue in Iraq  the use of private security forces  There are approximately 20 000 30 000 private security contractors in Iraq  the exact number is unknown  I have serious concerns about the inadequate regulation and oversight of these companies  Companies such as Blackwater have enjoyed enormous government contracts  Their ties to the Administration have allowed them to grow significantly and reap large wartime profits  Yet their accountability has been limited  Stories abound of contract employees placed in war zones without the proper personal protection or equipment and of units being undermanned  If these companies are unnecessarily risking American lives while their profits increase  they should be held accountable just as a military commander would be held accountable under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice for a failure to protect the troops  The connections Blackwater has established with the Administration and that fact that its work is done in Iraq should not prevent it from being held legally accountable for its actions  Many of the men and women working for Blackwater in Iraq and Afghanistan are honorable  professional and patriotic  But any organization with as wide a footprint as Blackwater is likely to have some exceptions in its midst  While in theory security contractors are bound by the same Rules of Engagement as our soldiers are  the limited oversight of their work by the Administration has made it exceedingly difficult to hold them accountable for their actions  In practice there has been little or no accountability exercised  Finally  the Administrations haphazard planning for this war has fostered an over reliance on private security forces to fill gaps that should have been anticipated  When the Administration has needed more security than our over stretched armed forces can provide  it has turned to private security contractors paid by American tax dollars  Those contractors are seen abroad as representing the United States  even though U S  oversight has been limited  These issues need greater attention  Accordingly  I request that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee conduct a hearing to investigate  among other things  the following issues   How many private security contractors currently work in Iraq and Afghanistan  Under what rules do they operate  What are their specific rules of engagement  Under what legal authority are they held accountable  How many lethal and non lethal incidents have they been involved in since the beginning of the war  Who investigates these incidents and ensures that they are held accountable for any lapses or illegal acts  What no bid contracts has Blackwater received from the Administration  Are there ties between Blackwater and the Administration that raise concerns about any of these no bid contracts  What are Blackwater and other companies doing to ensure the maximum protection of their employees on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan  Who  if anyone  monitors whether the companies are placing profit ahead of the protection of their employees  What U S  laws  if any  are groups like Blackwater required to obey in their operations abroad  What Iraqi or Afghan laws are they subject to when they work in Iraq and Afghanistan  Are there any restrictions that prevent such groups from being hired by foreign governments or entities as private mercenaries   Thank you for your cooperation in this matter  Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
