Announces Intent To Introduce Legislation To Address Weaknesses In VA Hiring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tuesday  November 6  2007     Washington  DC   At a congressional oversight hearing today  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  announced that he intends to introduce legislation to address weaknesses in the hiring practices and quality control at VA Medical facilities across the country  The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing included testimony from the Principal Deputy Undersecretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs  Dr  Gerald Cross  Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs  Tammy Duckworth  and former patient at the Marion VA Medical Center and Iraq veteran  Steven McCarty  The problems at Marion are very troubling and todays hearing shed light on similar issues throughout the system  The more I learn about circumstances at the Marion VA hospital  the more questions I have about how the Veterans Affairs Department manages staffing and quality control at its hospitals across the country  said Durbin  We need to make sure that these problems are not occurring elsewhere in other VA medical centers across the country  Our veterans have risked their all for this nation  we owe them the highest quality medical care  Durbin called for a hearing after working closely with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  for nearly two months on the ongoing investigations regarding the spike in deaths and the hiring of Dr  Veizaga Mendez  On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the Marion VA Medical Center due to an unusual increase in the mortality rate at the hospital  The VA Inspector General initiated an investigation after the increased mortality was discover and as questions arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after cases of malpractice and disciplinary action  Four top hospital officials at Marion have also been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  Durbin noted that the circumstances at the Marion VA Medical Center may point to greater problems within the VA medical system  Todays hearing focused on issues with hiring and retaining the best doctors in rural hospitals  consistency in the application of standards and credentialing and the detection of problems through a system of external review  It is no secret that the salaries at the VA are not competitive with private hospitals or private practice  And the reality is thats not likely to change  said Durbin  So we need to creatively look for other answers  We need to work with medical schools and teaching hospitals to tap into the talent of their professors and researchers  We need to look for avenues that would entice young doctors by helping to relieve their crushing medical school costs  And we need to find the factors that would encourage older and more experienced doctors to come and serve our veterans  I intend to introduce legislation that addresses the problem of attracting good doctors and will assure a level of scrutiny  accountability  and review throughout the VA medical system  Last week  in response to concerns from current and former employees of the Marion VA Medical Center  Senator Durbin called on Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to inform all employees of their rights under the Whistleblower Protection Act  On Saturday  Durbin requested that the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Illinois investigate allegations included in a letter he received from several current and former employees at the Marion VA  The letter  contained allegations of serious misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing
