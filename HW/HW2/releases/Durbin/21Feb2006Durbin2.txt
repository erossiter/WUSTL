February 21  2006           Building on earlier efforts to help protect Illinois seniors from identity theft  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation last week requiring the federal government to replace Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and documents with new patient identifiers          Identify theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in Illinois and the rest of the country   More than 11 000 people reported identity theft to the Illinois Attorney General   s office in 2005   The Senate   s overwhelming bipartisan support for this concept has made it clear that protecting our seniors needs to be a top priority for this Congress     Durbin said       Last October  Durbin proposed an amendment to the Labor  HHS  Education Appropriations bill requiring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  to report to Congress on how they intend to replace Social Security numbers with new patient identifiers   The amendment received unanimous support  passing the Senate in a 98 0 vote   While the amendment was changed slightly in the final version of the bill  the final conference report noted the proposal as a priority          A Social Security number is a key for an identity thief  who can use it to open a new bank account or get a new credit card   But the federal government continues to print Social Security numbers on Medicare cards  leaving 40 million seniors with their Social Security numbers in plain sight   It is time for the federal government to step up in the fight against identity theft     Durbin added       Durbin also sent a letter last week to Dr  Mark McClellan  Administrator of CMS  asking that he address the issue immediately  In the letter  Durbin noted a recent Government Accountability Office  GAO  report showed that    there are significant gaps in federal law and agency oversight with regard to the sharing of Social Security numbers      The Senator asked that CMS submit a report to the Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee by July 31  2006 outlining how the agency will change the system and how much it will cost       Many states and local governments have taken steps to protect their state residents   Twelve states have passed laws restricting the use of Social Security numbers  including Illinois  where private insurers are prohibited from using Social Security numbers as patient identifiers   Durbin   s bill would provide those covered by Medicare the same kind of identity theft protection that patients with private insurance have in Illinois       Text of letter below         February 16  2006   Dr  Mark McClellan  Administrator  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Ave   SW Room 341 H  Washington  DC 20201   Dear Dr  McClellan    As you know  I am very concerned about the use of Social Security numbers as patient identifiers for Medicare beneficiaries   According to the Federal Trade Commission  seniors are more vulnerable to fraud  including identity theft  than any other group   In 2004  consumers age 50 and over reported  152 million in fraud losses to the agency  which is likely only a small fraction of the fraud that actually took place       One of the main actions federal  state and local governments instruct consumers to take in protecting themselves from identity theft is guarding their Social Security number   In fact  12 states have passed laws restricting the use of Social Security numbers in order to protect their citizens   Meanwhile  the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services continues to print Social Security numbers on Medicare cards and benefit statements  leaving 40 million seniors with their Social Security numbers in plain sight       The Government Accountability Office published a report last month showing there are significant gaps in federal law and agency oversight with regard to the sharing of Social Security numbers   The federal government should be leading by example in protecting Americans from identity thieves   Taking Social Security numbers off Medicare cards and benefit statements is a good first step       As the Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee made clear in the report accompanying the FY06 bill funding your agency  the Committee considers this issue to be of utmost urgency and expects the Secretary to accelerate ongoing plans to convert beneficiary identifiers to a number not associated with Social Security       I request that you please submit to the Committee by July 31  2006  a report outlining how your agency will expeditiously go about changing the system of patient identifiers and how much it will cost       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
