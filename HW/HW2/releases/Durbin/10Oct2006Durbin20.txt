                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tuesday  October 10  2006   WASHINGTON  DC   Returning from an official visit to Iraq and Afghanistan  Sen  Dick Durbin called the situation in Iraq grim evidence of a poorly planned strategy   America has the best military in the world and the brave soldiers that I met over the last week are a source of pride for all of us  But our military and the billions of dollars we continue to spend are no match for a devastating civil war and an Iraqi government bitterly divided by age old hatreds   Our troops have done a tremendous job securing government centers and travel routes within the Green Zone  Insurgent attacks against our troops within the Green Zone have decreased since I visited last year  but the civil war outside those fortified enclaves threatens to wipe away much of the progress we have made   The danger to our troops grows by the day  I am still haunted by the knowledge that while I was meeting with our commanding generals two of our soldiers lost their lives to a roadside bomb just blocks away  During the week that I traveled to Iraq 27 American soldiers died   Four years into this war there are few pockets of safety in a country where every road  every street corner and every market in Baghdad is a lethal target  Over the weekend that I was in Baghdad the bodies of sixty victims of sectarian gangland slayings were recovered   The Bush Administration went into this war without a plan and now stubbornly clings to a political slogan to define its strategy   I will not forget the soldier who pulled me aside and told me Senator  staying the course will not win this war   Even the most determined General told us we have six months to determine whether our efforts will be successful   It is time for us to serve notice on the Iraqi government that unless they meet clearly defined goals in a timely fashion we will begin the redeployment of our troops  Those goals include an Iraqi military and police force prepared to stand and defend its own country  improvement in the basics of life like electricity and safe drinking water  reconstruction of oil and gas facilities  providing basic government services based on need rather than political or religious favoritism and an end to the militias   We owe it to our soldiers and the people of this country to reject political slogans and accept the reality of the grim situation we face  America has deposed a dictator  liberated a nation and given the Iraqis their first free elections  Now it is up to the Iraqi people and their elected government to take the lead and allow our troops to come home  If the Iraqis do not have the political will to create and defend their own nation  we cannot do it for them   In stark contrast Afghanistan has the potential to become a stable and secure nation  Meeting with President Karzai  NATO commanders and American military and civil leaders  I left with a belief that we can prove in Afghanistan that the forces of terror can be conquered   At the core of my hope is a country which has a fierce pride and a strong national identity which has endured for centuries  They have driven the British and the Soviets from their soil and take pride in calling themselves Afghans  They have a strong leader in President Karzai and have forced the Al Quaida and Taliban forces into a desperate position   There are three imperatives for success in Afghanistan  We must continue to support the international effort headed by NATO  We must make reconstruction and the eradication of the poppy cultivation high priorities  And we must create stronger border protection between Pakistan and Afghanistan   Pakistan has been a key ally in our effort but their recent decision to declare Wazuristan as an off limits province is creating a safe haven for Taliban terrorists and illicit border crossings  The planned summit of Afghan and Pakistani civil and religious leaders is an opportunity for new dialogue and a more effective effort to contain the terrorists   America would have been wiser to focus on Afghanistan and our original goal of defeating the perpetrators of 9 11  but it is not too late to recalibrate and finish the job
