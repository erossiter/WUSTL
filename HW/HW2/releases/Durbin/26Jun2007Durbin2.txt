     Grassley  Durbin Release New Information on L Visas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              6 26 2007                                                                                                                                                                            Grassley  Durbin Release New Information on L Visas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tuesday  June 26  2007      The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services responded to Senators Grassley and Durbin today and provided information that shows many foreign outsourcing firms that send American jobs overseas are using L visas in large numbers   The information provided today showed that many of the same companies identified as using the most H 1B visas were the same companies that used the most L visas  Under current law  employers can use the L visa program to evade restrictions on the H 1B program because it does not include protections for American workers  This demonstrates the need for additional checks on the L visa program   This information certainly makes one wonder if companies are using the L visa to circumvent the worker protections required under the H 1B program  Id like to know how many American workers these companies hire compared to the number of foreign workers they bring in  Grassley said  American workers deserve the best chance at jobs in this country  and this data makes one question if they are too often overlooked   The L visa is designed to give multinational companies the freedom to transfer managers and specialists within the company to their U S  offices  said Durbin  But some of these companies have hundreds  and in some cases thousands of L visa workers  I find it hard to believe that any one company has that many individuals that are legitimately being transferred within a single year  I find it even harder to believe that these L visas are being used appropriately when many of the same companies are some of the largest employers of H1 B workers  It s clear that foreign outsourcing firms are abusing the system and we can t let that continue   Grassley and Durbin said they would continue to investigate the blanket L petition that allows companies to bring in a limitless amount of workers  The Senators expressed concern in their original letter to the Director of Citizenship and Immigration Service about the screening of individuals through this process   Attached is a list of the top 20 companies using the L visa and a comparison of those to the top 20 users of H1 B visas   A copy of the news release and letter Grassley and Durbin sent to Citizenship and Immigration Services earlier this month is below   Thursday  June 14  2007  Grassley  Durbin Continue Work to Close H 1B and L Visa Loopholes  WASHINGTON    Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin today continued their quest to ensure that American workers are protected  and that companies who bring in foreign workers are complying with the law   The Senators today sent a letter to Emilio Gonzalez  the director of the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  asking more questions about how the agency is addressing fraud and abuse in the H 1B visa program   Earlier this month  the Senators sent letters to the top 9 foreign owned companies to determine the companies  usage of H 1B visas  Today s letter comes on the heels of responses received from several of the foreign companies   From the responses we ve received thus far  its evident that American workers are in the minority at these companies  I expect Citizenship and Immigration Services to take a hard look at their recruiting methods to make sure they are complying with the law  Grassley said  We cannot just increase the annual allocation of visas without understanding how companies are using them   We ve begun to question how many companies are complying with H 1B visa requirements  Durbin said  I look forward to hearing back from Director Gonzalez on what the government is doing to enforce the law   At this time  Grassley and Durbin will not be releasing the information received from the companies    June 13  2007  The Honorable Emilio T  Gonzalez Director U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services 20 Massachusetts Avenue  NW Washington  DC 20529  Dear Director Gonzalez   Recently  we asked the foreign based companies who obtain the most H 1B visas to answer questions regarding their workforce  wages  recruitment efforts  and usage of H 1B visas in the United States  Our letters were intended to learn more about how some companies are using the H 1B visa program  We remain concerned that the H 1B and L visa programs are facilitating the displacement of Americans by cheaper foreign workers  We continue our effort to understand how the H 1B and L visa programs are being used by U S  and foreign based companies  and therefore request that you provide details related to these programs   Under current law  H 1B dependent employers are required to attest that they have not displaced comparable workers in the United States before hiring a foreign worker  They must also make a good faith effort to recruit Americans first   The responses to our letters to foreign based H 1B users have led us to question how many companies are currently defined as H 1B dependent  and if these employers who depend on H 1B visa holders are being adequately monitored for compliance with H 1B program requirements  While we understand that the Department of Labor has primary jurisdiction over H 1B dependent employers  we would like to understand your agencys role in ensuring compliance with laws regarding displacement and recruitment   We have also become concerned about the use of L visas by companies who also use large numbers of H 1B visas  Many companies are allowed to bring in L visa workers through a blanket petition  which is approved by USCIS  While the blanket petition is meant to simplify the process  we fear that some foreign workers may be approved for visas by the Department of State without proper oversight by USCIS  which has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with L visa program requirements   In order to better understand the nature of the L visa program  we need to have access to better statistics  We would like to know how many L visas are approved each year  and what companies use the program  We would also like to know more about the use of the blanket petition for L visa holders  and USCIS s ability to monitor individual visa holders who are allowed entry into the United States on a blanket petition   Finally  we are concerned about the level of fraud monitoring of the H 1B and L visa programs  While we understand that the Fraud Detection and National Security unit is analyzing and writing an assessment of the H 1B program  we are concerned that abuse of both programs is not being addressed adequately  Given that the immigration bill before the Senate includes a provision to allow USCIS to divert special funds to other operations  we would like to know how many dollars have been used specifically for H 1B and L fraud efforts  We also seek more details about how these investigations are being handled within the Department   Given these concerns  we respectfully ask that the following answers be provided to us by Wednesday  June 20  2007   H 1B Dependent Employers  Please explain the process of identifying employers as H 1B dependent employers pursuant to INA Section 212 n  3    How many companies are defined by USCIS to be AH 1B dependent  employers   How are these H 1B dependent employers being monitored  if at all  by USCIS   Blanket L Visa Petitions  How many L visas have been approved each year since 2000   Please provide lists of companies that have used the L visa program for each of the two most recently available years  and how many visas each company has obtained in each year   Since USCIS has primary jurisdiction over blanket petitions and visa policies  what role has been delegated to the Department of State and how is your agency ensuring that aliens under the blanket petition are being properly screened before entering the U S    What role  if any  does USCIS play in monitoring the approval of L visas covered by blanket petitions   Please provide an explanation of USCIS s ability to track individual L visa holders who are allowed entry into the United States on visas covered by a blanket petition   Investigations of Fraud and Abuse  Annually  what has been the total amount of funds deposited into the Fraud Prevention and Detection Account under INA Section 286 v  since it was established  Of this amount  what amount has been provided to the Department of Homeland Security under 286 v  2  B    How have the funds provided pursuant to 286 v  2  B  been used in FY2005  FY2006  and thus far in FY2007  How many funds have not been expended in a given year   How does USCIS plan to spend the remaining funds left in FY2007   How many total fraud and abuse referrals have been sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  in the last two years  How many of these referrals  to your knowledge  have been pursued  How many referrals  to your knowledge  are pending  Please provide any further details about specific cases or referrals to ICE that may be helpful to understanding the process within the Department   Please provide examples of recent investigative referrals to ICE dealing with H 1B or L visas  Please explain any referrals in the last two years that have not been pursued or that have been closed  and provide information on how many are currently pending   While we anticipate your concerns about providing such information to us by Wednesday  June 20th  we must stress the fact that the U S  Senate is considering comprehensive legislation that would change immigration policies for years to come  The H 1B and L visa programs must be better understood before further action is taken on this bill  We appreciate your cooperation in providing us with input in the next week   Please contact my staff if you have any questions regarding this matter  Thank you in advance for your cooperation   Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin United States Senator  Charles E  Grassley United States Senator
