January 12  2006           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today said that recent reports about    mortality studies of Marines in Iraq and the vulnerabilities of their body armor are deeply disturbing          In a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  Durbin stressed that the Pentagon must respond quickly to meet the needs of troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan      As injuries and deaths mounted in the field  why was a move not made earlier to provide additional plating and enhanced coverage to soldiers and marines in the field   Clearly  concerns about weight and

 One media report quotes military medical examiner Dr  Craig Mallak as telling a medical panel in 2003 that the information    screams to be published        Durbin wrote       Durbin noted that following the disclosure last week of an August 2005 Department of Defense report entitled    Marine Lethal Torso Injuries     the Army announced that it will begin ordering new equipment   Durbin said that    this seems tragically late    and the slow reaction by the Pentagon    raises questions about the thoroughness of wound analysis that is taking place and about the Department of Defense   s responsiveness to findings from the field        The report  which was classified as official use only  found that the cause of death for 93 of the 401 Marines who died from combat injuries was a lethal injury to the torso  39 of these injuries occurred outside of the area covered by armor plating       Taking a broader view of the situation  Durbin also raised questions about whether other preventable and deadly injuries might be going undetected   In his letter to Rumsfeld  Durbin asked     Are there additional patterns of injury that need addressing   How is the Department of Defense collecting  examining  and responding to patterns in injuries incurred by our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan     Durbin asked       Below is the full text of the letter to Secretary Rumsfeld           January 12  2006   The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 4000   Dear Mr  Secretary    Recent revelations from defense watchdog groups and the media about mortality studies of Marines in Iraq and the vulnerabilities of their body armor are deeply disturbing   The safety of our troops is of utmost importance to all of us  they deserve every available protection that equipment and training can provide       The Department of Defense report entitled    Marine Lethal Torso Injuries     completed in August 2005  raises a number of troubling questions   As injuries and deaths mounted in the field  why was a move not made earlier to provide additional plating and enhanced coverage to soldiers and marines in the field    Clearly  concerns about weight and heat dissipation were part of the equation  but as injuries increased  particularly injuries occurring while riding in vehicles  the need for greater protection must have become increasingly apparent   One media report quotes military medical examiner Dr  Craig Mallak as telling a medical panel in 2003 that the information    screams to be published          The Marines began ordering additional plating several months ago and yesterday   s press conference and today   s news accounts indicate that the Army will now do so   This seems tragically late   It also raises questions about the thoroughness of wound analysis that is taking place and about the Department of Defense   s responsiveness to findings from the field       Sadly  there is an abundance of data to examine  more than 2200 U S  service men and women have been killed in Iraq and thousands of others have been seriously wounded  meaning there are thousands of autopsy reports and documents prepared by field medics to examine    Are there additional patterns of injury that need addressing   For example  turret gunners in HMMWVs  according to anecdotal evidence  are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic injuries from vehicle rollover   Do these injury rates demand either structural changes in the vehicles  remote firing devices  or additional protective equipment       How is the Department of Defense collecting  examining  and responding to patterns in injuries incurred by our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan       Thank you for your prompt attention to this very important issue       Sincerely   Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
