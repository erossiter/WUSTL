is Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  which drafted the  44 2 billion spending bill  This is a very transparent appropriations bill  shining a light on requests from Senators and the Bush Administration  That is the way it should be  said Durbin  We ve made tough decisions  with tight funds  in the face of many worthy demands and crafted a fiscally responsible and honest bill  We re forcing members to stand by the projects they request  funding important programs from court security to consumer safety and I ve proud of the bill we ve come up with  As Chairman of the Subcommittee  Durbin has budgetary oversight authority over a range of agencies in the Executive Branch  including the Offices of the President and Vice
