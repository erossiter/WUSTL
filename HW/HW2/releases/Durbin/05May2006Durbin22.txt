     DURBIN CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF HIS CAFE BILL

IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF HIS CAFE BILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Friday  May 5  2006    CHICAGO  IL      With gas prices soaring  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said Congress must take immediate action to help end our dependence on foreign oil and called for the passage of his bill on fuel economy standards       At a time when oil companies are raking in record profits  Chicago consumers are paying  on average   2 98 per gallon  68 cents a gallon more than they were a year ago today   Last year  the top five oil companies reported net profits of over  110 billion    which is equivalent to  1 000 for every household in America  These companies also just announced first quarter profits    up 50 percent from 2004          When ExxonMobil and other oil giants reap billions of dollars of profits at the expense of American families  small businesses and farmers  it s time for Congress to step up     Durbin said          Continued reliance on foreign sources of oil  in a world with increasing competition for those limited resources  is a dangerous future for America   We need to reduce our dependence  first by increasing the fuel economy of our cars   It   s a solution I   ve been advocating for years     said Durbin       Last year  for the third time in a matter of four years  Durbin proposed setting a new ambitious and attainable fuel efficiency standard of 40 miles per gallon by 2015 for cars and certain light trucks  including sport utility vehicles  SUV s    The bill  often referred to as CAFE  Corporate Average Fuel Economy   is designed to get the United States back on track toward a cleaner  more efficient and less oil dependent energy future          In the long term  we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil   Consumers need to demand more and better fuel efficient vehicles   The fight for CAFE standards legislation has spanned more than a decade   It   s the right thing to do and the momentum for real reform is building   I   m going to keep working for improved fuel economy standards as an essential component of an energy independence plan   Durbin said          If the U S  had increased the fuel economy of all cars sold in America ten years ago by only five miles per gallon  today we would be using more than 1 million fewer barrels of oil per day    saving  33 billion annually in the U S  economy and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming     Durbin said       Increasing fuel economy will save money    and this money will translate into new jobs and economic growth in other sectors of the economy   A study by the Environmental Law and Policy Center concluded that at  3 per gallon  cars and trucks that average 30  better MPG would save Illinoisans  3 6 billion on gasoline costs annually       Durbin said that the average fuel economy of our nation s cars and trucks has steadily declined since 1985 when the last fuel efficiency requirements ended   In 1975  when American cars were averaging 14 miles a gallon  Congress passed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  law  which required manufacturers to double the fuel economy of their vehicles to nearly 28 miles a gallon in 10 years       Durbin noted that many of the same arguments against new fuel efficiency standards     more expensive cars  impossible technical hurdles  loss of car making jobs     were raised back in 1975   I believe the auto industry and its engineers can meet this challenge  We made great strides toward energy efficiency more than 25 years ago when the first fuel efficiency standards became law  Detroit made safer cars with better technology  I believe they can do it again now   said Durbin       Durbin also supports a series of other short and long term measures to help consumer cope with rising gas prices       He has called for Congressional action on his legislation to help channel record oil company profits back to American families   Durbin   s Windfall Profits Reinvestment bill would take 50 percent of the integrated oil and gas companies windfall profits  those over a baseline price of  40 per barrel of oil  and use the revenue to fund a consumer rebate  provide additional resources to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  provide for a manufacturers incentive to improve the fuel economy of automobiles and provide additional revenue to the Highway Trust Fund to improve roadways and mass transit       The Senator supports Congressional efforts to determine whether the practices  including the consolidation through mergers and acquisitions  within the oil and gas industry violate current laws   Durbin is an original co sponsor of the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006  which would make it illegal for oil giants to choke supplies in order to drive up prices at the pump   The bill would give the federal government additional tools to clamp down on oil companies that manipulate the market by unilaterally withholding supplies to increase prices or create shortages       Durbin said that the bill would also empower the federal government to prosecute foreign energy cartels  like OPEC  that act illegally under American antitrust laws in collusion to limit production or set prices   The bill would also update various antitrust laws to require enhanced scrutiny and tough restrictions on petroleum industry mergers   The Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006 was approved by the Judiciary Committee  of which Durbin is a member  this week and now awaits action by the full Senate
