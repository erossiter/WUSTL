                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wednesday  June 13  2007       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  announced today that major components of his legislation on traumatic brain injury  TBI  were included in a fast moving bill introduced by Senator Carl Levin  D MI   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  includes several of Durbins proposals from his bipartisan Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act  S 1349   which requires the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  to implement a comprehensive program to diagnose  treat and rehabilitate service members and veterans who have suffered a service related traumatic brain injury  Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IEDs  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBIs are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases  Too many of our brave service men and women are coming home from war with serious injuries that may be overlooked because they dont bear any visible wounds or scars  Durbin said  We are still learning the best treatment options for those suffering from TBI  With the knowledge we gain from increased research we will be able to moderate the impact TBI has on the lives of our veterans and their families  Today we re taking an important step forward by introducing a comprehensive military and veterans health care bill that will aid thousands of Americas service members and veterans dealing with TBI  The Senate Armed Services Committee will include Senator Durbins language in a version of the bill they will markup in committee tomorrow  A markup is the process by which congressional committees and subcommittees debate  amend  and rewrite proposed legislation  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act includes the following provisions from Senator Durbins original bill   Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists   Outreach   The act will also require DOD to conduct education and outreach to families of members of the Armed Forces on a range of matters relating to TBI including detection  mitigation  and treatment  as well as train family members with respect to care for combat disabled service members   Seamless Transition  The bill requires the DOD and VA to develop a joint plan for the seamless transition of service members from DOD health care to VA health care and require the government to use electronic medical records to ease the transition   Enhanced Availability of Care  Under this bill  any former or current member of the Armed Forces with a severe combat related injury or illness will be entitled to medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services as if they were a member of the Armed Forces for a period of 3 years beginning on the date they leave active duty   Partnerships  The bill allows the DOD to enter into partnerships  agreements  or other arrangements with the VA  institutions of higher education  and other appropriate public and private entities to prevent  diagnose  mitigate  treat  and rehabilitate service members suffering from a traumatic brain injury  The partnerships can also be used to help train medical staffs  accomplish research  and develop outreach strategies   Authorization   The bill authorizes  5 million for the creation of a Center of Excellence in Prevention  Diagnosis  Mitigation  Treatment  and Rehabilitation of Traumatic Brain Injury  It also authorizes  50 million relating to the improved diagnosis  treatment  and rehabilitation of members of the Armed Forces with traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder     17 million of which shall be available for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbins urging  That amendment as well as Senator Durbin s bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America


