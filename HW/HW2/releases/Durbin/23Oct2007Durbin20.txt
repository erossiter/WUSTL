                                                                                                                                                                                           Tuesday  October 23  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today urged Senate colleagues to come together and support the DREAM Act  a narrowly tailored  bipartisan measure which would permit a select group of undocumented students to become permanent residents if they came here as children  are long term U S  residents  have good moral character  and attend college or enlist in the military for at least two years  When I hear some describe this bill as amnesty  I wonder  if someone is willing to risk his or her life to serve in our military in a combat zone  is that a giveaway  If they go to college and become future nurses  future teachers  future doctors  scientists  and engineers  doesnt that make our country an even richer place  said Durbin  We can allow a generation of immigrant students with great potential and ambitions to contribute more fully to our society and national security  or we can relegate them to a future in the shadows  which would be a loss for all Americans  This is the choice the DREAM Act presents to us  DREAM stands for the Development  Relief  and Education for Alien Minors  DREAM  Act  The DREAM Act  and its predecessor  the CARE Act  has had strong bipartisan support since its introduction in 2001  The bill being debated on the floor today was approved in committee by two Republican Congresses  The DREAM Act has gone through committee three times  In the 109th Congress  it passed the Senate as an amendment to the comprehensive immigration bill  As the Adjutant General  I support this bill as it rewards those who have earned the right to become American citizens  said William Enyart  Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard  It opens a pool of recruits who have a great desire to serve  Service to our country should be encouraged  respected and rewarded  This is an investment in the human capital of our country  just as the GI Bill was  Without the GI Bill I  like many others  wouldnt have a college education  Just as I was given an opportunity to succeed I believe those who are willing to serve should also receive an opportunity to succeed  In order to be eligible for the DREAM Act individuals must   Have arrived here under the age of 16 Be under the age of 30 on the date of enactment Have lived in the U S  for at least 5 years Graduate from a U S  high school or has obtained a GED in the U S   and Serve in the military or attend college for at least two years Have good moral character  Statement from University of Chicago President Robert J  Zimmer  I support the DREAM Act introduced by Senator Richard J  Durbin because it would open doors for bright students who have the potential to make significant contributions to our universities and society  Our nation s future economic success will be dependent upon our ability to tap all sources of talent and encourage a greater proportion of our young people to aspire to a college degree  This legislation would be a step in that direction  How it works   If a student who otherwise qualifies for the DREAM Act graduates from a U S  high school or gets a GED in the U S   they can obtain conditional permanent residence  They then have 6 years during which they must enlist in the military or go to college for 2 years        If they complete 2 years of higher education or military service  they can then receive Legal Permanent Residence  LPR Green Card    The DREAM Act would do the following   The DREAM Act includes strong anti fraud protections  Applicants who have committed document fraud are ineligible for the DREAM Act and anyone who commits fraud in applying for the DREAM Act can be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to five years  The DREAM Act would help solve the Armys recruitment crisis  Under the DREAM Act  thousands of well qualified recruits would become eligible for military service  all of them high school graduates with good moral character and no criminal background  DoD officials say the DREAM Act is very appealing  would apply to the cream of the crop and would be good for readiness   As president of a university that is actively involved in outreach programs with the Hispanic community in Chicago and throughout Illinois  I applaud Senator Durbins initiative  said Illinois State University President Al Bowman  These talented young people can achieve success by pursing education and career opportunities through provisions of the DREAM Act  The DREAM Act amendment would NOT do the following   The DREAM Act would NOT lead to chain migration  DREAM Act beneficiaries would have very limited ability to sponsor family members  They could never sponsor extended family members and they could not begin sponsoring siblings or parents for at least six years  The visa backlog for siblings is decades long and parents who are illegally present in the U S  would have to leave the country for ten years before they could gain legal status  The DREAM Act amendment would NOT repeal a provision of federal law that prevents states from granting in state tuition rates to undocumented students  This provision was in an earlier version of the amendment but has been removed from the current version  DREAM Act students would NOT be eligible for federal grants which do not require repayment  Those who choose to attend college and otherwise qualify for the DREAM Act would only be eligible for federal student loans and federal work study  The DREAM Act would NOT give legal status to 1 3 million people  While CBO estimates that less than 100 000 students will benefit in the next ten years  the Migration Policy Institute  MPI  estimates that about 350 000 will benefit  A recent MPI study explains that while 715 000 students would be eligible  current high school graduation rates for undocumented students are at 50   therefore drastically decreasing the number of students affected  Given these statistics  it is likely that between 100 000 and 500 000 students will benefit  a far cry from the claim that millions will be affected   The DREAM Act is an equitable solution that will work to support future generations of a well educated and engaged citizenry  said Roosevelt University President Charles R  Middleton  It is the 21st century extension of our founding principles that provided higher education to individuals without regard to gender  race or religion in 1945  Using higher education as a pathway for citizenship promotes a sensible  pragmatic and equitable solution to a divisive problem  I look forward to standing with Senator Durbin on this issue  The DREAM Act is supported by a broad bipartisan coalition in the Senate  and by military leaders  religious leaders  and educators from across the political spectrum and around the country  During the 109th Congress  the DREAM Act was adopted unanimously as an amendment to immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate  In the 108th Congress  the DREAM Act was the only immigration reform proposal reported to the Senate floor  on a bipartisan 16 3 vote in the Judiciary Committee  The DREAM Act was included in the immigration bill that was considered on the Senate floor last month  Thousands of children currently caught up in the immigration system through no fault of their own deserve an opportunity to contribute their full potential to our nation  said DePaul University President Rev  Dennis H  Holtschneider  DePaul University was founded to provide a first rate education to all students who were not always welcome at other universities in Chicago  Our Vincentian mission is alive today as we welcome first generation students  provide them with a high quality education and empower them to contribute to Chicagos vibrant economy in ways their parents never thought possible  There is real academic talent among these students  and the DREAM Act is a sensible means of nurturing this talent for the benefit of all Americans
