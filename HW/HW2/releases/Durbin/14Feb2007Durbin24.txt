ILLINOIS AND IOWA LAWMAKERS ASK PENTAGON TO USE ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL TO PRODUCE NEW HUMVEE ARMOR KITS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  February 14  2007    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA  and Charles Grassley  R IA  along with Congressmen Phil Hare  D IL  and Bruce Braley  D IA  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense  Robert Gates  urging him to utilize the Rock Island Arsenal to ensure that the troops serving in Iraq have the armor and equipment needed to perform their mission and protect their lives       Recent press reports indicate that U S  Army units in Iraq and Afghanistan lack more than 4 000 of the latest Humvee armor kits  known as FRAG Kit 5   These Humvee armor kits are designed to reduce U S  troop deaths from roadside bombs    including a rising threat from new and particularly lethal roadside bombs    that are now inflicting 70 percent of the American casualties in the country  according to U S  military and civilian officials       Durbin and the other lawmakers noted that Rock Island Arsenal has a demonstrated capacity and adequate manpower to rapidly and efficiently produce armor kits to meet the growing demand to protect our troops  They wrote   The Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center  JMTC  at Rock Island Arsenal recently produced 6 500 interim Frag Kit 5 units for use in Iraq and Afghanistan  and maintains the capability to immediately produce additional kits        Durbin said that in 2004  Rock Island Arsenal was awarded a contract to produce 2 000 Humvee armor kits  The Arsenal completed all 2 000 kits two full months earlier than contracted  and produced an additional 160 kits with steel that was left over   The arsenal shifted from manufacturing 75 kits a week to 225 kits a week with a 24 hour a day   7 days a week operation       The letter also addressed concerns expressed by some military experts that even the new FRAG Kit 5 armor kits offered insufficient protection from the new generation of roadside explosives now being used in Iraq and asked the Secretary to suggest other methods to protect American troops       The text of the letter appears below         The Honorable Robert Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  DC 20301 4000  Dear Mr  Secretary    We are writing to you regarding the need for up armor kits for Humvees in Iraq and Afghanistan  We believe that Rock Island Arsenal in Rock Island  Illinois has the demonstrated capacity and manpower to rapidly and efficiently produce up armor kits to meet the growing demand to protect our troops against roadside bombs       Recent press reports have highlighted the shortage of up armored Humvees and the insurgents  use of increasingly lethal explosives  Roadside bombs are now inflicting an estimated 70 percent of American casualties in Iraq  At the current rate of production  according to media accounts  the shortfall of 4 000 up armor kits  FRAG Kit 5  will not be satisfied until July  With an additional five brigades headed to Baghdad  it is estimated that 2 000 Humvees urgently need up armoring       The Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center  JMTC  at Rock Island Arsenal recently produced 6 500 interim Frag Kit 5 units for use in Iraq and Afghanistan  and maintains the capability to immediately produce additional kits  We understand that with the growing lethality of insurgent attacks  even this enhanced armor may not be sufficient to safeguard our troops  If that is the case  then we need to find alternative solutions that will protect our brave men and women in uniform from roadside bombs       We respectfully request the answers to the following questions       1    Are there currently or will there be shortages of up armored Humvees in Iraq or Afghanistan       2    Is the current production schedule adequate to ensure our deployed troops have necessary up armored Humvees when they arrive in Iraq or Afghanistan       3    Does the current armor provide adequate ballistic and blast protection against the devices they now face  including Explosively Formed Penetrators or Projectiles       4    What other measures are being taken to protect our troops from the increasing lethality of explosive devices       5    Can Rock Island Arsenal help meet the warfighters  needs in this critical effort       Thank you for your prompt attention to this very important issue  We look forward to your reply
