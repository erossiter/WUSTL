INTRODUCE NEW FOOD SAFETY BILL IN WAKE OF WIDENING RECALLS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Tuesday  May 1  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Representative Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today introduced legislation that will revise and upgrade the nation s food safety system  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   one of the federal agencies charged with safeguarding the U S  food supply  has come under fire recently in the wake of nationwide recalls and or quarantines of tainted pork  spinach  peanut butter and pet food       Durbin and DeLauro s legislation would give the FDA the power to order mandatory recalls of adulterated food products  establish an early warning and notification system for human food  as well as pet food  and establish fines for companies that don t promptly report contaminated products        The product recalls that we have seen in the past few weeks   first with pet food and then with food intended for human consumption   have shown us that food borne illness is a dangerous and real threat in this country   Durbin said    There are gaps in the inspection  monitoring  notification and enforcement elements of our food system and we must act now to address them  We simply cannot afford to let consumers continue to be the guinea pigs in our food safety system         After the countless recalls  alerts and advisories from the past year  along with the latest CDC numbers showing increases in various food borne illnesses  the evidence is clear our food safety system is collapsing and one of the main agencies charged with protecting it  is asleep   stated DeLauro    This needs to change immediately   it is time to transform the FDA from the toothless agency it has become to one that takes the proactive steps necessary to protect our food supply and the public health        Durbin and DeLauro said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimate that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized  and more than 5 000 will die  With emerging pathogens  a population at high risk for food borne illnesses and an increasing volume of food imports  this situation is unlikely to improve without decisive action       Some of the new responsibilities given to the FDA under Durbin and DeLauro s new legislation include       Providing the FDA the authority for mandatory recalls of contaminated or dangerous food  The FDA currently has no authority to order food recalls  but must rely on the industry to voluntarily pull products from store shelves    Establishing an early warning and notification system for human food as well as pet food products  The legislation directs the FDA to work with professional organizations  veterinarians  and others to disseminate information about pet food contamination and in cases of both pet and human food  to keep up to date  comprehensive  searchable recall lists on their website    Establishing uniform federal standards and better labeling of pet food  The guidances and practices that today govern the pet food industry are implemented on a voluntary basis by manufacturers and state departments of agriculture  However  there is no requirement for states to adopt these practices and they don t have the force of federal guidelines   Inspections are not coordinated state to state and some states have different standards than others    Improving FDA s ability to regulate imported food products  The sources of the recent human and pet food contamination were wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that originated in China  Neither shipment was inspected by FDA  in fact  FDA inspects fewer than 1 5  of imports  FDA does not currently certify that trading partners have food safety standards that are at least equivalent to those of the United States   This bill would direct FDA to establish a certification program with trading partners interested in exporting food products to the United States   Foreign food safety systems and plants would be inspected by FDA prior to certification and the Secretary would have the authority to revoke certifications and deny importation of food if it presented a public health risk    Requiring companies to maintain records and make them accessible to FDA as part of an investigation   This provision would prevent delays that could keep contaminations from being traced as quickly as possible   In the case of the recalled peanut butter this past winter  an FDA report showed that inspectors were denied documents when they requested them  The bill would clarify that when FDA conducts inspections  it will have access to those documents needed for purposes of safeguarding the food supply    Durbin and DeLauro have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  This Congress they introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act   S  654 and H R  1148 in the Senate and House respectively   Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues
