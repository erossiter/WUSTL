16  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Secretary of Interior Nominee  Governor Dirk Kempthorne  R ID   to discuss issues related to the Department of Interior including the need for two National Heritage Areas in Illinois  the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area and the Land Between the Rivers Heritage Area   Designating land as a National Heritage Area makes federal grants available through the Department of Interior for historic preservation  education and economic development activities       In today   s meeting  Durbin asked for Kempthorne   s support of the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area Act  which he introduced last year   The bill would authorize grants  to be distributed among 41 designated counties in central Illinois  for programs that would promote natural  historic  and cultural Illinois resources touched by Abraham Lincoln   s legacy        Illinois  in both its physical and cultural landscapes  shaped Abraham Lincoln s character from youth to adulthood   said Durbin    In his farewell address at Springfield  Lincoln said   To this place and the kindness of these people I owe everything    Just as Illinois left its mark on the character of Abraham Lincoln  Lincoln left his lasting impressions on our state s artifacts  landscapes  buildings and folklore  Establishing a Lincoln National Heritage Area will bind these scattered elements into a tangible experience of Lincoln s legacy for Illinoisans and visitors alike        Durbin also discussed his plans to introduce legislation that would designate an area within the boundaries of the 17 southernmost counties as the Land Between the Rivers Southern Illinois Heritage Area   Durbin noted that the historical features of the area  situated between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers  highlight the pivotal role Southern Illinois played militarily  socially  and politically during the Civil War          After the Lewis and Clark expeditions  the land between the rivers became famous for its beauty and agricultural abundance     said Durbin      Southern Illinois not only played an important role in the history of the Civil War  it was a strategic meeting point for pioneers during the westward expansion of the United States   We want the families who plan to visit the area to enjoy the beauty  history and culture of this area and come back again and again          The Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area includes the following counties in Central Illinois  Adams  Brown  Calhoun  Cass  Champaign  Christian  Clark  Coles  Cumberland
