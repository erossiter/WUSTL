INTRODUCES BILL TO HELP VETERANS WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thursday  July 21  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to immediately strengthen its Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  services for veterans and their families          Seventy five years ago today  President Herbert Hoover created the Veterans Administration  dedicated to the care and well being of Americans who served in our nation   s Armed Forces     Durbin said      Today  I am introducing new legislation to address a growing threat to veterans    health     Post Traumatic Stress Disorder             PTSD is a fairly new term  but it is by no means a new problem     said Durbin      Soldiers who have endured the horrors of battlefield have long struggled with psychological trauma that is just as real    and can be just as deadly    as any other war wounds   Unfortunately  the VA health system is not prepared to provide service members who are dealing with PTSD the health care and other support they and their families need          According to a study published in the July 2004 New England Journal of Medicine  up to one in five veterans return home from the Middle East with PTSD or related conditions such as major depression or anxiety    Yet a report by the Governmental Accountability Office  GAO  last September shows that the VA doesn   t know how many patients it is currently treating for PTSD   In addition  officials at six of the seven VA facilities visited by the GAO reported that they may not be able to meet the increased demand for PTSD services caused by the war in Iraq          Senators don   t need to read the New England Journal of Medicine to know that our returning veterans often need help to overcome some terrible experiences they had in battle   We hear it from veterans in our own states     said Durbin      Earlier this year  I traveled across Illinois  speaking with veterans who struggle with PTSD   Their stories are heart wrenching   In addition to their trauma  they have also faced frustrating delays and roadblocks at the VA that keep them from receiving the treatment they need   It is time for Congress to step in  take action  and provide the treatment that our veterans deserve          Durbin noted that the VA established a Special Committee on PTSD more than 20 years ago  which has issued four reports with recommended improvements for the treatment of PTSD   Last year  the GAO studied the progress on implementing these expert recommendations and found that the VA has not fully implemented any of them       The Durbin bill requires the VA to implement three of the key treatment improvement recommendations made by its own Special Committee on PTSD       The Durbin bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to      Establish a PTSD Clinical Team at every one of the nation   s 157 VA Medical Centers   Approximately 60 VA Medical Centers do not currently have a PTSD Clinical Team   Provide a certified family therapist within each of the 207 Veteran Centers across the country   Appoint a regional PTSD Coordinator within each Veteran Integrated Service Network and Readjustment Counseling Service Region to evaluate programs  promote best practices  and make resource recommendations    Altogether  the Durbin bill would add about 400 mental health professionals to the VA to treat veterans struggling with PTSD and to assist their families          It is important for Congress to act now     Durbin said      If we continue to drag our feet on this  far too many soldiers with PTSD may go undiagnosed and untreated   Without treatment  veterans with PTSD are at high risk for drug abuse  domestic violence  homelessness  unemployment and even suicide   America   s veterans deserve better
