May 10  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  held a meeting today with actress Drew Barrymore  marathon world record holder Paul Tergat  World Food Program s Executive Director  Josette Sheeran  and Representatives Jim McGovern  D MA  and Jo Ann Emerson  R MO   to discuss the McGovern Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program and future efforts for the program s expansion  This program  named for former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole  provides school lunches to children in impoverished countries  In March  Durbin introduced a bill to reauthorize the McGovern Dole program and provide it with additional funding so that it is restored to its original level of  300 million by 2012    Additional steps to increase funding for the program are being looked at as part of upcoming legislation        Millions of children around the world go hungry every day   Durbin said   This program works to bring children to school and provide them with a nutritious meal  but we can do more   I m happy to join Drew Barrymore and my friend Paul Tergat  as they bring attention to this vital program  I hope that their support of children around the world will spur us in Congress to provide the funding necessary to help as many children as we can        The McGovern Dole program provides donations of U S  agricultural commodities and financial and technical assistance for school feeding and child nutrition in low income  food deficit countries  The key objectives of the program are to reduce hunger and improve literacy  increase access to primary education  especially for girls  and to improve the health and learning capacity of pre school children  Since McGovern Dole became law in 2000  the program has provided meals to 26 million children in 41 countries and has boosted school attendance by 14 percent overall and by 17 percent for girls  The program has had a markedly positive effect on educational attainment and long term development outcomes       The Senate and House bills will ensure that minimum funding levels be provided each year and will allow the program to reach significantly more children  Increased resources will also ensure multi year commitments that are necessary in building self sustaining school feeding program       Actress Drew Barrymore became acquainted with the program during a recent trip to Africa  After seeing how important this program is to child around the world  she joined the Friends of the World Food Program as its celebrity partner  She spent the day on the Hill meeting with Members of Congress and urging their support of an expanded McGovern Dole program       One person who has participated in international school feeding programs is Paul Tergat  the current world record holder in the marathon   He ran the 26 2 mile race in 2 04 55  When he was a child living in Kenya  he received free lunches through a World Food Program school feeding program  Without the program  Tergat says his parents were too poor and he would not have been able to go to school       The McGovern Dole program is supported by Christian Children s Fund  Bread for the World  Heiffer

11 500 tons of U S  soybeans and soybean products   Illinois ranks second among the states in terms of both corn and soybean production and is among the top ten producers of wheat   More than 90 percent of the cultivated acreage in Illinois is planted with corn  soybeans or wheat   Illinois also exports more agricultural commodities than all but three other states
