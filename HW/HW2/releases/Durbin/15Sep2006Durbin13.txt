                                                                                                                                                                                         Friday  September 15  2006           Following recent reports that personal telephone records of Hewlett Packard  HP  corporate directors and nine journalists were obtained without authorization  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on the Majority Leader Senator Bill Frist  R TN  to schedule a vote on H R  4709  the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act before the Senate recess at the end of the month       Durbin  who has helped craft a Senator version of the House passed legislation  said H R  4709  The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act  is a consensus bill that provides strong criminal penalties for the fraudulent acquisition  unauthorized disclosure  or improper transfer of telephone records       In a letter to Senator Frist  Durbin wrote     No one should have to wonder whether it is illegal for others to obtain their phone records without authorization   I believe the practice already is illegal  but this legislation is urgently needed to erase any doubt and establish appropriate penalties for such actions   It is urgent that the Senate pass this legislation and send it to the President for his signature before the privacy of more Americans is violated          The full text of Durbin   s letter to Senator Frist appears below         September 15  2006  The Honorable William H  Frist  Senate Majority Leader  S 230 Capitol  Washington  D C   20510   Dear Majority Leader Frist    I strongly urge you to schedule a vote on H R  4709  the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act before the Senate recess at the end of the month   This legislation is identical to the amended version of S  2178 which I joined Senators Specter  Schumer  and others in crafting  and it was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee without dissent   The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act provides strong criminal penalties for the fraudulent acquisition  unauthorized disclosure  or improper transfer of telephone records       I introduced legislation earlier this year  as did Senators Schumer and Specter  in response to several news stories reporting that online brokers had illegally obtained cell phone records and sold them without customers    knowledge   Our measures were designed to deter online brokers by prohibiting the sale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone records   We worked out our differences and the differences between our bills and the corresponding House measure  and the language in H R  4709 is consensus language we all support to address this illegal practice   However  the effort to pass this legislation has stalled in the Senate for reasons we do not understand  while Americans    telephone records remain at risk       As you know  telephone records     both hard line and cellular     contain vast amounts of personal and sensitive information including home addresses  contacts with personal associates and health care providers  and other private data   Recent media attention has alerted the public to the existence of Internet websites that advertise the ability to obtain virtually anyone   s personal telephone records for a small fee       The urgent need for this legislation is even more apparent in light of recent revelations   Last week  reports surfaced that Hewlett Packard  HP  obtained the personal telephone records of its corporate directors without authorization   The records of nine journalists reportedly were also obtained without authorization   HP   s investigators allegedly did this by impersonating these people in contacts with their telephone service providers  and a high ranking attorney at HP claims these actions were not illegal   No one should have to wonder whether it is illegal for others to obtain their phone records without authorization   I believe the practice already is illegal  but this legislation is urgently needed to erase any doubt and establish appropriate penalties for such actions   It is urgent that the Senate pass this legislation and send it to the President for his signature before the privacy of more Americans is violated       The Senate has granted you the authority to set the Senate floor agenda   This legislation should not be delayed any longer   I urge you to schedule a vote on the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act and look forward to working with you to secure its passage       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator
