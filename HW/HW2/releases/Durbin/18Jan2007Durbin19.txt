BIGGERT INTRODUCE BILL TO AUTHORIZE ASIAN CARP BARRIER PROJECTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  January 18  2007          U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congresswoman Judy Biggert  R IL  today introduced legislation to authorize funding for the Asian Carp barriers in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal       Asian carp  an invasive species  threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem by consuming large quantities of phytoplankton and competing with native fish for habitat   Originally  asian carp were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities  The carp have made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River  Asian carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds  and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day          The carp approaching the northern section of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan have no natural predators  This invasive species threatens both the native fish and natural wildlife of the lake and in turn  the economy of the entire Great Lakes region     said Durbin      The  400 000 we secured in last year   s emergency spending bill provided us with an immediate remedy to the threat of Barrier I getting shut down   Today  Congressman Biggert and I introduced legislation that will address the long term solution that will help us avert a potentially devastating situation           By lifting funding and other limitations on the barrier project  the bills Senator Durbin and I introduced today will enable the Corps to fortify this last line of defense against the voracious Asian Carp   said Biggert    The Great Lakes are one of our most important natural resources   The Asian Carp won t wait for Congress to act   I look forward to working with Senator Durbin and others to get this legislation enacted as soon as possible        The legislation will authorize the Corps of Engineers to      Complete construction on a permanent barrier  Barrier II  Upgrade and make permanent the original demonstration barrier  Barrier I  Operate Barriers I   II simultaneously to optimize effectiveness Study options and technologies to prevent the spread of this invasive species    The demonstration barrier in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal was authorized in 1996 under the National Invasive Species Act to prevent non native species like the Asian carp from moving between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes  Since this barrier was designed to be temporary and is close to the end of its expected service life  a second permanent barrier is being constructed       In June  2006 Durbin and Obama worked to successfully secure  400 000 to operate the barriers that prevent invasive species from entering the Great Lakes   Twenty eight other Great Lakes House Members joined Biggert in sending a letter to House appropriators in support of this effort  The funding was included to pay for the operation of Barrier I  a temporary barrier that keeps the invasive species out of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan by emitting an electric current that deters the carp from passing through  Funding to maintain the operation of Barrier I has been almost entirely depleted and the Corps of Engineers indicated that without additional funding they would have to shut down the temporary barrier       Durbin was a member of the conference committee between the House and Senate versions on the emergency spending bill where the provision to fund barrier I was added   The bill was signed into law on June 15th  2006
