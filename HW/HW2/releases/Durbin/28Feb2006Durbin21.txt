QUESTIONS WHETHER ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWED LAW DURING REVIEW OF DUBAI PORTS WORLD DEAL

Tuesday  February 28  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to the top Bush Administration official who headed the government   s review process that approved the sale of six American ports to Dubai Ports World  questioning whether the official followed the law       Durbin believes that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  ignored two sections in the law   Durbin said that    Even though Dubai Ports World is clearly owned by a foreign government  a 45 day detailed review was not conducted     and that    no written report was submitted to the Secretary of the Senate to notify Congress of the results    of the CFIUS review           I write to request an explanation as to why  in the case of the Dubai Ports World purchase of the American port operations of Peninsular   Oriental Steam Navigation Co   you did not adhere to the processes that have been established by law for reviewing commercial transactions that might impact the national security of the United States     Durbin wrote to Robert Kimmett  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury       The full text of the letter appears below           February 28  2006   Honorable Robert Kimmett  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury  1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  D C  20220  Dear Secretary Kimmett    I write to request an explanation as to why  in the case of the Dubai Ports World purchase of the American port operations of Peninsular   Oriental Steam Navigation Co   you did not adhere to the processes that have been established by law for reviewing commercial transactions that might impact the national security of the United States       It is my belief that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  ignored two sections of the relevant statute  50 USC App  Sec  2170   emphasis added        b  Mandatory investigations   The President or the President s designee shall make an investigation  as described in subsection  a   in any instance in which an entity controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government seeks to engage in any merger  acquisition  or takeover which could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States  Such investigation shall         1  commence not later than 30 days after receipt by the President or the President s designee of written notification of the proposed or pending merger  acquisition  or takeover  as prescribed by regulations promulgated pursuant to this section  and        2  shall be completed not later than 45 days after its commencement       g  Report to the Congress   The President shall immediately transmit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a written report of the President s determination of whether or not to take action under subsection  d   including a detailed explanation of the findings made under subsection  e  and the factors considered under subsection  f   Such report shall be consistent with the requirements of subsection  c  of this Act       Even though Dubai Ports World is clearly owned by a foreign government  a 45 day detailed review was not conducted   Further  no written report was submitted to the Secretary of the Senate to notify Congress of the results of the CFIUS review       I am pleased that Dubai Ports World has voluntarily asked for a more thorough 45 day review  however  this does not allay my broader concerns that the mandated CFIUS processes were not properly followed in this instance   I would therefore appreciate your explanation as to why the two highlighted requirements were not followed   Furthermore  I would also like to know in how many other cases over the past year has CFIUS not met each of these requirements       Thank you for your attention to this request   I look forward to your prompt reply       Sincerely   Senator Richard J  Durbin
