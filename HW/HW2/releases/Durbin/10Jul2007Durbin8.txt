the Consumer Product Safety Commission  The subcommittee also oversees much of the funding for the nation s financial services agencies  as well as the U S  Treasury Department  This is a very transparent appropriations bill  shining a light on requests from Senators and the Bush Administration  Quite frankly  that is the way it should be  said Durbin  This is a responsible spending bill that honestly addresses earmarks  forcing members to stand by their projects  The bill addresses a wide range of issues from increased funding for court security programs and meth prevention initiatives  to expanding the budget of the Consumer Product Safety Commission so they can better safeguard the public  Weve made tough decisions  with tight funds  in the face of many worthy demands  and Im proud of the bill weve crafted  The subcommittee was allocated  21 8 billion in discretionary budget authority in addition to  22 4 billion in mandatory spending  This is a  3 billion increase
