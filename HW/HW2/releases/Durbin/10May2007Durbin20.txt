Question US Trade Representative about US China Trade Relationship

10  2007   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today called for the U S  Trade Representative  USTR  Susan Schwab to examine the U S  trade relationship with China in light of the questions being raised in connection with the pet food recall about China s poor sanitary conditions and lax food safety regulations   Recently  two companies in China have been identified as the source of the contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate in the pet food recall       In today s letter  Durbin and DeLauro requested that Ambassador Schwab provide information about food safety standards included in current free trade agreements and other permanent trade relations  as well as what recourse is taken when imports threaten public health        Not that long ago  the vast majority of products at the local grocery store were from domestic manufacturers and subject to standard regulations   Today  an increasing amount of our food  food additives and over the counter drugs are imported from other countries    where the laws governing food and drug safety are often lax or entirely absent   said Durbin   Fewer than one in 50 food products from overseas are inspected   Those are poor odds for any bet and not a risk American families should have to take         There is significant evidence that China is failing to meet international food safety standards   from deceptive labeling and intentional contamination of products to unsanitary conditions   In a modern  globalized food supply system significant amounts of food imports are a reality   said DeLauro   And the Chinese need to be aware that their regulations need to be strengthened because trade should not trump public health        The text of the letter appears below         May 10  2007   The Honorable Ambassador Susan Schwab  Office of the United States Trade Representative  600 17th Street  N W   Washington  DC 20508   Dear Ambassador Schwab    We are writing in light of the recently discovered contamination of imported wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate used to manufacture pet food in the United States   This contamination led to the recall of millions of packages of pet food  a number of pet deaths and illnesses  and increased uncertainty about the safety and soundness of our food supply   Because the investigation also revealed that feeding operations for hogs  chickens  and fish also were affected  the contamination may have reached the human food supply       The safety of food imports from China extends beyond the pet food recall   China is especially poor at meeting international food safety standards  which is particularly disturbing considering that China exported approximately  2 26 billion in agricultural products to the United States in 2006   A recent news article noted that  in February  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  blocked the entry of several food products from China because they contained banned additives  were tainted by pesticides or were contaminated with salmonella   Some products were simply unsanitary       The U S  Trade Representative  USTR  is involved in these matters because regional  bilateral  and international trade agreements entered into by the United States often include sanitary and phytosanitary  SPS  measures   For example  there are two World Trade Organization  WTO  agreements that deal with food safety and animal and plant health and safety   We understand that these provisions allow countries to set their own standards but require countries to base regulations on science and encourage countries to use international guidelines where they exist       Our concern is whether the USTR has the ability to challenge the sanitary and phytosanitary standards of our trading partners based on evidence that they are not meeting international standards and may be endangering public health in the United States       This issue is particularly important as U S  agricultural imports are predicted to reach a record  69 billion in FY 2007   If we are to continue at this rate  we must ask important questions about the food safety standards of our trade partners to ensure our nation s public health is not compromised       Developing countries often lack sufficient regulations  monitoring  and enforcement of SPS regulations   China  for instance  has come under scrutiny in the past for an overall lack of transparency and failure to properly adhere to SPS measures required by the World Trade Organization       While we understand the importance of the United States  involvement in international trade  participation in these trade relations should not come at the expense of animal or human health       Therefore  we request answers to the following questions         1  What sanitary and phytosanitary measures are included in current free trade agreements and other permanent trade relations in which the United States is currently engaged       2  What legal recourse does the United States possess with respect to imported food products that pose a threat to public health  in the event that the country where the offending product originated is not cooperative       We believe this situation deserves your attention and careful review       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator   Rosa L  DeLauro  Member of Congress
