  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today announced  19 million in Senate funding for transportation projects in the City of Springfield   The funding is part of  215 million Durbin and Obama secured for Illinois in the TEA 3 highway bill recently passed in Congress          The funding in this bill will help Springfield alleviate congestion and improve road conditions on several key corridors     Durbin said      The Capitol building is the heart of our city   With more tourists visiting Springfield everyday  now is the time to connect the Capitol to the tourism center near the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum   Springfield is on its way to becoming a world class city   The Multi Modal Center will improve access for residents and tourists alike to public transportation   a key component of most growing cities             Securing this funding for Springfield is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     Obama said     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges             I appreciate the efforts made by Senators Durbin and Obama to ensure that Springfield can move forward on several important transportation initiatives     Mayor Tim Davlin said      The Capitol Street Project will transform an average city street into a bustling boulevard that will unite our downtown historic sites with our Capitol Complex   I am equally excited that funding is being provided which will lay the groundwork for a Multi Modal transportation center  a facility which will enhance the experience that travelers enjoy when using public transportation to visit Springfield          The Senate funding will be used for      Construction of the 11th St  Extension  which is designed to better connect Springfield   s inner city to the University of Illinois at Springfield campus   Construction on Capitol Avenue between 7th and 11th Streets  in an effort to connect the Capitol complex to the downtown area with a boulevard that   s architecturally attractive   The plan is designed to showcase Springfield   s Capitol Building   Extension of MacArthur Blvd  from Wabash to Iron Bridge Road   The extension will allow a new entrance to IL 72 to be built  which will substantially relieve congestion on Wabash and Veterans on the west side of the city   The federal funding moves the City toward its goal to connect MacArthur Blvd with IL 72   Improvements to Cockrell Lane  which will widen the roadway and improve traffic safety in an already congested high traffic area   Planning and design of the City

converge  providing residents and visitors with the ability to easily transfer from one mode of transportation to the other    U S  Rep  John Shimkus secured an additional  1 2 million for MacArthur Blvd and  480 000 for Route 29 in the House of Representatives portion of the TEA 3 bill    The Illinois delegation works together on many issues and projects  particularly this transportation bill     said Shimkus      I am pleased to have supported our efforts to gain funding for the MacArthur extension and Route 29  which will provide both jobs  driver safety  and access for economic development        Congressman Ray LaHood  who helped secure the funding for Cockrell Lane as well as  400 000 for the development of the Sangamon Valley Trail on Springfield   s west side was pleased to see the Springfield area receive significant funding      Projects such as the Capitol Avenue upgrades  the Multi Modal center  and the Sangamon Valley Trail underscore the importance of our state   s capital city     LaHood said      These projects will do much to enhance the quality of life in the community as well as provide important transportation options          The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21       Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level       Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families          It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois             This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
