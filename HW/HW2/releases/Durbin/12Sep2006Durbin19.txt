GOLDEN TRIANGLE AWARD FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF DOWNSTATE ILLINOIS FARMERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Tuesday  September 12  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   who serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  today received the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers Union  NFU  for his attention to issues affecting rural America   The award was presented at a meeting held today in Durbin   s U S  Capitol office with the Illinois Farmers Union   At today   s meeting  the Illinois lawmaker discussed bipartisan legislation that will assist downstate Illinoisans  including a new agriculture disaster package  a resolution recognizing September as    Rural America Month     legislation Durbin introduced last month to provide broadband access to rural areas and the 2007 Farm Bill         I am honored to receive this award and will continue to work with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help our nation   s farmers     said Durbin      Unfortunately  the Administration continues to challenge our efforts to provide Illinois and other Midwestern farmers with disaster relief   We cannot let this be the final word and I am now working with senators on a bipartisan basis for a new agriculture disaster package          Last week  Durbin worked with Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation that will provide disaster assistance to farmers in Illinois and across the country dealing with drought   The legislation would assist farmers who have lost more than 35 percent of their crop with a payment of 50 percent of the established crop price   It would also provide Supplemental Economic Loss Payments to help compensate farmers for significantly higher energy and fertilizer costs in 2005 and 2006   Also  it would provide assistance for livestock producers facing increased feed costs  and additional assistance to farmers to compensate for specialty crop losses       Last week  Durbin helped pass legislation to designate September 2006 as    Rural America Month      The legislation  S Res 561  will encourage activities during the month of September to highlight the importance of Rural America and among other things  will help recognize rural America   s role in the nation   s growing information highway   Last month  Durbin introduced legislation  the Broadband for Rural America Act of 2006  to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas          Broadband is an essential component of our lives  at work and at home  It has become an essential service like water  gas and electricity  Our homes and businesses need affordable access to high speed internet connections  in the same way our homes and businesses need traditional utility services     said Durbin     Yet  for too many people living in small communities today  broadband access is still not a reality   When I travel in downstate Illinois  people tell me that they cannot wait to have broadband service  but that there is no service available to them right now  My bill will change that          In today   s meeting Durbin also discussed the 2007 Farm Bill  The Farm Bill will likely contain a number of provisions important to Illinois farmers including improving protections for farmers in the event of natural disasters such as droughts and flooding  modifying the current commodity support programs  maintaining nutrition programs like Food Stamps and the Women  Infants  and Children Program  WIC  and increasing federal support for innovative renewable energy projects   House and Senate Agriculture Committees are currently holding hearings around the country to gather information from farmers and other stakeholders on a variety of topics  including crop insurance  commodity programs  rural development  renewable energy and others   The Agriculture Committee is expected to begin writing the Farm Bill next year        The Golden Triangle Award is based on NFU s symbol   a triangle with  legislation  and  cooperation  forming the sides and  education  the base  The Golden Triangle Award is awarded annually and was first established in 1988
