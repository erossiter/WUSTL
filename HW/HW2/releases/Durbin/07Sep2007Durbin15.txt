September 7  2007       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  was joined by members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation today in sending a letter to Governor Rod Blagojevich and the members of the Illinois General Assembly urging swift passage of the state capital bill  Members signing on to todays letter include Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Representatives Melissa Bean  D IL   Judy Biggert  R IL   Jerry Costello  D IL   Danny Davis  D IL   Rahm Emanuel  D IL   Luis Gutierrez  D IL   Dennis Hastert  R IL   Phil Hare  D IL   Jesse Jackson  Jr   D IL   Tim Johnson  D IL   Mark Kirk  R IL

expressed their concern for the future of Illinois projects  The lack of a state capital bill to address infrastructure issues means that Illinois has not kept up with the growth in construction costs  These infrastructure needs will not go away  and the longer we wait to fund them  the more expensive these projects will be  They explained  According to the Transportation for Illinois Coalition  state capital funds for highways are  842 million less than in 2003  a 55 percent reduction  In the absence of a capital bill  a funding lag over the last four years has caused a significant drop in the number of miles of state highways repaired and improved  For example  about 820 miles a year of highways were improved in 2003  we are now down to only 360 miles this year  IDOT has estimated that the miles of roads in bad repair will grow by 50 percent in the next five years  A state capital bill would allow IDOT to expedite badly needed transportation projects and better utilize federal funding set aside for Illinois  This increased investment will help address Illinois aging bridges and infrastructure and move us closer to the having the safest  most efficient transportation system in the country  Text of the letter appears below   September 6  2007 The Honorable Rod Blagojevich  Governor  Capitol Building  Springfield  IL 62706 Members of the Illinois General Assembly  Capitol Building  Springfield  IL 62706    Dear Governor Blagojevich and Members of the Illinois General Assembly    The tragic events on the Minneapolis Interstate 35W bridge last month have brought a heightened awareness of our nations bridges and infrastructure needs  In Illinois  more than 1 500 bridges have structural ratings worse than the I 35W span that collapsed  Many of these bridges crisscross Illinois aging interstate system  85 percent of which is more than 20 years old  Replacing just one of these bridges can cost millions of dollars  modernizing our transportation infrastructure will cost billions  While our states transportation needs pile up  costs for construction  replacement  and repair of our aging infrastructure are rising rapidly  The costs of materials used for highway and street construction have risen 22 percent over the past two years  The lack of a state capital bill to address infrastructure issues means that Illinois has not kept up with the growth in construction costs  These infrastructure needs will not go away  and the longer we wait to fund them  the more expensive these projects will be  In the 109th Congress  we worked together in a bipartisan manner to provide Illinois with the largest infusion of federal funding for transportation infrastructure in the states history  SAFETEA  P L  109 59  provided the state with 33 4 percent per year more in federal funding for highway infrastructure than in previous years  This  6 2 billion provided by the federal transportation bill put in place the resources necessary to make significant investments in infrastructure throughout Illinois  Were proud of this accomplishment and are determined that all of the federal funding set aside for Illinois be spent as soon as possible in an effort to meet the demands of our states transportation system  The State responded after Congress passed comprehensive transportation infrastructure legislation in the late 1990s by enacting Illinois FIRST  This capital bill ensured that all federal funding secured by the Illinois Congressional Delegation could be spent on highway and transit projects  In short  thanks to the state match  federal funding was acted upon swiftly  addressing urgent transportation needs and insuring against the rising costs of construction  According to the Transportation for Illinois Coalition  state capital funds for highways are  842 million less than in 2003  a 55 percent reduction  In the absence of a capital bill  a funding lag over the last four years has caused a significant drop in the number of miles of state highways repaired and improved  For example  about 820 miles a year of highways were improved in 2003  we are now down to only 360 miles this year  IDOT has estimated that the miles of roads in bad repair will grow by 50 percent in the next five years  The beginning of fall is a reminder that we have let another construction season pass without a major state capital bill  This lack of investment has delayed projects that will be more expensive the longer we wait  Illinois residents understand the need for strengthening our investment in transportation and ensuring the safe and efficient transportation of people and goods  The State of Illinois has been considering a capital bill to address some of these issues  A state capital bill would allow IDOT to expedite badly needed transportation projects and better utilize federal funding set aside for Illinois  This increased investment will help address Illinois aging bridges and infrastructure and move us closer to having the safest  most efficient transportation system in the country  We hope we can count on you to pass and enact appropriate legislation that will provide the required state match to the federal funds we helped secure  As always  we stand ready to help the taxpayers of Illinois obtain the highest rate of return for their tax dollars  Sincerely   U S  Richard Durbin  D IL
