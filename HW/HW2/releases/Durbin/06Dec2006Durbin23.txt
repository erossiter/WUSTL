                                                                                                                                                                                                             12 6 2006                                                                                                                                                                            SENATE APPROVES CRITICAL COURT SECURITY BILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  December 6  2006        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today helped pass legislation to increase courtroom security  The bill was approved unanimously by the Senate  Both Illinois senators have been involved with the fight to pass stronger courtroom security legislation for more than a year          The level of violence directed at judges in Illinois  Georgia and Nevada has shown that we need to move quickly to prevent attacks on innocent individuals and on our criminal justice system     Durbin said      Speaker Hastert  Senator Obama and I have all discussed the need to pass stronger court security laws before the end of this Congress   Today  the Senate has successfully passed a bill to make judges safer in their homes and in our courtrooms  the House now has an opportunity to act on this critical safety measure             Our judges should never have to worry that simply doing their jobs will put them or their families at risk  I believe that the additional protections this legislation provides will make our judges safer  and will help them feel more secure     said Obama   I am very pleased that the Senate passed this important bill  and I hope the House will soon follow suit          The Court Security Improvement Act of 2006 includes the following      Expands the definition of prohibited dangerous weapons in federal courthouses  Creates a new federal crime  punishable by up to 5 years in prison  for posting restricted personal information about a federal judge  law enforcement official  juror  witness or family member thereof  on the Internet with the intent to use that information to kill  kidnap  inflict bodily harm against  or threaten the federal official or family member  Creates a new federal crime  punishable by up to 10 years in prison  for filing a false lien against the property of a federal judge or law enforcement official in retaliation for the performance of official duties  Extends a provision in existing law that gives federal judges the authority to edit information about their financial disclosures when its release could endanger the judge or their family  Authorizes an additional  20 million for the U S  Marshals Service to protect judges  Requires the U S  Marshals Service to consult with the Judicial Conference of the United States regarding the security requirements of the judicial branch  Authorizes state courts to receive Justice Department grant money to improve security     Earlier this year  a similar court security provision was adopted by the Senate with broad bipartisan support as an amendment to the 2007 Department of Defense Authorization bill   It was later removed from the bill during conference committee deliberations       Last year  Durbin and Obama  citing the recent murders of the husband and mother of federal judge Joan Lefkow in Chicago and the courtroom killings in Atlanta  worked to secure funding for enhanced security for federal judges and courtrooms   Durbin wrote to the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court and the U S  Attorney General regarding improvements to the protection of federal judges   The Senators also met with the Director of the U S  Marshals Service  who oversees the safety and protection of federal judges  on this issue       In April  2005  Durbin and Obama successfully added a provision to the 2005 Supplemental Appropriations bill that provided  12 million to protect federal judges in their homes and courthouses   The funding is currently being used for installation and maintenance of security systems at the homes of federal judges  protective surveillance at the homes of judges and at courthouses  and for protective intelligence gathering and analysis
