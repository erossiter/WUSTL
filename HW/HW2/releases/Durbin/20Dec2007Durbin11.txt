Department of Energy  Samuel Bodman  to release the Record of Decision  a final public decision that certifies the project meets environmental requirements  for FutureGen  Even though the site selection has been completed and the 30 day public comment period for the Environmental Impact Statement has ended  the Department of Energy has failed to issue a Record of Decision without which  it will be difficult to keep the project on track and on budget  We are pleased that this independent council of renowned experts carefully assessed the science and strengths of this Illinois location and favorably affirmed the commitment of state and local resources that were assembled in response to clear federal expectations announced 4 years ago  the Illinois members wrote  While the site selection has been completed  the 30 day period for the issuance of the Record of Decision  RoD  by the Department of Energy has not been met  We are interested in learning when the Department intends to release this document so that this project can move forward in Illinois without additional unnecessary delays  On Tuesday  the FutureGen Alliance announced their decision to locate the  1 5 billion emissions free coal generation plant in Mattoon  Illinois  FutureGen will be a  1 5 billion government industry project which will produce the first emissions free coal generation plant of its kind  It is a demonstration for gasifying coal  converting it to hydrogen and carbon monoxide   producing hydrogen and electricity  capturing carbon dioxide  and sequestering it underground  The plant would generate approximately 275 MW of electricity  which is enough to supply 150 000 homes  Facility construction would begin in 2010  with full scale operation beginning in 2013  The FutureGen Initiative was initially announced by President Bush in February 2003  In early December of 2005  the Department of Energy signed an agreement with the FutureGen Alliance  a non profit consortium of coal producers and energy generators  Over the last year  site selection  design activities  and environmental analyses has laid the groundwork for final project design  construction  and operation  The Department of Energy announced on November 9  2007 the completion of the Final Environmental Impact Statement  and acknowledged that the FutureGen Alliance  as required under the cooperative agreement with the Department  would make its final site selection before the end of the year  Other members signing on to todays letter include Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Representatives Bobby Rush  D IL   Jesse Jackson  Jr   D IL   Dan Lipinski  D IL   Luis Gutierrez  D IL   Rahm Emanuel  D IL   Peter Roskam  D IL   Danny Davis  D IL   Melissa Bean  D IL   Jan Schakowsky  D IL   Mark Kirk  R IL   Jerry

December 18  2007 The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary  United States Department of Energy  Forrestal Building  Room 7B138  1000 Independence Avenue SW  Washington  D C  20585 0800 Dear Mr  Secretary  This week the FutureGen Alliance announced its final selection of Mattoon  Illinois  as the location for the construction of the FutureGen project     pronouncing the Mattoon proposal exceptional and underscoring the highest forms of teamwork and community support  We are writing today to urge the Department to release the Record of Decision  RoD  for the FutureGen project  so that this important effort can stay on track and on budget  We are pleased that this independent council of renowned experts carefully assessed the science and strengths of this Illinois location and favorably affirmed the commitment of state and local resources that were assembled in response to clear federal expectations announced 4 years ago  The Department of Energy announced on November 9  2007 the completion of the Final Environmental Impact Statement  and acknowledged that the FutureGen Alliance  as required under the cooperative agreement with the Department  would make its final site selection before the end of the year  While the site selection has been completed  the 30 day period for the issuance of the Record of Decision  RoD  by the Department of Energy has not been met  We are interested in learning when the Department intends to release this document so that this project can move forward in Illinois without additional unnecessary delays  In 2003  when President Bush announced the long term commitment of the United States government to this project  representatives of academia  industry  labor and government responded  investing considerable resources to make their case  It is the commitment of the Illinois Congressional Delegation to maintain the scope of this project in Illinois and implement the independent recommendation of the FutureGen Alliance  We look forward to the continued commitment by the Department of Energy to the current project and look forward to learning the issue date of the RoD  Sincerely  Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
