Thursday  December 6  2007       At a press conference in the U S  Capitol  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today was joined by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  the Grocery Manufacturers Association  GMA   the Food Marketing Institute  FMI   the American Frozen Food Institute  AFFI   the Coalition for a Stronger FDA and FDA Alliance  the Center for Science in the Public Interest  CSPI   and the Consumer Federation of America  CFA  in calling on the White House to increase FDAs food safety resources  Also today  in a letter to President Bush with cosigners from both sides of the aisle  Senator Durbin urged the President to recognize the importance of this issue by proposing a significant funding increase for FDAs Foods Program in the FY09 Budget  For years  Congress has pointed out that the FDA is understaffed and under funded  said Senator Durbin  Now  the FDA s own science advisors admit the agency is failing at its mission  The only good news is that these reports may give us the momentum we need to change  I am calling on the Administration to commit to doubling FDA funding over the next five years  We simply cannot leave American families vulnerable when it comes to food safety  Last week  a subcommittee of the FDAs Science Board released a pivotal report detailing how under funding of the FDA is jeopardizing the agencys ability to protect the food supply  Specifically  the report found that FDA is woefully under funded and unable to do its job due to soaring demands on the Agency  and resources that have not increased in proportion to those demands  We need comprehensive preventive measures  effective surveillance  and robust authority for FDA to take action where needed to protect lives  said Senator Kennedy  Theres no mystery to how to improve food safety  The Europeans have a strong system  and so do the Japanese  I am working with my colleagues on the health committee and throughout the Senate on comprehensive bipartisan legislation to protect the food supply  and this proposal ought to be the first order of business for the Senate in the new year  The nature of our food supply is evolving more rapidly than ever before  and the food industry is adapting in order to provide consumers with abundant  safe and affordable food  said GMA President and CEO Cal Dooley  In order to adequately protect the food supply and restore consumer confidence in our nations food safety net  Congress and the Bush Administration must provide FDA with the resources it needs to modernize the agency and allow it to properly fulfill its food safety mission  Just like we wouldn t send the cavalry to fight a modern war  we should not allow the FDA to continue to use out of date tools to manage a global food supply  said Caroline Smith DeWaal  food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest  The latest report from the FDA Science Board says that FDA s food program is in critical condition  The proof of the report is in the number of food outbreaks and recalls over the last 16 months  Preventing illnesses and outbreaks takes money  Without it  millions of consumers are at increased risk of becoming ill from something they eat  The FDA continues to receive less and less resources and more and more responsibility  said William Hubbard  FDA Coalition spokesperson  The Institute of Medicine has concluded FDA needs more funding  the FDA s own advisors now conclude FDA is in critical shape because of lack of funding  and now we need the Administration and Congress to come to that same conclusion and provide more resources  The capable and dedicated professionals at FDA would certainly benefit from increased funding for essential food safety programs  said Tim Hammonds  president and CEO  FMI  Because of extensive experience with the rapidly evolving food safety challenges facing our nation  FDA s leadership can be a valuable resource for helping to decide just how this additional funding can be best targeted and allocated  Consumers expect the FDA to be able to assure that the food on their plates is safe  said Chris Waldrop  Director of the Food Policy Institute at Consumer Federation of America  Without adequate resources  the FDA is unable to meet those expectations  and consumers are put at unnecessary risk  We urge Congress and the Administration to significantly increase the FDAs funding so that it has the resources it needs to protect our food supply  The proposed increase that we seek will assist the FDA in developing new strategies  as well as continue important work in the areas of regulatory enforcement  monitoring and inspection  international harmonization  science based oversight  foreign food safety assessments and technical assistance  and trade  said American Frozen Food Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Leslie G  Sarasin  These efforts are intended to enable the agency to remain an effective force in resolving issues bearing on the safety  quality  and labeling of foods and other products   Additional Information  About GMA The Grocery Manufacturers Association  GMA  represents the worlds leading food  beverage and consumer products companies  The
