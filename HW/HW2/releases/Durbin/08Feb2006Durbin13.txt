     DURBIN MEETS WITH ENERGY SECRETARY BODMAN TO PUSH ILLINOIS LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY INNOVATION

WITH ENERGY SECRETARY BODMAN TO PUSH ILLINOIS LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY INNOVATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wednesday  February 8  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to discuss issues important to the State of Illinois   At the meeting  Durbin advocated bringing the FutureGen project to Southern Illinois  discussed the long term benefits of stockpiling gasoline reserves  and the future of the Rare Isotope Accelerator  RIA  research facility       FutureGen is a  1 billion government industry project which will produce the first emissions free coal generation plant of its kind   The Department of Energy will develop a short list of the most qualified states by mid 2006  and make a final site selection in mid to late 2007        FutureGen is the number one federal energy project for downstate Illinois  an area that has the coal and the commitment needed to make it a reality     said Durbin    Finding cleaner ways to generate power using coal will help ensure our country   s energy security   I have been working closely with Senator Obama and Representative Costello to bring this project to Illinois   I was pleased to see significant funds allocated for the project in this year   s budget proposal          This week  the President   s budget made a commitment of  54 million for FutureGen   An additional  200 million will become available on October 1  2007 to support continued funding   Non Federal sources will be required to match funds for initial planning and research at least 20 percent       Illinois has almost one eighth of the coal reserves in the United States and one quarter of the nation   s bituminous coal reserves   The Illinois coal industry produces approximately 35 million tons of coal and generates more than  1 billion in gross revenues   Currently  recoverable coal reserves in the state of Illinois amount to more than 30 billion tons   The valuable mineral underlies 65 percent of the state   s surface       Durbin noted that Illinois geology is also well suited for the carbon trapping technology that the FutureGen project would need to develop   Illinois is home to oil and gas reserves and deep saline aquifers that can capture and sequester carbon dioxide       In addition  Southern Illinois University operates its Coal Research Center in Carbondale  one of the top in the country   which conducts a wide range of studies that deal with the commercial development of coal   The center   s work includes improvements of coal cleaning processes  the reduction of air pollution from coal fired power plants  the reduction of solid waste residues from coal burning  and the development of products from those residues       In early December of 2005  Secretary Bodman announced that the Department of Energy would be moving forward with the project  after signing an agreement with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance  a group of coal and energy companies with investment commitments to the project   The FutureGen Initiative was initially announced by President Bush in February 2003   Over the next year  site selection  design activities  and environmental analyses will lay the groundwork for final project design  construction  and operation       In today   s meeting  Durbin also strongly urged Bodman to consider taking steps to create a stockpile of gasoline reserves          Over the past year  the United States has imported record levels of refined fuel products     Durbin noted      While the availability of refined products from foreign nations has helped to ease the impact of fuel shortages in the United States  relying on the resources held by foreign nations in the future compromises our national and energy security          Durbin authored the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of 2005  S 1794  in response to fuel shortages caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The bill will require the Department of Energy to hold and manage 40 million barrels of unleaded gasoline and 7 5 million barrels of jet fuel to be used in times of shortages that adversely impact the U S  economy          With an open dialogue between the Administration  Congress and industry representatives  we can create the appropriate infrastructure and supplies to ensure stability in our fuel market     Durbin concluded       In today   s meeting  Durbin also stressed the importance of funding the Rare Isotope Accelerator  RIA   a  1 billion research facility   Durbin expressed serious concern that the Administration has yet to provide funds to move forward with the RIA site selection process  for which Argonne is a potential recipient          The Rare Isotope Accelerator belongs at Argonne     Durbin said      Argonne has already built a major isotope accelerator and is the only facility in America with the experience  infrastructure and management already in place to get this project up and running   I look forward to working with the members of the Illinois delegation and the Administration on fully funding this important project
