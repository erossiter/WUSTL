     Durbin Calls for Food Safety Improvements in Wake of Recent Recalls

Food Safety Improvements in Wake of Recent Recalls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Monday  July 2  2007   JOLIET  IL   With July 4th barbeques around the corner  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  visited the Joliet Junior College Culinary Arts Program to discuss his legislative proposal to strengthen the nations food safety system  The federal agencies charged with safeguarding the U S  food supply have come under fire recently in the wake of nationwide recalls and quarantines of tainted pork  spinach  peanut butter and pet food  The product recalls that we have seen in the past few months  first with pet food and then with food intended for human consumption  have shown us that food borne illness is a real threat in this country  Durbin said  Durbin also wants to hold the Chinese government and their exporters accountable for sending contaminated products into the U S  for sale  In the last several months contaminated toothpaste  vitamin c  monkfish  and pet food have been discovered  Made in China is rapidly becoming a warning label for American consumers  said Durbin  We need something better than a food safety system that operates on a case by case basis  We need to hold the Chinese government and their exporters accountable for sending contaminated products to the U S  Durbin said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimate that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized  and more than 5 000 will die  Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to food borne pathogens  With emerging pathogens  a population at high risk for food borne illnesses and an increasing volume of food imports  this situation is unlikely to improve without decisive action  Durbin said  Durbin has been pushing since 1997 for a single food safety agency with the authority to protect the food supply based on sound scientific principles  Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety  With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues  For example  processed food facilities may be inspected by the FDA once every five or six years  while meat and poultry operations are inspected daily by USDA  The recent contaminations point to serious  but correctable  weaknesses in our food safety system Durbin said  Quick action is needed at the federal level  Today  we have 12 different federal agencies stumbling over each other to ensure the safety of our food supply  Turf battles  overlap and inconsistencies are inevitable  Durbins legislation  the Safe Food Act  is designed to ensure the safety of our nations food supply by making one federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring and would  Require food producers to code their products so that those products can be quickly traced in the event of a food borne illness outbreak Require that food processing plants have procedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination Require regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk Give the FDA recall authority  If the food safety system is centralized in one agency  the FDA   the agency could quickly respond to an outbreak  The Senate unanimously approved a Durbin amendment in May to give the FDA the following new responsibilities  Establishing an early warning and notification system for human food as well as pet food products  The legislation directs the FDA to work with professional organizations  veterinarians  and others to disseminate information about pet food contamination and in cases of both pet and human food  to keep up to date  comprehensive  searchable recall lists on their website  Improving FDA s ability to detect problems  and alert consumers of contaminants by creating an adulterated food registry for imported and domestically produced food  The amendment requires the FDA to establish a registry to collect information on cases of potentially dangerous food adulteration to improve risk based surveillance of food safety and improve the speed at which consumers and firms are notified  Importers and domestic processors and manufactures of food would have to submit information pertaining to actual or suspected adulteration of food  The submission would be made to the FDA for inclusion in a centralized database through an electronic portal  The sources of the recent human and pet food contamination were wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that originated in China  Neither shipment was inspected by FDA  in fact  FDA inspects fewer than 1 5  of imports  A database would give FDA better information on which to base inspections  Requiring companies to maintain records and make them accessible to FDA as part of an investigation  This provision would prevent delays that could keep contaminations from being traced as quickly as possible  In the case of the recalled peanut butter this past winter  an FDA report showed that inspectors were denied documents when they requested them  The bill would clarify that when FDA conducts inspections  it will have timely access to those documents needed to safeguard the food supply  Establishing uniform federal standards and better labeling of pet food  The guidances and practices that today govern the pet food industry are implemented on a voluntary basis by manufacturers and state departments of agriculture  However  there is no requirement for states to adopt these practices and they dont have the force of federal guidelines  Inspections are not coordinated state to state and some states have different standards than others
