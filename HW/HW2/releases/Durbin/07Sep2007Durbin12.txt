     Durbin s Remarks to the Center for National Policy   No More Blank Checks for Iraq

to the Center for National Policy   No More Blank Checks for Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Friday  September 7  2007  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  delivered the following remarks to the Center for National Policy in Washington  D C   on Friday  September 7  2007   No More Blank Checks for Iraq   I want to thank CNP President Tim Roemer for that generous introduction  I also want to thank Tim  and CNP executive director Joy Drucker  for inviting me to join you today    I understand that CNP Chairman Peter Kovler is out of town  Not only is Peter a great chairman  he is also a friend  a University of Chicago graduate  and a member  with me  of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission     The Center for National Policy is a true national security asset     CNP provides something vital  a forum for searching  honest  bipartisan discussions about how to make America  and the world safer  And I am honored to be here    Four days from today will mark the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on America     Those attacks left deep wounds on America  We are especially aware of the pain and the loss at this time every year    I want to thank Tim Roemer for the extraordinary work he and all of the members of the bipartisan 9 11 Commission did to help us understand how 9 11 happened  and how to prevent the next attack    There would never have been a 9 11 Commission were it not for the courage and persistence of the families who lost loved ones on that day    It took too long  and an election  to do it  but Congress finally passed most of the Commissions remaining recommendations at the end of July     I understand that some members of 9 11 families may be here today  I believe I speak for all Americans when I say  Thank you for insisting on answers  and action  from your government    Two different wars   America today is engaged in two wars that we almost certainly would not be fighting had we not been attacked on September 11    The war in Afghanistan  which I voted for  was a necessary response to 9 11 and it was supported by nearly every nation on Earth    The war in Iraq is  tragically  a very different war  A mistaken war  sold with fear and misleading and manipulated intelligence that has taken the lives of 3 760 of our troops and more than 27 000 of Americas sons and daughters maimed and wounded  with broken bodies and shattered spirits  and killed tens of thousands  maybe hundreds of thousands    of innocent Iraqi men  women and children   President Bush 19 months ago  A clear strategy for victory in Iraq   Nineteen months ago  in this very same room  President Bush declared  We are carrying out a clear strategy for victory in Iraq    The President assured Americans that quote  The Iraqis are forming a unity government  instead of giving into disunity  instead of fighting the civil war the terrorists hoped to foment   And the success of democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan is inspiring calls for changes across the region    Since President Bush spoke those words  1 500 US troops have died in Iraq  over 10 000 more of our troops have been injured  and Iraq has descended into ever more chaos and carnage   Bush Petraeus report   Now  despite the growing list of independent reports and military experts who say he is dead wrong  President Bush is preparing to tell the nation  once again  that his strategy in Iraq is succeeding    We know what the Bush Petraeus report will say  The surge is working  Be patient   The surge is not working   The reality is  Despite heroic efforts by US troops  the Bush surge is not working     The surge has stretched our military to the breaking point  yet violence in Iraq has increased  and political progress in Iraq has come to a standstill    Tragically  Iraqis are failing to use the breathing space created with the lives of our sons and daughters to work for reconciliation and lasting security    Three weeks ago  I traveled to Iraq  Afghanistan  Pakistan  Kuwait and Jordan  Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania joined me in Iraq  It was my third visit to Iraq since the invasion in 2003    We met with General Petraeus  General Ray Odierno  and Ambassador Ryan Crocker  We also talked with  and listened to  soldiers and Marines on the front lines of this war    More than on either of my earlier visits  I feel overwhelmed by the tragedy we have created  for Iraq  for its neighbors  for Americas image around the world  and for our troops    I used to think this war was our worst foreign policy mistake in a generation  Now I think it is our worst foreign policy mistake ever    Saddam Hussein was a tyrant  but his aggression was contained  The Iraqi people suffered under his rule  but their suffering today is quantitatively greater    Our invasion has created a backlash against America around the world  Our nations ability to fight the spread of religious extremism and to engage other nations in positive diplomacy have been compromised by this colossal blunder    By carefully manipulating the statistics  the Bush Petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in Iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working    Even if the figures were right  the conclusion is wrong    Remember  When he announced in January that he intended to send almost 30 000 more troops to Iraq  the President said the surge would give Iraqis the security and breathing space to make political progress  to build a sustainable government and provide for their own security     Since then  over 700 American troops have been killed in Iraq and more than 4 000 have been injured     Our troops are sacrificing  and fighting  and dying in support of his surge    but the progress the President promised is not happening    This has been the deadliest year yet for US forces in Iraq  From January 1st through the end of August  739 US troops have died    significantly more than in that same time period in any year since the war started    The new National Intelligence Estimate released two weeks ago warns that  quote  The level of overall violence remains high  Iraqs sectarian groups remain unreconciled  and to date Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively    The independent report released this week by the Government Accountability Office concludes that the Bush strategy has failed to achieve 15 of the 18 goals set for it  The Jones Commission report by retired generals  released yesterday  cautions that Iraq s national police force is fragile  ill equipped and infiltrated by militia forces and recommends scrapping the entire force and starting over  Instead of progress toward political reconciliation  as the President promised  Iraq is now besieged by civil wars within a civil war    Two million Iraqis have been driven from their homes  the victims of violence and ethnic cleansing  and are displaced within Iraq  Another 2 million have fled  mostly to neighboring countries  And the US has done little to help these new refugees  even those who worked for the US effort in Iraq     Day to day living for many Iraqis has become unbearably grim  In addition to the near constant threat of violence  poverty is rampant  One in three Iraqis is hungry and relies on international relief agencies for basic survival  And the nations health care system has been all but destroyed  Our military is at the breaking point   The surge has stretched our military to its limits    Colin Powell warns that the Army is  quote  about broken    Most Army brigades have completed two or three tours in Iraq or Afghanistan    Last year the Pentagon released a study showing that one third of soldiers and Marines returning from combat in Iraq or Afghanistan reported mental health problems    Active duty soldiers committed suicide last year at the highest rate since Vietnam    The divorce rate among Army personnel doubled between 2001 and 2004  Among Army officers  the divorce rate tripled    Officers educated at West Point are leaving at a rate not seen in 30 years  Last year  more than one third of the West Point class of 2000 left the Army after their initial five year commitment  One result  the Army now has a shortfall of 3 000 commissioned officers   and the problem is expected to get worse    And its not just the soldiers that are worn out  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have destroyed or seriously damaged 40 percent of the Armys equipment    If he has his way  this President will leave office with an American military severely compromised by his mishandling of this war   15 month deployments are too long   An officer in Iraq told me that the 15 month deployments needed to support the Bush surge are just too long    He said that by the end of 12 months in Iraq  his soldiers are like zombies going through the motions    And the 12 months between deployments is only half of what they really need to reconstitute their units  rest them  train them and give them a chance to keep their families together     The Army Secretary  General Pete Geren  has said  quote  Fifteen months is asking more than we want to ask of our soldiers and their families in the long run   Why dont you tell the truth  This army is exhausted   Last month  the London Observer ran a story with the headline  Fatigue cripples US army in Iraq  It describes American soldiers in Iraq getting by on Red Bull and three hours of sleep a night     In Mosul  a chaplain s assistant who has come to bless a patrol asks the reporter  Why don t you tell the truth  Why don t you journalists write that this army is exhausted    Does this mean were here another five years    I saw that exhaustion in the soldiers I met last month in Iraq    Flying into Baghdad in a C 130  I sat next to a two soldiers in their early 20s who were returning from RR    One of the soldiers opened a copy of Stars and Stripes  pointed to a headline announcing that Congress had just passed a  400 billion defense budget  and asked  Does this mean were going to be here another five years    I tried to explain the confusing funding process in Congress and told him the Iraq debate would start again in September     The other soldier wanted to know if we were going to vote to bring the soldiers home     I replied that many of us believe our troops have accomplished their mission and now we need a new strategy in Iraq  But we only have four Republican senators siding with us so far  and we need seven more    The solider then asked this question  Would those senators voting for the war consider living a soldiers life for one day    If they did  he said  they would realize what a mistake this war is    Later  that soldier told me his job  He spots and detonates roadside bombs before they kill his fellow soldiers   No More Blank Checks For Iraq War   I voted against this war in the beginning  one of only 23 Senators to vote no on the original war authorization  because I believed the Bush Administration had failed to make its case for war with Iraq    I have never for one minute doubted or regretted that vote    But I have grown increasingly troubled by the votes I have had to cast since then on whether to continue to fund this war     My concerns have deepened as this President has repeatedly ignored the advice of military experts  as the costs of the war  in lives and dollars  has grown  and the war itself has deteriorated from a mistake  to a disaster  to a catastrophe    With each war funding vote  I have asked myself this question  What would I want Congress to do if it were my son or daughter riding through the streets of Baghdad  or Samarra  or Fallujuh    I have worked with others to try to change the Presidents strategy in Iraq  But when we could not gain the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster  I have voted to give our troops the support they need while they are in harms way    But this Congress must not give this President another blank check for his war in Iraq   Sen  Warner  each vote is a de facto re authorization   During the debate in July on the defense authorization bill  I asked Senator John Warner  one of the Senates defense experts  whether he believed that the conditions in the original Iraq war resolution still exist    Senator Warner replied that  no    Saddam Hussein was gone and other conditions cited in the war authorization had changed or proved to be non existent    He then added  however  that he believed every annual defense authorization vote is a de facto re authorization of the Presidents right to conduct this war as he chooses    It is clear the President believes this  too    After all of the catastrophic strategic mistakes this Administration  not our troops  but this Administration  has made in Iraq  we cannot allow the President to continue to dictate the course in Iraq  against the will of the American people and the advice of many of our best military leaders   We Need A Comprehensive Plan    We have a moral obligation  to our troops  to our own citizens  and to the people of Iraq  to face facts     The President says we need to give our troops enough time to complete their mission  The President needs to understand  Our troops completed their mission when they toppled Saddam Hussein     Our troops are the best in the world  But American military power cannot solve an Iraqi political crisis   We need a comprehensive  responsible new plan to improve security in Iraq so that we can begin to bring our troops home and re focus on al Qaeda and the threat of global terrorism    the real and urgent threat to our national security   A new mission for US troops in Iraq   The Constitution gives Congress a means to force the President to change course  the power of the purse  For the sake of our long term national security interests  Congress should use that authority now    I believe Congress should tie future funding for the war in Iraq to a new role for our troops there    US troops remaining in Iraq beyond that date will be limited to three specific and essential functions   protecting US and coalition troops and assets  conducting and supporting counter terrorism operations  and training Iraqi security forces so that they can take responsibility for defending their own nation    Diplomacy surge and special envoys   In addition  what is needed nowand what this Administration has neglected  is a surge in diplomacy to bring leaders in Iraq  and neighboring nations  together in search of a political settlement in Iraq    Regrettably  the Bush Administration has damaged its credibility in the region too severely to fulfill this critical assignment  Key leaders in Iraq  such as the Grand Ayatollah Sistani  will not speak to this Administration    For that reason  I urge President Bush to appoint a bipartisan team of U S  envoys to immediately begin diplomatic efforts at bringing about a political settlement in Iraq     These envoys must have the autonomy and authority to meet with any and all leaders in Iraq and the region who are critical to hammering out an agreement    These envoys should be senior statesmen or women with serious experience in international affairs and a history of tough  successful negotiation    I can think of few better statesmen for this difficult and essential mission than former National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scrowcroft    Americas experience brokering the Dayton Accords  which helped bring to an end a brutal ethnic conflict in Bosnia  is proof that conflict based on bitter and ancient rivalries can be ended when there is a serious  sustained diplomatic initiative    But drop in visits or phone calls are not enough to engage Iraqi and regional players in a serious long term political negotiation     It is past time for the US to begin such an intense initiative in Iraq  The longer we delay making these essential changes  the worse the outcome is likely to be   Ease the refugee crisis   There is another urgent need that demands our attention  and that is the Iraqi refugee crisis that is now threatening to overwhelm Iraqs neighbors  and could further de stabilize the entire region    Think about these numbers  Jordan  Iraqs neighbor  has taken in an estimated 700 000 Iraqi refugees    10 percent of Jordans entire population  in the last two years     That would be the equivalent  in this country  of 30 million refugees  Think about the political debate were having in this country over 12 million undocumented workers over a generation  Imagine 30 million new immigrants in two years     In Jordan  the cost of living has doubled for all residents  Water  which was scarce in Jordan before the refugee crisis  is now in critically short supply    Syria  another neighbor  has taken in more than 1 million Iraqi refugees  It is also experiencing wrenching social and economic upheavals as a result    The refugee crisis is one of the many tragic consequences of a war we started  That gives us a moral obligation to help solve it  We have a special obligation to help Iraqis who risked their lives to help our efforts and are now targeted for retaliation and death because of it  Two months ago  Ambassador Ryan Crocker sent an urgent cable to Washington pleading that the US admit Iraqis who have worked in our embassy and are now targeted by extremists with retaliation or execution as a result     Yet  to date  the US has taken in only a little more than 700 Iraqi refugees  1 percent of the refugees taken in by tiny  poor Jordan    How can any American face that fact without profound embarrassment    We should ensure that adequate funding is available to ease the refugee crisis that is overwhelming Iraq and its neighbors     Many Iraqi refugees have exhausted their life savings  Some have turned in desperation to begging  and even prostitution  to survive    Frankly  it is shameful that the wealthiest nation in the world has done so little  so far  to ease the Iraqi refugee crisis  a crisis that exists in part because of this Administrations failures    I am working in the Senate to increase US commitments to migration and refugee assistance as well  and to help Jordan deal with the crushing costs of trying to house  feed and educate so many refugees    In addition  I support and Congress should pass the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act  sponsored by Senator Kennedy    Most importantly  the White House must show leadership in this mounting humanitarian crisis    Doing our part to solve the Iraq refugee is not only the moral course  It is in our national interest  Refugee children are prime candidates for recruitment by extremists  And abandoning people who trusted us with their lives makes it far less likely that others will take that risk in the future  when we need them   Re focus on the global terrorism threat and save Afghanistan   Finally  we must find a responsible path out of the Iraq quagmire so that we can refocus on capturing Osama Bin Laden and defeating the threat of global terrorism    As part of that effort  the US must work intensively to strengthen our essential bonds with our allies  We cannot fight a global war without a global partnership    We should work to reclaim our role as a moral leader in the world by clearly and unequivocally renouncing torture  and closing Guantanamo and black site secret prisons  These steps will do much to ease the current strain between the US and many of our closest allies   Lastly  we must preserve the victory over the Taliban and extremism in Afghanistan    That victory  paid for in part with the blood of American troops  is fragile and uncertain today    The Taliban and Al Qaeda  the murderous thugs who attacked our nation    are regrouping along the Pakistan Afghan border     An NIE report last year warns that al Qaeda is stronger now than any time since September 11    Afghanistans record poppy crop is flooding the world market with cheap opium and heroin  and providing the terrorists and the Afghan warlords with a steady source of income    Yet  six years after routing the Taliban  we have only a handful of US agricultural experts in a nation in which 80 percent of the economy is agriculture    In the Khowst area where I visited  on Afghanistans eastern border with Pakistan  fewer than 10 civilian experts have been sent by the US to help with basic rebuilding tasks such as agriculture  health care  police training  democratic governance  and rule of law  The area needs at least 10 times that number of rebuilding advisors    Military leaders report that they  too  have rarely  if ever  received the support and numbers they need to accomplish their mission     Think about that  In the land that sheltered Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban  our troops are fighting and dying  But the Administration is failing to provide the resources and focus the people need to build a more secure future    General James Jones  former commandant of the US Marine Corps  and former NATO supreme commander  is exactly right when he warns that the consequences of failure may be even greater in Afghanistan than in Iraq    In General Jones words  Symbolically   Afghanistan  is more the epicenter of terrorism than Iraq  If we dont succeed in Afghanistan  you re sending a very clear message to the terrorist organizations that the U S   the U N  and the 37 countries with troops on the ground can be defeated  A message that terrorism can defeat the entire civilized world    We cannot allow that message to take hold    As we approach the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on our nation  in honor of those who died on 9 11 and those they have left behind  and in tribute to all of the more than 1 million Americans who have served and sacrificed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  we must  must  hold this hard won ground against terrorism   Conclusion   It is regrettable that the White House has apparently chosen September 11 to release the Bush Petraeus report  President Bush acknowledged long ago that Iraq has nothing to do with 9 11    September 11th should be a day to try to unite Americans  not divide us    September 11th should also be a day to recall clearly the true nature of those who attacked us  and the threat that still faces us    Iraq was not the front line in the war on terror  Iraq has been a diversion in our most urgent national security challenge    Misled with faulty information  we lost our focus in the fight against global terrorism  But we have not lost our courage  nor our ability to conquer any challenge when we are united    We remember the shock and pain of September 11th  But we also remember how the world came together to support America on September 12th    By changing our course in Iraq and renewing our commitment to active  positive cooperation with other nations  we can    and we will    make America  and the world  safer for all of us    Thank you  and thanks to CNP for this opportunity to speak to you today
