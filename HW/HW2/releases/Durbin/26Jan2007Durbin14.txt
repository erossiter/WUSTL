26  2007    ROCK ISLAND  IL      With highway congestion increasing each year  gas prices and consumer demand remaining high  now is the time to bring Amtrak to the north central and northwest region of Illinois  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said today       Durbin invited Amtrak Senior Director of Government Affairs Ray Lang to the Quad Cities area to discuss bringing Amtrak   s passenger rail service to Northwest Illinois   The Senator assembled a group of officials from Rock Island  Henry  Bureau  Whiteside  Mercer  Stark and Knox counties to make the case directly to Amtrak   s top leadership       Durbin said all three state Amtrak routes     from Chicago to Carbondale  St  Louis  and Quincy     have shown a double digit increase in recent years      The growth in ridership on Illinois    Amtrak corridors shows that Illinois residents are looking for a quick  cost effective  and reliable public ground transportation system   Amtrak provides just that to 30 communities and 3 million people in Illinois   We need to add the communities in northwest and north central Illinois to that list          The Quad Cities is roughly a one hour drive to the nearest Amtrak line  the    Zephyr     which runs from Chicago to Quincy   Currently  Quad Cities area residents can take a shuttle bus to Galesburg to catch the Zephyr   The area has been without intercity passenger rail service since the Rock Island Railroad   s    Rocket    line that ran from the Quad Cities to Chicago ceased operating in 1978   The    Rocket    was not a part of the Amtrak system       New Amtrak service to the Quad Cities would have multiple benefits   Residents from the Quad Cities and Chicago would be able to travel between each region and points in between for recreation  school  and work opportunities   In addition  new Amtrak service to the Quad Cities would take cars off of I 80 and other Illinois highways   This would reduce traffic congestion  gasoline consumption and carbon dioxide emissions          Extending Amtrak service to the Quad Cities makes sense on many levels     said Durbin     and I look forward to working with Amtrak and government officials in Illinois and Iowa in taking the first few steps of what I hope will be a process that will bring Amtrak to the Quad Cities and other regions of Illinois        Last week  Durbin introduced The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues  The legislation would reauthorize Amtrak funding for 2007 through 2012          We are introducing a reauthorization bill for one of the most valuable transportation programs for Illinois and the nation     said Durbin   It   s now up to us  as lawmakers  to pass this reauthorization measure and subsequent appropriations bills to provide Amtrak with sufficient funds to keep things on track          Earlier this month  Durbin spoke with Amtrak President and CEO Alex Kummant about funding for the three Illinois intrastate lines  as well as initiatives to fund new lines in the Quad Cities  Rockford and Peoria       Durbin recently helped secure a commitment from Amtrak to supply four new trains for additional round   trip service on the three Illinois routes  The 2007 Illinois budget committed to finance the service for these trains by doubling their Amtrak funding to  24 3 million  As a result of this state and federal cooperation  new service on the Carbondale  Quincy and St  Louis lines began in October  2006          The  24 million commitment from the State of Illinois and four new train sets from Amtrak late last year have put Illinois Amtrak expansion on the right track     said Durbin      It   s time to take advantage of this momentum  get the Quad Cities on board and bring Amtrak to the table   The Quad Cities and their residents deserve to have convenient and affordable access to the city of Chicago and the nationwide Amtrak network          Durbin noted that Illinois benefits  both directly and indirectly  from Amtrak jobs and service  An average of 48 Amtrak trains run each day on more than 1 000 miles of track in Illinois  Amtrak employs more than 2 000 Illinois residents and annually spends  56 million for goods and services in the state  Illinois is the central rail hub of the North American continent  bringing 2 5 million passengers through Amtrak   s Midwestern hub in Chicago each year       Durbin is a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee
