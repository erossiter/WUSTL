June 26  2007   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to U S  Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh calling on him to recuse himself from all cases involving the treatment of enemy combatants  Durbin also asked Judge Kavanaugh to explain discrepancies between testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee and recent news accounts of his role in developing rules governing the treatment of detainees   Revelations in yesterdays Washington Post strongly indicate that Mr  Kavanaughs testimony on May 9  2006 before the Senate Judiciary Committee that I was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants was misleading   In the letter he sent to Kavanaugh today  Durbin wrote  In light of the Washington Post and National Public Radio reports  your sworn testimony appears inaccurate and misleading  You participated in a critical meeting in which the Administration made a decision on whether to extend access to counsel to detainees  an issue that is clearly a rule governing detention of combatants  By testifying under oath that you were not involved in this issue  it appears that you misled me  the Senate Judiciary Committee  and the nation   Therefore  I request that you provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with an explanation for this apparent contradiction  In addition  I request that you disqualify yourself in all pending and subsequent cases involving detainees and enemy combatants  Your lack of candor at your nomination hearing suggests you cannot approach these cases with impartiality and an open mind   Kavanaugh was confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit on May 26  2006 by a vote of 57 36  Kavanaugh was controversial because he had spent his legal career as a political foot soldier for the Bush Administration and Republican Party  He never had a jury trial or bench trial before becoming a judge and had less experience than any judge ever nominated to the D C  Circuit during its 113 year history other than Ken Starr  Durbin opposed his nomination   The D C  Circuit is the most important federal court in the U S  after the Supreme Court  Under the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act  the D C  Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over detainee and torture litigation    Text of the letter appears below    June 26  2007 Hon  Brett M  Kavanaugh U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 5423 E  Barrett Prettman U S  Courthouse 333 Constitution Ave   N W  Washington  D C  20001 Dear Judge Kavanaugh  Yesterday the Washington Post published a lengthy article about Vice President Cheneys role in the policymaking process of the Bush Administration  In this article  you are reported to have participated in a heated White House meeting in 2002 about whether U S  citizens who had been declared enemy combatants should be given access to lawyers  The information in this article was confirmed today by a report on National Public Radio  These reports appear to contradict sworn testimony you gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 9  2006 at your nomination hearing  At that hearing  I asked you about the role you played  as one of the Presidents top White House lawyers  in the selection of William Haynes  a controversial nominee to the U S  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and proponent of permissive policies with regard to torture  I asked  What did you know about Mr  Hayness role in crafting the Adminstrations detention and interrogation policies  You testified  Senator  I did not  I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants  and so I do not have the involvement with that  In light of the Washington Post and National Public Radio reports  your sworn testimony appears inaccurate and misleading  You participated in a critical meeting in which the Administration made a decision on whether to extend access to counsel to detainees  an issue that is clearly a rule governing detention of combatants  By testifying under oath that you were not involved in this issue  it appears that you misled me  the Senate Judiciary Committee  and the nation  Therefore  I request that you provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with an explanation for this apparent contradiction  In addition  I request that you disqualify yourself in all pending and subsequent cases involving detainees and enemy combatants  Your lack of candor at your nomination hearing suggests you cannot approach these cases with impartiality and an open mind  The federal judicial recusal statute  28 U S C  455  sets forth numerous conditions in which a federal judge must seek recusal  One of these conditions appears to apply to you  It states that a federal judge should disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned  The court on which you serve  the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  has exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases under the Detainee Treatment Act and Military Commissions Act  I hope you will recuse yourself in cases involving these and other statutes that come before you during your service on this court  Please respond to this letter at your earliest convenience  Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin United States Senator
