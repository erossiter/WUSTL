                                                                                                                                                                                                      5

LIPINSKI  DAVIS  DURBIN MARK MEDICARE Rx DEADLINE FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS  CALL ON CONGRESS TO PASS MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SAVINGS AND CHOICE ACT   Monday  May 15  2006   CHICAGO  IL   Today marks the deadline for Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the Administration   s Medicare prescription drug benefit without being penalized   Senator Dick Durbin  and Representatives Rahm Emanuel  Jan Schakowsky  Danny Davis  Dan Lipinski  and seniors and advocates held a press conference to discuss ways to improve the prescription drug benefit so that both seniors and taxpayers receive a fair deal          Today marks the official deadline for enrollment into the Bush Administration   s Medicare Prescription drug plan  yet millions of beneficiaries have not yet enrolled   And as a result  millions of seniors will be needlessly taxed for a benefit plan that seems to only benefits drug companies and HMOs     said Emanuel     As the deadline comes and goes  it is now more important than ever that we improve the program   We must allow Medicare to directly negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices  saving billions for seniors and taxpayers             Because President Bush and Congressional Republicans stubbornly refused to extend the arbitrary enrollment deadline  one million beneficiaries will be denied coverage this year and millions will have to pay financial penalties that will increase throughout their lifetimes   With a benefit that was constructed by and for the drug companies  all beneficiaries continue to pay unnecessarily high prices under their plans   We must now fix Part D by creating a uniform benefit that requires Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies for lower prices  like the VA does     said Schakowsky       This year  the House Government Reform Committee minority released a report showing that the drug prices offered by the 10 leading Medicare drug plans are  80  higher than the prices negotiated by the federal government  60  higher than prices in Canada  and 3  higher than at Costco   The Medicare Prescription Drugs Savings and Choice Act would lower those prices dramatically and pass the savings on to seniors          We can use good old fashioned negotiating power to achieve savings since the laws of economics say that if one buys in bulk  the price will come down     said Durbin      The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings Act would ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive the benefits of their purchasing power          The Medicare Prescription Drugs Savings and Choice Act  introduced by Representative Schakowsky and Senator Durbin would instruct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to offer a nationwide  Medicare administered  drug plan in addition to the plans being offered by the private insurers   The legislation would also require that HHS negotiate with the drug companies for lower prices  like the Veterans Administration does       For months  the members of the Chicago delegation called on the President to extend the Medicare deadline to give seniors and people with disabilities more time to navigate the confusing and chaotic program without having to face a financial penalty   Despite the Congressional Budget Office estimates that an extension would have allowed for an additional one million seniors to enroll  the Bush Administration refused          At the more than three dozen informational seminars I have held for seniors to help them with this program  my heart has gone out to all those who are understandably bewildered     Lipinski said      It is unconscionable that Congress and the Administration have refused to act to change this program or even to give Seniors the benefit of extra time to sign up without a penalty             Spin and hype aside the sign up process for Part D has been a disaster   It is time to step back  listen to what seniors are saying and revise the program to meet the real needs of retirees     said Davis
