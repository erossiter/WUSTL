TO RESTORE FUNDING FOR SUCCESSFUL FIRST RESPONDER PROGRAMS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  March 23  2006     IL  Homeland security begins with hometown security  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said today during a meeting with local fire and police chiefs   Durbin held the meeting to discuss several programs important to local first responders which did not fare well in the Presidents 2007 budget   The budget dramatically cut funding for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 78 percent  eliminated the The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  and deeply cut two programs to hire and train firefighters   The funding cuts will make it harder to equip and train local firefighters and police officers  said Durbin   Our first responders and emergency preparedness officials need to know that the Department of Homeland Security will provide them with the tools they need   Critical law enforcement programs funded by the Justice Department have suffered steep and steady declines since September 11  2001  said Durbin   We need to make a commitment to the communities that rely on federal support for their local law enforcement agencies and move the programs that have proven to be so valuable toward the top of our nations priority list   Firefighters  First Responders  The President s budget eliminates the SAFER firefighter hiring program  which provides funding to fire departments to hire additional firefighters and first responders   In Illinois  over  1 3 million was awarded to fire departments for hiring and recruiting additional firefighters in 2005   The Presidents budget also proposes to cut funding for the FIRE program nearly in half  reducing its budget from  545 million to  293 million   The FIRE program provides fire departments with vital equipment and training   In 2005  Illinois was awarded over  25 million for fire department equipment   Durbin noted that these programs are especially important to Illinois rural and volunteer fire departments   Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program  The JAG program was established two years ago by combining the Byrne Grant program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program   The Presidents budget eliminates this important program  which was budgeted at  327 million last year   Durbin expressed serious concern that the elimination of this program could significantly impact the ability of Illinois law enforcement to combat the states growing meth problem    The amount of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased nearly tenfold between 1997 and 2003    Ending the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funds would severely hamper regional methamphetamine task forces and several crime prevention programs  The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group pays almost half of its agents with funding from Byrne grants   Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS   The Presidents budget cuts funding for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 78 percent   Since COPS was created in 1994  the program has assisted Illinois law enforcement agencies in reducing violent crime by awarding the state more than  422 7 million in COPS grants for community policing efforts   These grants have funded 5 530 additional police officers and sheriffs deputies in Illinois  benefiting 682 local and state law enforcement agencies   In addition   22 million has been awarded to hire 182 school resource offices to improve safety for students  teachers and administrators in Illinois elementary and high schools   The program has also awarded  50 3 million to enhance crime fighting technologies   Durbin supported an amendment to the FY 2007 budget to provide interoperable communications equipment for first responders so that they can respond to natural disasters  terrorist attacks  and other public safety needs   The lack of interoperable communications for Americas first responders puts them and our communities at risk   Too many of our police  fire  emergency medical services and transportation officials can not communicate with each other  and our local departments are not able to link their communications with state and federal emergency response agencies   Durbin also supported an amendment that provided  2 8 billion more than the Budget Resolution included for first responder grants to states and localities to be used for hiring  equipping  and training first responders  as well as covering related overtime costs   Due to the repeated cuts to first responder programs over the last several years   1 6 billion is needed just to restore cuts to state homeland security formula grants  FIRE Act grants  SAFER grants  Emergency Management Performance Grants  EMPG   and the Metropolitan Medical Response teams  This funding would also restore severe cuts to the COPS grants program and fully fund Law Enforcement Terrorism Preparedness Program and Byrne formula grants   Beyond restoring the FY2007 cuts  the amendment increases funding for first responder preparedness by an additional  1 2 billion and EMPG grants by  46 million or 25  over last years appropriated level
