                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  November 1  2007     WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   a member of the Senate Impact Aid Coalition  today announced that the final version of the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education  LHHS  Appropriations bill will include a Durbin authored amendment to allow the five public schools serving the Great Lakes Naval Training Base to pool their students to maximize federal education assistance through the Impact Aid program  Senator Durbin notified the mayors school district officials and state legislators affected by this provision and asked them to urge swift enactment of the legislation  This change in the federal funding calculation will protect North Chicago schools from losing their heavily impacted status  Durbin said  And it will help to assure that the children of Navy families have the best educational opportunities  Many local school districts across the U S  serve students affiliated with military families and include federally owned land exempt from local taxes which fund public schools  These school districts face special challenges  they must provide a quality education to the children in the area and meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act  while often operating with less local revenue than is available to other school districts  Impact Aid supplements the cost of educating those students whose families are part of the U S  military  The Durbin provision will help bring the federal government closer to meeting an obligation it has failed for years  it s obligation to the children of members of our armed services  The federal government has never fully reimbursed schools for the cost of educating military affiliated children  and the children and school districts who educate them suffer  This includes the over 1 500 children of Great Lakes personnel who attend public schools in the area  We need to make sure that school districts have the funds they need to provide each student with a quality public education  said Durbin  Many local school districts across the U S  cover areas that include federally owned land exempt from local taxes which fund public schools  Impact Aid fills this gap in funding to make sure that no student is left behind  Senator Durbin has consistently supported higher funding for Impact Aid  Earlier this month  he met with representatives from the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools  NAFIS  in order to discuss the pressing need for increased Impact Aid in schools serving the Great Lakes Naval Base  Scott Air Force Base and other federal lands  Durbin and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  first introduced legislation to allow the five school districts serving the Great Lakes Naval Training Center to pool their students to maximize federal education assistance through the Impact Aid program  Todays legislation was approved by a joint House and Senate Conference Committee  Once it is approved by both the House and Senate  it will be delivered to the President for his signature  In addition to the Durbin provision  the LHHS Appropriations bill also includes a measure that increases Impact Aid funding nationwide by  20 million

_____________    I have good news to share  The final version of the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill will include my Senate amendment to allow the five public school systems serving the Great Lakes Naval Training Base to enter into a local compact for purposes of calculating Impact Aid subsidies for students from military affiliated families   This morning  the House and Senate Appropriations Committees completed their conference meetings on the FY 2008 spending bill for the Department of Education  The bill they have agreed upon will go the floor of the House and the Senate and then on to the White House  I am pleased to report the final package that will be delivered to the President includes the amendment that I secured during the Senate Committees work on the bill   Thank you for your patience and continued support throughout this two year effort  This change in the federal funding calculation will protect North Chicago schools from losing their heavily impacted status and provide the surrounding school districts with increased funding to support the additional military affiliated children they will be educating   I hope the President will sign this important legislation and this critical provision into law and have made my views known to the White House  I encourage you to contact Congressman Kirk  who is supportive of this provision  and ask him to urge the President to enact this much needed Impact Aid fix for your communities and school districts   I look forward to working with you as we support the public schools in the Great Lakes community  Sincerely  Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
