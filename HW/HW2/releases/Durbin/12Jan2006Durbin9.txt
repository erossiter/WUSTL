     DURBIN STEPS UP CALL FOR REVIEW OF MINE SAFETY RECORDS

CALL FOR REVIEW OF MINE SAFETY RECORDS

January 12  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent letters to the U S  Secretary of Labor and the head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  asking them to look into two issues     the impact funding cuts for mine safety inspections have had on mine safety in Illinois and elsewhere  and a status report on safety conditions at all of Illinois    mines       In his letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao  Durbin wrote    I am greatly concerned that the oversight of coal mine safety in Illinois and across the nation has been compromised due to budget cuts which have reduced the number of safety inspectors at a time of burgeoning coal mining activity  I hope that your department plans to quickly address this issue for the benefit of coal miners in my state and across the nation       I respectfully request information as to why your department requested a decrease in funding for mine safety inspections  and what effect those cuts had on safety oversight  inspection frequency  and compliance in Illinois          Durbin said President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the five years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 130 mine inspectors since 2000       Earlier this week  Durbin wrote to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them to address safety conditions at the Viper Mine in Williamsville  Illinois which has been cited for 124 safety violations  42 of which carried a    significant and substantial    risk of death or injury  Durbin also sent a similar letter to the owners of the Viper Mine  the International Coal Group  ICG   ICG also owns the Sago Mine in Tallmansville  West Virginia where 12 miners lost their lives       In his letter to MSHA today  Durbin asked for a comprehensive review of all 18 underground and nine surface mines currently operating in Illinois  Durbin wrote     T he coal industry still remains a dangerous occupation in the new millennium   Since 1993  there have been 471 coal mining fatalities in 20 states  and the injury rate far exceeds that of most other industries      Your agency has been tasked with acting as the guardian of safety for America   s coal miners   I respectfully request that you provide me a safety status report on all of Illinois    mines   In addition  with new mines beginning operations in Illinois  please provide detailed information as to whether your agency has sufficient resources and inspectors with which to conduct proper oversight of all the mines in Illinois          On January 2  2006 an explosion trapped 13 men in a West Virginia coal mine resulting in the death of 12 of the 13 workers   Last year  the operators of that mine received 205 citations for health and safety violations  96 of which were    significant and substantial    according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration   In 2005 the mine was forced to halt operations 16 times after failing to comply with safety rules       The text of each letter appears below           January 12  2006   Elaine Chao  Secretary  U S  Department of Labor  Frances Perkins Building  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210   Dear Secretary Chao       I am writing to you regarding mine safety inspectors  I am concerned that budget cuts have resulted in an inadequate number of Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  inspectors       Funding for MSHA has been cut in the President s budget in four of the last five years   Due to these cuts  MSHA has witnessed a decrease of 170 staff positions since 2001  130 of which are mine inspectors   Meanwhile  the coal industry has undergone a recent resurgence  as the price of coal has risen from  30 to  57 per ton since 2003   Coal mining activity  consequently  has increased substantially   For example  in my home state of Illinois  three mines began new operations in 2005  and three new mines are scheduled to begin operations in 2006  bringing Illinois  total of active mines from 18 in 2004 to 24 by the end of 2006       I am greatly concerned that the oversight of coal mine safety in Illinois and across the nation has been compromised due to budget cuts which have reduced the number of safety inspectors at a time of burgeoning coal mining activity  I hope that your department plans to quickly address this issue for the benefit of coal miners in my state and across the nation   Safety oversight of coal mines in the form of increased inspectors and inspections is one of the greatest tools available to protect coal miners from injuries and fatalities       I respectfully request information as to why your department requested a decrease in funding for mine safety inspections  and what effect those cuts had on safety oversight  inspection frequency  and compliance in Illinois  In addition  please provide your department s plans for future funding of mine safety inspectors       I thank you for your time and attention to this issue  and I look forward to hearing from your department within the next month       Sincerely    Richard Durbin  United States Senator        January 12  2006   David G  Dye  Acting Administrator  Mine Safety and Health Administration  U S  Department of Labor  1100 Wilson Boulevard  21st Floor  Arlington  VA 22209 3939   Dear Administrator Dye       As a follow up to my letter of January 8th regarding the safety record of Viper Coal Mine in Williamson  Illinois  I am writing to you to determine the safety status of all of the coal mines currently operating in the state     It is my understanding that new mines will become operational in 2006  bringing the total number of mines in the state to 24  up from 18 in 2004       The coal industry is vital to the economy of the state of Illinois   In 2004  18 coal mines produced over 32 million tons of coal with just 3 252 employees   Compared to 1930  when 185 Illinois mines produced 52 million tons of coal with over 51 000 employees  it is clear that the 21st Century Illinois coal miner is extremely productive and highly skilled   However  the coal industry still remains a dangerous occupation in the new millennium   Since 1993  there have been 471 coal mining fatalities in 20 states  and the injury rate far exceeds that of most other industries   Clearly  the safety environment in which coal miners operates has not risen to the level of what most Americans would expect in the 21st Century       Your agency has been tasked with acting as the guardian of safety for America   s coal miners   I respectfully request that you provide me a safety status report on all of Illinois    mines   In addition  with new mines beginning operations in Illinois  please provide detailed information as to whether your agency has sufficient resources and inspectors with which to conduct proper oversight of all the mines in Illinois       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter   Please feel free to contact me or my office if I can be of any assistance  as I trust you will not hesitate to request sufficient resources with which to fulfill your oversight functions       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
