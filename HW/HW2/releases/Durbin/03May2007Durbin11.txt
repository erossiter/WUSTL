                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  May 3  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U  S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   and Thad Cochran  R MS  today introduced the Homeland Security Education Act to strengthen instruction in science  math  and foreign language in our nation s schools   Our security and economic future depends on the next generation of workers and their ability not just to keep up  but to innovate said Durbin   Science and technology are the engines of economic growth   We must invest in our students and our educational system by providing the training and resources needed in science  technology  engineering  mathematics  and foreign languages   America s workforce needs scientific and foreign language skills to adapt to the challenges of globalization and to counter the threats posed to our nation s security  said Akaka   We need to reinvigorate our educational system to ensure that tomorrow s workers can compete and succeed in a multi lingual and technologically complex environment   I thank Senator Durbin for his leadership in sponsoring this bill that will strengthen our economy and our security   I am proud to be a cosponsor   Cochran said  Addressing the need for a highly skilled workforce in math  science  and technology and combining those skills with foreign language and international cultural education will ensure that American students are qualified to advance research and economic development while preserving our nation s role as a world leader   Reports show that prior to 9 11  the Intelligence Community was not prepared to handle the challenge of translating the volumes of foreign language counter terrorism intelligence it had collected   The Intelligence Community faced backlogs in material awaiting translation  including papers providing details on foreign research and development in scientific or technical areas  a shortage of language specialists and language qualified field officers  and a readiness level of only 30 percent in the most critical foreign languages   The Homeland Security Education Act provides the framework to enhance our education system ensuring that our nation will have individuals possessing these critical skills in the future by   Awarding scholarships to students as an incentive for them to earn undergraduate degrees in science  technology  engineering  math and foreign language studies  Awarding scholarships to practicing scientists and engineers and those who are fluent in foreign languages to return to school to obtain their credentials for teaching in elementary or secondary schools  Encouraging public private partnerships to improve science and math curricula  upgrade laboratory facilities  provide scholarships for students to study math  science  or engineering at the university level  and establish internship and mentoring opportunities for students in grades K through 12  Developing cultural awareness and immersion programs in colleges and universities that combine science  technology  and engineering instruction with foreign language to expand international understanding and scientific collaboration  and Creating language learning pathways to facilitate proficiency in critical foreign languages from kindergarten through graduate school   The Homeland Security Education Act also establishes programs to increase the number of teachers in the fields of science  math  and foreign language through scholarships tied to service agreements and would improve foreign language teacher professional development through partnerships between local education agencies and institutions of higher education to hold summer workshops and provide distance learning   The Homeland Security Education Act builds on similar legislation introduced by Durbin and Akaka in both the 107th and 108th Congress   They were joined by Senator Cochran in the 109th Congress
