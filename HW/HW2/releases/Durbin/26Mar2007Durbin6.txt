March 26  2007   WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Representative Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today sent a letter to Andrew von Eschenbach  Commissioner of the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   asking for an analysis of FDA s oversight of pet food manufacturing facilities and a report of actions taken since the recent pet food recall        Many cats  dogs and other pets  considered members of the family are now suffering as a result of a flawed pet food inspection system   said Durbin    Congresswoman DeLauro and I have once again reached out to FDA to work on eliminating the vulnerabilities that are affecting food safety   Today we asked FDA to quickly provide us with a report of what FDA has done to address the recent recall  and what needs to be done to make real improvements to the system of overseeing pet food safety         Based on the evidence so far  it would appear that FDA is failing its responsibilities to protect animals from unsafe food as much as it is failing to protect American consumers   They have never visited the plant in Kansas being mentioned as a possible source of the contamination  and the last time FDA inspected the New Jersey plant that has also been implicated was in 2004   said DeLauro  Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture  FDA and related agencies    For the past decade  many of us who have examined our food safety system have pressed for a consolidated food safety agency   In light of recent events it looks like we will need to broaden that effort to include pet foods to ensure that all family members are protected from food borne illnesses        On March 17  2007  pet food producer Menu Foods  Inc  announced a recall of pet food products made at its Emporia  Kansas facility between December 3  2006 and March 6  2007   The recall was made in response to a recent string of kidney failures in cats and dogs as well as a handful of pet deaths   The reported number of pets affected has grown to nearly two dozen over the past several days       Since the recall  the FDA has been working with Menu Foods to investigate the source of any potential contamination   It is unclear whether or not there has been a contamination or what the source of the contamination may be   In samples of the recalled product  recent tests have confirmed the presence of rat poison  aminopterin  which in high doses can cause kidney failure       Text of the letter appears below         March 26  2007   The Honorable Andrew von Eschenbach  Commissioner  Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  Maryland 20857   Dear Dr  von Eschenbach    On March 17  2007  pet food producer Menu Foods  Inc  announced a recall of pet food products made at its Emporia  Kansas facility between December 3  2006 and March 6  2007   Since then  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has been working with Menu Foods  Inc  to support the recall and investigate the source of any potential contamination       Based on our understanding of the investigation thus far  neither FDA nor Menu Foods  Inc  has discovered whether or not there has been contamination or what the source of that contamination might be   Many reports suggest that a contaminated batch of wheat gluten may be the cause of a recent string of kidney failures in cats and dogs as well as a handful of pet deaths   Officials with the New York Department of Agriculture announced on Friday that they had identified the presence of aminopterin  a toxin found in rat poison  in samples of the recalled pet food       The recall of 60 million cans and pouches of pet food and the deaths that have been reported over the past several days have raised serious concerns among pet owners  veterinarians  and pet store owners about the safety and consistency of pet foods   Some media outlets have reported that the Emporia facility that is being investigated as the source of the contamination has never been inspected by the FDA       These reports that pet food manufacturing facilities are not being inspected by the FDA are very disconcerting   Many  cats  dogs  and other pets are considered members of the household and it is unfortunate that not even the family pet is immune from the food safety problems that are plaguing our country   It is our hope that the FDA is not ignoring this important area of responsibility       Within 15 days of receiving this letter  please respond to the following questions       1  What is the status of the current investigation       2  Please provide a detailed timeline  from the time when FDA first learned about potential contamination or the first illnesses were reported through the present time  that details the actions taken in response to the outbreak by local  state  and federal health officials       3  What is FDA s overall regulatory posture with respect to the pet food industry       4  How many inspections have been conducted at pet food processing facilities over the past three years and how many violations have been found   How frequently is each facility inspected       5  What changes in current law or funding levels are needed so that FDA can better regulate the pet food industry       Thank you very much for your prompt response to these questions       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator   Rosa L  DeLauro  Chairwoman  House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies
