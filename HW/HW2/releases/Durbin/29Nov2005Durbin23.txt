     DURBIN CALLS ON HHS TO WARN SENIORS ENROLLING IN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT ABOUT CHANGING DRUG PRICES

ON HHS TO WARN SENIORS ENROLLING IN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT ABOUT CHANGING DRUG PRICES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Tuesday  November 29  2005           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to post a warning to inform seniors that drug prices quoted on the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder website can change       In a letter to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt  Durbin urged the Secretary     t o place a prominent notice on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  website informing Medicare beneficiaries that the drug prices quoted on the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder can change            Durbin noted that a constituent who used the Plan Finder website saw the estimated annual cost of her prescription drug plan increase from  2 691 69 to  3 942 18 in less than two weeks          While millions of American seniors are busy trying to figure out which drug plan best meets their needs and fits within their budget  the drug prices are changing     Durbin continued       I have advised my constituents to take their time and study each plan carefully before making a decision   What I now realize is that the plan that is the best for them this week may not be the best plan next week   Yet they are being asked to lock in a decision for a year based on prices that could change tomorrow          Durbin asked     If seniors are locked into a plan for a year once a plan is chosen  why are insurance plans able to drastically change prices at their whim          Durbin called on the Secretary to remedy the situation  labeling it unacceptable      Seniors diligently compare plans and decide on the best plan now  unaware that they may be charged a different price in January  and possibly another price in February and another in March   This could deal a significant financial blow to seniors on a fixed income          The full text of the Durbin   s letter to Secretary Leavitt appears below           November 29  2005   The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Department of Health and Human Services  Hubert Humphrey Building  Room 416G  200 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt       I am writing to urge you to place a prominent notice on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  website informing Medicare beneficiaries that the drug prices quoted on the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder can change  and that seniors should not expect that the prices they find on the website will remain valid throughout the year  unless they choose a plan with co payments rather than coinsurance       While millions of American seniors are busy trying to figure out which drug plan best meets their needs and fits within their budget  the drug prices are changing    I have advised my constituents to take their time and study each plan carefully before making a decision   What I now realize is that the plan that is the best for them this week may not be the best plan next week   Yet they are being asked to lock in a decision for a year based on prices that could change tomorrow       One of my constituents called my office asking for assistance in choosing a plan   She is taking Arthrotec  Fosamax  K Tabs  Lasix  Prevacid  and Trental   The Plan Finder on November 17  2005 offered a list of appropriate prescription drug plans  including Medicare Rx Rewards Premier  which had an estimated annual cost of  2 691 69   My staff re checked the same drug list on the Plan Finder less than a week later  on November 22  2005  and found the same plan was then estimated to have an annual cost of  3 844 49     an increase of  1 152 80 from the week before   We checked the drug list again on November 28  2005 and this time  Medicare Rx Rewards Premier was estimated to have an annual cost of  3 942 18   an increase of more than  1 250 in the plan   s annual cost since the Plan Finder website was first consulted 11 days earlier       In another instance  my staff checked a Humana plan for a zip code in Hillsboro  IL at 3 10 p m  and again at 5 02 p m  on November 22  2005 and the estimated annual cost had decreased more than  70 in two hours   This fluctuation in the final cost is unexplainable  as all of the data provided for drug prices  deductibles  and monthly premium costs was the same in both instances   All of this data is attached for your review       A call to the Congressional Affairs office at CMS revealed that pricing data is entered into the Plan Finder on a weekly basis   If seniors are locked into a plan for a year once a plan is chosen  why are insurance plans able to drastically change prices at their whim       This situation is unacceptable   Seniors diligently compare plans and decide on the best plan now  unaware that they may be charged a different price in January  and possibly another price in February and another in March   This could deal a significant financial blow to seniors on a fixed income       The CMS website is currently doing a poor job of educating seniors on the possibility of price changes   The site says    costs will vary depending on which drug plan you choose     but nowhere does it point out that costs within a plan could change   Under the heading    How Much Will the Plans Cost     you should spell out clearly that prices could fluctuate  not simply describe the structure of the benefit as though prices will be static       I urge you to remedy this situation before the benefit begins so that seniors understand what they may be paying   I also urge you to take action to rein in this drug price variability within individual drug plans  or to explain to Congress why you are unable to do so and work with us to correct this flaw in the program       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senate
