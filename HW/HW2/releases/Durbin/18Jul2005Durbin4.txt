18  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today expressed their grave concern at U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  data revealing that at 103 Superfund sites nationwide     human exposure is currently not under control       Illinois is number one on the list  with 11 sites where people are at risk for exposure to hazardous contaminates       According to an official publication of the EPA    human exposure is currently not under control at the following Illinois sites      Parsons Casket Hardware Co   Belvedere De Pue New Jersey Zinc Mobil Chemical Corp   De Pue  Kerr McGee  Kress Creek West Branch of DuPage River  DuPage County  Jennison Wright Corportation  Granite City  Lenz Oil Service  Inc   Lemont  Ottawa Radiation Areas  Ottawa  Southeast Rockford Ground Water Contamination  Rockford  Beloit Corp   Rockton  Outboard Marine Corp   Waukegan  Kerr McGee  West Chicago  Residential Areas   Kerr McGee  West Chicago  Sewage Treatment Plant     Durbin and Obama also noted that at an additional 157 sites nationwide  EPA has determined there is not enough data to determine whether or not human exposure to toxic materials is under control  raising the number of sites where citizens are potentially at risk   An additional six Illinois sites are listed by EPA as having insufficient data to gauge risk of human exposure to toxins     Sangamo Electric Dump Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge  Carterville Amoco Chemicals  Joliet Landfill   Joliet Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Company  LaSalle Indian Refinery Texaco Lawrenceville  Lawrenceville Savanna Army Depot Activity  Savanna Yeoman Creek Landfill  Waukegan    In a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  Durbin and Obama outlined their concerns about the data          Available materials from EPA reveal there is insufficient information to determine the impact of the contaminates on the people exposed  or even how many people face dangerous exposure     Durbin and Obama wrote      While an advanced search of these sites reveals the location of schools  it does not identify the number of daycare facilities within proximity to the Superfund site  which would provide a more accurate assessment of how many children face exposure to hazardous contaminates at these sites   Additionally  EPA provides no information revealing or prioritizing which sites are the most harmful   and  little information concerning EPA   s plans to address  reduce and prevent future human exposure at these sites          In their letter to Administrator Johnson  Durbin and Obama requested that EPA take immediate steps to provide information on each of the 11 Illinois sites in which EPA has not reduced and controlled human exposure to hazardous materials   The senators requested that EPA conduct an analysis to report the exposure threat at each site and the people potentially at risk  evaluating which sites pose the greatest risk of human exposure   Durbin and Obama requested a detailed plan outlining how and when EPA plans to fully control human exposure at the listed sites       For the six additional Illinois sites without adequate data to determine whether or not human exposure is controlled  Durbin and Obama requested that the EPA report on what is needed to compile sufficient data to determine whether people are being exposed to hazardous materials at these sites          This matter is of great importance to the people of Illinois and the nation     Durbin and Obama wrote      We look forward to your timely and thorough response          The Bush Administration has refused to reauthorize Superfund  arguing cleanup should be paid for by the taxpayer  not the polluting industries   Because of this Bush policy  the cleanup of toxic waste sites around the country has slowed dramatically       Full text of Durbin and Obama   s letter appears below        July 14  2005      The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U  S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20460 0001   Dear Administrator Johnson       As the Senate considers the pending nominations of Marcus Peacock  Susan Bodine and Granta Nakayama  we wish to highlight an issue of grave concern regarding the Superfund program   Specifically  we are deeply troubled by data revealing that 103 superfund sites exist nationwide at which EPA has determined    human exposure is currently not under control      At an additional 157 sites  EPA has determined there is not enough data available to determine whether or not human exposure is currently controlled  so the number of sites where humans are in risk of exposure is potentially much higher than 103       We are most concerned that eleven of these sites are in our state of Illinois  placing Illinois at the top of the list with the most Superfund sites where EPA has failed to control human exposure to hazardous contaminants       Available materials from EPA reveal that there is insufficient information to determine the impact of the contaminants on the people exposed or even how many people face dangerous exposure   We are also troubled that while an advanced search of these sites reveals the location of schools  it does not identify the number of daycare facilities within proximity to the Superfund site  which would provide a more accurate assessment of how many children face exposure to hazardous contaminants at these sites    Additionally  EPA provides no information revealing or prioritizing which sites are the most harmful  There is also little information concerning EPA   s plans to address  reduce and prevent future human exposure at these sites       One of the 11 sites  the Ottawa Radiation Areas in LaSalle County  involves 14 areas contaminated by radioactive materials throughout the city of Ottawa   The homes of 50 people were built on soil contaminated by radioactive materials   While 17 500 people live in Ottawa  there is no information noting how many people in Ottawa face exposure  An EPA map also reveals that there are eleven schools located within a five mile radius of the Ottawa superfund site yet information is insufficient to determine the potential health threat to the pupils attending these schools   Instead  the EPA information available notes     access is unrestricted  and individuals could be at risk from direct contact with  or accidental ingestion of  contaminated soils      Finally  while EPA notes that human exposure is not controlled  EPA has yet to allocate any funds to clean up this site       We request that EPA take immediate steps to provide any information available on each of these 11 sites in Illinois  as well as the 103 sites throughout the United States  in which EPA has not taken the appropriate steps to reduce and control human exposure to hazardous contaminants   Furthermore  we request that EPA conduct an analysis and report the exposure threat at each site and the populations potentially at risk  This analysis should also include a complete national review of all of the 103 sites on the NPL list when human exposure has not been controlled and determine which of these sites poses the greatest risk of human exposure   Lastly  we request that EPA provide a detailed plan outlining how and under what timetable the Agency plans to control human exposure at the 11 sites in Illinois  as well as the 103 sites nationwide       Finally  Illinois contains six of the 157 superfund sites on the NPL for which there is insufficient data to determine whether or not human exposure is controlled   We request that EPA report on the steps necessary to compile sufficient data to determine whether humans are being exposed to hazardous materials at these 157 sites       This matter is of great importance to the people of Illinois and the nation  We look forward to your timely and thorough response
