SENATE  BI PARTISAN RESPECT FOR THE FUNERALS OF FALLEN HEROES ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Friday  December 8  2006          U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL    Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Evan Bayh  D IN   and Kent Conrad  D ND   chief sponsors of the Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act  S  4042  applauded last night   s passage of the legislation  saying it will help put an end to the disgraceful and protests that have disrupted military funerals nationwide        Our soldiers  our veterans and those fallen heroes who have sacrificed their lives for the good of our country deserve to be laid to rest with dignity and honor     Senator Durbin said      By addressing conduct in this bill  not content  the legislation respects not only our veterans but our constitutional freedoms           Our military men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice deserve to have a funeral with honor and dignity     said Chambliss  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee     It   s only right that the family members of our fallen military men and women have peace and respect at this very difficult time           Our troops represent America at its finest   The protesters who have tried to disrupt funerals in Indiana and elsewhere represent the worst     Senator Bayh said      This legislation will ensure that military families across the country can say goodbye to their loved ones in peace   Their service and sacrifice demands nothing less           These soldiers have given their lives for our liberty and freedom  We must honor their sacrifice and allow the families of the fallen to mourn with peace and dignity     Senator Conrad said     It sickens me to see our fallen soldiers being dishonored by protestors  No one deserves this  It must stop and it must stop now        In May 2006  Congress passed and the President signed into law the Respect for America   s Fallen Heroes Act  which prohibits demonstrations at and around federal cemeteries  However  there are only 121 federal cemeteries in the United States  Approximately 90 000 veterans are buried each year at federal cemeteries  which are covered by the law passed in May  The legislation would expand coverage of the demonstration ban to the funerals of 650 000 700 000 veterans who die each year in the United States     The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act would build on the current law by providing similar protection for the funerals of all deceased members or former members of the Armed Forces  not only at federal cemeteries but also at private cemeteries  funeral homes  and houses of worship     The National Military Family Association has endorsed the legislation because it bans    demonstrations in ALL military funerals  Grieving military families  who had made the ultimate sacrifice  should not be subjected to these intrusions   This legislation will provide military families the opportunity to mourn in a peaceful environment           As President of the Illinois Council of Chapters of the Military Officers Association of America  MOAA   I represent over 6 000 MOAA members  who live in our state  plus their family members and survivors  I believe that the 34 000 plus military retirees and all the other veterans in the state of Illinois would agree that federal legislation is needed to ban demonstrations at the funerals of all our veterans  wherever they are held     wrote retired U S  Army Colonel Aaron J  Wolfe     Under the legislation  it would be a criminal misdemeanor     punishable by a fine or up to one year in jail     for any person to  1  make any noise or diversion within the boundary of or within 150 feet of a military funeral location that intentionally disturbs the peace and good order of the funeral  or  2  intentionally impede access to or from the funeral within 300 feet of the funeral location     The legislation has also been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America  In a letter to Durbin  MOAA   s Director of Government Relations  retired Air Force Colonel Steven P  Strobridge  wrote     Those who have laid their lives on the line for our Nation deserve better than to have their families harassed by extremist elements in their hours of grief  We strongly support your efforts to protect them and their families  and pledge to assist however we can in securing enactment of your proposed legislation        The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act is consistent with the First Amendment according to University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment scholar Geoffrey Stone  and the bill is within Congress   s lawmaking power according to an analysis conducted by the Congressional Research Service     The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act now goes to the House for consideration


