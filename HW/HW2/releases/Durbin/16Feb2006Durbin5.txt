WITH SEC  CHERTOFF REGARDING ILLINOIS HOMELAND SECURITY NEEDS AND CHICAGO SECURITY ISSUES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thursday  February 16  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to discuss security issues critical to the safety of Illinoisans   Emergency management officials from Illinois have told me that the priorities in the President s budget could undermine efforts to protect the people of our state  said Durbin  I wanted to discuss my concerns directly with Secretary Chertoff and urge him to find a way to help Chicago and other cities in Illinois prepare for natural disasters and terrorist attacks   In the meeting  Durbin expressed serious concerns about the impact of the Presidents 2007 budget on Illinois ability to respond to natural disasters and terrorist threats   He also brought up Chicagos need for funding to ensure port security and the need for better evacuation planning across Illinois   Durbin noted that the City of Chicago is the third largest city in the country and a hub for the nations transportation network   Yet  the port of Chicago  one of the busiest in the country  was not included among the top 66 ports eligible to apply for port security grants   How do you explain including Milwaukee and not Chicago  Durbin said   Durbin also expressed concern that Chicago was not certified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  for an urban search and rescue team and that the citys first responders  and many downstate  do not have interoperable communications equipment   Interoperable communications equipment would make it possible for first responders  such as firefighters and law enforcement officers  to communicate with one another   The funding cuts in the Presidents budget will also make it harder to equip and train local firefighters and police officers  said Durbin   Durbin noted that while most cities and states have basic evacuation plans in case of terrorist attacks or natural disasters  state and local officials may not be adequately prepared to address the actual conditions they might face   The lack of training makes it difficult to address miscommunications that can take place during actual disasters and to recognize gaps in service  shortfalls in the stockpiling of needed supplies  and bottlenecks in evacuation plans   Durbin also discussed legislation he introduced last fall that addresses the need for greater assistance for disaster planning   Durbin s bill  the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act  would establish a  250 million a year grant program that will allow states to develop comprehensive evacuation plans  stage drills and exercises to practice and perfect evacuation procedures and stockpile materials needed to supply evacuation staging areas and evacuation routes   According to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the National Emergency Managers Association  only a limited amount of homeland security funding can be used for evacuation planning  and that money is generally earmarked for essential personnel  with little money left for the planning and staging of evacuations   Durbins bill addresses this issue by creating a separate stream of money for preparedness planning   Following the meeting  Durbin said that he was hopeful that Secretary Chertoff would take his concerns to heart   Our first responders and emergency preparedness officials back home need to know that the Department of Homeland Security will provide them with the tools they need   That was the message I gave to the Secretary   While I think Secretary Chertoff understands our challenges  only time will tell if the federal response will be adequate  said Durbin
