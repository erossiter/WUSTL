On Federal Government To Take An Active Role In Reducing Community And Healthcare Associated Infections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Sunday  October 28  2007   CHICAGO  IL   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced that he will introduce legislation next week in the Senate to improve the prevention  detection and treatment of community and healthcare associated infectionsparticularly antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA  Durbins initiative  the Community and Healthcare Associated Infections Reduction  CHAIR  Act of 2007  follows several confirmed cases of MRSA infections involving students in the Chicagoland area over the last few weeks    This legislation builds on what hospitals are already doing and what infectious disease experts and government agencies agree is critical to reducing the emergence of these infections  said Durbin  We have a national responsibility to improve the prevention  detection  and treatment of community and healthcare associated infections  Durbins measure would require the federal government to develop best practices guidelines for hospital internal infection control plans  Hospitals would then be required to review their existing infection control plans for compliance with these guidelines to improve the health and safety of patients  healthcare workers  and the public    Durbins bill also requires hospitals to report their infection rates to the Centers for Disease Control  CDC   Once the data is acquired  the CDC would promote the availability of the data to researchers  Currently  there is incomplete information about how many types of these infections there are  what conditions they seem to thrive in  how often they affect people and how they react to efforts to control them  The information can be used to target high risk areas  identify hospitals that are doing a good job of controlling infections  and do a better job of communicating what we know to hospitals and health departments around the country  With better data  its easier for researchers to learn more about how to treat and  ideally  how to prevent these dangerous infections  Durbin said  The CDC estimates that in 2005  94 000 Americans developed an invasive drug resistant staph infectionMethicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  or MRSA  In 2005  nearly 19 000 died from itmore than the number of people who died from HIV AIDS  homicide  emphysema  or Parkinsons  We are finding that about half of the infections that end up being treated in a hospital were actually picked up in the community  Durbin said  Durbins legislation would introduce a Quality Improvement Payment Program through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to provide payment subsidies to hospitals for lowering hospital acquired infection rates  The comparison will take into consideration the different characteristics of hospitalssuch as patient demographics and hospital sizeand how they may impact the prevalence of infections  The CHAIR Act of 2007 would also     Create a grant program for states to carry out a public awareness campaign to educate and increase awareness of reducing and preventing these infections  especially in schools and other local facilities      Authorize additional funding at the National Institutes of Health for the establishment of new research programs  or enhancement of existing research programs  that focus on infections     Create an interagency working group to discuss and coordinate a comprehensive federal effort to reduce and prevent healthcare associated infections     Request a Government Accountability Office report on the impact of this Act on  1  the prevalence of healthcare associated infections and  2  the quality and availability of data about healthcare associated infections
