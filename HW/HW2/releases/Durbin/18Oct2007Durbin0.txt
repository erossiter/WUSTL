October 18  2007    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin sent the following letter to Governor Rod Blagojevich  House Speaker Michael Madigan  Senate President Emil Jones  House Minority Leader Tom Cross and Senate Minority Leader Frank Watson urging the Illinois State Legislature to choose a preferred airport plan and create an airport authority for the proposed South Suburban Airport in Will County  Without a preferred plan from the State of Illinois  the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  can not move forward with the airport project  The delay in choosing a preferred airport plan and passing state legislation creating an airport authority now threatens to jeopardize the proposed South Suburban Airport  Durbin wrote  I fully support the development and construction of this airport  I helped secure an expedited environmental review from the federal government and facilitated the return of the project to the national priority list for federal funding  I will continue to work to advance development of the South Suburban Airport  but to move this project forward  we need a strong commitment from the State and consensus from local communities  In todays letter  Senator Durbin also stressed the importance of creating an airport authority to control and operate the airport  Pointing to the vast majority of airports in Illinois that are locally controlled  Durbin wrote  It is essential that this governing body be composed of a majority of local residents who live in the county in which the airport is located  The text of the letter appears below    October 18  2007   The Honorable Rod R  Blagojevich  Governor of Illinois  207 State House  Springfield  IL 62706   The Honorable Michael J  Madigan  Speaker of the House   300 State House   Springfield  IL 62706   The Honorable Tom Cross  House Minority Leader  316 Capitol Building  Springfield  IL 62706   The Honorable Emil Jones   President of the Senate   327 State House   Springfield  IL 62706    The Honorable Frank C  Watson  Senate Minority Leader  309A State House  Springfield  IL 62706   Dear Governor Blagojevich  Speaker Madigan  President Jones and Leaders Cross and Watson  The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has informed my office that the viability and future of the proposed South Suburban Airport is in question due to inaction on the state level  While the State of Illinois has submitted two different airport layout plans to the FAA  it has yet to choose a preferred option  Without such a plan  the FAA cannot move forward  Also  our state has not enacted legislation creating a governing body    airport authority    for the proposed airport  The delay in choosing a preferred airport plan and passing state legislation creating an airport authority now threatens to jeopardize the proposed South Suburban Airport  I fully support the development and construction of this airport  I helped secure an expedited environmental review from the federal government and facilitated the return of the project to the national priority list for federal funding  I will continue to work to advance development of the South Suburban Airport  but to move this project forward  we need a strong commitment from the State and consensus from local communities  A key component of this effort is the creation of an airport authority that will ultimately control and operate the airport  It is essential that this governing body be composed of a majority of local residents who live in the county in which the airport is located  The vast majority of Illinois airports share this local control approach  But the creation of such an airport authority requires action in Springfield  I will do my best to move the federal process forward as quickly as possible once the State has submitted a preferred airport layout plan and created a locally controlled airport authority  As always  I stand ready to assist in this effort  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin
