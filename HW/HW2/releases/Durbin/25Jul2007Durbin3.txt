                                                                                                                                                                                          Wednesday  July 25  2007  Washington  DC  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Sherrod Brown  D OH  today introduced legislation to provide a better safety net for farmers by replacing current price support programs with a comprehensive revenue protection program  The intent of this new farm bill is the same as it was in 1933   to ensure that farmers can survive a bad year  said Durbin  Unfortunately  much has changed in the past 70 years and we havent revised our strategy  The current program wastes taxpayer dollars  doesnt enhance farmer profitability and makes commodity programs hard to defend  If market price isnt the only factor that affects what a farmer makes  it shouldnt be the only factor on which we base commodity calculations  This bill recalculates the way we allocate funding to correct program inefficiencies and target farmers in need  Given the drought conditions that many Ohio farmers are facing this summer  we need reforms our commodity programs  During a statewide farm tour this spring  I visited Mark Schwiebert in Henry County  who first introduced me to the idea that Congress should be considering a broad reform of our nations farm safety net and in particular considering a revenue protection approach  This legislation represents a forward looking safety net that provides better protection for American farmers while making needed reforms to our farm policy  said Senator Brown  the first Senator from Ohio to serve on the Agriculture Committee in over 40 years  The Durbin Brown bill provides a better safety net for farmers by replacing price support programs with a comprehensive two tier revenue protection program  Under the bill  farmers rely on private revenue insurance at the individual level  while the government handles widespread losses at the state level where the private insurance market is ineffective  According to the Durbin Brown proposal  the federal government provides a payment when a farmers actual revenue falls below 90 percent of the forecasted revenue for a specific crop  Private insurance is integrated with the state program  operating much like it does currently  However  private insurance would only cover a farmers individual revenue losses beyond what the government covers  In doing so  farmers will see a significant decrease in their crop insurance premiums  The Durbin Brown proposal replaces existing counter cyclical payments and loan deficiency payments with a state level revenue protection program which will not cost the taxpayers any additional money over what is spent today  Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate the cost savings from integrating crop insurance and replacing the current crop payment programs fully offset the cost of the Durbin Brown legislation  Direct Payments are not affected by this revenue protection proposal   Senators Durbin and Brown are helping take farm policy to a new level by introducing legislation that is forward looking and emphasizes a market based farm program  said NCGA President  Ken McCauley  This is a proposal that growers in the Heartland want  and NCGA appreciates these senators for being on the side of producers  The Farm Safety Net Improvement Act provides better protection  less market distortions and equity across crops  all at no additional costs to taxpayers   said Ralph Grossi with AFT   American Farmland Trust applauds Senators Durbin and Brown for introductng a new risk management policy that gets farm policy reform right for producers and the public   The benefits of this approach are  Better protection for farmers by protecting revenue rather than merely price as the current system does  Revenue protection fixes many of the holes in the existing safety net  Currently  farmers fail to receive assistance even though they face real losses in revenue when prices are high but yields are low  By protecting farmers yields  this program also reduces the need for ad hoc disaster assistance    Less production distortions by using a revenue target that adjusts with the market rather than politically set target prices and loan rates  Current programs discourage farmers to plant for market demand  This revenue protection program reduces the incentive to overproduce on marginal land and helps reduce production distortions    Equitable treatment across crops resulting in planting decisions being made based on market signals not the government program  All commodities are given equal protection based on market risk rather than politically set targets    Private crop insurance works better by integrating private revenue insurance with federal revenue protection into a comprehensive programmaking private revenue insurance more cost effective and allowing higher coverage levels at a lower cost for farmers    No additional costs because of the efficiencies created by integration with crop insurance and elimination of excessive payments
