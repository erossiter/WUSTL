DEDICATES DIETARY SUPPLEMENT LEGISLATION TO MEMORY OF SEAN RIGGINS  LINCOLN NATIVE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tuesday  December 12  2006     IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  announced on Tuesday that legislation he authored requiring manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements to report all serious adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  is dedicated to the memory of Sean Riggins  a 16 year old Lincoln native whose death in 2002 was linked to ephedra   Durbin was joined by Riggins    father  Kevin  who has worked to draw attention to potentially harmful dietary supplements       Last week  the U S  Senate and the U S  House of Representatives passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act  which was written by Durbin  Tom Harkin  D IA  and Orrin Hatch  R UT    The bill now awaits the President   s signature          Dietary supplements are safely consumed by millions of Americans every day  unfortunately  this is not the case for all supplements   With this bill  the FDA will have the tools to monitor supplements that cause dangerous health problems like heart attack  stroke  seizures and liver failure     said Durbin       Although the FDA has a voluntary system to receive reports of problems with dietary supplements and a mandatory system that covers some over the counter   OTC  drugs  there is no requirement for mandatory reporting for all of these products as there is for prescription drugs and medical devices   This bipartisan bill passed by the Senate today requires manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and OTC drugs to report serious adverse events to FDA     MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION   Adverse Event Reporting  The bill would require manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and OTC drugs to report all serious adverse events to FDA  This is an entirely new requirement for supplements  Some OTC drug manufacturers are already required to report serious adverse events   Serious Adverse Events Only  The reporting requirement is limited to the information FDA really needs  reports of death  a life threatening experience  hospitalization  a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  or a congenital anomaly or birth defect   False Reports  The bill prohibits deliberately making a false adverse event report to a manufacturer or to the FDA   Recordkeeping  The bill requires manufacturers to keep all adverse event records  serious and non serious  for six years  and allows FDA to inspect these records  It also sets a 15 day time limit for manufacturers to give FDA the serious reports they receive   State responsibilities   States will continue to work with the FDA on safety concerns  The bill makes clear that states may continue to enter into agreements     In addition to Senators Hatch  Durbin and Harkin  Senators Mike Enzi  R WY  and Ted Kennedy  D MA  are also cosponsors of this legislation  This bill is also supported by Consumers Union  Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of dietary supplement manufacturers and their representative organizations in Washington       Durbin has been one of the leading advocates in Congress for reform of the dietary supplement industry   Nearly two years ago  Durbin was instrumental in urging the FDA to remove the dietary supplement ephedra from store shelves after it was linked  to more than 140 deaths nationwide  A 16 year old boy from Lincoln  Illinois  Sean Riggins  was one of those whose death was linked to ephedra  and Durbin has worked with the Riggins family to prevent other similar deaths
