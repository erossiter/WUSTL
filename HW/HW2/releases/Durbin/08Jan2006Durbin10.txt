SAFTEY AGENCIES AND COAL COMPANY TO REPORT ON SAFETY CONDITIONS AT ILLINOIS MINE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sunday  January 8  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      Following the terrible mine disaster in West Virginia earlier this week  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them to address safety conditions at the Viper Mine in Williamsville  Illinois  Durbin also sent a similar letter to the owners of the Viper Mine  the International Coal Group  ICG   ICG also owns the Sago Mine in Tallmansville  West Virginia where 12 miners lost their lives          What happened at the Sago Mine is a tragedy  and we must do everything possible to ensure that it does not happen again     said Durbin      The same company that operated the Sago Mine in West Virginia  also operates a mine in Williamsville  Illinois known as the Viper Mine  According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration  that mine has incurred a number of serious safety violations in the past year  I have written letters to the company and to the state and federal agencies that oversee mine operations and asked them to examine conditions at Viper and  if necessary  immediately implement improvements          According to Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  records  since ICG purchased the Viper Mine in Illinois a year ago  there have been 124 safety violations  42 of which carried a    significant and substantial    risk of death or injury       Durbin also noted that President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the five years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 190 mine inspectors since 2000          I hope we can learn some important lessons from the disaster in West Virginia     that safety violations must be taken seriously and that an adequate number of government inspectors are on the job to make sure coal mines are safe     said Durbin     When serious safety concerns are repeatedly raised  when we reduce the number of mine inspectors  when we lose our zeal for enforcing the law  unfortunately we invite tragedy          Illinois currently has 18 underground and nine surface mines  The Viper Mine  located in northern Sangamon County  is working the Illinois No  5 seam  also referred to as the Springfield seam  ICG estimates that Viper controls approximately 29 6 million tons of coal reserves  plus an additional 38 5 million resource tons  The Viper Mine is a room and pillar operation  utilizing continuous miners and shuttle cars  The mine employs approximately 235 workers       On January 2  2006 an explosion trapped 13 men in a West Virginia coal mine resulting in the death of 12 of the 13 workers   Last year  the operators of that mine received 205 citations for health and safety violations  96 of which were    significant and substantial    according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration   In 2005 the mine was forced to halt operations 16 times after failing to comply with safety rules         January 8  2006      David 0  Dye  Acting Administrator  Mine Safety and Health Administration  U S  Department of Labor  1100 Wilson Boulevard  21st Floor  Arlington  VA 22209 3939   Dear Administrator Dye       I am writing to you to determine the safety condition of the Viper Coal Mine in Williamsville  Illinois  that is owned by the International Coal Group  ICG   As you know  the ICG also owns the Sago Coal Mine in Tallmansville  West Virginia  where a mine accident recently killed 12 employees       I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in West Virginia  Like many others  I also am disturbed by the egregious number of citations issued to the Sago Coal Mine in the year prior to the mine accident for    serious and significant    violations of federal safety laws  Coal miners accept that their occupation is risky  But they have a right to expect that their employer will put safety ahead of other considerations  and the ICG has a moral obligation to ensure that unsafe practices are scrupulously identified  promptly corrected  and proactively avoided  The ICG   s safety record raises questions about the company   s commitment to safety  Moreover  federal regulators appear to be unable to prevent companies from amassing large quantities of safety violations       According to Mine Safety and Health Administration records  the Viper Mine in Illinois was cited for 42    serious and significant    violations out of 124 total citations in 2005  which was the first full calendar year in which the ICG owned the mine  It is my hope that the Sago disaster was an isolated incident and does not reflect a pattern of mismanagement by the ICG and unsafe conditions at the Viper Mine       At a time like this  the burden is on the ICG and our nation   s regulatory authorities to ensure that the ICG is properly and safely managing its mines in Illinois  Please provide to me and the people whose lives are affected by operations at the Viper Mine a safety status report on the Viper Mine  In addition  please include the safety record of the mine since ICG purchased the operation and the extent of any steps the ICG has taken to address past safety violations and prevent them in the future       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter  I look forward to hearing from you within the next month       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
