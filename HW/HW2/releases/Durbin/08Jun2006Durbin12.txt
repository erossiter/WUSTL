                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  June 8  2006   WASHINGTON  DC      Last night  the U S  House of Representatives approved a bipartisan bill to help protect the lives of miners in Illinois and throughout the nation   Major provisions in the bill were included in mine safety legislation introduced in March by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL       This represents the largest overhaul of mine safety legislation in 30 years     said Durbin      This bill will ensure that more than 3 500 miners in Illinois  and thousands more across the country  will receive much needed safety equipment and training  The legislation includes significantly stronger safety regulations so that tragic events like those we witnessed last year in West Virginia and Kentucky will never be repeated          The recently passed measure  the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act  will improve enforcement of safety regulations  raise minimum and maximum penalties for serious violations and provide funding for safety training grants   The bill  which passed 381 to 37  is identical to a measure the Senate passed unanimously on May 24  2006  It now heads to the President for his signature       Durbin said the legislation approved by the House and Senate will                 Give the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  the power to shut down a mine if it refuses to pay a fine                 Require mine owners to install wireless communications and tracking equipment in all mines within three years                 Require coal mines to create new emergency response plans and require that these plans be continuously reviewed  updated and re certified by MSHA every six months                 Require each mine to make available two experienced rescue teams capable of responding to an emergency within an hour                 Substantially raise minimum fines for serious safety violations                 Raise the maximum fine to  250 000 for first offenses and  500 000 for second offenses  as well as raise the maximum civil penalty for flagrant violations to  220 000                 Create grant programs to improve safety training       Durbin s original bill  S  2448  also called for increased fines for mine safety violations  improved mine safety training grant programs and a tightened fines collection process   According to recent reports  since 2001  almost half of all fines have not been collected   Federal records also show that in the last two years the federal mine safety agency has failed to hand over any delinquent cases to the Treasury Department for further collection efforts  as is supposed to occur after 180 days  The bipartisan mine safety bill tightens up fine collections and authorizes MSHA to close mines that don   t pay       Over the years  funding for education health and training grants has steadily declined    seriously impacting the agency   s ability to meet the training needs of the Illinois mining industry   Nationally  MSHA awards up to  10 million in grants annually   Last year  Illinois received  209 250   down from  274 781 approximately ten years ago   The Illinois Office of Mines and Minerals  OMM  uses the funds it receives from MSHA to purchase safety vehicles  rescue training equipment and to help train new coal mine employees   Not only is OMM unable to purchase new equipment as old equipment wears out  but the agency is having trouble purchasing modern mine rescue training equipment   The legislation passed by Congress includes a new grant program for education and training which will allow OMM to apply for grants as they see fit       Durbin has also written to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them for a review of mine safety records in Illinois and elsewhere  In his letters he asked the agencies to examine two issues     the impact funding cuts for mine safety inspections have had on mine safety  and a status report on safety conditions at all of Illinois    mines   President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the five years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 130 mine inspectors since 2000       The State of Illinois recently passed legislation that would require mine operators to install communications technology that tracks miners below ground and requires the miners to wear oxygen canisters   The bill is awaiting the Governor   s signature
