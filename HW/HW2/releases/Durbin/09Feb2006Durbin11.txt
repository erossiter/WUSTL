     DURBIN ISSUES A    RURAL REPORT CARD    ON PRESIDENT   S BUDGET                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2 9 2006                                                                                                                                                                            DURBIN ISSUES A    RURAL REPORT CARD    ON PRESIDENT   S BUDGET                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  February 9  2006        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today joined his colleagues to release the  Rural Report Card  to illustrate the impact of the Administration   s budget cuts in programs that directly affect the quality of life of rural Americans        The President   s budget is our first real opportunity to understand the Administration   s priorities for the nation     said Durbin      Sadly  this budget continues to provide tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working American families   especially those in rural areas  It not only proposes significant cuts to vital programs  such as rural law enforcement  it calls for the elimination of several others  including important funding for smaller hospitals   Funding for rural programs should be a top priority  but this budget puts them last          The Rural Report Card focused on seven areas where the budget cuts deep into rural Illinois      1  RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT    Durbin pointed to the President   s budget cuts in funding for local and state law enforcement and first responders   He noted that the following funding sources are critical to Illinois law enforcement and that cuts  totaling approximately  1 billion nationally  will handicap a wide range of services that rural communities depend on including combating Illinois    growing  methamphetamine problem      Firefighters   First Responders  The President s budget eliminates the SAFER firefighter hiring program  which provides funding to fire departments to hire additional firefighters and first responders   In Illinois  over  1 3 million was awarded to fire departments for hiring and recruiting additional firefighters in 2005       The President   s budget also proposes to cut funding for the FIRE program nearly in half  reducing its budget from  545 million to  293 million   The FIRE program provides fire departments with vital equipment and training   In 2005  Illinois was awarded over  25 million for fire department equipment   Durbin noted that these programs are especially important to Illinois    rural and volunteer fire departments      Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program  The President   s budget eliminates this important program  which was budgeted at  327 million last year   Durbin expressed serious concern that the elimination of this program could significantly impact the ability of Illinois law enforcement to combat the state   s growing meth problem    The amount of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased nearly tenfold between 1997 and 2003    Ending the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funds would severely hamper regional methamphetamine task forces and several crime prevention programs      Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS   The President   s budget cuts funding for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 78 percent   Since COPS was created in 1994  the program has assisted Illinois law enforcement agencies in reducing violent crime by awarding the state more than  422 7 million in COPS grants for community policing efforts   These grants have funded 5 530 additional police officers and sheriff   s deputies in Illinois  benefiting 682 local and state law enforcement agencies   In addition   22 million has been awarded to hire 182 school resource offices to improve safety for students  teachers and administrators in Illinois elementary and high schools   The program has also awarded  50 3 million to enhance crime fighting technologies  allowing Illinois law enforcement officers to spend more time on the streets preventing and fighting crime      2  RURAL HEALTHCARE     Durbin noted that the elimination of 28 programs in the Department of Health and Human Services  as recommended by the budget  would have a significant impact on rural health care in Illinois   At a time when rural areas are struggling to recruit and retain doctors and nurses  provide better emergency care to rural residents  and enhance access to primary care  this budget is proposing to reduce federal resources      Medicare  Medicare will lose more than  36 billion over the next five years   Over the next ten years  as the baby boomers retire  the President   s budget would reduce Medicare spending by  105 billion dollars      Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants  The President   s budget eliminates Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants   These grants help maintain and upgrade small hospitals in rural areas   They also coordinate and improve health care delivery in rural parts of the country   Illinois receives  650 000 annually from this grant for its 51 critical access hospitals      AHEC  One particularly unwise cut is Area Health Education Centers   The President   s budget would eliminate these vital centers which improve access to health care services  predominantly primary health care  through projects and activities that link health professionals in medically underserved communities with educational opportunities   These centers serve rural regions that have medically underserved populations or that experience shortages of health professionals   This program was established in 1991 to improve primary health care for underserved urban and rural areas   Illinois has seven Area Health Education Centers that are making significant contributions in the area of rural health   For example  the Western Area Education Center in Quincy  Illinois set up the Illinois Rural Interdisciplinary Network  which provides learning opportunities for rural health providers at three rural Illinois sites  Carthage  Dixon  and Girard   The Western Center also offers tele health training for workers at small rural hospitals  so that they do not have to travel long distances to receive continuing education      Allied Health Professionals Grant Program  At a time when rural areas are having difficulties recruiting and keeping qualified people  the President   s budget cuts resources for allied health professional programs   Last year  Illinois received a  278 000 grant to improve access to quality physical therapy and occupational therapy in medically underserved areas   Rush University was awarded  396 000 in 2004 to set up a program for increasing the numbers of qualified faculty to teach in allied health shortage areas   Rural areas need more medical personnel and this grant program is helping achieve that goal      3  EDUCATION     Durbin noted that the President   s proposed cut to education funding  by  2 1 billion  is the largest cut in the 26 year history of the Department of Education      No Child Left Behind  The President   s budget would hurt rural school districts in Illinois that rely on federal dollars provided for No Child Left Behind   The bulk of federal funding for NCLB is provided through Title I   Title I helps schools provide textbooks  teachers  and additional classroom help to students from low income families   The shortfall in Title I funds could affect more than 159 000 Illinois school children by shortchanging the state of  530 million for the program      Student Financial Aid Programs  For the fourth year in a row  the President s budget makes college unaffordable for thousands of students in rural Illinois areas by freezing the maximum Pell grant at  4 050 and eliminating the Perkins Loan program  which provides low interest loans to help needy students   Last year  over 194 000 Illinois students were awarded nearly  450 million in Pell grants   In 2004  over  95 million in Perkins loans helped over 40 000 Illinois college students      Education Programs Terminated  The President   s budget proposes to cut 42 existing education programs  including ones that play a large role in rural Illinois  such as GEAR UP and TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound       These programs help disadvantaged students overcome the challenges that might prevent them from graduating from high school and going on to college  In Illinois  Northeastern Illinois University and the Illinois Department of Human Services received  8 2 million and  3 5 million  respectively  in GEAR UP grants   The proposed termination of the TRIO programs would also have a significant impact on rural Illinois students   Through the TRIO programs proposed for termination  Illinois received over  17 8 million in 2004  which served over 19 000 disadvantaged students      Vocational and Technical education  The President has proposed eliminating all vocational and technical education programs by proposing zero funding for the Carl D  Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act   Last year  Illinois colleges received over  15 3 million in Perkins grants  with nearly one third going to colleges serving rural Illinois students      4  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT     The President   s budget would drastically cut economic initiatives relied on by Illinois    rural communities   Durbin noted that the economic development initiatives often benefit smaller communities in Illinois      Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program  The President   s budget requested a  736 million cut in funding for Community Development Block Grants   This is a reduction of about 20 percent from last year   s proposal   In 2005  Illinois received about  177 million in CDBG funds which were invested in projects around the state  many in smaller rural areas   The CDBG program is critical for three types of projects across the state of Illinois      Infrastructure investment   In 2004  the CDBG program assisted over 100 Illinois communities pay for improvements to their water  sanitary  or storm water systems   Business investment   Community Development Block Grants helped at least 13 Illinois businesses to create or retain more than 1 000 jobs in 2004   Housing rehabilitation   Illinois used CDBG to provide housing rehabilitation to low income homeowners in small and rural communities   In 2004  at least 313 homes in 27 communities were rehabilitated to address health and safety issues  and  where appropriate  accessibility issues for people with disabilities    Durbin added that  according to Governor Blagojevich  in 2004 every CDBG dollar Illinois invested in infrastructure and housing spurred more than three dollars of other public and private investment   This yielded more than  109 million in additional dollars for Illinois communities      Rural Housing and Economic Development  The President has requested that the Department of Housing and Urban Development eliminate the  25 million program for Rural Housing and Economic Development   The budget proposes to fold this program into the Community Development Block Grant program  which is already experiencing a 20 percent cut       Last year  a  100 000 Rural Housing and Economic Development grant was awarded to Anna  Illinois   This grant was used to support Bethany Village  which serves the homeless and others who are in the midst of a crisis   The  100 000 was awarded to Anna to help build a    haven    for the homeless that would include a food pantry  a clothing closet  and homeless prevention services   Anna  Illinois pledged to supplement that  100 000 with another  243 377 to make this project happen   This kind of rural program would be all but eliminated with the proposed budget cuts      5  AGRICULTURE    The President   s budget drains federal spending from rural America by scaling back investment in farm income  consolidating farm service agency offices  restricting eligibility for food stamp benefits and cutting energy assistance to low income families      Scaling Back Investments in Farm Income  The President   s budget proposes cutting farm income assistance by 5 percent  including marketing loan benefits  direct and countercyclical payments and Milk Income Loss Compensation program payments  This 5 percent cut in farm income would mean Illinois farmers would loose  65 million      Consolidating Farm Service Agency Offices  The President   s budget plans to consolidate Farm Service Agency offices  in effect  limiting services to farmers  Farm Service Agency offices are where our producers go when they need to deal government programs that affect them    Illinois has 93 Farm Service Agency offices  which are effectively used to administer programs      6  FOOD STAMPS  Durbin noted that the average monthly food stamp allowance of  94 makes a big difference to those in poverty   New rules will make it significantly more difficult for rural families to receive food stamp assistance       Currently  families receiving non cash assistance through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  TANF  or receiving Supplemental Security Income are automatically eligible for food stamps   Under the President   s budget  these individuals will no longer be eligible  The Congressional Budget Office noted that 225 000 people who qualify for Food Stamps today will no longer be eligible if the proposed changes become law   Each year  more than a million people in Illinois who need help buying food are receiving that help through Food Stamps   Durbin said the 500 000 children in Illinois who are living in poverty also need this assistance      7  RURAL ENEGRY  The President   s budget fails to provide good answers to energy challenges rural Americans faces with increasing gas prices  more expensive home heating costs  and the need for developing clean and alternative fuel resources      Gasoline Prices  Since 2001  the average monthly price of regular unleaded gasoline rose from  1 43 per gallon to  2 27 per gallon at the end of last year     a 58 percent increase   Diesel fuel rose from  1 40 per gallon to  2 40 in the same time period     a 71 percent increase   The Energy Information Administration projects that these prices will hold steady or increase over the course of the next two years      LIHEAP  The President s budget does not provide adequate funding for low income Americans struggling to meet their energy needs   This budget cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to just  1 782 billion from  2 161 billion   LIHEAP funds assist low income households in covering rising residential energy costs  Only two states typically receive more LIHEAP funds than Illinois  and last year the state received nearly  113 million in assistance   In a year when many Illinois residents have seen home heating costs double  the budget for Illinois would be cut by more that  11 million      Clean Cities Program  The President   s budget includes a  3 6 million cut in the Clean Cities program  which partners with local governments to encourage the use of clean non petroleum fuels and alternative fuel vehicles  Overall  proposed funding for transportation technology research and development has been relatively flat under this administration


