2  2005    MANTENO  IL      U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  announced  3 6 million in federal funding for road improvements in Manteno and Bourbonnais  as well as a bike trail extension in Kankakee   The funding was secured through the TEA 3 bill recently passed by Congress        The Senators secured  1 million for the expansion of Maple Manteno Lake Road in Manteno   The land is located near an intersection where the Village is proposing construction of a new high school   The road improvements will allow the Village to bring the streets up to current standards and to potentially move forward on the new school        The Senators also secured  700 000 on behalf of Manteno Township for critical street and lighting improvements at the Diversatech Campus in Manteno  which had been found to pose a public safety hazard        Because the Village of Bourbonnais is growing at a rapid pace  improvements to three area roadways received a total of  1 5 million in the Senate portion of the bill   The roads include Career Center  6000 North and 5000 North        The bill also includes  400 000 for a bike trail extension for the Kankakee River Trail Project           Manteno  Bourbonnais and Kankakee are all growing communities   The funding in this bill is designed to aid that growth  upgrading roadways for businesses and residents alike and making quality of life improvements for area families     said Durbin          Securing this funding for Kankakee  Bourbonnais and Manteno is the result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     said Obama     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to make ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges         The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21       Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level      Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families         It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois            This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
