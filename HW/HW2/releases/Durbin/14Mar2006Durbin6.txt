STATEMENT ON CENTRAL ILLINOIS TORNADOES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Tuesday  March 14  2006    WASHINGTON DC    U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  gave the following speech on the Senate floor Tuesday regarding the tornadoes that hit Central Illinois     Mr  President  for the last two days  I   ve been asked by many senators  and I   ve received calls and emails from across the country  about my hometown of Springfield  Illinois  which was hit by two tornadoes Sunday evening   I want to take a few minutes to tell this Senate  and the nation  where things stand now        On behalf of the people of Springfield  let me say   We are grateful for the outpouring of support we have received these last two days   We will get through this disaster together  and we will rebuild Mr  Lincoln   s hometown        This series of photographs  Durbin was referring to a chart with images of the damage  shows homes and businesses in Springfield that were blown apart by the tornadoes   Imagine this image multiplied hundreds of times  and you have an idea of what Springfield looks like today    and the hard road ahead facing many Springfield families and businesses        The two tornadoes that hit Springfield were part of a violent storm system that claimed at least nine lives and wreaked havoc along a 350 mile corridor    from Lawrence  Kansas through Illinois    They were the worst tornadoes many people in Springfield can recall   And we live in Tornado Alley        They tore through Springfield at about 120 miles an hour  followed by fierce rain and hail        The first tornado touched down around 8 20 Sunday evening   It was on the ground for almost about six minutes and left a path of destruction 5    miles long and a half mile wide        The second tornado touched down at 8 25   It was on the ground for five minutes and left a damage path four miles long 300 yards wide        The winds ripped the roof off a Springfield Wal Mart  peeled the siding off other buildings  and blew the windows out of countless buildings     including some windows in our state capitol building    Many homes and businesses were completely leveled     Trees were pulled up by the roots   Utility poles were snapped in half   Traffic signs and signals were toppled  forcing the closure of most major roads into the city        Twenty four people in central Illinois were injured in the storms  including 19 people in Springfield        We are very grateful that no one died in our state   That   s due partly to luck    but partly also to the excellent storm warning system operated by the city of Springfield and Sangamon County   The early warnings gave people time to seek shelter from the storm        Governor Rod Blagojevich has already declared a state disaster in Sangamon County and in six neighboring counties   Ford  Greene  Logan  Morgan  Randolph  and Scott        But the worst damage  by far  is in Springfield        Nearly 1 000 homes were damaged or destroyed        10 000 people remain without electricity        Schools remain closed today        Many roads are still impassable        The worst disasters tend to bring out the best in Americans   That is certainly true in Springfield today   There has been a real outpouring of courage and generosity   I   m told that the Red Cross is seeking temporary housing for about 50 Springfield residents today   All of the other people whose homes were damaged or destroyed have been taken in by friends and family in the Springfield area        I want to commend Governor Blagojevich  Springfield Mayor Tim Davlin and their staffs  and so many community leaders who have been working around the clock try to get help to the victims and restore power to the areas that lost it        I also want to commend the mayors of two neighboring towns that were also hit hard by the tornados   Mayor Harry Stirmell of the village of Jerome  and Mayor Joe Rusciolelli  of the village of Riverton  and working with state and local officials  and with FEMA        The Governor   s office and the mayors    offices are scheduled to meet with FEMA officials tomorrow to assess the damage together and map out a recovery plan   Senator Obama and I  along with the Illinois congressional delegation  are working closely with them to provide assistance        Based on what we already know  we expect that Springfield and other central Illinois communities hit by these tornadoes will quality for federal emergency disaster assistance  and we hope that aid will be forthcoming quickly        A story in today   s Springfield Journal Register quotes a man named Tim Williams   Before the tornado  Mr  Williams    garage in Springfield was filled with antiques  including a 1955 Roadmaster Rivera that he had just finished restoring and had driven only 87 miles   Today  the car is damaged and Mr  Williams    antiques are scattered across the neighborhood        Like everyone in Springfield  Tim Williams considers himself lucky that he and his family made it through the tornadoes alive   Like many in our town  he is feeling a renewed empathy for the victims of Hurricane Katrina   As Mr  Williams told a reporter      You don   t realize until it happens to you           I want to say to my fellow residents of Springfield     and to others who suffered severe losses in these storms   You are not alone   America is with you   We will help you get through this and help you rebuild   We are 50 states  but we are one American family
