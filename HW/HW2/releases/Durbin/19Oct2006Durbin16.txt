Thursday  October 19  2006   Washington  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today released a letter asking members of the baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee to include Cubs third baseman Ron Santo into this year   s class of baseball Hall of Famers       Durbin made his request in a letter sent to the all the members of the baseball Veterans Committee   In the letter  the Illinois lawmaker wrote about the life of Ron Santo  his struggle with diabetes  statistics from his 15 year career  career batting average of  277  342 home runs and 1 331 runs batted in  and his love for the Cubs          He is the best third baseman in Cubs history  one of the best in the history of the game and he is a Hall of Famer   Beyond the numbers  there are other reasons Ron Santo deserves to be in Cooperstown   The first is his courageous struggle with diabetes and his tireless effort to help others who suffer from the disease     wrote Durbin         Durbin went on to say     In September 2003  the Cubs retired Ron Santo   s number 10   It now hangs at Wrigley Field  along with the jerseys of his former teammates Billy Williams and Ernie Banks   Like his teammates whose retired jerseys also hang proudly at Wrigley Field     Billy Williams and Ernie Banks    Ron Santo deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame          Text of letter below          Members of the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee  National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum  25 Main Street  Cooperstown  NY 13326   To the Members of the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee    I am writing to thank you for what you have contributed to America   s Pastime and to ask your support for a man I strongly believe deserves to join you in the Hall of Fame     Ron Santo       Ron Santo hid his diabetes from his fans for 10 years because he didn   t want anyone to pity him or hold him to a different standard  He wanted to be judged the same way every ballplayer is judged     by the numbers     and by that standard  Ron Santo has earned his spot among the greats at Cooperstown  During his 15 year career  he batted  277  with 342 home runs and 1 331 runs batted in  He was a nine time All Star and five time NL Gold Glove winner  In four seasons each  he batted  300  drove in 100 runs  and led the league in walks       We can   t know how much better Ron Santo   s statistics might have been had he not played his entire career with a life threatening illness  in an era that suppressed the long ball  for a team that  God bless them  never once saw post season action     but that doesn   t matter  Ron Santo still put up the numbers to earn his spot at Cooperstown  He is the best third baseman in Cubs history  one of the best third baseman in the history of the game and he is a Hall of Famer       Beyond the numbers  there are other reasons Ron Santo deserves to be in Cooperstown  The first is his courageous struggle with diabetes and his tireless efforts to help others who suffer from the disease       Since 2001  Ron Santo has lost the lower portions of both legs to diabetes  He has also survived a bout of cancer and endured more than 23 surgeries  Walking on prosthetic legs has slowed his gait but not his charitable work for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation  on whose board of directors he has served since 1975  In 28 years  the annual Ron Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago has raised more than  50 million for juvenile diabetes research       Another reason Ron Santo stands out as one of baseball   s best is his legendary loyalty to the one city  one team and its fans  He fell in love with the Cubs as a kid in Seattle watching the Game of the Week on TV  As he has said     It was Wrigley Field  Ernie Banks     something about this ballpark and the Cubs fans     When it came time to sign  other clubs offered more money     but I wanted to be a Cub     He could have made more money at the end of his career as well by leaving Chicago  Instead  in 1974  Ron Santo became the first player to invoke his privilege under the league   s    5 and 10 rule     declining a trade to the Angles because he wanted to finish his career in the city he loved  That kind of dedication to a team and its fans is something you hardly ever see anymore  in any sport       Today you can hear Ron Santo   s love for the Cubs in his frequent  crowd pleasing 7th inning stretch renditions of    Take Me Out to the Ballgame    at Wrigley Field  You can hear it  too  in the color commentary he provides on WGN Radio Cubs broadcasts  a job he held since 1990  To quote Sports Illustrated writer Rick Reilly  Ron Santo    loves them cubs like Pooh loves honey     He does not call the game     he lives it     He cheers so much that it sounds like his play by play partner Pat Hughes is broadcasting from Murphy   s bar          In September 2003  the Cubs retired Ron Santo   s number 10   It now hangs at Wrigley Field  along with the jerseys of his former teammates Billy Williams and Ernie Banks  Ron Santo says     that is my Hall of Fame     But the Old Cub deserves more  Like his teammates whose retired jerseys also hang proudly at Wrigley Field     Billy Williams and Ernie Banks     Ron Santo deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame       Of all the titles he holds     Gold Glover  All Star     the one title he does not deserve is best player not in the Hall of Fame  You have the power to take that title away from him  For Ron Santo  for his fans and for baseball  I respectfully ask that you do so when you cast your 2007 Hall of Fame ballot       Sincerely   Dick Durbin  United States Senator  Baseball fan
