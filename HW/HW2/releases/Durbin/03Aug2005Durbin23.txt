                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  August 3  2005    BROOKFIELD  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Rep  Dan Lipinski today announced  3 2 million in new federal funding to improve the main entrance to the Brookfield Zoo at 31st Street and Golfview Road   The funding is part of  215 million Durbin and Obama have secured for Illinois in the TEA 3 transportation bill recently passed in Congress            The funding for this project is as important for the people who live in the area as it is to Brookfield Zoo visitors     Durbin said      Over 30 000 cars per day pass through the main entrance with traffic jams on First Avenue stretching from the Eisenhower Expressway to the Stevenson Expressway   Improving access to Brookfield Zoo is important for public safety and traffic congestion reasons          The federal funding will be used to facilitate smoother entrance into the zoo and improve the parking situation          Right now     Durbin said     the traffic problems disrupt the day to day travel of people living in and around the Brookfield area      On March 29  2005  many guests waited as long as three hours to enter the zoo and traffic jams stretched 2 5 miles to the Eisenhower and Stevenson Expressways   A combination of 70 degree weather  spring break for area schools and a Brookfield Zoo    free day    brought more than 33 000 people to the zoo            Securing funding for Brookfield is a result of the Illinois delegation working together in a bipartisan manner to put the interests of the people of Illinois first     Obama said     I am proud that I was able to help write this bill and work with my colleagues to ensure that Illinois will continue to have safe and efficient roads  rails and bridges          The TEA 3 transportation bill has a five year life span   Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21       Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion     128  over TEA 21   s level       Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands of new jobs for Illinois families          It   s a time to put people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America     said Obama of the bill     This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois             This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state     said Durbin     Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems
