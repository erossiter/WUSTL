Delegation Renews Effort to Secure Chicago as the Host of the 2016 Olympics and Paralympic Games                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wednesday  August 1  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today held a meeting with the Assistant Secretary at the Bureau of Consular Affairs  Maura Harty and the Assistant Commissioner of the United States Customs and Border Protection  Jayson Ahern  to discuss strengthening Chicagos bid as host of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games by overcoming an international perception that United States visa and entry practices make it difficult for international visitors and participants at such events to enter the country  Today s meeting was arranged to specifically address the upcoming World Boxing Championship  scheduled to be held in Chicago from October 18 through November 3 which is seen by many as a trial run at efficient visa processing and has the potential to impact Chicagos prospects for winning the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic bid  Other members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation attending the meeting were Congressmen Rahm Emanuel  D IL  and Don Manzullo  R IL   In today s meeting  both Assistant Secretary Harty and Deputy Commissioner Ahern assured us that they are prepared to quickly and effectively process visas  said Durbin  This will make it easier for those seeking U S  entry for the World Boxing Championship in Chicago to do so  and will show that Chicago is making the necessary preparations for the 2016 Olympics and Paralympic games  With the World Boxing Championships around the corner  Chicago is poised to show the world were a world class city with remarkable diversity  culture  history  and people and we are ready to host the 2016 Olympic Summer Games  said Emanuel  The ability for the United States to bring thousands of foreign visitors into this country in a safe and timely manner will be a significant factor in whether Chicago will be awarded the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games  Manzullo said  The Olympic bid committee will get a trial run of our visa process in action this fall when the World Boxing Championships take place in Chicago  At todays meeting  Assistant Secretary Harty and Commissioner Basham assured us they will do everything in their power to ensure these international athletes and the world are shown our nations finest hospitality  The Illinois Congressional Delegation has been united in its support of Chicago as the potential host 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games since the city was selected earlier this year by the United States Olympic Committee to represent America in the international competition  A possible obstacle to a Chicago bid is an international perception that United States visa and entry practices make it difficult for international visitors and participants at such events to enter the country  The Illinois delegation has joined with the U S  Olympic Committee and Chicago 2016 in working with officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the U S  Department of State to streamline visa issuance and entry  The last time a Summer Olympic Games was held in a U S  city was in Atlanta  Georgia in 1996  On May 17  the entire Illinois delegation sent a letter to Assistant Secretary Harty and Commissioner Basham inviting their respective departments to brief the delegation on programs to expedite entry  give status reports on these programs and give suggestions for how Members of Congress can support that effort  On May 11  both the House and Senate passed a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the City of Chicago should be commended for being chosen to represent the United States in the International Competition for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games
