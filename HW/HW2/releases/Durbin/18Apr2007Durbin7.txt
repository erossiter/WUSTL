April 18  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today met with U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Commissioner  Andrew von Eschenbach in Durbin s Capitol office to discuss the latest recall of pet food  this time caused by contaminated rice protein imported from China   In the meeting  Durbin and DeLauro learned that the Chinese Government has blocked requests from the FDA to send personnel to China to inspect the facilities suspected of producing the contaminated products  The FDA first contacted the Chinese Government on April 4  2007  but have not been granted permission to send food inspectors into the country   In response  Durbin and DeLauro sent a letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States  Zhou Wenzong  urging the Chinese Government to issue visas to U S  food inspectors as quickly as possible   It is unacceptable that the Chinese government is blocking our food safety inspectors from entering their country and examining facilities that are suspected of providing contaminated pet food to American consumers  said Durbin  We have asked for two things in our letter today    that the Chinese government allow our inspectors in and that the Chinese ambassador to the United States meet with Congresswoman DeLauro and me to discuss the larger issue of contaminated food being sent to the U S   These are reasonable requests and we hope that we can find a level of cooperation with the Chinese   At time when China is exporting more foods into the U S   the Chinese are refusing to allow our inspectors in to the country to investigate the source of the pet food contamination  The FDA needs to be allowed to investigate this so we can better protect our pets and identify the source of the source of the problem  While we have a significant trade relationship with the Chinese  the investigation of the contaminated product comes first  said DeLauro   Last week  Durbin  a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  along with Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   the Chairman of the Subcommittee  held a hearing to question witnesses on the timeline of the investigation  the source of the contamination  and the agency s regulatory and inspection responsibilities   In the hearing  the Senators also questioned outside experts who about the current state of the pet food industry  as well as regulatory or resource shortfalls that led to the widespread recall of tainted pet food   Additionally  DeLauro  the Chairman of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  will further explore FDA s inspection of imported foods in a follow up hearing before the subcommittee   Durbin and DeLauro have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  This Congress they introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act   S  654 and H R  1148 in the Senate and House respectively    The Illinois senator said legislation he has introduced to consolidate all federal food safety responsibilities into a single  independent agency has taken on new urgency because of a possibly heightened need to respond quickly and effectively to any acts of bioterrorism or agroterrorism  Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues   The non partisan U S  General Accounting Office  GAO  has been unequivocal in its recommendation for consolidation of federal food safety programs   In February of this year  the GAO deemed federal oversight of food safety as high risk to the economy and public health and safety  Over the past two decades  GAO has also issued numerous reports on topics such as food recalls  food safety inspections and the transport of animal feeds   Each of these reports highlights the current fragmentation and inconsistent organization of the various agencies involved in food safety oversight     Text of the letter appears below   April 18  2007  Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong  Embassy of the People s Republic of China  2300 Connecticut Ave   NW  Washington  D C  20008  Dear Mr  Ambassador   The ongoing investigation into the recent series of pet deaths and illnesses in the United States has revealed that contaminated batches of wheat gluten and rice protein responsible for these events were imported from China   According to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   China was the source of both the contaminated wheat gluten responsible for the recall of more than 60 million containers of cat and dog food  and the most recent recall of rice protein products   Both products were contaminated with melamine  a chemical used for industrial purposes in the United States and in fertilizers in China   According to experts  no level of melamine should be found in pet or human food   In the case of the contaminated wheat gluten  FDA has identified Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co  Ltd  as the source of the product   Although spokespeople for Xuzhou Anying have denied involvement in the incident  U S  based importer ChemNutra  Inc   has demonstrated that it imported the contaminated wheat gluten from Xuzhou Anying and various media reports show that the Chinese company was involved in purchasing significant quantities of melamine   In the case of the rice protein contamination  U S  importer Wilbur Ellis has said that it imported its products from Binzhou Futian Biology Technology  Ltd   In response to these contaminations  on March 30  2007  FDA took steps to block imports of Chinese wheat gluten thought to pose a risk to the safety of the human and pet food supply   The Agency has also made multiple requests to the Chinese Government to allow U S  inspectors to look at the facilities that are suspected to have produced the contaminated product   On April 4  2007  the FDA sent its first letter to the Chinese Government asking for visas to allow its inspectors visit China   The request was not granted  and on April 17  2007  the FDA sent an additional letter emphasizing that it wished to be allowed to send its inspectors to China   This incident has brought suffering to pet owners who have seen their animals fall prey to illness or death  and caused significant economic losses to U S  companies that believed they were importing wholesome products   Therefore  we strongly urge the Chinese Government to quickly issue visas to U S  inspectors and cooperate in this investigation   Last year  the United States imported more than  2 1 billion of agricultural goods from China  up from nearly  1 8 billion the year before   Clearly  this is an important trading relationship   We appreciate the courtesy of a timely response   We would also like to meet with you in the near future to discuss this issue   Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator  Rosa L  DeLauro  Chairwoman House
