Legislation to Help Identify and Treat Postpartum Depression                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Monday  May 7  2007    DOWNERS GROVE  IL    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced he will introduce legislation in the Senate days before Mother s Day that is designed to ensure new moms and their families are educated about postpartum depression  screened for symptoms  and provided with essential services       The Mom s Opportunity to Access Help  Education  Research and Support for Postpartum Depression Act  or MOTHERS Act     which is cosponsored by U S  Sen  Robert Menendez  D NJ  and U S  Sen  Olympia Snowe  R ME    will help new moms by providing important education and screening on postpartum depression that can lead to early identification and treatment as well as expanding important research to improve and discover new treatments  diagnostic tools and educational materials for providers       Durbin made the announcement at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital during a meeting with two local moms who shared their personal stories about how suffering from postpartum depression affected them and their families        Postpartum depression is such a tragic mental illness   Durbin said    During what should be one of the happiest times in a woman s life  postpartum depression can pull the rug out from under a new family   New moms may be unwilling or unable to admit to themselves that they are experiencing the symptoms of postpartum depression  let alone tell their families and seek treatment   This legislation will help the many women who suffer from postpartum depression by making sure the right screenings take place and the right services are provided        Each year  more than half of women who have recently given birth suffer from postpartum mood changes   Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders impair 10 to 20 percent of new mothers  and postpartum psychosis strikes 1 or 2 in 1 000 women after birth       A major part of prevention is informing new mothers about the symptoms and providing them with the services that are available in their community   Durbin s legislation includes two grants to help health care providers educate  identify and treat PPD      Award grants to states so that local health care providers can educate women who have recently given birth and their families about PPD before the mothers leave the birthing center and offer the opportunity for new mothers to be screened for postpartum depression symptoms during the first year of postnatal check up visits   Award grants to states and local governments  public or non profit hospitals and community based organizations for the delivery of essential services to individuals with postpartum depression and psychosis and their families  including enhanced outpatient and home based health care  inpatient care and support services    Since the exact cause of PPD isn t known  research continues to be the key to unlocking the mystery of this condition   This legislation incorporates and is the companion legislation to Congressman Bobby Rush s  D IL  House bill  the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act  which would expand and intensify research at the NIH with respect to PPD and psychosis  including increased discovery of treatments  diagnostic tools and educational materials for providers       The MOTHERS Act is endorsed by the following organizations  Postpartum Support International  Association of Women s Health  Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses  AWHONN   Family Mental Health Institute  Inc   American College of Nurse Midwives  National Mental Health Association  National Women s Health Network  Depression and Bipolar
