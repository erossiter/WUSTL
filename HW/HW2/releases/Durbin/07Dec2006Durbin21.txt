recovery efforts in Illinois          The text of the letter to President Bush appears below             December 7  2006   The Honorable George W  Bush  The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    We write in support of a request dated December 7  2006  from Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich asking that 49 counties in the state be declared federal disaster areas under Section 501  a  of the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act   The request is based on a severe winter storm involving sleet  freezing rain  heavy snow  high winds  and single digit temperatures that moved through Illinois on November 30  2006   Based on preliminary information obtained from the National Weather Service and on initial estimates of emergency response and projected debris removal costs from State agencies and local governments  the Governor has identified the following counties for inclusion in his request for Federal assistance   Adams  Bond  Boone  Brown  Bureau  Calhoun  Cass  Champaign  Christian  DeKalb  DeWitt  Fulton  Greene  Hancock  Henry  Jersey  Kendall  Knox  LaSalle  Lee  Livingston  Logan  Macon  Macoupin  Madison   Marshall  Mason  McLean  McDonough  McHenry  Menard  Morgan  Monroe  Montgomery  Ogle  Peoria  Piatt  Pike  Putnam  Sangamon  Schuyler  Scott  Shelby  St  Clair  Stark  Stephenson  Tazewell  Winnebago and Woodford   Governor Blagojevich has already declared a state disaster for the affected areas       The severe winter storm moved from the St  Louis Metro East area through Central Illinois and into Northern Illinois   It has resulted in record or near record snowfall in some counties and extraordinary ice formation on roads  electric power distribution systems  trees  and other structures in many other counties in the State of Illinois   The storm disrupted power to hundreds of thousands of households and businesses throughout the stricken area   State and local emergency workers along with private organizations continue to work around the clock to restore power  provide shelter and maintain emergency services       Devastating storms in the spring and summer depleted the resources of many of the local governments affected by this most recent storm   Even those not affected by the earlier storms lack the resources to respond adequately to the past week s record snowfall and extraordinary ice formation  which is affecting their ability to protect public health and safety   Therefore  it is important that federal assistance be made available as soon as possible to help with the ongoing recovery efforts in this region of Illinois  The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is coordinating the state   s response       Mr  President  we respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the State of Illinois and the affected counties can receive federal disaster assistance to recover from this severe winter storm   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin
