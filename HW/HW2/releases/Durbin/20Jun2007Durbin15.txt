20  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   At a Senate Rules hearing today  U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  called on Congress to take meaningful action to restore public confidence in the Congressional elections process and pass The Fair Elections Now Act  Sen  Durbins bill would create a voluntary system that gives Senate candidates the option to stop dialing for dollars and attending fundraisers  without asking taxpayers to completely underwrite the process   I think the average American would be shocked if they knew how many hours a day a member of Congress has to spend raising money in order to stay competitive in their reelection campaigns  said Durbin  This needs to stop now  We need to spend more time focusing on the needs of the people we represent and less time on fundraising   How The Fair Elections Bill works    Participating candidates would be required to demonstrate sufficient public support to merit Fair Elections funding by raising qualifying contributions of  5 each from a minimum number of state residents  based on the population of the state     Having demonstrated their viability  the candidates would be eligible to receive Fair Elections funds  The amount would vary based on the population of the state  with the allocation for the primary equaling two thirds of the allocation for the general election  The allocations would also be adjusted for the cost differences in the various media markets covering each state    All candidates would also be able to raise seed money in amounts of no more than  100 per person to pay for campaign start up costs from a maximum number of people around the country that would be based on the number of residents in the state    Participants would receive vouchers for purchasing broadcast air time and would receive a 20  discount below the lowest unit cost on all advertising purchased near the end of the primary and general campaigns   What the Fair Elections Bill does    Doesnt burden the individual taxpayer because it is funded  in large part  by charges on spectrum usage fees    Doesnt limit free speech because it is a completely voluntary program    Discourages self financed millionaires because it matches them dollar for dollar if they outspend a candidate in the Fair Elections program    Discourages 527s because it matches them dollar for dollar if they outspend a candidate in the Fair Elections program    The first panel to testify at todays hearing consisted of Sen  Mitch McConnell  an opponent of Durbin s bill   Sen  Arlen Specter  a cosponsor of Durbin s bill  and Senator Durbin  The members then heard testimony from former FEC counsel  Stephen Hoersting  former FEC Chairman  Scott Thomas  Public Campaign CEO  Nick Nyhart  former Senator Warren Rudman  and former Stride Rite Chairman  Arnold Hiatt   The Fair Elections Now Act is modeled after the Fair Elections type systems that have already been implemented at the state and local levels such as those in Arizona and Maine and is supported by a wide range of organizations  including Americans for Campaign Reform  Brennan Center for Justice  Common Cause  Democracy 21  Democracy Matters  Public Campaign  Public Citizen
