June 13  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      Just hours after a destructive insect known as the Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  was discovered in Kane County  Illinois  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  called on the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to develop a plan to curb the spread of this pest and report on their progress within fifteen days       The Emerald Ash Borer is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees    ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  Infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years          The discovery of the Emerald Ash Borer in Kane County is troubling news   Illinois has more than 131 million ash trees  with about 20 percent of the trees in the Chicago area     said Durbin     In the past few years  this insect has killed tens of millions of trees throughout the Midwest  and we need to get ahead of this infestation   I have called on the U S  Department of Agriculture to work with Illinois officials to develop a plan to meet this challenge             It   s crucial that we act quickly to stop this infestation before it permanently alters the Illinois landscape     said Senator Obama     Senator Durbin and I will do everything we can to prevent this pest from having the same devastating effect it had in other Midwestern states          In a letter sent today to the head of USDA   s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  Durbin wrote     As you know  time is of the essence   I would appreciate receiving a report within 15 days describing the specific plans APHIS will implement to combat EAB in Northern Illinois and the timelines that will guide the agency   s response   Specifically  I would like to know what resources APHIS will commit to this discovery of emerald ash borer          In a second letter sent to the Appropriations Committee which both Senators Durbin and Obama signed  they wrote      To date  federal support for combating EAB has focused on eradication and limiting the spread    have yet to be adequately funded to control the pest  and it has continued to spread across Michigan  Indiana  Ohio and into Illinois  The research station believes that with a total investment of  2 6 million  substantial progress can be made on identifying techniques to suppress the EAB and slow its spread          The Emerald Ash Borer was first sighted in 2002 in Michigan   Forestry experts estimate that the Emerald Ash Borer has been responsible for the devastation of than 12 million ash trees in Michigan  Ohio  and Indiana       Text of letters below         June 13  2006   Dr  Ron DeHaven  Administrator  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  United States Department of Agriculture  4700 River Road  Riverdale  MD 20737   Dear Dr  DeHaven    The recent discovery of the invasive pest known as the emerald ash borer  EAB  in Kane County is a great concern   The discovery of EAB in Kane County represents a potential threat to the ash population of Northern Illinois as well as to the nursery industry of Kane County  which ranks first in the state in revenue and is a significant source of employment       I appreciate the ongoing efforts of the United States Department of Agriculture   s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to collaborate with the Illinois Department of Agriculture  IDOA  in detecting and identifying the presence of emerald ash borer and activating a state federal local emerald ash borer response plan   The activation of IDOA   s emerald ash borer response plan has initiated a public awareness campaign and an initial survey of the extent of the ash borer   s presence in Northern Illinois   I urge APHIS to continue to work with its federal  state  and local partners to control and eventually eradicate this invasive pest  and to devote every resource needed to achieve that goal swiftly       As the federal agency responsible for responding to the presence of the emerald ash borer  APHIS tested and confirmed the EAB specimen collected by IDOA   I understand you are working with state and local agencies to establish protocols to control and eradicate the pest   You can count on my assistance in your efforts to achieve that goal       As you know  time is of the essence   I would appreciate receiving a report within 15 days describing the specific plans APHIS will implement to combat EAB in Northern Illinois and the timelines that will guide the agency   s response   Specifically  I would like to know what resources APHIS will commit to this discovery of emerald ash borer   In addition  please send me a review of APHIS    emerald ash borer activities since the discoveries of EAB in Michigan in 2002  so that we can better understand the range of assistance USDA can provide       I thank you again for your efforts to contain and eradicate this invasive pest   I look forward to hearing from you shortly as all of us work together to meet this challenge         June 13  2006   The Honorable Conrad Burns  Chairman  Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior  187 Dirksen Senate Office Building     The Honorable Byron Dorgan  Ranking Member  Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior  322 Hart Senate Office Building     Dear Senators Burns and Dorgan    As the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior considers its budget for FY2007  we ask that you include  2 6 million for the Forest and Rangeland Research program at the U S  Forest Service for Emerald Ash Borer research and technology development   An emerald ash borer  EAB  infestation is currently plaguing Michigan  Indiana  and Ohio  and has just been identified in Illinois   This funding would assist the Northern Research Station in developing technology to control the pest       To date  federal support for combating EAB has focused on eradication and limiting the spread of EAB from affected states through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  at the Department of Agriculture    Unfortunately  EAB activities at APHIS have yet to be adequately funded to control the pest  and it has continued to spread across Michigan  Indiana  Ohio and into Illinois       There has been less focus on the science being conducted by the Forest Service which seeks to suppress the pest   In FY2005  the Northern Research Station budget for EAB research was  1 1 million  and in FY2006 it received  1 2 million   The research station believes that with a total investment of  2 6 million  substantial progress can be made on identifying techniques to suppress the EAB and slow its spread       Until recently  the country had been fortunate that the Emerald Ash Borer infestation was bounded to the north  east  and west by three of the Great Lakes  which had helped facilitate mitigation efforts   However  we see with the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer west into Illinois recently  additional funding for EAB research is essential not only to contain the pest  but begin to suppress it   For these reasons  we ask that you consider this additional funding EAB science research through the Forest Service in FY2007
