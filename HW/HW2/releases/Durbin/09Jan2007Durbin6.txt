9  2007    Washington DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced that the Department of Transportation has selected United Airlines to be the first airline to offer direct daily service between Dulles International Airport  outside Washington  DC  and Beijing Capital International Airport   Several major airlines  including American  Continental and Northwest airlines  were in competition for the rights to the new service  which is expected to generate  100 million annually in revenue for United Airlines        China is emerging as one of the strongest markets for U S  businesses in the world  The airline that provides the connection between U S  business travelers and this emerging market will reap tremendous rewards   said Durbin   This service is also important for improving U S  China relations  As China grows in global importance  face to face communications between our public leaders will become increasingly critical        In September  Durbin and U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  wrote a letter to the Acting Secretary of the DOT  Maria Cino  supporting United   s application   In the letter  the Senators stressed that the new service would benefit local airline passengers   With the recently approved service between Springfield and Washington Dulles  many business and government leaders in Springfield will be able to utilize the capital to capital to capital service  creating and strengthening important ties between the State of Illinois  Washington  and China       United will operate this route using a 347   seat Boeing 747   400a jet   Service will begin March 27th  2007 with one daily roundtrip between Dulles and Beijing   The service will allow Washington  DC  to join 28 other world capitals in offering nonstop service to Beijing       Text of letter below          September 27  2006      The Honorable Maria Cino  Acting Secretary  U S  Department of Transportation  400 7th Street  NW  Washington  DC 20590   Dear Secretary Cino    We are writing in support of United Airlines    application for new airline service between the United States and China   United Airlines is applying to fly from its Washington Dulles hub to Beijing         United service from Washington to Beijing will establish the first direct service from the U S  Capital to the Chinese Capital  and would be important for improving U S  China relations   Service from capital to capital should make it easier to connect our public leaders to those in China and that  in turn  should help us better communicate on the varied economic and foreign policy discussions and debates that take place between our two governments   As China grows in global importance  face to face communications between our public leaders will become increasingly critical        United is currently in negotiations with the City of Springfield  Illinois to establish air service between Springfield and Washington Dulles   If this service were to be established  many business and government leaders in Springfield would utilize the capital to capital to capital service  creating and strengthening important ties between the State of Illinois  Washington  and China          We are also aware of a similar application by American Airlines to establish air service to China from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport   This proposed route will also serve communities in downstate Illinois  as the cities of Moline  Peoria  and Champaign have direct service to Dallas Fort Worth   We ask that you carefully consider American Airlines    application for future consideration       Thank you for your consideration of our request and please feel free to contact us with questions or comments   We look forward to working with you on this and other important transportation matters       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin   United States Senator   Barack Obama                                      United States Senator
