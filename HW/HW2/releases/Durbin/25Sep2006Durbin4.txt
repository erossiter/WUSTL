SECURE CHICAGO S FIRST SIGNIFICANT PORT SECURITY GRANT OF MORE THAN  11 MILLION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Monday  September 25  2006       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has awarded  11 496 456 in federal grant funding to ports in the Chicago area    Today s announcement comes just months after Durbin met with and wrote to Department of Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff  urging him to add the City of Chicago to DHS list of critical seaports  Those cities on the critical seaports list are eligible to apply for more than  168 million in port security grant funding for the protection of critical port infrastructure from terrorism   This is the first year that Chicago was included on that list since 2003  and the first year it received significant funding   I commend the decision made by DHS to award Chicago with this critical port funding  said Durbin   In February  I met with DHS Secretary Chertoff and asked him to restore Chicago to the list of critical seaports and provide port security funding  Today  the Administration took an important step in acknowledging the City of Chicagos need for adequate homeland security funding   In Durbins letter to Secretary Chertoff he noted  I am concerned that last year  the port of Chicago was not included among the top 66 ports eligible to apply for port security grants even though it is undoubtedly one of the top ports in the nation and the world   Chertoff responded to Durbins port security concerns in a June 28th letter  announcing that as to the Port of Chicago and its eligibility for the FY 2006 Port Security Grant Program  PSGP   the FY 2006 PSGP Guidance and eligibility list will be released in a few days and Chicago will be eligible for grants under this program   In 2002  of the over  58 million requested by the City of Chicago  zero was awarded   In 2004  of the over  14 million requested  zero was awarded   The one project which received an award in the last four years was made in the amount of  300 000  a partial award made to the Chicago Police Department for a year round patrol   The award was so small that the CPD was unable to move forward with the proposed security measures   Chicago Port Security grant requests total  84 million over the past four years and include requests for surveillance equipment for the Chicago and Calumet River  Year Round Patrol Vessel for the Chicago Police Department and a Chicago Marine Safety Station   The nations 100 most critical seaports  representing 95 percent of the foreign waterborne commerce of the United States  are eligible to participate in the port grant program  From 2002 to 2005  DHS provided more than  706 million through this program  The funding is dispersed through the DHS Office of Grants and Trainings Infrastructure Protection Program   The City of Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications received  7 529 016  the City of Joliet received  551 105  the Illinois International Port District received  3 416 335   The City of Chicago will spend its funds enhancing surveillance and sensor technology  access control  intrusion barriers  and emergency response equipment      Text of letter below   February 15  2006  The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff   Thank you for agreeing to meet with me on Thursday   At the meeting I would like to discuss your departments Fiscal Year 2007 budget  various Illinois homeland security requests  and evacuation planning legislation   I am concerned that the Department of Homeland Securitys FY 2007 budget decreases first responder and homeland security funding by almost  400 million and cuts funding streams to police  firefighters and emergency managers    For example  the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program is eliminated and assistance to firefighters is cut by over  350 million   These cuts to cities  first responders compound the concern I have expressed previously that the City of Chicago  the third largest city in the country and the hub of the nations transportation network  has not received sufficient funds to secure its infrastructure and citizens   Specifically  I am concerned that last year  the port of Chicago was not included among the top 66 ports eligible to apply for port security grants even though it is undoubtedly one of the top ports in the nation and the world   I am also troubled that Chicago was not certified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an urban search and rescue team and that the citys first responders do not have interoperable communications equipment   I would also like to discuss with you legislation I have introduced  S  2043  the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act  to better prepare our cities and states to respond to disasters   As we witnessed in the wake of recent natural disasters  our cities face special challenges and vulnerabilities when disaster strikes   Part of disaster preparation at any level of government includes having well prepared and practiced evacuation plans   Existing grant programs for evacuations only provide sufficient funding for personnel  and not for proper planning and staging of evacuations   This bill would authorize a five year grant program that will provide local governments with the funds to develop comprehensive evacuation plans  stage drills and exercises to perfect evacuation procedures  and stockpile materials to supply evacuation staging areas and evacuation routes   I hope that we can discuss these matters in detail on Thursday in order to ensure that citizens in Illinois and across the nation have the tools to prevent disasters and to protect their citizens should emergencies occur   Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator
