CONGRESS MUST  EASE THE COLLEGE DEBT SQUEEZE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wednesday  June 28  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on Congress to    ease the college debt squeeze    on millions of students saddled by thousands of dollars in loans and interest payments   Durbin said students will accumulate even more debt starting on July 1st because interest rates on college loans will increase by one of the largest rate hikes in history   Durbin is the author of the Reverse the Raid on Student Aid Act of 2006  RRSA Act   a bill that will cut this interest rate hike in half on college loans for student borrowers with the most financial need and for parent borrowers          The Senate leadership is failing college students in Illinois and all across America     Durbin said      Republicans cut  12 billion from student aid     the largest single cut in financial aid programs in history to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans    The leadership cannot continue to place the burden of paying for tax cuts for the richest Americans on the backs of students from middle class families  Higher interest rates shortchange our children   s future and threaten our country s ability to remain competitive in the global marketplace          Durbin   s bill cuts interest rates in half  from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent  for students with subsidized loans   which go to students with the most financial need   and from 8 5 percent to 4 25 percent for parent borrowers  starting July 1  2006   If interest rates were cut in half  Illinois college graduates would save  3 220 over the ten year life of their loans          We must make it a priority to ease the college debt squeeze on students   Democrats are ready to invest in our students    future by increasing Pell Grants  cutting student and parent loan interest rates by 50 percent and allowing students to consolidate their loans while they are still in school     Durbin said       On eve of one of the largest interest rate hikes on outstanding student loans  Durbin joined his colleagues in releasing a report which provides a state by state analysis of rising college costs and student debt    The finding in the report  Durbin noted  demonstrate why there is an immediate need for Congress to invest in higher education and to boost affordable college opportunities for all Americans   In Illinois  the report found     The Cost of College Has Soared   Between the 2000 01 and 2004 05 school years  the cost of attendance at 4 year public colleges in Illinois increased 34   from  9 533 to  12 803 for tuition  fees  room and board   The cost of attendance at 4 year private colleges in Illinois increased 23  from  21 941 to  26 966 for tuition  fees  room and board        Median Family Incomes Have Remained Stagnant   While public college costs have increased 34   median family incomes in Illinois have increased only 0  since 2000   After financial aid is taken into account  30  of the average family income in Illinois is needed to pay for tuition at 4 year public college        Federal Student Aid Has Eroded Over Time   In Illinois the maximum Pell grant  which has remained at  4 050 for the past four years  covered only 32  percent of the average public 4 year tuition  fees  room and board in 2004 2005    down from 47  percent in 1986 1987   In 1975 1976  77 percent of federal aid going to students nationally was in the form of grants  and only 20 percent was loans   In 2004 2005  it was 70 percent loans  20 percent grants        Students Have Taken on More Debt to Pay for College   More students are leaving college in debt   In 2004  nearly two thirds of all 4 year college graduates nationwide had loan debt  compared with less than one third of graduates in 1993   In Illinois  66  of undergraduates took out loans to finance their college education   The average student graduating from a four year college in Illinois owed  16 104 on graduation day in 2004
