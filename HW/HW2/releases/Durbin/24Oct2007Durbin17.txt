with FutureGen Alliance and Illinois Officials to Discuss Proposed FutureGen Sites                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Wednesday  October 24  2007       U S  Senator Dick Durbin today met with the CEO of the FutureGen Alliance  Mike Mudd  and the Director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity  Jack Lavin  to discuss the proposed plans for locating the FutureGen project in downstate Illinois  Four sites are still under consideration for the project  Mattoon  Illinois  Tuscola  Illinois  Jewett  Texas  and Odessa  Texas  I am encouraged by the progress that has been made toward securing the FutureGen project for downstate Illinois  an area that has the coal and the commitment needed to make this project a success  said Durbin  Both Illinois sites have received support from other states  Pennsylvania  Indiana and Kentucky  that recognize the advantages that our state has in both geology and existing infrastructure  I have been working closely with Senator Obama and Representative Costello to bring this project to Illinois and with a final announcement expected in the coming months  I will continue to do everything in my power to secure the FutureGen project for Illinois  FutureGen will be a  1 5 billion government industry project which will produce the first emissions free coal generation plant of its kind  It is a demonstration for gasifying coal  converting it to hydrogen and carbon monoxide   producing hydrogen and electricity  capturing carbon dioxide  and sequestering it underground  The plant would generate approximately 275 MW of electricity  which is enough to supply 150 000 homes  Facility construction would begin in 2010  with full scale operation beginning in 2013  The project is a joint venture between DOE and the FutureGen Alliance  a non profit consortium of coal producers and energy generators  Illinois has 38 billion tons of recoverable bituminous coal reserves  the largest in the nation  one eighth of the total U S  coal reserves  containing more energy than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined   The valuable mineral underlies 65 percent of the states surface  Coal transportation costs in Texas would be millions of dollars more expensive per year  The Illinois sites have an abundant and reliable supply of water and are geologically suited for the carbon trapping technology that the FutureGen project would need to develop  Illinois is home to oil and gas reserves and deep saline aquifers that can capture and sequester carbon dioxide  In addition  Southern Illinois University operates its Coal Research Center in Carbondale  one of the top such centers in the country   which conducts a wide range of studies that deal with the commercial development of coal  The centers work includes improvements of coal cleaning processes  the reduction of air pollution from coal fired power plants  the reduction of solid waste residues from coal burning  and the development of products from those residues  In early December of 2005  Secretary Bodman announced that the Department of Energy would be moving forward with the project  after signing an agreement with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance  a group of coal and energy companies with investment commitments to the project  The FutureGen Initiative was initially announced by President Bush in February 2003  Over the last year  site selection  design activities  and environmental analyses has laid the groundwork for final project design  construction  and operation  Best and final offers from the four sites were submitted on August 1  2007 and the FutureGen Alliance Board is expected to make a final site selection before the end of 2007


