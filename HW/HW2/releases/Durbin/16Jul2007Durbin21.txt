16  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to Benjamin Grumbles  Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water at the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to express his strong opposition to a permit that will allow BPs Whiting refinery in Indiana to discharge more pollution into Lake Michigan  The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System  NPDES  permit  recently approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management  IDEM   will allow BP to increase ammonia and sludge pollution discharges into Lake Michigan by 50 percent and 35 percent respectively  In todays letter Durbin said  Lake Michigan is one of our nations greatest natural resources and serves as the drinking water supply for over 40 million people  including the entire Chicago metropolitan area  supports a significant commercial fishing industry  and supports numerous recreational activities It is our responsibility to support efforts to restore  rather than further degrade Lake Michigan  We should be working toward the goal of eliminating pollution in this fresh water ecosystem  The permit runs counter to the Clean Water Act and the State of Indianas anti degradation policy  A specific provision in the federal Clean Water Act prohibits any downgrade in water quality near a pollution source even if discharge limits are met  In today s letter  Durbin asked EPA  which has authority over state environmental agencies  to  justify their decision to grant the permit  answer to the harmful environmental impact of granting it  explain the legality of the permit under the Clean Water Act  Senator Durbin also joined with Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  in sending a letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen L  Johnson expressing strong concern over the issuance of the permit and requesting for a hold to be placed on the permit until certain assurances have been met   The text of the letters appears below    July 16  2007   Benjamin Grumbles  Assistant Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  Office of Water  4101M   1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20460 Dear Assistant Administrator Grumbles   I write in strong opposition to a proposed National Pollution Discharge Elimination System  NPDES  permit approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management  IDEM  that will allow BPs Whiting refinery in Indiana to discharge more pollution into Lake Michigan  This permit will allow BP to increase ammonia and sludge pollution discharges into Lake Michigan by 50 percent and 35 percent respectively   The goal of the Clean Water Act  CWA  is to minimize and eventually eliminate the discharge of pollutants into our rivers and lakes  As you know  the anti backsliding regulation prohibits the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  from reissuing NPDES permits that allow more pollutant discharge than was allowed in the previous permit   The NPDES permit issued to BP by IDEM is clearly out of step with federal regulation as well as the State of Indianas anti degradation policy  With respect to the authority provided to EPA by Section 401 of the CWA  please provide specific answers to the following questions  To what extent has EPA been involved with and reviewed the IDEMs proposed permit for the Whiting BP refinery expansion proposal  On what basis did EPA allow or not object to IDEMs issuance of this permit    How does EPA reconcile the terms of this proposed permit with the anti backsliding and or anti degradation language of the CWA    News reports identify a space constraint at the BP facility as an impediment to reducing ammonia and sludge waste from the proposed expanded facility  Has EPA examined whether BP has the capability to increase the on site wastewater treatment facility to eliminate the additional pollution expected by this facilitys expansion  Does EPA believe that such a space limitation justifies the increased levels of pollution into Lake Michigan    News reports also identify economic growth as a justification for the expanded plant  Does the EPA believe that economic growth and environmental protection are contradictory  If not  under what provisions or implementing regulations of the CWA did EPA allow or not object to the issuance of this permit    In this regard  what was the analytical rationale for EPAs allowance or lack of objection    Is it EPAs intent to allow a permit that runs counter to the goals of the CWA  especially in a situation where the affected industry has the technological capability to eliminate the pollution covered by this proposed permit    What is EPAs understanding of the cumulative environmental impact of an additional 578 160 pounds per year of ammonia that will be dumped into Lake Michigan    What is EPAs understanding of the cumulative impacts on the Lake Michigan ecosystem of the nearly 2 million additional pounds of sludge that will be allowed by this proposed permit    To what extent has EPA examined the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed refinery expansion including the emissions of greenhouse gasses  mercury emission releases as well as mercury contamination is suspended solids and chlorides    What is EPAs understanding of the cumulative impact on the Lake Michigan ecosystem of the anticipated new emissions of mercury that could be allowed by this plants expansion    Does EPA plan to object to IDEMs issuance of any other permits until the above concerns regarding the NPDES permit are fully addressed   Lake Michigan is one of our nations greatest natural resources and serves as the drinking water supply for over 40 million people  including the entire Chicago metropolitan area  supports a significant commercial fishing industry  and supports numerous recreational activities  Pollution from industrial  agricultural and municipal sources already poses a serious threat to the ecological health of the Great Lakes ecosystem  It is our responsibility to support efforts to restore  rather than further degrade Lake Michigan  We should be working toward the goal of eliminating pollution in this fresh water ecosystem   I appreciate your immediate attention and response to this issue  Sincerely     Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator  Cc  The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  EPA   July 16  2007 The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington  DC 20460 Dear Administrator Johnson  We are writing to express our strong concern over the Indiana Department of Environmental Managements recent decision to allow BP PLCs Whiting  Indiana facility to increase the amount of ammonia and sludge they can dump into Lake Michigan daily by 50  and 35   respectively  This new permit will allow BP to dump an average of 1 584 pounds of ammonia and 4 925 pounds of sludge daily into Lake Michigan  The Great Lakes account for 95  of the United States surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans  Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90  of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  we are shocked that the EPA has allowed this permit to go forward  As you know  Section 401 of the Clean Water Act grants the U S  Environmental Protection Agency oversight authority over state environmental agencies  We respectfully request that you put a hold on the new permit until we have assurances that 1  As authorized under Section 402 d  of the Clean Water Act  Indianas granting of the permit was reviewed by the EPA and did not meet the standards for objection as being outside the guidelines and requirements of the Clean Water Act  2  As authorized by Section 402 o  of the Clean Water Act  the permit was not renewed  reissued  or modified containing efflulent limitations which are comparable to effluent limitations in the previous permit  3  As authorized by Section 301 b  2  A  of the Clean Water Act  the permit meets the Best Available Technologies requirement  4  Water Quality in Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes will not be adversely affected by the new allowances for ammonia and sludge dumping by BP Whiting  In May of 2004  President Bush issued an executive order to establishment a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in order to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes  In the executive order  the President stated that it is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship  We agree with the President that the Great Lakes are one of our nations greatest treasures  and we should not allow new dumping into them  Allowing the dumping of more ammonia and sludge into Lake Michigan does not encourage community stewardship  and instead sets back the progress we have made to clean up these vital elements of Americas commercial  recreational  and environmental life  We remain steadfastly opposed to an increase in dumping in Lake Michigan or any of the Great Lakes  and we look forward to your response to our request      Sincerely     Richard J  Durbin   United States Senator
