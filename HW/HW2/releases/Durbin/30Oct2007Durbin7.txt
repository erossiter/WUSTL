Tuesday  October 30  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   Several Illinois members of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing  AACN  today presented U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  with an Appreciation Award in recognition of his efforts to highlight the need for new nurses and nurse faculty  The award is presented to Members of Congress who have made tremendous strides for nursing education and research through their legislative efforts  I am honored to accept this award from the American Association of Colleges of Nusing  said Durbin  Nurses care for our children and grandchildren  our parents and other loved ones  We know the difference nurses make in our lives  and increasingly we are noticing the difference when we do not have enough of these dedicated men and women when we need them most  I will continue to work in the Senate to see that more is done to boost our nursing schools in order to train the nurses we will need in the years to come  Last week  the Senate approved legislation to address one of the major causes of the nationwide nursing shortage  an insufficient number of nurse educators  by providing grants to colleges to improve their ability to educate nursing students  The legislation  added as an amendment to the Labor  Health and Human Services Appropriations bill  would create and fund a program modeled after the Nurse Education  Expansion  and Development  NEED  Act  which Durbin introduced on January 31  2007  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing is the only national organization dedicated exclusively to furthering baccalaureate and graduate nursing education  It represents more than 600 schools of nursing at public and private universities and senior colleges nationwide which offer a mix of baccalaureate  graduate  and post graduate programs  The dean or other chief administrative nurse in the nursing program serves as representative to AACN  Last year  the AACN surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing  They found that 66  of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty  An additional 15  said they were fully staffed but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained  It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 through 2012  reducing nursing faculty while the need for qualified nurses continues to increase  In Illinois  the number of qualified applicants being denied admission to nursing schools is growing  From 2002 through 2003  there were 502 qualified students rejected from Illinois nursing schools  Last year  there were 1 900 students turned away because of lack of faculty and resources  And yet  in spite of the increasing number of eligible nursing school applicants  Illinois could be facing a shortage of over 21 000 nurses by 2020 because of a lack of nursing faculty  Members of the AACN in attendance at todays award presentation included   University of Saint Francis Illinois
