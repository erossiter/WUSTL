BIPARTISAN DURBIN AMENDMENT TO FULLY FUND BRAIN INJURY TREATMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thursday  September 7  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      The Senate today approved a bipartisan amendment sponsored by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  to fully fund the treatment of traumatic brain injuries   The amendment  which was offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  will allocate an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007       The leading organization within the Department of Defense for treating military men and women afflicted by this injury is the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center located at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington  D C  Several other sites across the country also serve as treatments centers in Texas  California  Virginia  Florida  North Carolina  and Minnesota       Durbin said   I am very pleased that the Senate supported our troops who have sustained brain injuries by approving this amendment  While money is tight  this is what many are calling the  signature wound  in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and treatment for these debilitating wounds should be fully funded   said Durbin   These funds will enable the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center to give every soldier the treatment they deserve and decrease brain injury related disability        The Brain Injury Center   s current budget is  14 million  but the Defense Appropriations bill reduced the funding for Brain Injury Center by 50   leaving the center  7 million short   According to Durbin  the situation is even worse because the Brain Injury Center has requested  19 million for the coming year  citing the growing number of patients  the cost of long term care  current staffing requirements  and the need for research to improve treatment and prevention   Durbin   s amendment adds  12 million  bringing funding up to the full  19 million level          The nature of combat in Iraq  where insurgents often use roadside bombs instead of bullets  produces more frequent brain injuries than we have seen in previous wars  In Vietnam and previous 20th Century wars  brain injuries accounted for just 12 percent of injuries  in Iraq and Afghanistan  brain injuries account for 22 percent of injuries     noted Durbin     More than 1 700 of those wounded in Iraq have sustained brain injuries  Half of these injuries are severe enough to permanently impair thinking  memory  mood  behavior and the ability to work       According to a recent study by researchers at Harvard and Columbia  it is estimated that the cost of medical treatment for those individuals with brain injuries from the Iraq war will be at least  14 billion over the next 20 years       Durbin said the Brain Injury Center is completely different from other Brain Injury programs and initiatives because it focuses on the well being of those who put themselves in harm   s way for our country  While the focus is treatment  it links injured soldiers to clinical studies where cutting edge treatments are developed   And it does this with all members of the military   both active duty military personnel and reservists  No other brain center combines treatment and clinical studies for the immediate benefit of American servicemembers   The Brain Injury Center also focuses on the unique needs of military and veteran beneficiaries including return to duty considerations  continuity of care with military and veterans    hospitals  and the TRICARE health system       Durbin was joined by U S  Senator George Allen  R VA  and others in offering the amendment  The Veterans of Foreign Wars  Disabled American Veterans  the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  the National Military Families Association  the American Legion  and the Blinded Veterans Association all support an increase in funding for the Brain Injury Center          Our military men and women have made tremendous sacrifices for this country  We owe them the best medical care possible     said Durbin
