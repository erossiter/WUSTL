July 3  2007   QUINCY  IL   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  hosted a listening session today with representatives and leaders from Illinois agriculture industry to discuss provisions for commodity  nutrition  conservation and other programs likely to be included in the 2007 Farm Bill  Durbin  a member of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee  also discussed the challenges ahead in reauthorizing the current Farm Bill  which expires in September        I believe the single most significant factor will be the budget  Durbin said  Were writing this bill during a time of record deficits rather than the surpluses we had on hand during the writing of the 2002 Farm Bill  and there is going to be competition for limited funds for education  medical research  social services  and other core functions  Renewable energy will be a critical element of the 2007 Farm Bill  Durbin supports a renewable energy program that provides grants to farmers and rural small businesses interested in investing in wind and biofuels projects  anaerobic digesters  or energy efficiency projects  We ought to continue adding to the momentum behind ethanol and biodiesel and other renewable sources of energy  Durbin said  Durbin is hoping to add biofuels and broadband legislation to the Senate Farm Bill  Durbin introduced legislation last month that would increase biodiesel production nearly three fold over current levels to 1 25 billion gallons in 2012  Biodiesel burns far cleaner then petrol diesel and emits fewer unburned hydrocarbons  carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide  all of which contribute to global warming  The Senate Agriculture Committee has already begun meeting to discuss proposals for the 2007 Farm Bill and hopes to have the bill ready for floor action later this month or immediately following the August recess  While the 2002 Farm Bill was a vast improvement on the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill  there are still several changes that need to be made to craft the best bill for Illinois farmers  Durbin said  One thing weve identified for improvement is our policy for dealing with natural disasters  The current Farm Bill does not do a very good job of protecting against yield losses  which lead to frequent need of ad hoc disaster assistance  Corn and bean farmers in Illinois and the Midwest do not receive the same level of support through the crop insurance system that farmers in other parts of the country do  That leaves Illinois farmers at risk when they have yield loss  such as during the 2005 drought in parts of Northeast and Western Illinois  Were looking at several proposals which would help protect against yield loss  Durbin said  I believe that is an important goal in our current environment of high grain prices  As the Farm Bill discussions begin  Durbin will be looking at ways to promote economic growth  One of my top priorities is bridging the digital divide by bringing broadband access to rural parts of the state  Durbin said  There is a clear issue here of economic development  For small towns and rural areas to attract businesses and qualified people  communities need to offer access to broadband  Durbin introduced legislation earlier this year  the Connect the Nation Act of 2007  S  1190   to encourage the rapid deployment of high quality  affordable broadband internet service  especially in rural areas  The legislation creates a matching grant program to be administered through the Department of Commerce to assist statewide or regional public private partnerships increase broadband access  map resources and build demand  Durbin received the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers Union in September for his attention to issues affecting rural America


