OIL WINDFALL PROFITS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO CONSUMERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tuesday  October 11  2005      IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced new legislation to help channel record oil company profits back to American families       Durbin   s Windfall Profits Tax bill would impose an excise tax on integrated oil and gas companies equal to 50  of their profits over a baseline price of  40 per barrel of oil   The  40 baseline was established by taking the average price of oil in the year 2004   In 2004  oil and gas companies were already realizing record profits       The revenue would be used to fund a consumer rebate  provide additional resources to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  provide for a manufacturers incentive to improve the fuel efficiency of automobiles and provide additional revenue to the Highway Trust Fund to improve roadways       The Washington Post recently reported that refineries have recognized a 255  increase in the profits they realize from the sale of one gallon of gasoline   Last year  refiners received 27 cents for every gallon of gasoline purchased by Illinois consumers  but this year  they are profiting nearly one dollar for every gallon          Oil companies are swimming in windfall profits and American consumers are sinking   My bill takes a portion of the big oil companies    unprecedented profits and returns the revenue to the consumers who have been on the losing end of the recent run up in gas prices          Durbin   s Windfall Profits Tax bill would distribute revenue as follows      Consumer Rebate   The bill provides for a  150 consumer rebate in the first year   In subsequent years  the amount of the tax rebate would be more or less depending on the price of crude oil  based on 60  of the revenue generated from the Windfall Profits Tax      LIHEAP funding   The bill creates a LIHEAP trust fund to help low income families pay their heating bills   In the first year  revenue from the Windfall Profits Tax would be transferred into the trust fund equal to  3 1 billion  the emergency amount sought by 50 Senators in a recent vote   In subsequent years  the amount of revenue transferred into the trust fund would be 7 5  of the revenue generated   These funds would supplement annual appropriations to LIHEAP by Congress from the general treasury      Fuel Efficiency Standards   The legislation provides  1 billion annually to fund an auto manufacturing tax incentive for the production of advanced technology vehicles that improve fuel efficiency   Manufacturers could receive up to 50  of their qualified investments made in each taxable year  as long as they keep making fuel efficiency improvements  concluding with a 50  increase in the company   s average fuel economy over 10 years   Additionally  vehicle component manufacturers would qualify for a tax incentive if they make approved  higher efficiency components      Revenue for Highway Trust Fund   The remainder of the revenues available from the Windfall Profits Tax will be transferred into the Highway Trust Fund   This  extra  money would be made available to states to help fund highway improvements based on the current Highway Trust Fund formula  with 18 percent used for transit programs  States would not be required to use match money they receive from these resources       Durbin intends to introduce his Windfall Profits Tax bill when the Senate reconvenes after the Columbus Day recess          While I will introduce the Windfall Profits Tax bill to capture some of the enormous profits oil and gas companies are pulling in  in the long term  we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil   Consumers must demand more and better fuel efficient vehicles  At the same time  I will continue to fight for my CAFE standards legislation that is designed to get us back on track toward a cleaner  more efficient and less oil dependent energy future   Durbin said       For the third time in a matter of four years  Durbin has proposed setting a new ambitious and attainable fuel efficiency standard of 40 miles per gallon by 2015 for cars and certain light trucks  including sport utility vehicles  SUV s        Durbin said that the average fuel economy of our nation s cars and trucks has steadily declined since 1985 when the last fuel efficiency requirements ended   In 1975  when American cars were averaging 14 miles a gallon  Congress passed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  law  which required manufacturers to double the fuel economy of their vehicles to nearly 28 miles a gallon in 10 years       Durbin noted that many of the same arguments against new fuel efficiency standards     more expensive cars  impossible technical hurdles  loss of car making jobs     were raised back in 1975   I believe the auto industry and its engineers can meet this challenge  We made great strides toward energy efficiency more than 25 years ago when the first fuel efficiency standards became law  Detroit made safer cars with better technology  I believe they can do it again now   said Durbin
