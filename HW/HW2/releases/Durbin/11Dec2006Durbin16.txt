THE FUNERALS OF FALLEN HEROES ACT HEADED TO PRESIDENT TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Monday  December 11  2006          The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act  bi partisan legislation authored by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   was passed last week by the Senate and the House of Representatives and is headed to the President to be signed into law    Durbin said the Act will help put an end to the reprehensible actions of those who have insisted on disrupting military funerals across the nation   Senators Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Evan Bayh  D IN  and Kent Conrad  D ND  were original cosponsors of the legislation          Congress spoke with a clear voice when The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act was approved without any opposition     Durbin said      Our soldiers  our veterans and those fallen heroes who have sacrificed their lives for the good of our country deserve to be laid to rest with dignity   This is a victory for our military personnel and their families   The act respects our veterans and our Constitutional freedoms by addressing only conduct  and not content        In May 2006  Congress passed and the President signed into law the Respect for America   s Fallen Heroes Act  which prohibits demonstrations at and around federal cemeteries  However  there are only 121 federal cemeteries in the United States  Approximately 90 000 veterans are buried each year at federal cemeteries  which are covered by the law passed in May  The legislation would expand coverage of the demonstration ban to the funerals of 650 000 700 000 veterans who die each year in the United States       The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act would build on the current law by providing similar protection for the funerals of all deceased members or former members of the Armed Forces  not only at federal cemeteries but also at private cemeteries  funeral homes  and houses of worship       The National Military Family Association has endorsed the legislation because it bans    demonstrations in ALL military funerals  Grieving military families  who had made the ultimate sacrifice  should not be subjected to these intrusions   This legislation will provide military families the opportunity to mourn in a peaceful environment             As President of the Illinois Council of Chapters of the Military Officers Association of America  MOAA   I represent over 6 000 MOAA members  who live in our state  plus their family members and survivors  I believe that the 34 000 plus military retirees and all the other veterans in the state of Illinois would agree that federal legislation is needed to ban demonstrations at the funerals of all our veterans  wherever they are held     wrote retired U S  Army Colonel Aaron J  Wolfe       Under the legislation  it would be a criminal misdemeanor     punishable by a fine or up to one year in jail     for any person to  1  make any noise or diversion within the boundary of or within 150 feet of a military funeral location that intentionally disturbs the peace and good order of the funeral  or  2  intentionally impede access to or from the funeral within 300 feet of the funeral location       The legislation has also been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America  In a letter to Durbin  MOAA   s Director of Government Relations  retired Air Force Colonel Steven P  Strobridge  wrote     Those who have laid their lives on the line for our Nation deserve better than to have their families harassed by extremist elements in their hours of grief  We strongly support your efforts to protect them and their families  and pledge to assist however we can in securing enactment of your proposed legislation          The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act is consistent with the First Amendment according to University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment scholar Geoffrey Stone  and the bill is within Congress   s lawmaking power according to an analysis conducted by the Congressional Research Service
