                                                                                                                                                                                          Monday  November 21  2005    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Sens  Dick Durbin  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Richard Lugar  R IN  said today that Congress should act to help undocumented students by providing them with a pathway to legalize their immigration status and attend college  The senators have introduced S  2075  the Development  Relief  and Education for Alien Minors  DREAM  Act  legislation which would allow states to provide in state college tuition to undocumented students who grew up in the United States  and would also provide a path for students to earn legal permanent residency          This is about more than helping talented students pursue their goal of a higher education  this is about giving thousands of young students the freedom to dream of a future with genuine educational and employment opportunities     Durbin said     Without this legislation  these young people will have uncertain futures with no chance of continuing their education in America once they graduate from high school          The three senators noted that due to their undocumented status  tens of thousands of immigrant students with good grades are shut out of the American dream  told they cannot attend college without legal immigration status  The lawmakers said that many of these students had no choice in the matter  coming to the United States with their parents at a young age and have spent a significant portion of their lives living in America       Such is the case with a young woman from Illinois named Diana who was born in Michaocan  Mexico but was raised in Chicago  Seeking greater economic opportunities  her parents brought her to this country when she was 6  Today  her father works for a remodeling company earning  25 000 per year and her mother is a manager in a fast food restaurant earning  15 000 per year  The oldest of four children  Diana will be the first in her family to go on to college       Last year  Diana graduated at the top 5   of her class from a Chicago area high school with a GPA of 4 4 on a 4 0 scale  She is an Illinois State scholar and the recipient of numerous awards including the first place winner in the Annual Design and Drafting Contest awarded by American Design and Drafting Association  She is an active member of her church and she earned the Youth Leadership Award for community involvement two consecutive years in 2002 and 2003  Her outstanding academic record  coupled with her involvement in activities gained her acceptance into some of the top universities in the country  including Northwestern University  Although she was accepted to Northwestern University  she was denied access to financial aid so she was unable to attend          If we allow these roadblocks to higher education to persist  we ultimately hurt our nation because we will deprive our selves of future leaders  and the increased tax revenues and economic growth they would produce     said Durbin     Young people with great potential and ambitions would be limited to the employment options available to those without a college degree or worse  they would live on the fringes of society and the law          Currently  individuals who were brought to the U S  years ago as undocumented children and who have stayed in school and out of trouble since then have no way to legalize their immigration status and improve their lives  The DREAM Act would correct this problem by providing that upon graduation from high school  these young people     who have grown up in the United States     would be able to apply for six years of    conditional    legal immigration status which would be made permanent if they continue on to college or to serve in the military  The provisions of this bill are nearly identical to the version that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last year by a 16 3 vote       The bill has broad based support at both the national and state levels  Nationally  the bill is supported by a number of local advocacy organizations  including the Center for Community Change  the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  the National Immigration Law Center  the National Council of La Raza  the National Association for Bilingual Education  the League of United Latin American Citizens  People for the American Way  and the American Immigration Lawyers Association  In Illinois  over 15 community organizations  including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights  the Latino Organization of the Southwest and Chicago   s Erie Neighborhood House  voiced their support Durbin s bill  For the past several years  the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights have launched a state wide campaign to promote the passage of the bill  The coalition is comprised of 60 community based organizations throughout the state       Other cosponsors of the bipartisan legislation include Sens  Norm Coleman  R MN   Larry Craig  R ID   Mike Crapo  R ID   Mike DeWine  R OH   Russ Feingold  D WI   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Joseph Lieberman  D CT   John McCain  R AZ   and Barack Obama  D IL
