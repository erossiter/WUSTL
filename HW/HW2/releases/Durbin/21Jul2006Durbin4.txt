FROM U S  SENATOR DICK DURBIN   S EMERALD ASH BORER SUMMIT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Friday  July 21  2006    EVANSTON  IL    U S  Senator Dick Durbin delivered the following statement today during the Emerald Ash Borer Summit at Northwestern University       I   d like to thank everyone for being here for today   s Emerald Ash Borer Summit   The discovery of EAB in Kane County in mid June  in Wilmette one month later and here in Evanston just yesterday has generated a lot of attention       The battle against EAB begins in our backyards       Homeowners  business owners and local officials are on the front lines of this battle   We all need to pitch in   We need to get educated about this threat  through the websites and other materials the experts here today have put together   We need to take the initiative and look for troubled ash trees on our property and then we need to promptly report any findings through the proper 800 numbers       The tree loss we   re discovering today has been underway for more than 5 years   This is going to require a long term commitment and everyone needs to help   Don   t expect the government to solve this problem on its own       It   s going to take a coordinated strategy at all levels of government to address the EAB threat   Resources need to be gathered quickly so we can quickly and aggressively take action against EAB       For homeowners  the concern has been    what is the future of the ash tree planted in my front yard      for municipal and forestry officials it has been    how much is this going to cost my city and my department      for state officials    what is the effect on Illinois    economy and green spaces          Although the focus of our attention is   different  what we all have in common is our concern that this infestation has the potential to cause significant damage       When you watch the video clip we   re about to screen  you will see the potential damage this beetle can cause   That   s one street   Then you look at this map of at risk areas and you can try to multiply in your mind what we   re looking at statewide and nationwide if we don   t act quickly to manage this problem       Trees are an important resource     for those of you who remember the bleak landscapes caused by Dutch Elm Disease  you understand this is a significant matter   Our ash trees are important to the nursery industry  property values  asthetic pleasure  wildlife habitat  eco diversity   Illinois is home to more than 110 million of these trees   Their benefits are substantial  but hard to quantify       Before this species was discovered in Illinois  I had been following its deadly march across the Midwest   My colleagues Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana and Carl Levin of Michigan and I talked about what a menace EAB is in our region       When it hit  I knew that potential damage could be extensive   From our experience with the Asian Longhorned Beetle  we knew the value of a timely response       I   ve been working with state  local  and federal officials to increase public awareness of the issue and have secured an appropriations earmark to ensure that Illinois receives funding for EAB control   I will continue to work on this issue and hope we make the same kind of progress we did with Asian Longhorned Beetle in Chicago       Let   s compare these two critters        ALB is a big  fat  shiny  slow bug     we stopped his advance by chopping down 1 500 trees in the Chicagoland area     over a 9 year period  at a cost of  70 million  involving a quarantine of 25 square miles        EAB is small  quick and deadly   Since its discovery in Michigan in 2002 it has killed 20 million trees in an infested area of 19 000 square miles   Michigan alone has lost 10 million of its 700 million ash trees       I   d like to conclude this brief introduction by thanking the many good people  many of whom I recognize here today from our last EAB gatherings  for their hard work and long hours since the beetle was discovered in mid June       I would also like to thank the municipal leaders here today who want to learn what this beetle means for their communities and homeowners in their communities   I hope this summit helps answer some of your questions and puts you in contact with relevant people from the various agencies and organizations working on this problem
