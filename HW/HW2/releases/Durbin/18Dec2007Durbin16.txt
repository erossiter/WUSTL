December 18  2007       A bipartisan group of 48 Senators  lead by Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and John McCain  R AZ   today  asked the President to support an international arms embargo against Burma  In a letter to the White House  the Senators urged the President to press the UN Security Council to impose sanctions and to continue to support the efforts of thousands of Burmese citizens fighting for democratic change  In September  thousands of Burmese took to the streets to peacefully protest for change  the Senators wrote  Tragically  the Burmese military government violently suppressed the peaceful protests  ignoring the overwhelming demands for reform issued by its own people and by the global community  No responsible nation should provide weapons to a regime as reprehensible as the one found in Burma  The Senators asked the President to support binding measures that will stop the inflow of weapons to the Burmese military  weapons that the military uses to further its decades long junta  An international arms embargo has widespread support from human rights groups  members of the European Union and broad bipartisan support within the Congress  Text of the letter appears below   December 18  2007 Dear Mr  President  We write urging the U S  Permanent Representative to the United Nations to immediately press the UN Security Council to impose an international arms embargo against Burma  In September of this year  thousands of Burmese took to the streets to peacefully protest for change  Monks  lined by thousands of cheering and clapping supporters  marched through Burmas cities calling for an end to one of the worlds most repressive regimes  All the while  Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi remained under house arrest  where the military has shamefully detained her for most of the seventeen years since her party won a landslide election in 1990  Tragically  the Burmese military government violently suppressed the peaceful protests  ignoring the overwhelming demands for reform issued by its own people and by the global community  No responsible nation should provide weapons to a regime as reprehensible as the one found in Burma  The junta uses its weapons against its own people to enforce a climate of fear and oppression  Torture  forced labor  rape  and arbitrary imprisonment are widespread  and the regime has continued its brutal tactics year after year despite ongoing global condemnation  You and the First Lady have been strong public advocates for change in Burma  Your voices have joined many others from around the globe  including South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Czech president Vaclav Havel  both of whom have called for greater UN action on Burma  In December 2001  all living Nobel Peace Laureates gathered in Oslo to honor fellow Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi  And in May of this year  former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik released a letter he organized with 59 former heads of state from five continents calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all other Burmese political prisoners  Thousands of extraordinarily brave Burmese monks and everyday citizens insist that the time for peaceful change is now  We must continue to support their efforts  The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement in October calling for change inside Burma  While welcome  this non binding statement is not enough  It is time to halt the flow of arms to the Burmese military  arms that directly contribute to its grip on power  An international arms embargo is supported by numerous human rights groups and enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress  The European Union and many other countries have already imposed their own arms embargoes against Burma  and we believe you could elicit their strong support for a comprehensive international arms ban  We urge you to press the UN Security Council to impose such an embargo against Burma and thank you for the steps you have already taken on this issue  Sincerely  Dick Durbin  U S  Senator
