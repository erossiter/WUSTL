                                                                                                                                                                                            Thursday  July 27  2006           U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  met this week with officials from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Colonel John Drolet and Brigadier General Bruce Berwick  to discuss recent developments in funding for the Asian Carp barriers and the Chicago Shoreline Project        The carp approaching the northern section of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan have no natural predators  This invasive species threatens both the native fish and natural wildlife of the lake and in turn  the economy of the entire Great Lakes region     said Durbin      The  400 000 we secured in last month   s emergency spending bill and the provision approved in the water resources bill earlier this month provide us with both an immediate remedy and a long term solution that will help us avert a potentially devastating situation        Asian carp threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem because they consume large quantities of phytoplankton  which is critical to the stability of the ecosystem  Originally  they were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities  The carp have made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River   Asian carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds  and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day     During the meeting  Durbin discussed the  400 000 recently secured in the emergency spending bill for the Corps of Engineers to address the Asian Carp problem   The funding was included to pay for the operation of Barrier I  a temporary barrier that keeps the invasive species out of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan by emitting an electric current that deters the carp from passing through  Funding to maintain the operation of Barrier I has been almost entirely depleted and the Corps of Engineers indicated that without additional funding they would have to shut down the demonstration barrier   As a member of the conference committee that reconciled the differences between the House and Senate versions of the emergency spending bill  Senator Durbin   s efforts were crucial to ensuring that the funding which will maintain operation of the barrier  was kept in the final version of the bill     Earlier this month  Senators Durbin and Obama also helped to successfully include language in the Water Resources Development Act that passed the Senate to authorize the Corps of Engineers to treat Barriers I and II as one project   In addition  the language authorizes the Corps to upgrade the temporary barrier  Barrier I  into a permanent barrier at federal expense  to finish construction of Barrier II  to conduct a study of options that may reduce the efficacy of the barriers  and to provide credit to those states that contributed to the construction of Barrier II        WRDA includes a critical project that protects the Great Lakes ecosystem   Today  the Asian Carp threatens a  4 1 billion sport and commercial fishing industry in the Great Lakes   This legislation recognizes the threat of the Asian Carp by authorizing the permanent operation of the barrier system to prevent these fish from entering the waters of the Great Lakes     Durbin added     The demonstration barrier in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal was authorized in 1996 under the National Invasive Species Act to prevent non native species like the Asian Carp from moving between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes      During the meeting  Durbin also asked for a progress report on the Chicago Shoreline project   In 1999  Durbin helped negotiate a project cooperation agreement with the Army Corps on the Shoreline project  which provides storm damage protection to the Lake Michigan Shoreline and  in particular  Lake Shore Drive   The existing shoreline structures  built in the early 1900s  have deteriorated and no longer function to protect against storms  flooding and erosion   The Corps reported that the project is nearly 80  complete and they are continuing to work with the City of Chicago and State of Illinois to complete the necessary work
