Hold Chicago Field Hearing on Consumer Safety and Magnetic Toys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Monday  June 18  2007   CHICAGO  IL   United State Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Bobby Rush  D IL  held a Congressional hearing today on the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  and the dangers of magnetic toys  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Finance Services and General Government  Durbin has oversight authority over the CPSC  Rush serves as chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee responsible for consumer protection    Durbin and Rush decided to hold the hearing after the Chicago Tribune reported on incidences in which more than two dozen children faced life threatening injuries from playing with a popular magnetic toy  One child died as a result of the injury  The toy  Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets  uses powerful magnets which  if dislodged  can be swallowed and attract internally  causing severe internal injuries    The evasive actions of an uncooperative toy company and the limitations on the agency that oversees them has led to serious injuries of more than a dozen children  said Durbin  We are here today because these injuries could have been prevented  We need to find out exactly how the system should be changed so this doesnt happen again    My committee has jurisdiction over consumer product safety  said Rush  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce  Trade and Consumer Protection of the House Energy and Commerce Committee  who has held two hearings on childrens safety and the Consumer Product Safety Commission  including the Magnetix case    Although my subcommittee has vast jurisdiction  there is nothing more important than our mission to protect our children  If the federal government cannot deliver on this basic responsibility to help parents keep their children away from avoidable hazards  then we are not doing our job    The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for protecting individuals and families from dangerous products including toys  child safety seats and power tools  In November of 2005 a child from Washington state was killed after swallowing tiny magnets that had broken loose from a Magnetix toy  In March of 2006  the CPSC announced a voluntary recall of nearly 4 million sets of the popular toy  A voluntary recall asks the toy company to remove the toy from store shelves  but doesnt require it be done  Unfortunately  this made it possible for Rose Art Industries continued to sell the product  despite the known hazard  On April 19th  2007 an additional recall of another 4 million units was announced    Testifying at the hearing was Nancy Nord  Acting Chairwoman of CPSC  Dr  Kyran Quinlan of American Academy of Pediatrics  Lisa Madigan  Illinois Attorney General  Nancy Cowles  Executive Director of Kids in Danger  a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting children  and Sharon Henry  the mother of a child injured by the Magnetix Building Set    I am here today as a mother to tell the frightening story of what happened to my little boy  Deron  Mrs  Henry said  I am also here as a concerned consumer to ensure that this tragedy does not happen to anyone else    Two years ago  Deron Hyman swallowed magnets which had broken off of his Magnetix toy set  After complaining about stomach pains  Deron was rushed to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a perforated bowel  Deron survived  but may suffer from dowel obstructions and abdominal pain for the rest of his life    Following the stories in the Chicago Tribune  Senator Durbin sent a letter to Chairwoman Nord asking for information into the agencys handling of this case  The CPSCs response to the Durbin letter was made available at the hearing    A thoughtful reauthorization could strengthen the agencys ability to deal with some of the most vexing consumer product safety problems and emerging hazards  said Chairwoman Nord  Although the Commissions statutory authority is generally sufficient to deal with the vast majority of safety problems within our jurisdiction  I believe it is in the best interests of consumers to look to possible modernization of these statutes  In the long run  ensuring that the CPSC continues to maintain adequate statutory and resource tools not only will help address existing product safety issues  but also will enable us to continue to anticipate and understand emerging product safety hazards
