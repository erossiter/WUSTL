WOULD STOP THE SALE OF CELL PHONE CALL LISTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wednesday  January 18  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation to prohibit the sale  fraudulent transfer or use of cellular telephone records  Durbin s bill would make it illegal to transfer personal information from cell phone companies to online brokers and the legislation provides tough criminal penalties  including up to 10 years in prison  for those found guilty of violating phone users    privacy          The acquisition and sale of an individual   s personal cell phone call list record is a violation of privacy  and can pose a real threat to personal safety     Durbin said      The fraudulent acquisition of records needs to be punishable as a true criminal offense  subject to jail time and fines  The sale and transfer of this information needs to be clearly prohibited by law          Durbin said that recent reports show that online brokers have illegally obtained cell phone records by posing as customers  hacking into online accounts or by purchasing them from rogue employees of cell phone companies   These records have been made available by these online brokers  for a reasonable price  to anyone who requests them       The Senator noted that the sale of personal call records is not only a violation of individual privacy  it creates the possibility of identity theft and threatens the personal safety of law enforcement and public officials   There are significant concerns that criminals could use such services to obtain personal information about police  especially undercover officers   Recent investigations indicate that the cell phone records of the Chicago Police Department and public officials have been among those targeted       In a letter to his Senate colleagues  Durbin wrote    Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the internet  enforcement is sparse and is not a priority for the Justice Department   In addition  the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal information obtained illegally and without the consent of cell phone customers          Durbin emphasized the need to address issues raised by the current patchwork of laws and regulations  which make it difficult to determine whether the information was illegally obtained and easy for violations to slip through the cracks   According to current telecom laws  cell phone companies are obligated to protect customers    personal information  with the exception of warranted inquiries from law enforcement   The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  monitors and regulates telephone companies and their compliance with privacy laws   The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  handles fraud complaints   However  if an online broker obtains telephone records  the law does not prohibit their subsequent sale       See letter below         January 18  2006  PREVENT THE SALE OF TELEPHONE RECORDS   Dear Colleague    I ask you to join me in cosponsoring legislation that would prohibit the sale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone records and provide tough criminal penalties for violating phone users    privacy       According to recent news reports  online brokers have illegally obtained cell phone records and sold them without customers    knowledge   Telephone companies receive many legitimate requests from consumers and law enforcement officials for access to personal records and the requests are considered routine   However  online brokers have taken advantage of the system and begun selling cell phone records to anyone who requests them       Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the Internet  the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal information obtained illegally or without the consent of cell phone customers   Consumer and privacy groups have expressed concerns about the access and availability of personal information   Regardless of how a bad actor obtains the telephone records of innocent and unsuspecting customers  the sale of such information should be prohibited       The Phone Records Protection Act of 2006 would deter online brokers by prohibiting the sale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone records   The sale of this information is a violation of individual privacy and also creates the possibility of identity theft   Moreover  the sale of telephone records of law enforcement personnel and public officials could endanger public safety  as criminals and terrorists would be eager to have such information       Please join me in supporting this effort       Sincerely       Richard Durbin  United States Senator
