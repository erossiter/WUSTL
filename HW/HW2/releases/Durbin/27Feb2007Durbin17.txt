    U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent letters to the U S  Transportation Secretary  Mary Peters and the President of American Eagle  Peter Bowler  urging them to strongly consider other airlines  applications when the contracts with the current regional airline serving Quincy  Marion and Decatur    Regions Air    expire in July   The Illinois lawmaker sent a third letter to the Mayors of the affected communities  informing them of his actions and future commitment to replacing Regions Air with a carrier that can provide the areas with reliable air service to St  Louis        The residents and businesses in central Illinois rely on and are entitled to dependable air service   said Durbin    Regions Air has an unacceptable record  late 15 times more often than the average domestic carrier   When their contracts expire this summer  we need a new carrier that will provide our communities with the reliable air service they deserve        Regions Air  operating as American Connection to St  Louis Lambert International Airport  currently receives over  3 5 million per year federal subsidy to operate Essential Air Service  EAS  to Quincy  Marion  and Decatur as part of two year contracts with the Department of Transportation    The airline also provides service to Springfield s Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport  The EAS program is vital to these cities that are far from a medium or large hub airport and would otherwise be without air service   Regions  Illinois EAS contracts are set to expire in July        I have worked hard with community leaders to bring air service to our Downstate cities  But we cannot build a strong passenger base with an airline that is unreliable   Durbin added          Text of letters below         February 27  2007   The Honorable Mary Peters  Secretary  U S  Department of Transportation  400 Seventh Street  S W   Washington  D C  20590   Dear Secretary Peters    I am writing to you regarding the Department s Essential Air Service  EAS  Program and Regions Air service in Illinois   Quincy  Marion  and Decatur are three EAS communities in Illinois that are currently served by Regions Air flights to St  Louis  The EAS program is vital to these cities that are far from a medium or large hub airport and would otherwise be without air service       Regions has a code share relationship with American Airlines  which allows passengers to seamlessly book travel on flights to and through American s regional hub at Lambert International Airport in St  Louis through American Connection  Regions receives over  3 5 million per year in EAS subsidies as part of the two year contracts with the U S  DOT        In the last three months  Regions has failed to adequately fulfill its contracts to operate these flights  Flight cancellation figures for November  December  and January were 15 6 percent  27 percent  and 15 5 percent  respectively  In contrast  according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics  the average percentage of flights canceled in the domestic passenger market was 1 71 for all of 2006       Regions  poor service record and large number of cancellations deter travelers from flying into or out of Quincy  Marion  Decatur  and Springfield which has a detrimental effect on the local economies   In addition  this deficient service is the primary factor for Quincy s inability to meet the important 10 000 passenger threshold  which qualifies Quincy Regional Airport for a  1 million Federal Aviation Administration grant       Regions  Illinois EAS contracts in Marion and Quincy are set to expire in May and July  respectively  While Regions has the opportunity to re apply for these contracts  I respectfully request that you give strong consideration to other airlines  applications  The people in the Quincy  Marion  Decatur  and Springfield  a non EAS community  areas rely on and are entitled to efficient and dependable air service  which  unfortunately  Regions has failed to provide       Thank you for your consideration of this request  I look forward to working with you to improve air service to underserved areas in Illinois and around the nation       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin     Mr  Peter M  Bowler  President  American Eagle Airlines  4333 Amon Carter Boulevard  Fort Worth  TX 76155   Dear Mr  Bowler    I enjoyed meeting with you and other American Airlines American Eagle executives last week in Dallas about Illinois air service   I am writing to follow up on our discussion about Regions Air service in Illinois       I was pleased to hear you speak about American Eagle s commitment to providing quality  dependable service to downstate Illinois as well as your desire to find a carrier to replace Regions Air  as warranted   As you know  Regions Air currently operates service from St  Louis to four cities in Illinois  Quincy  Marion  Decatur  and Springfield   Of those four cities  Quincy  Marion  and Decatur are all Essential Air Service  EAS  communities   The EAS program is vital to these cities that are far from a medium or large hub airport and would otherwise be without air service       Regions receives over  3 5 million per year in EAS subsidies as part of two year contracts with the U S  Department of Transportation   In the past four months  Regions has failed to adequately fulfill its contract to operate these

deter travelers from flying into or out of Quincy  Marion  Decatur  and Springfield which has a detrimental effect on the local economies       Regions  Illinois EAS contracts in Marion and Quincy are

service to downstate Illinois airports   The people in these communities rely on and are entitled to efficient and dependable air service  which  unfortunately  Regions has failed to provide       I look forward to working with you to improve air service to underserved areas in Illinois       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin     February 27  2007   Mayor Paul Osborne  City of Decatur  One Gary K
