     DURBIN ADDRESSES BRAIDWOOD COMMUNITY CONCERNS WITH SAFETY OF WATER SUPPLY

ADDRESSES BRAIDWOOD COMMUNITY CONCERNS WITH SAFETY OF WATER SUPPLY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tuesday  May 23  2006    WASHINGTON  DC       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent letters to the Administrator of the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Stephen Johnson  and the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency  IEPA   Doug Scott  requesting that the agencies work together to prevent any future contamination of the groundwater supply in Godley   Durbin also sent a letter to the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  ASTDR   Dr  Howard Frumkin  requesting an independent health study of the water system to determine the potential health impacts of tritium contaminated water  and other contaminants in the area          Recent spills at the Braidwood plant  along with contamination problems in local wells  have raised serious concerns in the community     said Durbin      Braidwood area residents must be given a full and accurate account of how safe their drinking water is and what will be done to both monitor the current situation and prevent future contamination   The Braidwood community needs a comprehensive and long term solution that will keep them safe and informed       The Braidwood Nuclear Generating facility recently informed local residents that their plant leaked tritium 22 times since 1996  with significant spills in 1996  1998 and 2000  totaling over 6 million gallons of tritiated water   Exelon  the owner and operator of the Braidwood facility  is currently providing bottled water to many of the residents of Godley and monitoring drinking water wells   While the quality of the water supply has not been directly linked to recent tritium spills  these incidences have highlighted the need to conduct a thorough study of the level of contaminants in the drinking water supply and closely monitor local wells       In today   s letter to IEPA  Durbin acknowledged recent efforts by the agency to monitor both private and public wells but expresses concern    that once the current round of monitoring of private drinking water wells is complete  area residents may remain concerned about potential subsurface tritium migration     Durbin asks both EPA and IEPA to invest in longer term monitoring in order to provide the community with a consistent and reliable source of information regarding water safety levels   A longer term monitoring system will also help detect future contamination  in the case of another unexpected tritium release       At a Godley community meeting in April  Durbin met with local residents who expressed concerned with a recent report citing a high number of cancer incidences within a three mile area of an outlet pipe originating at the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station   The study  done by a local community organization  the Concerned Citizens Awareness Group  documented the occurrence of more than 60 cancer cases over a 20 year span in a specific area outside of Braidwood       In today   s letter to ASTDR  Durbin stressed the need for an accurate account of the situation  noting that    It is critical that these residents receive an unbiased  independent review and analysis of the water system upon which they rely and the potential health implication of tritium and other hazardous contaminants in their groundwater supply          After a series of reports that the Braidwood plant failed to disclose that radioactive substances had leaked into the groundwater  Durbin introduced legislation with Senator Obama  D IL  and Congressman Jerry Weller  R 11th  that would require all nuclear companies to inform state and local officials if there is an accidental or unintentional leak of a radioactive substance   The Nuclear Release Notice Act would require that when a radioactive leak occurs that exceeds limits set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC   the Environmental Protection Agency or other federal agencies  state and local officials are notified simultaneously with NRC       The text of the letters is below           May 23  2006   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue   N W   Washington  DC 20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    I would like to request the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency in monitoring the impact on the residents of Godley  IL of the accidental releases of tritium from the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Facility located just north of the city       In the past few months  the residents of Godley were informed that tritium at the Braidwood Nuclear Generating facility has reported 22 leaks of tritium since 1996  with significant spills in 1996  1998 and 2000 totaling over 6 million gallons of tritiated water   While Exelon  the owner and operator of the Braidwood facility  is currently providing bottled water to many of the residents of Godley and monitoring drinking water wells  residents remain concerned about the potential for long term exposure to tritium       The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency  IL EPA  has been working diligently since late November 2005 to uncover the extent of the contamination in this area   The agency has issued two violation notices to Exelon and has referred this case to the Illinois Attorney General   s Office for enforcement    IL EPA has requested that Exelon conduct significant testing of groundwater near the plant in areas of previous leaks of water that contained tritium   Discussions between the IL EPA  IL AG and Exelon are underway       While current sampling results indicate no significant elevated levels of tritium in private drinking water wells  residents need the certainty that their drinking water is safe  not only today but in the long term   When the current monitoring of the wells ceases  residents are concerned that any migration that may occur in the future will go undetected   Additionally  long term monitoring could provide a means to detect whether there are any additional releases of tritium that may go undetected       Therefore I am requesting the that the EPA work with the IL EPA  Exelon and the residents to provide long term monitoring of area wells to ensure there is no migration of tritium or other radionuclides impacting the drinking water wells used by the residents   I look forward to hearing from you on this matter       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator       May 23  2006   Mr  Douglas P  Scott  Director  Illinois Environmental Protection Agency  1021 North Grand Avenue East  P O  Box 19276  Springfield  Illinois 62794 9276   Dear Mr  Scott    I am writing to you about the concerns of the residents of Godley  IL  and the ongoing activity related to the tritium contaminated water released from the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station located just north of the city       I appreciate the IL EPA   s diligent attention to this issue  including the two notices of violation  the decision to involve the IL Attorney General in the matter  and your continued efforts to require Exelon to deal with the contaminated areas   It is imperative that every effort be made to assure residents that their water is safe and that they are not adversely affected by the previous releases from the Braidwood facility   Additionally  I believe that we must take every step available to prevent any future contamination of the groundwater supply in Godley       A few weeks ago  I visited with residents of Godley   Understandably  area residents remain concerned about potential exposure to tritium as well as the potential health impacts of any possible exposure they received over the past ten years as these releases occurred   I know that IL EPA has directed ongoing monitoring of both private drinking water wells and monitoring wells   I also understand that no tests of private drinking water wells have shown tritium levels greater than the maximum permissible level that has been established by U S  EPA for safe drinking water   However  I am concerned that once the current round of monitoring of private drinking water wells is complete  area residents may remain concerned about potential subsurface tritium migration  At this time  does the IL EPA have any intention of providing long term monitoring of private wells in the area to ensure that there is no migration of tritium in the Godley groundwater supply   Longer term monitoring can provide at least some certainty to area residents that their water will remain safe  and may provide the opportunity to detect future contamination should an unexpected release occur again       I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to discussing this possibility with you       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator       May 23  2006   Dr  Howard Frumkin  MD  DrPH  Office of the Director  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  1600 Clifton Road  Mail Stop E 2A  Atlanta  Georgia 30333   Dear Dr  Frumkin    I am writing to you today concerning the town of Godley  Illinois  A citizen group has brought to my attention a cancer cluster within a three mile area of an outlet pipe originating at the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station       Godley residents have recently been informed that tritium at the Braidwood Nuclear Generating facility leaked 22 times since 1996  with significant spills in 1996  1998 and 2000 totaling over 6 million gallons of tritiated water   Exelon  the owner and operator of the Braidwood facility  is currently providing bottled water to many of the residents of Godley and monitoring drinking water wells       In late April I visited with residents of Godley  who presented me with information related to cancer cases in the area   The Concerned Citizens Awareness Group has reported more than 60 cancer cases over a 20 year span in a specific area outside of Braidwood   This area is also in close proximity to the former Joliet Arsenal    The residents claim a high incidence of cancer near a release line coming from the Braidwood Nuclear facility to the Kankakee River   These cases include brain  colon  lung  cervical  and other cancers  Additionally  statistical information provided by the Will County Health Department shows significant increases in low birth rate babies born in the years 1997 through 1999  2001  and 2002       While Exelon maintains that there is no indication of alarming levels of tritium in the drinking water wells being monitored  the residents are concerned about the long term exposure that they may have experienced over the past ten years   It is also important to note that elevated levels of heavy metals and arsenic  not originating from the Braidwood facility  have been identified in the Godley water supply       It is critical that these residents receive an unbiased  independent review and analysis of the water system upon which they rely and the potential health implication of tritium and other hazardous contaminants in their groundwater supply   Many questions plague Godley   s residents and while the nuclear facility operator is taking responsibility for its unplanned releases and attempting to address their concerns  the residents of Godley need an independent analysis of any potential threat to their well being       I am therefore requesting the assistance of the ASTDR in completing a health assessment of the area in order to determine the impacts of the releases of tritiated water  the elevated levels of heavy metals and arsenic and any other potentially harmful exposure uncovered during the course of ATSDR   s analysis       I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to working with you and the ATSDR to ensure that a thorough health assessment is completed       Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
