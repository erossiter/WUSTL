SAFETY AMENDMENT APPROVED BY SENATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Wednesday  May 2  2007    WASHINGTON  DC    Today the Senate passed  by a vote of 94 0  an amendment introduced by U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  that will strengthen the nation s food safety system   The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   one of the federal agencies charged with safeguarding the U S  food supply  has come under fire recently in the wake of nationwide recalls and quarantines of tainted pork  spinach  peanut butter and pet food       Durbin s amendment establishes an early warning and notification system for human food  as well as pet food  establish fines for companies that don t promptly report contaminated products  improves inspections monitoring of imports  and provides better  more uniform pet food safety standards   Durbin s amendment was accepted today as part of the FDA Reauthorization bill  S 1082  now on the Senate floor        With the passage of this amendment  we will make our nation s food safety system stronger on several fronts   We have strengthened regulation of imported food  instituted a better record keeping  tracking and inspection process for human and pet food  put in place an early warning system when outbreaks of contaminated food occur  set uniform standards for pet food  and instituted fines for companies that fail to report problems   said Durbin   There is more work to be done to fix our food safety system  but today we have moved forward to address the growing concerns across our nation        Durbin said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimate that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized  and more than 5 000 will die  With emerging pathogens  a population at high risk for food borne illnesses and an increasing volume of food imports  these numbers cannot improve without decisive action       Some of the new responsibilities given to the FDA under Durbin s amendment include      Establishing an early warning and notification system for human food as well as pet food products  The legislation directs the FDA to work with professional organizations  veterinarians  and others to disseminate information about pet food contamination and in cases of both pet and human food  to keep up to date  comprehensive  searchable recall lists on their website   Improving FDA s ability to detect problems  and alert consumers of contaminants by creating an adulterated food registry for imported and domestically produced food   The amendment requires the FDA to establish a registry to collect information on cases of potentially dangerous food adulteration to improve risk based surveillance of food safety and improve the speed at which consumers and firms are notified   Importers and domestic processors and manufactures of food would have to submit information pertaining to actual or suspected adulteration of food  The submission would be made to the FDA for inclusion in a centralized database through an electronic portal   The sources of the recent human and pet food contamination were wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that originated in China  Neither shipment was inspected by FDA  in fact  FDA inspects fewer than 1 5  of imports   A database would give FDA better information on which to base inspections   Requiring companies to maintain records and make them accessible to FDA as part of an investigation   This provision would prevent delays that could keep contaminations from being traced as quickly as possible   In the case of the recalled peanut butter this past winter  an FDA report showed that inspectors were denied documents when they requested them  The bill would clarify that when FDA conducts inspections  it will have timely access to those documents needed to safeguard the food supply   Establishing uniform federal standards and better labeling of pet food  The guidances and practices that today govern the pet food industry are implemented on a voluntary basis by manufacturers and state departments of agriculture  However  there is no requirement for states to adopt these practices and they don t have the force of federal guidelines   Inspections are not coordinated state to state and some states have different standards than others    Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  have been actively engaged on food safety issues for over a decade  This Congress they introduced legislation that calls for the development of a single food safety agency and the implementation of a food safety program to standardize American food safety activities  The Safe Food Act   S  654 and H R  1148 in the Senate and House respectively   Currently  there are at least 12 different federal agencies and 35 different laws governing food safety   With overlapping jurisdictions  federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety related issues
