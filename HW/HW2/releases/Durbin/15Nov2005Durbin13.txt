     DURBIN SAYS MEDICARE DRUG PLAN TOO CONFUSING  URGES CONGRESS TO DELAY ENROLLMENT PENALTIES TO GIVE SENIORS MORE TIME

MEDICARE DRUG PLAN TOO CONFUSING  URGES CONGRESS TO DELAY ENROLLMENT PENALTIES TO GIVE SENIORS MORE TIME                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday  November 15  2005           With enrollment set to begin today in the Medicare benefit drug plan  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said seniors need more time to navigate through the hundreds of confusing offers in order to choose the plan that best meets their health care needs   Making an uninformed decision  Durbin warned  could result in Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in a costly plan that does not cover their prescription drugs     Durbin joined Senate and House Democrats to urge Congress to pass the Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005   The bill will postpone the enrollment penalties until the end of 2006 so beneficiaries can learn more about the new drug benefit  obtain independent counseling  and make the right choice        Seniors in Illinois are frustrated and many are angry  they don   t see a lot of benefit in this so called prescription drug benefit   What seniors told us they wanted was a simple way to get lower prescription drug prices   Instead  they were handed a complex  confusing plan that in the end does very little to reduce the cost of prescription drugs   What it does is increase the profits for drug companies and line the pockets of their CEOs     Durbin said        Until Congress passes a plan allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices  the least we can do for seniors is give them more time to understand their options and make the best choice under the current system   With more than 130 different drug plans in Illinois  the risk is just too great for seniors to make uniformed decisions about their health     Durbin added     Under the Medicare prescription drug plan signed into law in 2003  42 million beneficiaries nationwide  including 1 7 million Illinoisans  are eligible to purchase the new Medicare Part D drug benefit through a private drug plan or enroll in a Medicare managed care plan that offers a drug benefit   The enrollment period begins November 15  2005 and ends on May 15  2006   Beneficiaries will be charged a late enrollment penalty if they choose to enroll at a later date     Durbin underscored the need for an extension by pointing to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey released last week   The study showed two thirds of seniors don   t know they have to choose a private plan and one third of seniors think they can receive their drugs through Medicare  The poll also showed 76  of seniors have never been on line  making researching these plans even more intimidating  Most alarming  63  of seniors don   t know they will face financial penalties if they don   t sign up by next May     In Illinois  the Senior Health Insurance Program  SHIP  has been designated the principal resource for seniors   Illinoisans can contact SHIP directly at 1 800 548 9034 for information about the Medicare benefit drug plan   However  according to SHIP program officials in Illinois  SHIP   s 700 volunteers are being    bombarded    with questions from anxious seniors  many of whom need personal counseling        There is not enough assistance for seniors     Durbin said      Some have children  friends or neighbors who are willing to help   Others must depend on government agencies   But with 1 7 million Medicare beneficiaries in Illinois  each one of the 700 SHIP volunteer is supposed to educate 2 374 beneficiaries about this complex new bureaucracy   That is not fair   Seniors need and deserve more time        In addition to postponing the enrollment penalties until the end of 2006  the Medicare Informed Choice Act will give every beneficiary the opportunity to make a one time change in plan enrollment at any point in 2006   Additionally  the legislation will protect employees from being dropped by their former employer   s plan during the first year of the implementation of the drug plan    Without these changes  beneficiaries will face a late enrollment penalty if they enroll in a plan after May 15  2006  could lose employer provided retiree health benefits if they enroll in some Part D plans  and could be prohibited from switching plans until 2007
