COOK AND KANE COUNTY QUARANTINES AND EMERGENCY FUNDING AS SIGHTINGS OF INVASIVE SPECIES INCREASE IN ILLINOIS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Monday  July 17  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      Just hours after today   s announcement that a portion of Kane County has been declared an ash tree quarantine zone by the Illinois Department of Agriculture  IDOA   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  sent a letter to the head of Illinois Department of Agriculture  asking him to quarantine vulnerable areas of Cook County   In a second letter  to the head of USDA s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  Durbin asked that both Kane and Cook County also be declared federal emergency quarantine areas so that they can apply for low interest emergency loans to help eradicate the Emerald Ash Borer  an invasive beetle species which has been found in Illinois       The Emerald Ash Borer is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees    ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  Infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years    The Emerald Ash Borer was first discovered in Kane County  Illinois in mid June   On July 11  the Illinois Department of Agriculture announced its second discovery of the ash borer in the Village of Wilmette in Cook County          The discovery of Emerald Ash Borer in both Kane and Cook County within the last month is troubling news   Illinois has more than 131 million ash trees  comprising about 20 percent of all of the trees in the Chicago area     said Durbin     In the past few years  this insect has killed tens of millions of trees throughout the Midwest  and we need to move quickly to contain this infestation   One of the most effective control mechanisms is an ash tree quarantine which is now in effect for Kane County and will give the Department authority to remove infested trees and keep potential beetle host material  like firewood  from being sent out to or brought in from surrounding areas   I have called on the Illinois Department of Agriculture to look at whether a similar quarantine is warranted in Cook County and on USDA to help provide these two counties with emergency funds          Today   s decision to declare Kane County an ash tree quarantine zone will give the Department authority to remove infested trees  the only option to prevent the destructive beetle from spreading   The quarantine also is intended to contain the infestation   It will prohibit the movement of potential beetle host materials  including firewood  lumber and nursery stock  into and out of the infested area   A federal quarantine from USDA would provide affected areas with much needed low interest emergency loans       In today   s letter to USDA  Durbin urged Dr  DeHaven to consider transferring Commodity Credit Corporation funds  as was done in Michigan and other affected states  to the Illinois Department of Agriculture to help them deal with the ash borer situation in Illinois   On June 23rd  Durbin announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee  on which he serves  approved  1 5 million to combat and prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer  On June 13th  immediately following the first sighting of the ash borer in Illinois  Durbin called on the USDA to develop a plan to curb the spread of this pest       The Emerald Ash Borer was first sighted in 2002 in Michigan   Since then  forestry experts estimate that the Emerald Ash Borer has been responsible for the devastation of more than 12 million ash trees in Michigan  Ohio  and Indiana       Text of letters appears below         July 17  2006   Mr  Charles A  Hartke  Director  Illinois Department of Agriculture  State Fairgrounds  P O  Box 19281  Springfield  IL  62794 9281   Dear Director Harke    Thank you for declaring a Kane County quarantine following the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Illinois  As you know  Illinois is the latest in a string of states to discover the presence of EAB  an invasive species that poses a significant threat to our ash populations and urban and forest landscapes       Since the first announced EAB discovery in Illinois in mid June  IDOA and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  have conducted a delimitting survey to measure the extent of the infestation  responded to potential EAB sightings  and pursued a public awareness campaign  Today s quarantine announcement by IDOA  which will restrict the movement of ash feedstocks out of Kane County  is an important step in the direction of controlling this potentially devastating species       On July 11  2006  IDOA announced its second discovery of EAB  this time in the Village of Wilmette in Cook County   Given the nature of the infestation in Kane County and the subsequent quarantine  I urge IDOA to quickly investigate the extent of the Cook County infestation and give maximum consideration to a quarantine of all or part of Cook County       Thank you for your attention to this matter       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator     July 17  2006   Dr  Ron DeHaven  Administrator  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  United States Department of Agriculture  Room 313E Whitten Building  1400 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC  20250   Dear Dr  DeHaven    Thank you for your attention to the matter of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Illinois  As you know  Illinois is the latest in a string of states to discover the presence of EAB  an invasive species that poses a significant threat to our ash populations and urban and forest landscapes       As the lead federal agency on this matter  it is the responsibility of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to promulgate quarantine regulations and coordinate and provide funding for control and eradication efforts in conjunction with state and local governments  It has been heartening to hear about the cooperation between APHIS and the Illinois Department of Agriculture  IDOA  and I encourage you to continue to work with your state and local partners on this matter       Since the first announced EAB discovery in Illinois in mid June  IDOA and APHIS have conducted a delimitting survey to measure the extent of the infestation  responded to potential EAB sightings  and pursued a public awareness campaign  Today s quarantine announcement by IDOA  which will restrict the movement of ash feedstocks out of Kane County  is an important step in the direction of controlling this potentially devastating species       I urge USDA to declare Kane County a federal emergency quarantine area so that they are eligible for low interest emergency loans to help eradicate EAB       As you know  on July 11  2006  IDOA announced its second discovery of EAB  this time in the Village of Wilmette in Cook County  While IDOA investigates the extent of the Cook County infestation  I urge USDA to continue to demonstrate concern for the Illinois infestation by commiting APHIS  resources to delimitting the area surrounding the initial Wilmette discovery and moving quickly to promulgate regulations establishing Cook County as a quarantine area should that be necessary   In addition  I ask that every consideration be given to providing emergency loans in the event that all or parts of Cook County are quarantined by IDOA       Last  I would like to direct your attention to the critical issue of funding  As I understand it  the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to transfer Commodity Credit Corporation  CCC  funds to invasive species outbreaks like the EAB situation in Illinois  In the past  USDA has allocated such funding for EAB control and eradication efforts in Michigan and other affected states  The discovery of multiple infestations in Illinois will stretch the budgets of the IDOA  other participating state agencies  and local governments  As the scope of Illinois  infestation becomes known and funding needs arise  I fully expect APHIS to support efforts to control and eradicate EAB in Illinois with CCC funds       Thank you for your attention to this matter       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
