INTRODUCES LEGISLATION FOR STUDENT LOAN RELIEF FOR YOUNG PROSECUTORS   PUBLIC DEFENDERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wednesday  January 31  2007    WASHINGTON  DC      Today  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced bipartisan legislation to create a student loan repayment program for law school graduates who commit to serve as criminal prosecutors or public defenders   Durbin   s legislation  the    John R  Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007     is named for the late John R  Justice  former president of the National District Attorneys Association and a champion of efforts to encourage law school graduates to work in public service    The legislation is co sponsored by Senators Arlen Specter  R PA   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Gordon Smith  R OR   John Kerry  D MA  and Susan Collins  R ME   and is considered    the highest priority for criminal prosecutors and defenders          With the average law graduate carrying a staggering amount of student loan debt     78 763 for those who attended private schools  and  51 056 for public schools     Durbin   s bill would establish a student loan repayment option for full time State and local prosecutors and State  local and Federal public defenders who agree to serve for a minimum of three years   Federal prosecutors are already eligible for loan relief through existing Federal programs          Today prosecutors and public defenders offices are having serious difficulty hiring and retaining good lawyers because students are leaving law school with mortgage sized student loan debts     said Durbin      When prosecutor and public defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep experienced ones  their ability to protect the public is compromised   The federal government has a responsibility to help make public service law an affordable option for talented  experienced lawyers who want to work in the criminal justice system        Durbin cited the contrast between the loan burdens carried by today s law school graduates and the entry level salaries for prosecutors and public defenders as evidence of the need for relief    More than 80  of law students borrow to pay for their law degree  and the amount borrowed by many students exceeds  100 000   Many law graduates also carry unpaid debt from their undergraduate studies   At the same time  the median entry level salary for State prosecuting attorneys is  46 000  and the median entry level salary for public defenders is  43 000       From an employer   s prospective  low salaries and high debt make it extremely difficult to recruit and retain attorneys in prosecutor and public defender offices   The Department of Justice has found that almost one third of prosecutor   s offices reported problems with recruitment and retention of staff attorneys          The    John R  Justice Prosecutors and Public Defenders Incentive Act    is crucial to public safety     noted Mathias H  Heck  Jr   President of the National District Attorneys Association      This important legislation will ensure that prosecutor offices across this country are able to recruit the best and brightest attorneys and are able to retain those qualified and experienced prosecutors in their offices          In addition  results of a survey by Equal Justice Works and the Partnership for Public Service show that a majority of public interest law employers  including public defender offices  report significant difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention   In recruiting efforts  89 percent of employers identified low salaries and 88 percent identified high educational debt as major impediments        Because of high student debt and low pay  public defenders  offices have a difficult time attracting and keeping qualified attorneys     noted Martin S  Pinales  President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers     The constant influx of new  inexperienced attorneys undermines the reliability  fairness  and efficiency of the criminal justice system   The John R  Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act would slow down the revolving door and improve the quality of justice for all Americans          Durbin s proposal is modeled after a student loan repayment program currently available to federal employees   Like the federal employee program  attorneys eligible for loan repayment could have up to  10 000 per year of student loan debt repaid   Loan repayments are capped at a maximum of  60 000 per individual       Durbin   s legislation is supported by the American Bar Association  the National District Attorneys Association  the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators  the National Legal Aid and Defender Association  the American Council of Chief Defenders  and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers       Durbin   s bill was introduced in the 109th Congress and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee   Unfortunately  the bill was not passed by the full Senate before the end of the session
