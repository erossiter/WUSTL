     DURBIN INTRODUCES MINE SAFETY BILL TO HELP PROTECT ILLINOIS MINERS

INTRODUCES MINE SAFETY BILL TO HELP PROTECT ILLINOIS MINERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thursday  March 16  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation to help protect the lives of miners in Illinois  The Mine Safety  Enforcement  Reporting and Training Act of 2006 will dramatically increase minimum fines for safety violations while creating a system of accountability for payment for those fines  The bill also doubles current funding for education and training grants          The recent tragic events in West Virginia and Kentucky have captured the nation s attention and exposed the serious dangers our miners face every day  Safety violations often result in injuries that cost miners their health  livelihood or lives   Safety inspectors have advised me that the fines need to be tougher when a company violates our safety laws and that we need to put more resources into training inspectors     said Durbin      We have more than 3 500 miners in Illinois   We owe it to them and to their families to ensure all 25 mines in operation in Illinois are being held to the highest standards of safety         Durbin   s bill would      Raise the minimum fine for safety violations from  60 to  500  Require coal mine operators to pay fines up front  Require a public yearly report of fine payments  Double funding for education and training grants made to states  increasing them to  20 million annually    Federal records indicate that few fines are issued at the maximum level  and the number has been decreasing in recent years   From 1996 2000 there were a total of 118 maximum fines issued  from 2001 2005 only 37 maximum fines were issued   The vast majority of fines issued in 2005 were under  100      Asking a multimillion dollar mining company to pay a fine equal to the cost of a minor speeding ticket doesn   t even slow these offenders down     said Durbin      Hopefully raising the minimum fine from  60 to  500 will prompt these companies to get serious about making safety improvements          Durbin noted that many coal operators are taking advantage of the current system which allows them to withhold payment of fines levied against them while negotiating to reduce the amount of those fines   From 2001 to 2003  more than two thirds of all major fines were reduced from the original amount imposed by safety inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA    MSHA reports that of the fines that are appealed  the average reduction is 47        According to recent reports  since 2001  almost half of all fines have not been collected   Federal records also show that in the last two years the federal mine safety agency has failed to hand over any delinquent cases to the Treasury Department for further collection efforts  as is supposed to occur after 180 days     A public report card of fine payments gives us the chance to grade these companies    and make necessary changes before we have another tragic accident on our hands     noted Durbin       Over the years  funding for education health and training grants has steadily declined    seriously impacting the agency   s ability to meet the training needs of the Illinois mining industry   Nationally  MSHA awards  10 million in grants annually   Last year  Illinois received  209 250   down from  274 781 approximately ten years ago   The Illinois Office of Mines and Minerals  OMM  uses the funds it receives from MSHA to purchase safety vehicles  rescue training equipment and to help train new coal mine employees   Not only is OMM unable to purchase new equipment as old equipment wears out  but the agency is having trouble purchasing modern mine rescue training equipment       Earlier this year  Durbin cosponsored legislation  the Mine Safety Tax Relief Act of 2006  to help protect the lives of miners in Illinois   It passed the Senate as an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation Act   If approved by the House of Representatives  it will provide tax credits and incentives to encourage coal companies to invest in mine safety equipment and training       Durbin has also written to state and federal agencies responsible for overseeing mine safety asking them for a review of mine safety records in Illinois and elsewhere  In his letters he asked the agencies to examine two issues     the impact funding cuts for mine safety inspections have had on mine safety  and a status report on safety conditions at all of Illinois    mines   President Bush has proposed cuts to the federal coal safety inspection budget in four of the five years he has been in office   Analysts say that those reduced budget numbers have accounted for the loss of 130 mine inspectors since 2000       On January 2  2006 an explosion trapped 13 men in a West Virginia coal mine resulting in the death of 12 of the 13 workers   Last year  the operators of that mine received 205 citations for health and safety violations  96 of which were    significant and substantial    according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration   In 2005 the mine was forced to halt operations 16 times after failing to comply with safety rules
