START UP FUNDS FOR TROOPS TO NURSE TAECHERS PROGRAM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Monday  August 7  2006   Washington  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  secured  500 000 to fund his    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program passed by the Senate earlier this year   The program is aimed at encouraging nurses leaving the military to become nurse educators  The funds  which will be dedicated to the program   s start up costs  are included in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill that is expected to be passed by the full Senate in September       With a projected shortfall of one million nurses by 2020  Durbin called the    Troops to Nurse Teachers    an    innovative solution    that will help place more qualified nurses in faculty positions  which will in turn  increase the pool of trained nurses needed at civilian and military facilities   Last year  35 000 qualified students were denied admission into America   s nursing colleges          With a nursing shortage all across the country  nurses who have spent time in the military can help fill a critical gap that hurts both military and civilian health care facilities     Durbin said      Last year  1 900 qualified student applicants were rejected by Illinois nursing schools because there were not enough teachers  By signing up to join the    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program  military nurses leaving the service will continue helping our country by teaching the next generation of health professionals          The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program will provide transitional assistance for service members who already hold a master   s or PhD in nursing or a related field  and are qualified to teach  Eligible service members will receive career placement assistance  transitional stipends  and educational training from accredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition       The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    proposal will also establish a scholarship program  on a pilot basis  that will provide financial assistance to members of the Armed Forces who have been involved in nursing during their military service in obtaining the education necessary to become nurse educators  Tuition  stipends  and financing for other educational expenses will also be provided  Recipients of scholarships must commit to teaching at an accredited school of nursing for three years in exchange for the educational support they receive  The Department of Defense may also require continuing service in the Selected Reserve  or some other form of public service       Durbin noted that neither the Army nor the Air Force has met their nurse recruitment goals since the 1990s   In 2004  the Navy Nurse Corps recruitment fell 32 percent below its target while the Air Force missed its nurse recruitment target by 30 percent   Civilian hospitals face similar challenges   According to the American College of Healthcare Executives  72 percent of hospitals were experiencing a nursing shortage in 2004          If we are going to address the nursing shortage over the long term  we must increase the number of nursing faculty members   The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    is an innovative solution for a serious and immediate health care problem     Durbin said       Durbin   s initiative is based on the Troops to Teachers program created in 1994  which has trained 14 000 former service members to be math and science teachers  More than 6 000 have been placed in high poverty schools       Durbin   s proposal is endorsed by the American Nurses Association  American Hospital Association  American Association of Colleges of Nursing  American Organization of Nurse Executives  American Health Care Association  and the National League of Nursing       Jeanette Lancaster  President of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing  AACN  and Dean of the University of Virginia School of Nursing  said     AACN is deeply appreciative of Senator Durbin s efforts to create the Troops to Nurse Teachers Program   These start up funds of  500 000 will allow the Department of Defense to set up the administrative procedures and start the program   This effort will provide additional nurse faculty so that schools of nursing can expand their enrollments   We also believe that having former military nurses serve as faculty will help to recruit more new nurse into the military
