Visa Reforms Needed to Protect American Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Friday  June 1  2007   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today announced that provisions of The H 1B and L 1 Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007 he introduced earlier this year with U S  Sen  Chuck Grassley  R IA  have been added to the Kennedy Kyl immigration reform compromise bill  Durbins legislation would overhaul the H 1B and L 1 visa programs to give priority to American workers and crack down on unscrupulous employers who deprive qualified Americans of high skill jobs  The H 1B visa program allows American companies and universities to employ temporary foreign workers who have the equivalent of a U S  bachelors degree in a job category that is considered by the U S  Citizenship  Immigration Services to be a specialty occupation  The L 1 visa program allows companies to transfer certain employees from their foreign facilities to their U S  facilities for up to seven years  Our immigration policy should seek to complement our U S  workforce  not replace it  Durbin said  Some employers have abused the H 1B and L 1 temporary work visa programs  using them to bypass qualified American job applicants  I want to set up safeguards for American workers  and provide much needed oversight and enforcement of employers who fail to abide by the law  Provisions of the Durbin Grassley bill included in the Kennedy Kyl immigration reform compromise bill would change existing law in the following ways  Currently  the H 1B visa program is criticized for failing to protect American workers  Under current law  only employers that employ H 1B visa holders as a large percentage of their U S  workforce are required to pledge that they have attempted to find American workers before bringing in foreign workers  The Durbin Grassley bill would require all employers seeking to hire an H 1B visa holder to pledge that they have made a good faith effort to hire American workers first and that the H 1B visa holder will not displace an American worker  The Durbin Grassley bill would require that H 1B employers may not advertise a job as available only for H 1B visa holders or recruit only H 1B visa holders for a job  Currently  so called job shops hire large numbers of foreign workers on H 1B visas for short time periods to train and then outsource these workers offshore  The Durbin Grassley bill would prohibit companies from hiring H 1B employees if they employ more than 50 people and more than 50  of their employees are H 1B visa holders  The Durbin Grassley bill would double penalties for employers who violate H 1B program requirements  Currently  the Department of Labor lacks sufficient oversight and investigative authority over the H 1B program  The Durbin Grassley bill would give DOL the ability to conduct random audits of any company that uses the H 1B program  and would require DOL to conduct annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees that have 15  or more of those workers on H 1B visas  The Durbin Grassley bill would give DOL authority to review employers H 1B applications for clear indicators of fraud or misrepresentation of material fact  Currently  DOL is only authorized to review applications for completeness and obvious inaccuracies  The Durbin Grassley bill would give DOL 14 days to review H 1B applications  instead of the seven days currently permitted  The Durbin Grassley bill would give DOL more authority to conduct employer investigations and streamline the investigative process by  among other things  permitting DOL to initiate its own investigations and eliminating the requirement that the DOL Secretary personally authorize an investigation  The Durbin Grassley bill would require the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to share with DOL any information in H 1B visa applications indicating that an H 1B employer is not complying with program requirements  The Durbin Grassley bill would strengthen existing whistleblower protections for the H 1B program and establish whistleblower protections for the L 1 program  The Durbin Grassley bill would give DOL authority to conduct investigations for 24 months instead of the 12 currently permitted  Currently  the H 1B and L 1 visa programs are criticized for making it possible for companies to hire foreign workers at lower wages and with fewer rights than Americans  in turn creating incentives for companies to avoid hiring Americans  The Durbin Grassley bill would require the government to provide H 1B visa holders with information about their rights  Under current law  experts argue that employers can use the L 1 program to evade restrictions on the H 1B program because the L 1 program does not have an annual cap and does not include protections for American workers  As a result  efforts to reform the H 1B program are unlikely to be successful if the L 1 program is not reformed at the same time  The Durbin Grassley bill would establish a process for DOL to investigate  audit and penalize L 1 employers


