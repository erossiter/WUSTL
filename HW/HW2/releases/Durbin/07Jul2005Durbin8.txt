AND E 85 TO BENEFIT FROM LEGISLATION PENDING IN CONGRESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  July 7  2005    ROCKFORD  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  was in Rockford  Rochelle and Yorkville today to promote the provisions in the recently passed Senate energy bill that would expand Illinois    ethanol market and help begin to reduce the nation   s dependence on foreign oil          Renewable fuels provide for a dependable domestic source of energy that increases fuel supplies  reduces our reliance on foreign oil  and enhances our ability to control our own security and economic future     while helping our farmers by increasing demand for their crops     Durbin said          Illinois farmers stand ready and willing to contribute to America   s energy security and independence     Durbin said      Replacing Mideast oil with Midwest ethanol is a winner for everyone but the oil sheiks   When we can use our Illinois agricultural expertise to reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers  the whole nation benefits          Durbin voted in favor of the Senate energy bill  which passed on June 28   The energy bill is now in a Conference Committee where Senate and House conferees will work toward an agreement       Included in the Senate bill is the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS   a provision that will create a nationwide standard for the use of domestically produced renewable fuels  like ethanol  and increase the use of those fuels to 8 billion gallons by 2012    The RFS passed by the Senate could reduce oil imports by 2 5 million barrels per day in 20 years   The House of Representatives passed an energy bill in which the RFS number is lower at 5 billion gallons      Today  Durbin sent a letter to the members of the energy bill House Senate Conference Committee urging them to retain the renewable fuels provisions included by the Senate       According to an analysis completed by economist John Urbanchuk of LEGC  Inc   an RFS that grows to 8 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012 would have a significant impact on both the farm and overall economy throughout the next decade          Reduce crude oil imports by 2 billion barrels and reduce the outflow of dollars largely to foreign oil producers by  64 billion          Create 234 840 new jobs in all sectors of the U S  economy          Increase U S  household income by  43 billion           Add  200 billion to GDP between 2005 2012           Create  6 billion in new investment in renewable fuel production facilities  and         Result in the spending of  70 billion on goods and services required to produce 8 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012        In Illinois  roughly one in every six rows of corn  approximately 280 million bushels  is the source for ethanol   Illinois ranks second in the nation in corn production  with more than 1 5 billion bushels produced annually  and is the nation   s leading source of clean burning ethanol   Illinois currently has five ethanol plants  with two other plants in production   Corn grown in Illinois is used to make 40  of the ethanol consumed in the United States   More than 95  of the gasoline sold in the Chicago area contains 10  ethanol       Investment in the ethanol industry in Illinois exceeds  1 billion  generating 800 jobs in plant operations and 4 000 jobs in the industry related service sector   In fact  Illinois ethanol production alone has increased the national market price for corn by 25 cents per bushel       Earlier this year  Durbin cosponsored Senate legislation which provides a tax incentive for the installation of alternative fuel refueling stations  including E 85 stations  that dispense fuels such as ethanol  natural gas and hydrogen   The provision was included in the transportation reauthorization bill  which is currently in a House Senate Conference Committee   In Illinois  49 cities stock E 85 at their pumps          Increased use of E 85 benefits both Illinois    air quality and economy  while enhancing energy security     said Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Director Doug Scott     We appreciate Senator Durbin   s strong support for ethanol on the federal level that has complemented Governor Blagojevich   s multi faceted state initiatives to increase availability of ethanol fuel and compatible vehicles  coupled with research and support for Illinois ethanol production
