INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP AID TO GOVERNMENTS THAT USE CHILD SOLDIERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thursday  April 19  2007         U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation to encourage foreign governments to disarm  demobilize and rehabilitate child soldiers  The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2007 will ensure that no U S  taxpayer dollars are used to support foreign governments that recruit or use children as soldiers  Senator Sam Brownback  R KS  has joined Senator Durbin as a cosponsor       In over fifteen countries  children are direct participants in war  Denied a childhood and often subjected to horrific violence  an estimated 200 000 to 300 000 children are serving as soldiers for both rebel groups and government forces  Physically vulnerable and easily intimidated  children typically make obedient soldiers and participate in all aspects of warfare  Many are recruited by force  and often compelled to follow orders under threat of death  As society breaks down during conflict  leaving children no access to school  driving them from their homes  or separating them from family members  many children perceive armed groups as their best chance for survival  Others seek escape from poverty or join military forces to avenge family members who have been killed        Hundreds of thousands children around the world today are used as child soldiers  These boys and girls wield automatic weapons on the front lines of combat  serve as human mine detectors  participate in suicide missions  carry supplies  and act as spies  messengers or lookouts and sex slaves   endangering their health and lives and sacrificing their childhoods   said Durbin   Over the last decade two million children have died in armed conflict and nearly six million children have been injured  Most troubling to me is that children have served as soldiers for governments that receive U S  military aid  It s time for that to end        Using the U S  Department of State s Country Reports on Human Rights as a guide  the Durbin bill would restrict U S  military training  financing and other defense related aid to countries that violate the bill s standards   These reports  issued annually  highlight the use of child soldiers by all armed groups in every country and what steps have been taken by the governments of those countries to end the practice       In the 2006 report  issued in March of this year  25 countries were singled out as nations that have recruited or are currently recruiting child soldiers  Of those 25 nations  16 countries have used child soldiers in direct hostilities with armed groups   either as part of government forces or in militias  Since 2001  14 of those nations have received U S  military assistance       The report also noted that of the 16 nations where child soldiers are currently being recruited or conscripted  10 nations used children as part of government security forces or government sponsored armed groups  9 of the 10 nations cited in the report have received U S  aid since 2001       Durbin said that the practice of providing military assistance to governments and militias who exploit children violates U S  policy and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict  which the United States Ratified in 2002  Nations which could be affected by this legislation include  Burundi  Chad  Colombia  The Democratic Republic of Congo  Cote d Ivoire  Sri Lanka and Sudan       Under Durbin s legislation  a child solder is defined as      any person under age 18 who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces   any person under age 18 who has been compulsorily recruited into governmental armed forces   any person under age 16 voluntarily recruited into governmental armed forces   any person under age 18 recruited or used in hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of a State   persons identified as child soldiers may be serving in any capacity  including in support roles such as  but not limited to  cooks  porters  messengers  medics  guards  sex slaves  etc    Next week  Tuesday  April 24   Durbin  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  will hold a hearing on the issue of child soldiers  The hearing will look at the continuing use of children in war despite the fact that that is widely seen as a war crime  Expert witnesses from non governmental and faith based organizations will testify along with Ishmael Beah  bestselling author of  A Long Way Gone  Memoirs of a Boy Soldier
