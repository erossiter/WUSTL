2  2007  Today  U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL   sent a letter to U S  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking him to clarify his testimony suggesting that enemy forces could legally subject Americans to abusive interrogation techniques  including waterboarding and mock execution     Durbin says that Gonzaless recent testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee raises serious new questions about the Administrations commitment to Americas legal and moral obligation not to subject detainees to cruel and inhumane treatment     In the letter  Durbin asked Gonzales to explain his claim that the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions would not apply to some detainees held by the United States  This is the first time an Administration official has publicly claimed that such a legal loophole exists     Durbin also charged that Presidents recent Executive Order regarding CIA detention and interrogation redefines Common Article 3  which violates our treaty obligations and would permit detainee abuse  Durbin asked Gonzales to explain the legal basis for this redefinition      Durbin is the Senate s Assistant Majority Leader and Chairman of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee     Text of the letter appears below      August 2  2007      The Honorable Alberto R  Gonzales   Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20530    Dear Attorney General Gonzales    I write in reference to your sworn testimony last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the Presidents Executive Order interpreting Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as applied to CIA detention and interrogation  Your testimony raises serious questions regarding whether that Executive Order complies with the law and would prohibit illegal and abusive interrogation techniques     In particular  I want to give you an opportunity to clarify your troubling suggestion that it would be legal for enemy forces to subject American citizens to cruel and inhumane interrogation techniques  including waterboarding and mock execution      During the July 24th hearing  I identified five interrogation techniques  1  painful stress positions  2  threatening detainees with dogs  3  forced nudity  4  waterboarding  i e   simulated drowning  and 5  mock execution  I explained that the Judge Advocates General  the highest ranking attorneys in each of the four military services  have stated that each of these techniques is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  I then asked you  Would it be legal for a foreign government to subject a United States citizen to these so called enhanced interrogation techniques which I just read  You responded  Senator  you re asking me to answer a question which  I think  may provide insight into activities that the CIA may be involved with in the future    I t would depend on circumstances  quite frankly  emphasis added      It is deeply troubling that you refuse to state unequivocally that it would be illegal for enemy forces to subject American citizens to these inhumane techniques  Your failure to make this clear may embolden our enemies to abuse American prisoners  I want to give you an opportunity to clarify your views on this vitally important question    1  For each of the five techniques named above  please respond to the following questions    a  Would it be legal for enemy forces to use this technique on an American detainee    b  Would it violate Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions for enemy forces to use this technique on an American detainee    2  Do you agree that all interrogation techniques used by the CIA must comply with Common Article 3    3  If all CIA interrogation techniques must comply with Common Article 3  could enemy forces legally use all such techniques against American detainees    4  If the United States does not explicitly and publicly prohibit the five techniques named above  how can we plausibly argue that it would be illegal for enemy forces to subject Americans to such treatment    During the July 24th hearing  you also suggested that Common Article 3 would not apply to some detainees held by the United States  which ironically would entitle al Qaeda detainees to a higher standard of treatment than other detainees  This is the first time an Administration official has publicly claimed that such a legal loophole exists  I asked you  Do you now agree that Common Article 3 applies to all detainees held by the United States  You responded    What I can say is that certainly Common Article 3 applies to all detainees held by the United States in our conflict with al Qaeda   If there were a different kind of conflict that on its face isnt covered by Common Article 3  then obviously we would not be legally bound by Common Article 3     This is a misinterpretation of Common Article 3 and the Supreme Courts Hamdan v  Rumsfeld decision  As you acknowledged in your testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on August 2  2006  Common Article 3 is the baseline standard that now applies to the conduct of U S  personnel in the War on Terror  The law is clear  Common Article 3 protects all detainees  regardless of their status  The Hamdan court cited the official commentary on the Geneva Conventions  which states simply  nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law    5  What is the legal basis for your view that Common Article 3 does not apply to all detainees held by the United States    6  What legal protections apply to detainees who are not covered by Common Article 3    7  Does the Executive Order regarding Common Article 3 apply to all detainees in CIA custody    8  Are any detainees currently in U S  custody not protected by Common Article 3    9  Does Common Article 3 apply to all detainees held in connection with the conflict in Afghanistan    10  Does Common Article 3 apply to all detainees held in connection with the war in Iraq    I am also concerned that the Executive Order might permit abusive treatment that violates Common Article 3  even for those detainees who are covered by its terms  The Military Commissions Act reaffirmed the Presidents authority to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions  just as he may interpret any treaty  The MCA did not grant the President the authority to redefine or narrow the Geneva Conventions  In fact  during consideration of the MCA  Congress specifically rejected the Administrations request to redefine Common Article 3     Nonetheless  the Executive Order redefines the meaning of Common Article 3 in a manner that would permit abusive interrogation techniques  As P X  Kelley and Robert Turner wrote in a recent Washington Post column  the language in the executive order cannot even arguably be reconciled with Americas clear duty under Common Article 3 to treat all detainees humanely and to avoid any acts of violence against their person     Common Article 3 states that outrages upon personal dignity  in particular humiliating and degrading treatment are absolutely prohibited  emphasis added   The Executive Order  on the other hand  prohibits willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse done for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual in a manner so serious that any reasonable person  considering the circumstances  would deem the acts to be beyond the bounds of human decency  emphasis added   In other words  humiliating and degrading treatment  which Common Article 3 absolutely prohibits  is permitted under the Executive Order as long as it is not willful and outrageous or a reasonable person would not consider it beyond the bounds of human decency  Moreover  the Executive Order permits the CIA to subject a detainee to willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse as long as they are done for some purpose other than humiliating or degrading the detainee  e g   protecting national security    11  What is the legal basis for the Executive Orders narrowing definition of Common Article 3    12  Please explain how the Executive Order complies with our nations legal obligations under Common Article 3    13  The Justice Department reportedly issued an opinion approving the legality of interrogation techniques authorized pursuant to the Executive Order  Will you provide a copy of this opinion to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  If not  please explain the specific legal basis for your refusal to provide the opinion    Due to the gravity of this matter  I request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible  and in no case later than Thursday  August 9    Sincerely           ____________________   Richard J  Durbin
