October 31  2006    Chicago  IL      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today called on the Inspector General of the Department of Education to investigate any conflict of interest between lenders and the universities to which they offer outsized incentives based on how much students borrow       Durbin questioned the    disturbing    practice of colleges and universities maintaining preferred lender lists  from which students will be encouraged to obtain private loans to cover the shortfall in tuition   He said recent incentives from lenders have included all expenses paid trips  iPods and bonuses based on how much students borrow          The first obligation of any college or university is to help its students  not the lenders     Durbin said      At a time when college costs continue to rise and students are borrowing more and more to pay for higher education  university officials should be looking out for the interests of the students and not the next all expenses paid trip to the Caribbean          Durbin added     At the end of the day  the incentive based relationships between lenders and universities could lead to students being saddled with even more debt   It   s time for these sweetheart arrangements to come to an end          In a letter to John P  Higgins  Jr   the Inspector General of the U S  Department of Education  Durbin wrote     Colleges and universities should not be enticed to select    preferred    lenders or take other actions related to the student loan program on the basis of factors that are irrelevant  or at best ancillary  to the primary interests of the students    When a student is faced with obtaining a private loan to cover a shortfall  the student should know whether their school is receiving an inducement in exchange for the loan        Durbin also said that he was    extremely troubled    by a recent Department of Education Inspector General report which found that the government had improperly paid more than  278 million in student loan subsidy payments to Nelnet   The payments were made to guarantee a 9 5  interest rate on student loans regardless of current market rates  According to the report  Nelnet took advantage of the program by adding ineligible loans to this group   As a result  Nelnet received more than  278 million from the federal government as of June 30  2005  and the IG report warned that they could be improperly paid an additional  882 million for the ineligible loans after June 2005 if the Department of Education fails to take proper action       In a letter to Spellings  Durbin wrote that it is    an outrage that money that could have gone to student financial aid was instead being paid to a student loan company that was knowingly fleecing the federal government      He called on her    to enforce the IG   s recommendation that DoEd direct Nelnet to discontinue claiming special allowance payments for all Project 950 loans  require Nelnet to pay back to the federal government all overpayments described in the IG   s report  and implement new measures to prevent similar actions by Nelnet and other companies          Senator Durbin   s letters to IG Higgins and Secretary Spellings are below         October 30  2006   The Honorable John P  Higgins  Jr   U S  Department of Education  Office of Inspector General  400 Maryland Ave   SW  Washington  D C  20202   Dear Mr  Higgins    A recent article published in the New York Times revealed examples of incentives offered by student loan companies in order to be placed on a college or university   s    preferred    lender list   Examples cited in the article included an all expense paid trip to the Caribbean for university officials and their spouses  gifts such as iPods  and bonuses that are based on how much students borrow       I am also concerned about other types of inducements that lenders might be offering colleges and universities to try to influence school decisions about student loan options       At a time when college costs continue to rise and students are borrowing more and more to pay for higher education  it is very disturbing to learn that some lenders and some colleges and universities may be engaged in practices that do not appear to be in the best interests of the students   Colleges and universities should not be enticed to select    preferred    lenders or take other actions related to the student loan program on the basis of factors that are irrelevant  or at best ancillary  to the primary interests of the students       The law sets out a number of actions that would disqualify a lender from participating in the Federal Family Education Loan program  FFEL    For example  lenders are prohibited from    offering directly or indirectly  inducements to any educational institution or individual in order to secure loan applications   conducting unsolicited mailings to students in order to urge the student to borrow from the lender  unless the student previously obtained a loan through that lender    offering  directly or indirectly  student loans as an inducement to a prospective borrower to purchase insurance or other products  and  engaging in fraudulent or misleading advertising    It is unclear whether the law is being enforced by the Department of Education  DoEd  as it relates to the FFEL program or whether student loan companies have exploited a loophole that may allow lenders to offer inducements to school officials in return for    private    loan applications or other considerations       Even if the law does not prohibit lenders from offering inducements in exchange for private loan applications  there is the potential for a conflict of interest   Students generally seek assistance from their school officials to provide guidance on financial aid matters and have an inherent belief that their school is looking out for their best interests   When a student is faced with having to obtain a private loan in order to cover a shortfall  the student should know whether their school receives an inducement in exchange for their private loan       I would like to request that you investigate the activities of the student loan companies for their compliance with the letter and the spirit of the law   As you investigate this matter  I ask you to consider the following questions       In what ways are lenders building on the relationship they develop with students through government backed loans  Stafford  PLUS  to offer students other products  such as private loans  that are not backed by the federal government and regulated by the federal student loan program   How many students who take out a government backed loan through a lender end up borrowing additional money through a private loan from the same lender       What types of financial or other benefits have schools received for steering private loan applications to a particular lender   Do these arrangements violate the law   If so  what should DoEd do about them   If not  what changes are needed in the law to ensure that the interests of students are protected       This is not the first time lenders have been accused of offering inducements to schools or their officials   In the past ten years  what actions has DoEd taken in response to allegations of lenders offering illegal inducements to school officials   What steps has DoEd implemented to enforce the prohibition against illegal inducements   What additional safeguards should be implemented by DoEd in order to ensure that the interests of the students are protected   What additional safeguards should Congress consider to strengthen the law and help ensure that the interests of the students are protected       How many schools have left the Direct Loan program and switched to the FFEL program   What reasons do they give   What kinds of financial or other benefits have they received for doing so   What effects do such changes have on borrowers and on the government   What restrictions or safeguards are in place  or needed  to ensure that the interests of the students are a priority when a school switches from the Direct Loan program to the FFEL program       Thank you in advance for your cooperation       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator       October 27  2006   The Honorable Margaret Spellings  Secretary  U S  Department of Education  400 Maryland Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20202   Dear Secretary Spellings    The findings contained in the recent audit report of the Inspector General  IG  of the Department of Education  DoEd  entitled    Special Allowance Payments to Nelnet for Loans Funded by Tax Exempt Obligations    are extremely troubling       As you are aware  the IG conducted an audit of Nelnet   s    Project 950     a process the company initiated in 2003 in order to increase the number of loans receiving a special allowance   The IG determined that between January 1  2003 and June 30  2005  Nelnet   s Project 950    did not fund loans from an eligible source in compliance with the  Higher Education Act of 1965  as amended   regulations  and other guidance issued by the  DoEd       The IG estimates that Nelnet was    improperly paid more than  278 million in special allowance for these loans from the quarter ended March 31  2003  through the quarter ended June 30  2005  and that Nelnet could be improperly paid about  882 million for the ineligible loans after June 2005 if Nelnet   s billings are not corrected          At a time when college costs continue to rise and students and their families are finding it more and more difficult to pay for higher education  it is an outrage to learn that money that could have gone to student financial aid was instead being paid to a student loan company that was knowingly fleecing the federal government       The IG   s Nelnet report also raises the question of whether the DoEd is adequately monitoring the special allowance payments   What measures do you have in place to ensure that claims made by student loan providers are indeed eligible for the special allowance   What changes do you plan to implement to make sure that other student loan providers are not receiving improper special allowance payments       I urge you to enforce the IG   s recommendation that DoEd direct Nelnet to discontinue claiming special allowance payments for all Project 950 loans  require Nelnet to pay back to the federal government all overpayments described in the IG   s report  and implement new measures to prevent similar actions by Nelnet and other companies       Thank you for your attention to this matter and I look forward to your response       Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin  United States Senator
