                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  March 21  2007   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Elizabeth Dole  R NC   along with Representatives Jim McGovern  D MA  and Jo Ann Emerson  R MO   today unveiled legislation to significantly expand the McGovern Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program  This program  named for former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole  provides school lunches to children in impoverished countries  Today s bill would reauthorize the McGovern Dole program and provide it with additional funding so that it is restored to its original level of  300 million by 2012        Every day around the world  more than 300 million children go through the day and then go to bed at night without enough to eat   Durbin said    To put that into perspective  it would be as if every one of the 298 million men  women and children living in the United States went to bed hungry each day   If we want the children of the world to become tomorrow s leaders  we must provide them with the basic building blocks to be successful         The McGovern Dole program helps feed hungry children in some of the world s poorest countries   said Dole    This program  conceptualized by my husband Bob Dole and his good friend and former Senate colleague George McGovern  has had great success  annually feeding more than 3 million children in 41 countries with remarkable results  such as improved literacy and school enrollment   McGovern Dole has tremendous potential to do more   and the legislation we are introducing today will help ensure that this program can expand and feed more starving children around the globe        The McGovern Dole program provides donations of U S  agricultural commodities and financial and technical assistance for school feeding and child nutrition in low income  food deficit countries  The key objectives of the program are to reduce hunger and improve literacy  increase access to primary education  especially for girls  and to improve the health and learning capacity of pre school children  Since McGovern Dole became law in 2000  the program has provided meals to 26 million children in 41 countries and has boosted school attendance by 14 percent overall and by 17 percent for girls  The program has had a markedly positive effect on educational attainment and long term development outcomes       Unfortunately  since the McGovern Dole program was first created in 2000 with an allocation of  300 million  funding has decreased to  50 million and then rebounded to  100 million  Organizations who track international feeding programs estimate that the program is only reaching about 3 million children each year       The Senate and House bills will ensure that minimum funding levels be provided each year and will allow the program to reach significantly more children  Increased resources will also ensure multi year commitments that are necessary in building self sustaining school feeding programs       One person who has participated in international school feeding programs is Paul Tergat  the current world record holder in the marathon   He ran the 26 2 mile race in 2 04 55  When he was a child living in Kenya  he received free lunches through a World Food Program school feeding program  Without the program  Tergat says his parents were too poor and he would not have been able to go to school        It is sometimes difficult for those of us used to the abundance of America to realize how significant this program can be in the lives of vulnerable children around the world   Durbin said    This legislation is a win win proposal  It builds on existing food aid programs  continues the successful work being conducted by relief organizations and will be implemented in a way that ensures that we distribute our agricultural harvests in a way that promotes long term development in foreign countries        The McGovern Dole program is supported by Christian Children s Fund  Bread for the World

Association  Better World Campaign and the National Corn Growers Association       In addition  a number of farm organizations also support the bill  including the Illinois Soybean Association and the Illinois Farmers Union   Last year  the McGovern Dole Program donated 16 000 tons of U S  wheat and wheat products  1 000 tons of U S  corn and corn products and 11 500 tons of U S  soybeans and soybean products   Illinois ranks second among the states in terms of both corn and soybean production and is among the top ten producers of wheat   More than 90 percent of the cultivated acreage in Illinois is planted with corn  soybeans or wheat   Illinois also exports more agricultural commodities than all but three other states
