May 31  2006    CHICAGO  IL      The impact of global warming is real  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  told a group of elementary school students gathered at Chicago   s Lincoln Park Zoo  pointing to the plight of polar bears who are seeing their Arctic habitat slowly melt       Durbin told the students that they and their families can take action to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encouraged the students to talk to their parents about their interest in helping to stop the global warming trend   Small steps the Senator suggested include saving electricity by turning off lights and computers  biking and walking instead of asking for a car ride  planting trees  recycling and encouraging parents to buy products designed to save energy       Durbin has also proposed a series of legislative solutions to help reverse the global warming trend      It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that the decisions we make today provide solutions to global warming instead of adding to the problem   America   s energy policy has been headed in the wrong direction for too many years  unless we turn it around  we   re going to reach a dead end     Durbin said          We have a chance to do two things  move seriously toward the goal of energy independence before our economy stalls and to begin to reverse the environmental damage that threatens our way of life   I believe energy and the environment are indistinguishable and the time is right for an energy policy that serves our economy and saves our environment     Durbin added       Durbin called for the passage of his bill on fuel economy standards   Last year  for the third time in a matter of four years  Durbin proposed setting a new ambitious and attainable fuel standard of 40 miles per gallon by 2015 for cars and passenger trucks  including sport utility vehicles  SUV s    The bill  often referred to as CAFE  Corporate Average Fuel Economy   is designed to get the United States back on track toward a cleaner  more efficient and less oil dependent energy future          If the U S  had increased the fuel economy of all cars sold in America ten years ago by only five miles per gallon  today we would be using more than 1 million fewer barrels of oil per day    saving  33 billion annually in the U S  economy and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming     Durbin said       Durbin also called for passage of the Clean EDGE Act of 2006  which sets a national goal of reducing oil consumption by 40   or 6 million barrels per day  by 2020   It also requires that 50  of all vehicles be fully capable of running on ethanol  biodiesel or alternative fuels by 2020 and that all refueling stations owned by major integrated oil companies must make alternative fuels available by 2015       Among the provisions that address global warming  the Clean EDGE Act of 2006 would require labeling of the annual output of greenhouse gas emission on all new vehicles sold   According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector are the largest source of energy related carbon dioxide emissions at 33 percent of total U S  energy related carbon emissions in 2004  Transportation sector emissions increased by 3 1 percent in 2004 relative to the 2003 levels   The Act also requires the Secretary of Energy with other agencies  to complete a study of the bills probable effects on greenhouse gas emissions and requires recommendations to the Act to ensure an overall reduction in total domestic greenhouse gas emissions       Durbin noted that by promoting the use of alternate fuel sources  the bill will set in motion a technological and innovation boon that will help create jobs and expand economic opportunities  while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming       Clean EDGE Act of 2006 would also   Protect consumers by making price gouging a federal crime  prohibits oil and gas companies from manipulating supplies to increase prices  and requires review of industry consolidation  Set a national standard requiring that 10  of all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020  Eliminate excessive tax breaks to major oil companies  Provide tax credit to low income consumers and rural commuters  Expand existing incentives for consumers purchasing alternative fuel vehicles
