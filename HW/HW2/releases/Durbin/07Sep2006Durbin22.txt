WITH ILLINOIS FARM BUREAU LEADERS TO DISCUSS EMERGENCY AGRICULTURE DIASASTER ASSISTANCE ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  September 7  2006    WASHINGTON  DC      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   who serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  met yesterday afternoon with the leaders of the Illinois Farm Bureau  IFB  to discuss legislation he introduced this week to provide assistance to Illinois farmers  Durbin also discussed the importance of the Water and Resources Development Act  WRDA  and the 2007 Farm Bill          I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle over the past year to provide Illinois and other Midwestern farmers with critical relief needed to deal with last year   s drought     said Durbin      Unfortunately  the President  House Republicans  and USDA continue to challenge our efforts to provide Illinois farmers with disaster relief   This simple  bipartisan legislation will provide long overdue assistance to Illinois farmers          Durbin s new legislation would      Assist farmers who have lost more than 35 percent of their crop with a payment of 50 percent of the established crop price   Provide Supplemental Economic Loss Payments to help compensate farmers for significantly higher energy and fertilizer costs in 2005 and 2006   Provide assistance for livestock producers facing increased feed costs   Provide additional assistance to farmers to compensate for specialty crop losses     Durbin noted that in addition to coping with crop losses  farmers have had to deal with significantly higher operating costs  as a result of increased fuel prices   For Illinois farmers  increased fuel prices mean higher costs for operating farm machinery  as well as rising fertilizer and pesticide prices   Durbin added that the average Illinois farmer  with a 1 000 acre farm  is paying  24 000 more than he or she did in 2001 to operate a farm   This 30 percent increase in costs is a direct result of higher gas prices which have led to higher fuel  fertilizer and pesticide costs for farmers across the state       At the meeting Durbin also updated Farm Bureau leaders on the status of the Water and Resources Development Act  WRDA    The Senate passed of a version of WRDA in July which includes Congressional authorization for locks and dam modernization on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  It also authorizes specific projects for navigation  ecosystem restoration  and flood and storm damage reduction  The House version of WRDA passed by a 406 14 margin in July of last year   The bill now goes to a conference committee that will reconcile differences in the House and Senate bills  it is expected members of the conference committee will be appointed in the next couple of days          Passing WRDA will mean over 50 000 new jobs for the region  shorter shipping times  and improved business for Midwest producers along the River     said Durbin      The Mississippi River transports  12 billion worth of products every year  affecting agriculture  commercial  and labor interests across the state  I discussed with the Farm Bureau the importance of working closely with members of the conference committee to ensure swift passage of this bill        The most significant provision in the bill would increase lock and dam capacity and improve the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers   Sixty percent of all U S  corn exports are shipped to export markets on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers  including more than half of Illinois  annual corn crop  The legislation would authorize  2 3 billion for replacing and upgrading locks and dams and another  1 58 billion for ecosystem restoration       Durbin also discussed the 2007 Farm Bill  The Farm Bill will likely contain a number of provisions important to Illinois farmers including improving protections for farmers in the event of natural disasters such as droughts and flooding  modifying the current commodity support programs  maintaining nutrition programs like Food Stamps and the Women  Infants  and Children Program  WIC  and increasing federal support for innovative renewable energy projects   House and Senate Agriculture Committees are currently holding hearings around the country to gather information from farmers and other stakeholders on a variety of topics  including crop insurance  commodity programs  rural development  renewable energy and others   The Agriculture Committee is expected to begin writing the Farm Bill next year       Illinois Farm Bureau leaders are in Washington this week for an annual Farm Bureau leadership meeting


