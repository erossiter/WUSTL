September 8  2006   CHICAGO  IL   Five years later  we remember the shock  the anger  and the deep sadness that we felt   But we should also remember something else about the day America was attacked   the powerful sense of unity we felt     the sense that we are all in this together  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  said at Roosevelt University today  while discussing the state of homeland security five years after the 9 11 attacks   Durbin said we need to rededicate ourselves to closing the gaps in Americas homeland security defenses   Five years after 9 11  despite tens of billions of dollars spent    Americas ports  rails  airports  borders  nuclear power plants and chemical plants are still not completely safe   In July 2004  more than two years ago  the 9 11 Commission released 41 recommendations to make our country safer and more secure  The recommendations were bipartisan and unanimous  And the Commission said that the changes were urgently needed   Last December  two months after Hurricane Katrina  the members of the 9 11 Commission  5 Republicans and 5 Democrats  issued a final report card   It graded the governments progress in implementing the commissions recommendations   The results were bleak and alarming  five Fs  12 Ds  nine Cs and only one A  and that was an A     Durbin examined four critical areas on which we  as a nation  should focus   First   improve public safety communications  Making emergency radios inter operable and providing more radio spectrum so that first responders can communicate with each other in disasters was the top recommendation of the 9 11 Commission   Illinois  with 40 000 first responders    is ahead of many states when it comes to public safety radio communications   The state is developing a statewide interoperable communications policy   Command officers at every law enforcement  fire and emergency management agency in the state can now communicate with each other in disasters   But more needs to be done  Durbin said   The federal government should clear more room on the analog spectrum for first responders as soon as possible   It should also establish standards for interoperability of emergency communications systems   Illinois and the 13 other members of EmNet can communicate with each other  but they cant communicate with the federal Department of Homeland Security  or FEMA  or with states that arent part of the network   The federal government has to share the cost of upgrading emergency radio systems   Digital radios are clearer and more reliable than analog radios   Theyre also about 8 times more expensive     500 versus about  4 000   Second   the federal government should allocate homeland security resources on the basis of real risk  not politics   That is not happening now   Instead of targeting scarce homeland security dollars where the risks are highest  the funds are spread out across the country   As the 9 11 Commission co chairs said  its more like a revenue sharing program than a strategic plan to protect America   The current allocation doesnt reflect the additional risks we face in Illinois as a result of having more urban areas  transportation systems  chemical plants  airports and other potential terrorist attacks than many other states   The current system is also too reactive   The federal government has spent tens of billions of dollars to strengthen airline security  but it has invested only a fraction of that amount on port and rail security    even after the catastrophic train and bus bombings in Madrid and London   The first step in developing a smart  strategic plan for homeland security is conducting a thorough survey of Americas homeland security vulnerabilities   The 9 11 Commission has called repeatedly for such a survey   Yet incredibly  five years after 9 11  it still hasnt happened   A temporary agreement to base homeland security funds on risk expires at the end of this month   Congress should make it permanent   We need to increase federal investments in rail  transit and port security   Terrorists may target our aviation system again but  as we saw in Madrid and London  other forms of transportation are also vulnerable   Washington should also help states and local communities develop  and practice    evacuation plans   More than 40 percent of communities in the recent survey by the US Conference of Mayors said they had no evacuation plans  or outdated plans   We know there will be more disasters    whether they are caused by terrorism  catastrophic weather  or an epidemic  like the bird flu   We have to be prepared   Third   We know that 9 11 was caused partly by the failure of people in government to connect the dots   The 9 11 Commission has warned that government wide information sharing must be improved   But little has been done   One example   There is still no unified terrorist watch list  a tool that might have led police to the 9 11 hijackers before they committed their evil act   Illinois has developed a system to share with state agencies any homeland security information it receives from Washington   The problem is  were not getting much information  Neither are other states   That has to change  Durbin said   Finally  to protect Americans at home from terrorism  we need to restore the strength of the National Guard   Illinois National Guard units have been seriously depleted   Many Guard units  in Illinois and across America  are experiencing severe equipment shortages  jeopardizing their ability to respond in a crisis  whether its a natural disaster or terrorist attack   To be at full readiness  the Illinois National Guard needs 1 225 Humvees and light trucks   They have 458   They should have 1 129 GPS receivers   They have 116  again  about one tenth of what they need   They should have 2 170 radios   They have 857   We can take the steps needed to keep our country safe   We can reach out and help each other  as Americans did the day we were attacked   And Congress can pass the recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 Commission  said Durbin
