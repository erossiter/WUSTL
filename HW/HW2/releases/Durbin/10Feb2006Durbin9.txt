

FOR SENATE HEARING AND AGENCY INVESTIGATIONS ON FRAUDULENT SALE AND USE OF PRIVATE PHONE RECORDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Friday  February 10  2006        U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today renewed his call to stop the sale and fraudulent use of private telephone records   In letters sent today  Durbin requested a hearing from the Senate Judiciary Committee  and investigations from the Federal Trade Commission  FTC   Federal Communications Commission  FCC   and Department of Justice          The sale of an individual   s personal telephone call records is a violation of privacy  and can pose a real threat to personal safety     Durbin said     The sale and fraudulent transfer of these records needs to be punishable as a true criminal offense  subject to jail time and fines   I have called for full and immediate investigations because Congress  the Department of Justice and the regulatory agencies have an obligation to get to the bottom of these outrageous offenses          In a letter sent today to Senator Arlen Specter  R PA   Chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee  Durbin wrote to request that the Senate Judiciary Committee hold a hearing  on the reports that personal telephone records have been obtained and sold without customer approval          Durbin also wrote to the Chairman of the FTC  Deborah Platt Majoras  and the Chairman of the FCC  Kevin J  Martin  urging these agencies to immediately conduct comprehensive investigations   Durbin noted that  although the agencies have initiated investigations  there is still a need to determine what methods are being used by phone companies to protect customer privacy and how effective they are   Durbin also asked these agencies to explain the extent of their authority to stop these privacy violations   This explanation could clarify the need for legislation   Durbin also asked  in a letter sent to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  that the Department of Justice conduct similar investigations into the matter       Last month  Durbin introduced a bill that would make it illegal to sell or transfer personal information from telephone companies   The legislation provides tough criminal penalties  including up to 10 years in prison  for those found guilty of violating phone users    privacy       Durbin said that recent reports show that online brokers have illegally obtained cell phone records by posing as customers  hacking into online accounts or purchasing them from rogue employees of cell phone companies  Online brokers have made these records available for sale to anyone willing to pay for them       The senator noted that the sale of personal call records is not only a violation of individual privacy  it creates the possibility of identity theft and threatens the personal safety of law enforcement and public officials  There are significant concerns that criminals could use such services to obtain personal information about police  especially undercover officers  Recent investigations indicate that the cell phone records of the Chicago Police Department and public officials have been among those targeted       In a letter sent to his Senate colleagues last month  Durbin wrote    Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the internet  enforcement is sparse and is not a priority for the Justice Department  In addition  the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal information obtained illegally and without the consent of telephone customers          Durbin emphasized the need to address issues raised by the current patchwork of laws and regulations  which make it difficult to determine whether the information was illegally obtained and easy for violations to slip through the cracks  According to current telecom laws  telephone companies are obligated to protect customers    personal information  with the exception of warranted inquiries from law enforcement  The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  monitors and regulates telephone companies and their compliance with privacy laws  The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  handles fraud complaints  However  if an online broker obtains telephone records  the law does not prohibit their subsequent sale       Durbin also sent letters today to others involved in the phone records issue  including Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky  Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich  Illinois Attorney General Madigan  and the Illinois Commerce Commission Chairman  Charles Box  expressing his desire to work with them to prevent these privacy violations       Four of the letters appear below           February 10  2006   The Honorable Arlen Specter  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  224 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  D C   20510 6275   Dear Chairman Specter    I am writing to you today to request that the Senate Judiciary Committee hold a hearing on the reports that personal telephone records have been obtained and sold without customer approval       You and I have both introduced measures to prevent these privacy invasions   I am sure we can resolve any differences in our approaches quickly   It is important that this legislation move forward expeditiously   A hearing will allow us to illuminate the issue and lay the groundwork for a legislative fix       Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the Internet  the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal information obtained illegally or without the consent of cell phone customers   Consumer and privacy groups have expressed concerns about how easily unauthorized persons can gain access to their personal information   Regardless of how a bad actor obtains the telephone records of innocent and unsuspecting customers  the sale of such information should be prohibited       My legislation  the Phone Records Protection Act of 2006  S  2177  would prohibit the sale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone records and provide tough criminal penalties for violating phone users    privacy       I look forward to working with you and other members of the Judiciary Committee on this important matter       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator       February 10  2006   Mr  Kevin J  Martin  Chairmam  Federal Communications Commission  445 12th Street  S W   Washington  D C  20554   Dear Chairman Martin    I am writing to you today to request that the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  conduct a speedy and comprehensive investigation into reports that personal telephone records have been obtained and sold without customer approval  and advise Congress on specific legislative changes to prevent these privacy violations       As you already know  online brokers have illegally obtained cell phone records and sold them without customers    knowledge   Telephone companies receive many legitimate requests from consumers and law enforcement officials for access to personal records and the requests are handled expeditiously   However  online brokers have taken advantage of the system and begun selling cell phone records to anyone who requests them       Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the Internet  the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal information obtained illegally or without the consent of cell phone customers   Consumer and privacy groups have expressed concerns about how easily unauthorized persons can gain access to their personal information   Regardless of how a bad actor obtains the telephone records of innocent and unsuspecting customers  the sale of such information should be prohibited       Although the FCC   s Enforcement Bureau has launched an investigation into how and to what extent data brokers are obtaining personal telephone records  the investigation should also determine whether telephone companies are employing effective safety measures to protect proprietary customer information   Congress also needs to know where your existing authorities may limit your ability to put a stop to these privacy violations       Please advise me of the scope and timetable of your investigation of this matter and how federal law can be changed to better protect consumers   I look forward to your prompt response       Sincerely   Richard Durbin  United States Senator       February 10  2006   The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W
