WITH LOCAL NURSES AND EDUCATORS TO DISCUSS HOW TO EASE NURSING SHORTAGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Friday  July 7  2006    CARTERVILLE  IL      The United States is facing a critical shortage of qualified trained nurses and one of the major causes is an insufficient number of nurse educators  U S  Sen  Dick Durbin  D IL  said today as he concluded a week long tour of Illinois communities including Decatur  Champaign  Paris  Mattoon and Carterville that are affected by the shortage   The Senator discussed his plan to help stem the nursing shortage  which includes legislation he introduced in the Senate last week to provide grants to colleges to expand their ability to educate nursing students  as well as a pilot program  for which he secured Senate passage earlier this month  that will offer incentives to nurses leaving the military to become nurse teachers          The U S  Department of Health and Human Services found that in 2000 this country was 110 000 short of the number of nurses needed to adequately provide quality health care   By 2005  the shortage had doubled to 219 000 and by 2020  we will be more than 1 million nurses short     Durbin said       Durbin noted that statistics paint a bleak a picture for the availability of nursing faculty now and into the future   Last year  the American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing   They found that 66  of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty   An additional 15  said they were fully staffed but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained  It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 through 2012  reducing nursing faculty while the need for qualified nurses continues to increase          Even as America is experiencing an acute shortage of nurses  qualified students who wish to dedicate their future to nursing are being denied that opportunity     Durbin said      Nursing schools last year turned away 35 000 qualified applicants because they don   t have enough teachers on staff   My bill will strike at the heart of the problem by giving colleges all across the country the ability to train more nurses          In Illinois  the number of qualified nursing students being rejected is growing   In 2002 2003  there were 502 qualified nursing students being rejected from Illinois nursing schools   Last year  there were 1 900 students turned away because of lack of faculty and resources   At Illinois State University  for example  100 qualified applicants were rejected as a result of a shortage of teachers and financial resources       Durbin   s Nurse Education  Expansion  and Development  NEED  Act would address the situation by      Authorizing capitation grants  formula grants to schools based on the number of students enrolled  for schools of nursing to improve their ability to educate nursing students   Making graduate  baccalaureate  and associate degree nursing programs eligible to receive grant funding to hire and retain new faculty  purchase educational equipment  enhance clinical laboratories  and repair and expand infrastructure    the very problems preventing schools from enrolling more students   Requiring the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on ways to increase the number of nurse faculty       Nurses care for our children and grandchildren  our parents and other loved ones  We know the difference nurses make in our lives     and increasingly we are noticing the difference when we do not have enough of these dedicated men and women when we need them most     said Durbin     More needs to be done to boost our nurse faculty workforce in order to train the nurses we will need in the years to come          In mid June  Durbin led a bi partisan effort to adopt a six year pilot program which offers incentives to nurses leaving the military to become nurse educators   The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program was approved by the Senate and included in the Senate FY   07 Department of Defense Authorization bill          Nurses who have spent time in the military can help fill a critical gap that hurts both military and civilian health care facilities   Their service to our country will go beyond their work in military hospitals and include our classrooms and lecture halls     Durbin said       The    Troops to Nurse Teachers    program will      Provide transitional assistance for service members who already hold a master   s or PhD in nursing or a related field  and are qualified to teach   Eligible service members will receive career placement assistance  transitional stipends  and educational training from accredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition   Establish a scholarship program  on a pilot basis  that will provide financial assistance to members of the Armed Forces who have been involved in nursing during their military service in obtaining the education necessary to become nurse educators   Tuition  stipends  and financing for other educational expenses will also be provided   Recipients of scholarships must commit to teaching at an accredited school of nursing for three years in exchange for the educational support they receive    The Department of Defense may also require continuing service in the Selected Reserve  or some other form of public service    Durbin   s initiative is based on the Troops to Teachers program created in 1994  which has trained 14 000 former service members to be math and science teachers   More than 6 000 have been placed in high poverty schools       Durbin   s NEED legislation and his Troops to Nurse Teachers program are endorsed by the American Nurses Association  American Hospital Association  American Association of Colleges of Nursing  American Organization of Nurse Executives  American Health Care Association  and the National League of Nursing
