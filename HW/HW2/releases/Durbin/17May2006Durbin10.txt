     DEMOCRATS LEAD THE WAY TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

THE WAY TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wednesday  May 17  2006           Calling it a roadmap to America   s energy independence and a significant step toward addressing the global warming crisis  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  today joined Democrats to announce the Clean Energy Development for a Growing Economy  EDGE  Act of 2006          America   s energy policy has been headed in the wrong direction for too many years  unless we turn it around  we   re going to reach a dead end     Durbin said      America holds only 3  of the world   s oil reserves  yet we consume 25  of the world oil produced   Drilling our way out of the current energy crisis is no solution  Americans cannot afford to be so dependent on Middle East oil  and the Bush Cheney administration cannot be permitted to set any more energy policies with Big Oil   s bottom line in mind             We have a chance     maybe our last chance     to do two things  move seriously toward the goal of energy independence before our economy stalls and to begin to reverse the environmental damage that threatens our way of life   The Democrats believe it is time for leadership     time for a new direction     time for an energy policy that serves our economy and saves our environment     Durbin added       Durbin said the Clean EDGE Act of 2006 sets a national goal of reducing oil consumption by 40   or 6 million barrels per day  by 2020   It also requires that 50  of all vehicles be fully capable of running on ethanol  biodiesel or alternative fuels by 2020 and that all refueling stations owned by major integrated oil companies must make alternative fuels available by 2015          Relying on Midwest corn instead of Middle East oil is in America   s best interest  Illinois farmers stand ready and willing to contribute to our nation   s energy security and independence     Durbin said       Durbin noted that by promoting the use of alternate fuel sources  the bill will set in motion a technological and innovation boon that will help create jobs and expand economic opportunities  while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming          The impacts of global warming are real and it is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that the decisions we make today provide solutions to global warming instead of adding to the problem     Durbin said       Among the provisions that address global warming  the Clean EDGE Act of 2006 would require labeling of the annual output of greenhouse gas emission on all new vehicles sold   According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector are the largest source of energy related carbon dioxide emissions at 33 percent of total U S  energy related carbon emissions in 2004  Transportation sector emissions increased by 3 1 percent in 2004 relative to the 2003 levels   The Act also requires the Secretary of Energy with other agencies  to complete a study of the bills probable effects on greenhouse gas emissions and requires recommendations to the Act to ensure an overall reduction in total domestic greenhouse gas emissions        Clean EDGE Act of 2006 would also      Protect consumers by making price gouging a federal crime  prohibits oil and gas companies from manipulating supplies to increase prices  and requires review of industry consolidation   Set a national standard requiring that 10  of all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020   Eliminate excessive tax breaks to major oil companies   Provide tax credit to low income consumers and rural commuters   Expand existing incentives for consumers purchasing alternative fuel vehicles
