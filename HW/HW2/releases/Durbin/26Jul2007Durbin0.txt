July 26  2007       U S  Senator Dick Durbin sent a letter late last night to state and local officials requesting a meeting to discuss recent concerns raised about asbestos at the Illinois Beach State Park  Illinois Beach State Park consists of 6 5 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline in the City of Zion in Lake County  Asbestos containing materials  such as house siding  water and sewer pipe  floor tile  and roofing material  have been washing up onto the beach since 1997  While signs are posted on the beach alerting beachgoers to the presence of asbestos  it has since been determined safe for human use   A story from yesterday s Chicago Sun Times reports concerns regarding the severity of asbestos levels at the beach  Human exposure to asbestos has been known to cause serious lung problems and cancer  According to the article  tests by the Centers for Disease Control completed in August 2006 found that the most toxic form of asbestos  amphibole asbestos  were located on the beach  Because of these findings  officials from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency expressed concerns regarding the safety of the beach for human use in an April 24  2007 letter to a federal health official in Chicago  In todays letter Durbin said  Millions of visitors enjoy the shores of Lake Michigan  and specifically the beaches at Illinois Beach State Park  every year  I want a clear understanding about any potential threats of asbestos there  Senator Durbin has led a bipartisan group of Illinois lawmakers in assuring that Lake Michigan and its shores are safe as a recreation site and source of drinking water for millions  On July 16  immediately after being informed of a permit that will allow BPs Whiting refinery in Indiana to discharge more pollution into Lake Michigan  Senator Durbin sent a letter to Benjamin Grumbles  Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water at the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to express his strong opposition  Durbin and Emanuel sent a second letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen L  Johnson expressing strong concern over the issuance of the permit and requesting for a hold to be placed on the permit until certain assurances have been met  Yesterday  Durbin and members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation met with the President of BP America to request that the company find alternatives to the dumping   Similar letters were sent to Douglas Scott  Director of the Illinois EPA  Sam Flood  Director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources  Brad Bradley  Project Manager at the US Environmental Protection Agency  Region 5  Mark Johnson  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  Tim King  Director of Intergovernmental Affairs  Chicago Park District  Paul Kakuris  the President of the Dunes Preservation Society  Lane Harrison  Mayor of Zion  Representative Melissa Bean  D IL   and Representative Mark Kirk  R IL    Text of the letter appears below   July 25  2007    The Honorable
