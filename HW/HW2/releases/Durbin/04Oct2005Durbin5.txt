     DURBIN PROPOSES STRATEGIC GAS AND FUEL RESERVE

STRATEGIC GAS AND FUEL RESERVE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Tuesday  October 4  2005    CHICAGO  IL      With one quarter of this country   s refinery capacity off line due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  has proposed a plan to create a fuel reserve that would provide consumer with a price buffer when pipelines or refinery outages occur due to national catastrophes   Durbin legislation  the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of 2005  would require the Department of Energy to hold and manage 40 million barrels of unleaded gasoline and 7 5 million barrels of jet fuel to be used in times of shortages that adversely impact the U S  economy   U S  Senator Barack Obama has co sponsored the bill          What hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught is that we must be ready for the unexpected   We must be prepared to absorb the impact that another natural disaster  refinery fire  or pipeline explosion would have on the fuel supply and as a result on our economy   It is critical to our national and economic interests to build a gasoline reserve to keep the country moving forward in case of an emergency     Durbin said       Today  the United States is ill prepared to provide immediate relief to consumers when drastic fuel shortages occur    While European countries began creating emergency stockpiles of gasoline decades ago  the U S  hasn   t done so   Instead  we must rely on imports of refined product to reduce supply shortages       The Bush Administration has ordered the release of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  which was created in the 1970s following an Arab oil embargo   but without refinery capacity  putting crude oil on the market does little to provide gasoline to consumers and alleviate high prices at pump   There is ten day lag time between production and delivery of refined gasoline   A Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve would provide the much needed refined product that would immediately alleviate supply constraints and high prices at the pump       The Washington Post last week reported that refineries have recognized a 255  increase in the amount of profit they pull in from the sale of one gallon of gasoline   Last year  refiners received only 27 cents per gallon     this year  they are pulling in nearly one dollar for every gallon of gasoline that Illinois consumers buy       The gasoline and jet fuel reserve could save both consumers and the airlines billions of dollars by alleviating price spikes caused by unexpected fuel shortages       Mark Anderson  Vice President  Government Affairs  United Airlines  said     Senator Durbin understands that escalating fuel prices  driven in part by shortages in supply  have a negative impact on travel and economic stability for individuals and businesses throughout Illinois and the nation   This proposal  which will ensure that emergency supplies of refined products like gasoline and jet fuel are located at strategic locations across the country  will provide economic stability when it is most needed   We applaud Senator Durbin   s efforts to address this issue of critical importance          According to Will Ris  Senior Vice President for Government Affairs for American Airlines   the proposal of Senator Durbin to establish a reserve of refined oil products is a far sighted idea that should be implemented quickly   The hidden story of the current crisis is that the cost of refining crude oil has increased at a much more rapid rate than the price of crude itself   By creating a reserve of refined products  the fluctuation in the markets due to temporary refining shortages can be reduced substantially   We particularly applaud Senator Durbin s proposal to build reserves of jet fuel as well as gasoline   This shows a strong understanding of the importance of commercial aviation to the economy
