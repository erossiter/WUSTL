January 30  2007    WASHINGTON  DC     In a bipartisan letter sent today  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  along with seventeen other members of the Senate  called for a meeting with the President to discuss emergency agriculture disaster assistance for struggling farmers and ranchers in rural America          Farmers and ranchers around the United States have faced serious challenges over the last two years from weather related natural disasters     Durbin and the others wrote      We  along with many of our colleagues in Congress  have been working for two years to secure emergency assistance for agricultural producers who have experienced serious losses due to circumstances that are beyond their control          Durbin said  the average Illinois farmer with a 1 000 acre farm is paying  24 000 more than he or she did in 2001 to operate   This 30 percent increase in costs is a direct result of higher gas prices which have led to higher fuel  fertilizer and pesticide costs for farmers across the state  The agriculture assistance called for by Durbin and other lawmakers will help local farmers deal with the daily cost of running a farm       Durbin is also a co sponsor of S  284  the Emergency Disaster Assistance Act of 2007 which  would provide  4 4 billion in emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies       Durbin was joined on the letter by Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Kit Bond  R MO   Byron Dorgan  D ND   Ken Salazar  D CO   Kent Conrad  D ND   Max

Reid  D NV   and Ben Nelson  D NE       Full text of the letter appears below      January 30  2007   The President  The White House  Washington  DC   Dear Mr  President    We are writing to request a meeting with you to discuss the urgent need for agricultural disaster assistance in rural America       Farmers and ranchers around the United States have faced serious challenges over the last two years from weather related natural disasters including drought  flood  wildfires  frost  and disease   Excessive rainfall and flooding in 2005 caused millions of acres of farmland to go unplanted and washed away millions of additional acres   A severe drought last summer plagued the United States  leaving fields of crops and forage as dry and barren as a moonscape   And serious snowstorms this winter have killed tens of thousands of cattle       Although the vast majority of the producers we represent carry crop insurance to help them manage the risks inherent in agriculture  crop insurance was never designed to cover repeated years of devastating weather or livestock losses sustained by ranchers   As a result  many farm and ranch families badly need an agricultural disaster relief package if they are to stay on the land       This country has always acted to help those affected by disasters    We  along with many of our colleagues in Congress  have been working for two years to secure emergency assistance for agricultural producers who have experienced serious losses due to circumstances that are beyond their control   You have not been supportive of our efforts over the past two years  but we believe that after hearing about some of the hardworking farmers and ranchers who have faced devastating weather conditions  you will help us in providing desperately needed assistance for agriculture producers across the country       We look forward to the opportunity to discuss this important issue with you and we hope you will be willing to meet with us when your schedule allows
