CHAMBLISS  BAYH  CONRAD INTRODUCE BI PARTISAN RESPECT FOR THE FUNERALS OF FALLEN HEROES ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Monday  October 2  2006                                                                                         Washington  D C       With U S  troops in harm   s way around the world  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Evan Bayh  D IN  and Kent Conrad  D ND  introduced The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act  S 4042  saying it is disgraceful for any American to disrupt the funeral of a U S  servicemember or veteran   The Senators said they authored the legislation after being disgusted by the scores of protests that have occurred at military funerals nationwide        Our nation owes our soldiers  our fallen heroes and all our veterans a debt of thanks that can never be repaid     Senator Durbin said      We can show them and their families our gratitude by guaranteeing that our military will be the best equipped and best trained force in the world  that our veterans will have the services they deserve  and that those who have served our nation will be laid to rest with dignity and honor           This legislation has been carefully drawn to respect not only our veterans but also our constitutional freedoms     Durbin added     It addresses conduct  not content  a critical element in protecting our freedoms of expression           Our military men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice deserve to have a funeral with honor and dignity     said Chambliss  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee      It   s only right that the family members of our fallen military men and women have peace and respect at this very difficult time           Our troops are among the most selfless and idealistic people I have met  and they should be buried with the dignity they have earned     Senator Bayh said      They represent America at its finest   The protesters who have tried to disrupt funerals in Indiana and elsewhere represent the worst   This legislation will provide needed protection to all our servicemembers and veterans  regardless of where they are laid to rest           Disrupting military funerals goes beyond the bounds of decency  It must stop and it must stop now     Senator Conrad said      There is no greater act than to lay one   s life down in the defense of our nation  We must honor the sacrifice of our fallen soldiers and allow their families to mourn with peace and dignity  The final resting place for these soldiers is hallowed ground        In May 2006  Congress passed and the President signed into law the Respect for America   s Fallen Heroes Act  which prohibits demonstrations at and around federal cemeteries   However  there are only 121 federal cemeteries in the United States   Approximately 90 000 veterans are buried each year at federal cemeteries  which are covered by the law passed in May   The legislation would expand coverage of the demonstration ban to the funerals of 650 000 700 000 veterans who die each year in the United States     The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act would build on the current law by providing similar protection for the funerals of all deceased members or former members of the Armed Forces  not only at federal cemeteries but also at private cemeteries  funeral homes  and houses of worship     The National Military Family Association has endorsed the legislation because it bans    demonstrations in ALL military funerals   Grieving military families  who had made the ultimate sacrifice  should not be subjected to these intrusions   This legislation will provide military families the opportunity to mourn in a peaceful environment           As President of the Illinois Council of Chapters of the Military Officers Association of America  MOAA   I represent over 6 000 MOAA members  who live in our state  plus their family members and survivors   I believe that the 34 000 plus military retirees and all the other veterans in the state of Illinois would agree that federal legislation is needed to ban demonstrations at the funerals of all our veterans  wherever they are held     wrote retired U S  Army Colonel Aaron J  Wolfe     Under the legislation  it would be a criminal misdemeanor     punishable by a fine or up to one year in jail     for any person to  1  make any noise or diversion within the boundary of or within 150 feet of a military funeral location that intentionally disturbs the peace and good order of the funeral  or  2  intentionally impede access to or from the funeral within 300 feet of the funeral location     The legislation has also been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America   In a letter to Durbin  MOAA   s Director of Government Relations  retired Air Force Colonel Steven P  Strobridge  wrote     Those who have laid their lives on the line for our Nation deserve better than to have their families harassed by extremist elements in their hours of grief   We strongly support your efforts to protect them and their families  and pledge to assist however we can in securing enactment of your proposed legislation        The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act is consistent with the First Amendment according to University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment scholar Geoffrey Stone  and the bill is within Congress   s lawmaking power according to an analysis conducted by the Congressional Research Service
