    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Statement submitted into the Record                      Harrisburg   Friday  July 21  2006                      Mr  Chairman  agriculture is Pennsylvania  s number one industry   According to 2004 U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  statistics  the market value of all agriculture production in PA was approximately  7 026 739 000   Since taking office in 1981  I have fought for all of our agriculture producers  ranging from those who produce milk  apples  peaches  or mushrooms   In the United States  Pennsylvania alone is the number one producer of mushrooms and the fourth largest producer of milk  apples  freestone peaches  and eggs   With this in mind  I commend the Senate Agriculture Committee for holding a series of field hearings across the United States  including one in Pennsylvania  in order to gather input from those who the 2007 Farm Bill will directly affect  farmers   Farmers and rural America are the backbone of our great country   Everyday  they work the fields  milk the cows  herd the cattle  and pick the produce   I myself grew up in rural Kansas and in the summer of 1944 at the age of fourteen  I worked for Clyde Mills  father of my close friend and high school classmate Steve  driving a tractor in the wheat fields   The tractor pulled a combine  which cut the wheat  extracted the grain  and collected it in a large bin   From sunup to sundown I drove around fields of fifteen to twenty acres  cutting fourteen feet of wheat in a square  then driving in another square  cutting down fourteen more feet of wheat  and so on until the entire field was cut   Farming was a great incentive to become a lawyer   In any case  I learned a most poignant lesson on the difficulties of working on a farm   This is why we need to ensure that our farmers are not left behind as the next Farm Bill is crafted   Dairy is Pennsylvania  s number one sector of the agriculture industry  In 2005  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania produced 10 5 billion pounds of milk from 558 000 cows on approximately 9 000 dairy farms  Even though milk production had a market value of  1 770 912 000 in 2004  dairy farmers across PA and the nation have seen a downward trend of milk prices since November of 2005  This is why I worked hard with Senators Chambliss  Santorum  Kohl  and Leahy to get the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  extended until September 2007  The MILC program was created as part of the 2002 Farm Bill to provide supplemental payments to dairy farmers when the market price falls below a statutory trigger  The safety net program has provided timely and crucial payments to producers  particularly when prices were low in 2002 and 2003  More recently  the drop in the price of milk below the statutory price of  16 94 per hundredweight has triggered the program to make payments to dairy farmers  Farmers across the nation should not be receiving decreased milk prices  especially with the increased costs of production  such as energy  fuel  and fertilizer  As a Co Chair of the newly formed Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure a more stable dairy pricing system   Specialty crops  including fruits and vegetables  are also major products of PA  s agriculture producers   Pennsylvania  s largest cash crop is the agaric mushroom and PA leads the nation in the crop  s production in supplying 45 percent of the country  s total production   Additionally  PA is the fourth largest producer of apples and freestone peaches in the United States   Ensuring that these  and all specialty crop  producers have USDA programs to assist them should they experience market losses is crucial to Pennsylvania   Organic farming was one of the fastest growing sectors of America  s agriculture in the 1990  s  and remains so today  with an estimated annual growth rate of about 15 percent   Consumers are demanding organic products and farmers in Pennsylvania have been switching to organic farming production in order to fill this market need   The 2007 Farm Bill needs to reflect this fast growing sector by further encouraging organic farming production   Conservation funding  emphasized under the 2002 Farm Bill  has provided assistance to farmers to meet various environmental challenges relating to America  s working land  including farmland protection  soil erosion  wetlands  and wildlife habitat   In PA alone  farms comprise about one quarter of the Commonwealth  s land at 7 745 336 acres out of a total 28 684 800 land acres   I hope we can continue to emphasize the importance of conservation programs in the 2007 Farm Bill and further include existing conservation programs   Finally  rural development is an important mission of the USDA and crucial to sustaining rural America   USDA  s Rural Development programs offer financial assistance to rural communities to support essential public facilities and services  including housing  emergency service facilities  electric and telephone service  and water and sewer systems   Technical assistance and information is available for local communities to undertake community empowerment programs allowing these communities to create a local self sustaining  long term economic development program   Also  the Department  s loan programs provide local economic development by making loans available to businesses within the community   Agriculture is important to Pennsylvania and to the entire nation   We need to ensure that the next Farm Bill provides our farmers with the assistance they need to overcome hardships  as well as providing our rural communities the financial and technical assistance they need to assure a vibrant and stable rural economy   Even though I voted against final passage of the 2002 Farm Bill because it disproportionately provided more federal funds to other states and regions in the United States  I look forward to working with the Senate Committee on Agriculture and my colleagues in the full Senate to ensure farmers across America are equitably treated when it comes to federal agricultural programs and assistance                                                                 Browse by
