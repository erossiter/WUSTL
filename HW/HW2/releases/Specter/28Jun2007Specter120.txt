    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Senator Specter Speaks on Thomas on the Senate Floor                      Washington  D C    Thursday  June 28  2007                      Mr  President  I seek recognition to honor the life of my colleague  Senator Craig Thomas       Craig  a real outdoorsman  would say he enjoyed nothing more than a horseback ride through Wyoming s spectacular wilderness area  Despite that  he found himself here in Washington  DC  working for the betterment of his Home State and the Nation  He was outspoken on government s need to provide adequate funding for national parks  a subject he knew well as chairman and ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee       Senator Thomas was also a strong defender of his State s cattle industry and was a firm believer in the virtues of rural America  This passion stems back to his time at the University of Wyoming  where he received a degree in animal husbandry  Senator Thomas also served as an officer in the U S  Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959  achieving the rank of captain  an experience that taught discipline and reinforced his commitment to the United States       Before Craig came to Congress  he served as vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau  and once headed the rural electric trade association of Wyoming  After 5 years in the Wyoming House  Thomas won a special election to replace DICK CHENEY  who was appointed to be Secretary of Defense  As Wyoming s lone Member in the U S  House of Representatives  he had the responsibility of representing over 450 000 constituents  Craig was reelected to that seat in 1990 and 1992  a testament to his ability to serve the people of Wyoming effectively  In 1994  he ran for the U S  Senate and won  defeating popular Democratic Governor Mike Sullivan by 20 percentage points  He was elected to a second term in 2000 with a 74 percent majority  one of the largest margins in Wyoming election history  He was reelected to a third term in 2006 with 70 percent of the vote       Senator Thomas had no doubts about who he was or what he represented  He was not one to pick a fight  but if asked how he felt about a given issue  he would be sure to give his typically candid and honest response  When it came to issues he was passionate about  such as public lands and private property  he left little doubt as to his priorities  As a member of the Senate Energy Committee  and particularly in his leadership of the National Parks Subcommittee  Craig asked tough questions and made strong statements about the responsibility of the Federal Government to care for the land it already owned  the fundamental nature of private property rights  and Congress s need to consider the interplay between these principles when contemplating new national parks or historic sites  He was always a fair broker  and I found on many occasions that he would give my priorities fair consideration and due process       I very much regret that Senator Thomas lost his battle to cancer  In 1970  President Nixon declared war on cancer  Had that war been prosecuted with the same diligence as other wars  my former chief of staff  Carey Lackman  a beautiful young lady of 48  would not have died of breast cancer  One of my very best friends  a very distinguished Federal judge  Chief Judge Edward R  Becker  would not have died of prostate cancer  All of us know people who have been stricken by cancer  who have been incapacitated with Parkinson s or Alzheimer s  who have been victims of heart disease  or many other maladies  I sustained an episode with Hodgkin s lymphoma cancer 2 years ago  That trauma  that illness  I think  could have been prevented had that war on cancer declared by the President of the United States in 1970 been prosecuted with sufficient intensity       On a personal level  Senator Thomas had an extraordinary relationship with his wife Susan  As many of my colleagues can attest  Craig and Susan were quite inseparable and quick with humor  Even as Craig battled with acute myeloid leukemia he continued to serve in the Senate with extreme vigor and a smile  He leaves behind many friends and admirers  who have tried to emulate his courage  his tenacity  and his integrity       I extend my deepest condolences to Susan  their four children  the whole Thomas family  and his very able staff                                                                 Browse by
