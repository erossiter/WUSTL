    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  March 27  2007                      Today  Senator Arlen Specter   R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee addressed reacted to Ms  Monica Goodling  s invocation of the Fifth Amendment   Senator Specter  s statement follows    I note that we  re scheduled to vote on Judge Wu at 12 10 p m  and as ranking member  I have the balance of the time until that period   And I chose to use it to comment  briefly  on a letter which I received yesterday from John M  Dowd  the attorney for Ms  Monica Goodling who was counsel to Attorney General Gonzales and White House liaison   In this letter  Mr  Dowd asserts the basis for having Ms  Goodling claim her constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment and privilege against self incrimination not to testify before the Judiciary Committee on our inquiry into the eight United States attorneys who were asked to resign    And  Mr  Dowd makes the point emphatically that in asserting this privilege against self incrimination  Ms  Goodling is not saying that she s done anything wrong and explicitly denies any wrongdoing  but cites Supreme Court authority for the right of an individual to claim the privilege against self incrimination  even those who are innocent as well as those who might have something to hide   And there is a firm assertion of her innocence by her attorney and her own affidavit    And I can understand the reasons for this claim of privilege and the reasons that Ms  Goodling does not want to testify before the Judiciary Committee  In Mr  Dowd  s letter  he references some of my prior statements and then says   Senator Schumer has no less than five times characterized the Department s testimony to date as false or  quote  a false hood  and have concluded that there have been misleading statement after misleading statement  deliberate misstatements      close quote    Well  if a false statement has been made to a congressional committee that constitutes a crime under Title 18 of the United States Code  Section 1001  That was the basis that the number two man in the Interior Department entered a guilty plea during the course of the past week   And where there have already been characterizations  as cited by Mr  Dowd  of senator Schumer  s statement that there are misleading statements which have been made  which that states a crime  I can understand the sense of a potential witness not wanting to be ensnared in that kind of a proceeding where conclusions have already been reached by Senator Schumer  who is in charge of the investigation    Mr  Dowd  s letter further goes on citing comments which I had made earlier  quote   that senator Schumer is using the hearing    this is Mr  Dowd s statement     hearings to promote his political party  That is not a legitimate reason for the Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings   And I have said in the Judiciary Committee hearings in the presence of Senator Schumer  eyeball to eyeball  so to speak  that I thought there was a conflict of interest   In concluding that there was a conflict of interest  I did not ask Senator Schumer to step aside  I said that was up to him    But following the testimony of U S  Attorney Iglesias from New Mexico  the very next day the web site of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had Senator Domenici  s picture on it urging his defeat in the 2008 election  And then shortly thereafter there was a fundraising letter from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to raise money saying that the democrats were elected to clean up Washington  and this is an example of what needs to be cleaned up    Now  any of us may be subject to a comment in a political situation  And Senator Schumer has a right to make political hay out of whatever he chooses to you  But I think that is inconsistent with leaving an inquiry and I can understand Ms  Goodling s decision not to testify in this context  And I think it is very unfortunate because it is very important for the Judiciary Committee to get to the bottom of what has happened with the request for eight United States attorneys to resign  There is a cloud over United States attorneys  and I think it has had a distinct  chilling effect on all 93 United States attorneys  not knowing what will come next    It is generally agreed that the president of the United States has the authority  standing right  to discharge United States attorneys for no reason at all  When President Clinton took office in one fell swoop he replaced 93 United States attorneys  and no one raised any question  But I think if United States attorneys have been asked to resign and have been replaced for an improper reason  for a bad reason  suggestion has been made that the united states attorney in San Diego  Ms  Lam  was replaced because she was hot on the trail of political operatives who may have been connected to former Congressman  Duke  Cunningham  who is now serving an eight year sentence     Or the allegation has been made    hasn t been substantiated   but it has been made    that New Mexican U S  Attorney Iglesias was replaced for failure to prosecute a vote fraud case    An extended article in the New York Times a week ago Sunday gave an extensive analysis which might lead to the conclusion that there was justification for Mr  Iglesias  resignation or perhaps there was not  But that is up to the Judiciary Committee to make a determination  So it is unfortunate that you have a situation where witnesses are not coming forward    And it would be my hope that we would not rush to judgment on this matter  that we would avoid conclusionary statements  and that instead we would wait until we find out what the facts are  And if these United States attorneys were asked to resign for improper reasons  I  ll be among the first to say so                                                                 Browse by                                                                  Current record
