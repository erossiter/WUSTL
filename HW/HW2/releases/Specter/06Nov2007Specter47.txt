Mukasey    Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  voted to support the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the next Attorney General of the United States  The committee approved Judge Mukaseys nomination by a roll call vote of 11 8     The nomination is now poised for a fair up or down vote on the Senate floor     Senator Specters opening statement from todays Judiciary mark up is pasted below     Senator Specter     Thank you  Mr  Chairman     Before the waterboard issue arose  Judge Michael Mukasey was deemed to be an ideal candidate for the next attorney general of the United States  almost as if he had come out of central casting on all the substantive qualifications  Columbia undergrad  Yale Law School  board of editors    distinguished credentials there     The practice of law in New York City at a prestigious firm for five years  An assistant U S  attorney for four years  Then back to the practice of law for about a decade  Then a federal judge for 18 years     Obviously  a man of great intellect  learned in the law  Spoke with precision     And we were all very anxious to see him confirmed  At the hearings  everyone spoke very  very favorably about him  And that was in part due to the status of the Department of Justice  which has been classified as dysfunctional  in disarray     We all recognize that  next to the Department of Defense  the Department of Justice is the most important department we have  It takes the lead on terrorism investigations  fights violent crime  drug crime  Very grave responsibilities     And we urgently need  at this moment  someone to run that department  because right now  it s being run down     And then the issue of waterboarding came up  And I was dissatisfied with the answer he gave to Senator Whitehouse during the hearing  And I wrote to him on October 24th  wanting clarification  And his response on October 31st did not satisfy me     And although his answers were extensive to the written questions  and very erudite and very carefully structured  they didn t satisfy me again     I got some reassurance when I read Senator Schumer s comments last Saturday  where Senator Schumer was quoted as saying that Judge Mukasey had assured him that Congress could declare waterboarding illegal and that he  Judge Mukasey  would say that the president did not have Article II power to supersede that  as the president has superseded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on the basis of his Article II powers     It is basic law that a statute cannot alter the Constitution  it takes a constitutional amendment  And if the president has Article II powers  he can disregard a statute under our laws  And there s circuit court opinion for that on foreign intelligence gathering     I wanted to be sure  so I called Judge Mukasey yesterday myself  and I had an extended conversation with him and got definitive answers to two very important propositions     First  it was his legal opinion that the Congress has the constitutional authority to prohibit waterboarding  equating it with torture and making it illegal     And secondly  he said that it was his opinion that the president did not have Article II powers as commander in chief or other inherent power to disregard a congressional enactment to that effect     And we remember perhaps Judge Mukasey s most important answer in his hearing when he responded that if a president of the United States disregarded his opinion    his judgment on an important constitutional issue  that he would resign  rather than stay on just as Elliot Richardson did in the Saturday Night Massacre    Now  this status of events bring it squarely to the purview of Congress to make a decision as to whether waterboarding amounts to torture  and therefore should be illegal  And if the Congress so decides  Judge Mukasey has said he would back that up     And it really is a decision for the Congress  The Congress  in a representative democracy    very fundamental  we all know this    makes decisions about what is in our security interest and how far we ll go on fighting terrorism  which may encroach on civil rights  how far we ought to go on interrogation practices and what we ought to do     Now  the Congress has taken up this issue in two contexts  Detainee Act  and also the Military Commissions Act  where the Congress voted down equating waterboarding with torture by a vote 53  46     I voted to make waterboarding illegal  and would do so again     There is pending legislation to that effect     But I think it really is up to the Congress     And what has been done generally is to avoid the really sticky question as to what would be done in the so called ticking bomb case  And we all know what that is     That s a situation    it s only hypothetical up until now    where information is available that there is about to be an event which would kill tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans  And there is someone who is believed to have information to enable us to discover the so called ticking bomb and head it off  And what is done     And what is happening is that public officials all dance around it  We don t want to say that waterboarding is legal  even under the ticking bomb scenario  because that would give credence or credibility or legitimacy to waterboarding  and we ought not to do that  even in the extreme case  And if the president was ever faced with that situation  it would be a presidential decision     And we ve talked about having torture warrants  submitting the matter to a court  We rejected that idea     But it is my thought    and I don t have all the answers to this complex question    that that is a matter which ought to be considered by the Congress  What do we have to say about the morality of waterboarding  Is it banned by some international commitment  The Geneva rules  A very fuzzy    very fuzzy area     Justice Jackson made a lot of famous statements  and one of his most famous statements was that the Constitution is not a suicide pact    not a suicide pact  So we re not bound by the Constitution to undertake conduct which would be a suicide     So that it is my thought that Judge Mukasey went about as far as he could go  I thought he was not on solid ground when he said he wasn t read into the program  that he didn t know what waterboarding was  Waterboarding s generally well known  Not being read into the program I thought was  candidly  an excuse  and a flimsy excuse     Certainly  he had been investigated sufficiently so the president was confident to tell him the highest secrets of the country  And he could have been read into it and could have given us a judgment     And he said in answers to my letter of October 24th that he was reluctant to put people at risk  And we know that a couple of weeks ago  former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was served with legal process  I m unclear exactly what it was  perhaps a warrant of arrest     We know that some countries are exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction on crimes against humanity  that Prime Minister Sharon was under indictment from Belgium  And we know what happened with Pinochet  So that there is a risk factor     So  I think he went about as far as he could go and I think now it s a matter for the Congress     I want to express one other concern  and that is concern about what Judge Mukasey may have as a view of excessive executive authority     I m very concerned about the presidential signing statements  where we pass legislation and under the Constitution he has the authority to either veto it or sign it  and he cherry picks  And he did it in two contexts which were very troubling     One was  after his negotiations with Senator McCain and we legislated on interrogation  he signed the bill and said he didn t have to follow it     And we passed out of this committee the Patriot Act  past the Congress  And we gave the FBI additional powers on the condition that we have more oversight  Then he signed the Patriot Act and he said he didn t have to abide by the conditions on oversight     And I asked Judge Mukasey about that and I got back an answer which is totally unsatisfactory  He said  I agree with you that presidential signing statements should not be a vehicle for creating unnecessary confrontation     Well  what does that mean  Or is there necessary confrontation     And he says he will keep in mind the concerns when advising the president  I think the attorney general should have said  The president negotiates and arranges with Congress  signs the bill  he ought to stand by it  and not act to the contrary     But all factors considered  I think that the balance is decisively in favor of confirming Judge Mukasey     And I look forward to congressional consideration of this issue of waterboarding  We re the people who ought to decide it  And with his assurances in writing that he will back us up  that s good enough for me     Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                                    Browse by
