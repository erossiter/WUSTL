    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  April 19  2007      U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  made the following opening statement at the   Department of Justice Oversight    hearing today    Senator Specter  s statement follows       Thank you very much  Mr  Chairman        The purpose of this Senate oversight hearing is to determine this committee s judgment as to whether Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should continue in that capacity        We are mindful of the difficulties and the achievements that Attorney General Gonzales had to surmount to become a Harvard Law graduate  become a Texas State Supreme Court justice  a White House counsel and now the chief law enforcement officer of the United States  a very distinguished record  indeed   And we further appreciate your status as a role model as the first Hispanic attorney general  and well recall the historic occasion  January 4th of 2005  when you appeared at that table on your confirmation hearing        As I see it  you come to this hearing with a heavy burden of proof to do three things  first  to reestablish your credibility  second  to justify the replacement of these United States attorneys  and third  to demonstrate that you can provide the leadership to the United States Department of Justice which has such a vital role in protecting our national interests and so many lives        Notwithstanding demands for your resignation by Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and elsewhere  I have insisted both publicly and privately that you be given your so called day in court to give your responses  You do so in the context of testimony from a number of people in the Department of Justice who have contradicted certain of your public statements        You earlier said that you were not involved in any discussions  and then your subordinates testified to the contrary  that you were at meetings where discussions were undertaken about the replacement of these U S  attorneys        You then said that you did not see memoranda  and again your subordinates have testified under oath that you were at meetings where documents  memoranda  were distributed        And then you modified your statement about the discussions to say that you were not involved in deliberations  And again  the testimony of three of your key subordinates    your chief of staff  Kyle Sampson  the acting associate attorney general  Bill Mercer  and the director of the Executive Office of U S  Attorneys  Michael Battle    have said that you were involved in deliberations and have done so with some particularity        So that this is your opportunity  Mr  Attorney General  to tackle that burden of proof    the heavy burden of proof to re establish your credibility here        With respect to the removal of United States attorneys  there is no doubt that the president can remove U S  attorneys for no reason at all  And President Clinton did just that in 1993  when in one fell swoop he removed 93 United States attorneys        But there cannot be a removal for a bad reason  that is if  as suggestions have been made  that U S  Attorney Lam in San Diego was replaced because she was hot on the trail of confederates of former Congressman Duke Cunningham  who is now serving eight years in jail  Or a U S  attorney may not be replaced if  as the allegations are made    and until we ve heard from you  Mr  Attorney General  I m going to regard them as allegations    until we hear from you  until we give you an opportunity to respond        But the allegations were made that U S  Attorney Iglesias in New Mexico was removed because he would not initiate prosecutions which in his discretion felt were unwarranted        Now  as you and I know  I have been candid with you in suggestions as to what you should do  I think that is the role of a senator  to be open to discuss the issues candidly        And you called me on a Saturday and I wrote to you sometime ago outlining what I thought you had to address        As far as I m concerned  this is not a game of gotcha  This is a matter where we want the facts  We want the hard facts so we can make an evaluation        And I suggested to you that you make a case by case analysis as to all of the U S  attorneys who were asked to resign  and if you felt on or concluded on reexamination that some were asked to resign improperly  that you ought to say so and even ought to consider reinstatement        If someone is improperly removed  there are judicial remedies    not in case  but in other analogous situations where courts will order reinstatement  Well  pretty hard to unscramble the eggs but that is a possibility        With respect to leadership  no one short of the secretary of defense has a more important role in our government in the administration of civil and criminal justice than does the attorney general of the United States heading the department        In your effort to remove yourself or distance yourself as you have appeared to have done  denying discussions  denying deliberations  denying memoranda  you face  really  the horns of a dilemma        And that is  if he were removed and actions were taken which were inappropriate that you were not really part of  although you have articulated your overall responsibility as CEO  but not responsible on the judgments  from the other horn of the dilemma of how you can provide the leadership if you are detached on such really important matters        It s a very  very tough dilemma  I think  that you face  And I believe you have come a good distance from the day you said that this was an overblown personnel matter in the USA Today article        So this is as important a hearing as I can recall  short of the confirmation of Supreme Court justices  more important than your confirmation hearing  In a sense  it is a reconfirmation hearing  And I await your testimony        Thank you  Mr  Chairman
