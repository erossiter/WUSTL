    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Friday  December 14  2007                       U S  Senator Arlen Specter today voted to support the 2007 Farm Bill  which received final passage from the Senate by a vote of 79 14  The Farm Bill  last renewed in 2002  covers a wide range of programs  including commodity price and income support  agricultural conservation  farm credit  research  rural development  and domestic food programs     I applaud my colleagues for passing the 2007 Farm Bill  Specter said  The legislation does a great deal for Pennsylvanias dairy farmers  and it contains very important provisions on specialty crops  conservation and nutrition programs     The Farm Bill will now be sent to conference with the U S  House of Representatives before being sent to the President    The Senators floor statement on the 2007 Farm Bill is pasted below     Mr  President  I seek recognition to give my reasons for supporting the Senate passage of H R  2419  The Farm  Nutrition  and Bioenergy Act of 2007  also known as the 2007 Farm Bill  I am voting for it notwithstanding the subsidies that have grown since The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 and I believe moving toward a free market for agriculture is highly desirable     Many constituents in my home state of Pennsylvania have contacted me to express support for final passage of the five year 2007 Farm Bill as soon as possible  Agriculture is Pennsylvanias number one industry  contributing about  45 billion to the economy through production  food processing  marketing  transportation and manufacturing  Since taking office in 1981  I have fought hard for agriculture and nutrition programs     The many provisions in the bill that are beneficial to Pennsylvania include the Milk Income Loss Contract Program for our dairy producers  increased funding for specialty crops  increased funding for nutrition programs  and increased funding for conservation programs  While other regions have received more money in previous Farm Bills through subsidy programs for cotton  rice  wheat  soybean  and corn  this Farm Bill directs more money to agriculture products in Pennsylvania than previous Farm Bills     The MILC program provides counter cyclical payments to our dairy producers when the price of milk falls below a set trigger price  Since its inception in the 2002 Farm Bill  it has provided more than  220 million to our Pennsylvania dairy farmers  Although I worked hard to ensure that any dairy provisions addressed costs of production  there was resistance from Senators from other regions in the United States  The bill also requires mandatory price reporting of sales transactions of dairy commodities and calls for a study of collapsing the dairy class system and a study of advance pricing  These provisions will help create an open  transparent dairy market benefiting dairy farmers and consumers     Pennsylvanias specialty crop producers that include mushrooms  apples  freestone peaches  and grapes will get the assistance they need to market their products  The bill provides about  2 2 billion in research and marketing programs funding  This is the most ever set aside in a farm bill to assist these farmers who are left out of traditional federal farm programs     The bill includes about  197 5 billion for nutrition programs  as compared to about  178 158 billion in the previous 2002 Farm Bill  The bill also includes  1 billion to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program  FFVP  nationwide over five years to reach nearly 4 5 million low income children  FFVP allows schools to offer and promote free fresh fruits and vegetables during the day     Finally  the bill includes increased money for conservation programs to help farmers use environmentally friendly farming practices  There is about  22 billion for conservation programs which is about  5 billion more than the 2002 Farm Bill  More specifically  the bill has  165 million for conservation programs in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  which includes large sections of Pennsylvania     Taken together  these important programs benefit Pennsylvania  Therefore  I support this Farm Bill     I yield the floor                                                                     Browse by
