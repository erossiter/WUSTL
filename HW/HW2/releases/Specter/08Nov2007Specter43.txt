    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C     Thursday  November 8  2007     Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  commended the Senates approval of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States  The Senate confirmed Judge Mukaseys nomination by a vote of 53 40   A copy of Senator Specters Floor Statement urging confirmation is below     Mr  SPECTER    Now  on to former Federal Judge Michael Mukasey  He is a man with an outstanding record  If you went to central casting  you couldn t find a better prospect to be Attorney General of the United States on substance  on qualifications  He graduated from Columbia University in 1963  Yale Law School in 1967  was on the Board of Editors of the Yale Law Journal  and credentials from Yale and the Board of Editors and the high academic standing which that implies are excellent qualifications  He was an associate in a major New York law firm for 5 years after graduating from law school  He was then an assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1972 to 1976 and was chief of the Official Corruption Unit for 2 years  Then  he went back to the practice of law for 11 years and became a Federal judge in 1988 for almost two decades  through 2006  and was Chief Judge of the Federal Court in the Southern District of New York in Manhattan from 2000 to 2006 where he presided over some very important trials involving terrorism  The courthouse for the Federal court in New York was just a few blocks from the Trade Towers which were victimized on September 11  2001     Now  a great deal has been said about the issue of waterboarding  The Senator from Illinois who just spoke said the morals of our country will be judged by what has gone on with Judge Mukasey s confirmation process  We have worked through this issue  and I believe we have a satisfactory resolution of it which accomplishes the substance of what the Senator from Illinois was decrying     I am opposed to waterboarding  I think waterboarding is torture  When the issue was before the U S  Senate on the Military Commission Act  we had a vote  and this body voted 53 to 46 not to classify waterboarding as torture  That is what the Senate did  In another legislative matter  the Detainees Act  waterboarding was prohibited  But as of this moment  the Congress of the United States has not spoken on the matter     Now Judge Mukasey has stated if waterboarding is declared the equivalent of torture  as Attorney General he will uphold the congressional determination  even if the President sought to seek to reject the statute by virtue of the President s Article 2 powers as Commander in Chief and other inherent authority which the President possesses under Article 2  Now that is exactly what the President did on the Terrorist Surveillance Program  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act enacted in 1978 specifies that the exclusive way to wiretap is to go to a Federal judge with a statement of probable cause and get a warrant    judicial approval    to do the wiretapping  But President Bush said he had authority to disregard the statute because he had constitutional authority     As a matter of constitutional doctrine  you can t amend the Constitution with a statute  To amend the Constitution  you have to have a constitutional amendment  That means passing the Congress by a two thirds vote and ratification by three fourths of the States     So the President took the position that his constitutional power superseded the statute  and he rejected it and ignored it  I have grave doubt about the propriety of what the President did there  We didn t find out about it until it was disclosed in the newspapers in mid December of 2005 when we were in the midst in this Chamber of debating the PATRIOT Act  I chaired the Judiciary Committee  and I was at this podium managing that bill when the news broke in the morning papers that day  and a number of Senators said they were prepared to vote for the PATRIOT Act until they found out what had been done secretly under the Terrorist Surveillance Program     As the record shows  we didn t pass the bill until early in 2006  But the relevance of that procedure is that there was concern that even if Congress said waterboarding was torture and therefore illegal  the President might seek to use his Article 2 powers to ignore that law     The first disclosure that former Judge Mukasey would not uphold that Presidential action came with a disclosure by Senator Schumer at a meeting he had with former Judge Mukasey last Friday  It appeared in the press that Judge Mukasey would say the congressional enactment was controlling  I then had a discussion by telephone with Judge Mukasey last Monday morning to be explicit and to confirm what I had read in the papers and not wanting to rely on that  and Judge Mukasey told me he    it was his legal judgment that Congress had the constitutional authority to legislate  to say waterboarding was torture and was  therefore  illegal  and if such legislation was enacted  then it was Judge Mukasey s legal judgment that the President could not supersede the statute  could not rely on Article 2 power to ignore that finding  That was confirmed in writing     I said in the letter  as the record will show  if Judge Mukasey had any difference with my statement  he should let me know promptly  I know it was received by White House personnel  and we communicated  staff to staff  about it  and that is a binding commitment  That commitment  in conjunction with Judge Mukasey s response to my questioning    I asked him if the President of the United States ignored his advice as Attorney General if and when confirmed on a matter of serious import  would Judge Mukasey resign as Attorney General  just as Attorney General Elliot Richardson had resigned on the Saturday Night Massacre when efforts were made to stop the investigation of President Nixon at that time  and Judge Mukasey said he would resign  So I think we have a very solid record     Now  I do believe there were reasons Judge Mukasey did not express a judgment on waterboarding as being torture  although candidly it would have been my preference if he had done so  if he had agreed with my vote on the subject  But Judge Mukasey said in written responses that he believed he could not make that pronouncement without placing people at risk to be sued or perhaps even criminally prosecuted  We know a few weeks ago  former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was in Paris at a time when people sought legal process against him  It was unclear whether it was a criminal procedure or a civil procedure  But we do know that many nations are exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction when they may consider conduct to be a violation of the law against humanity     We know  for example  that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon was indicted  I believe it was in Belgium  They couldn t serve the warrant  but had he gone to Belgium  he would have been subject to that process  We know the case of Pinochet from Chile where extraterritorial jurisdiction was sought as to him  So that is a matter of some considerable import     Professor Goldsmith wrote that from his experience as Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel that members of the administration had expressed concerns that they might be subject to civil liability or even criminal liability if it was later determined that some of their conduct was illegal  So Judge Mukasey faced a situation where an expression of an opinion by him would put people at risk     Professor Goldsmith documented that in a book which was recently published  That is  he documented the concern that members of the administration had expressed  Judge Mukasey also sought to explain his unwillingness to give a legal opinion on whether waterboarding was torture because he hadn t been read into the program  I thought that was inadequate and insufficient  While it is true he was not read into the program  there is no doubt it would have been easy for him to have been read into the program  The investigation which had been conducted prior to the President submitting his name to the Senate as a nominee for Attorney General was very thorough  and there is no doubt that he would have been entrusted with whatever classified information was involved in being informed on the issue of waterboarding  So I thought that was an excuse and not weighty    or not a valid excuse     Parenthetically  I think it is worth noting that there are members of the Judiciary Committee who were called upon to pass on Judge Mukasey s qualifications who had not been read into the program on waterboarding  that is  to know specifically what it was  whether it was used  what it was all about  was it entirely hypothetical  or what the facts were  We have some members of the Judiciary Committee    four    who are on the Intelligence Committee  The chairman and I as ranking member were read into the program  I tried to get the administration to read the members of the Judiciary Committee into the program  and the administration wouldn t do it  Now  they read the Intelligence Committee into the program  and I think the Intelligence Committee should have been read into the program  but the operative committee to pass on Judge Mukasey was not the Intelligence Committee  It was the Judiciary Committee  We voted on Judge Mukasey with members of the Judiciary Committee not knowing the specifics on waterboarding to have a sufficient basis  in my view  to cast an intelligent vote     But the administration precluded that  This evening  there will be about 80 Senators    if they stay up until midnight  or whenever it is that we vote    who will be voting on Judge Mukasey    and waterboarding is going to be a central issue of the debate tonight    without knowing the details of what waterboarding is     The brutal fact is that the administration has not given Congress the information Congress should have received so that we can perform our oversight function  The Intelligence Act requires that members of the Intelligence Committee be notified of matters such as the secret terrorist surveillance program  and it may be that a few Members of Congress    the Speaker of the House  the senior Republican in the House  the majority leader of the Senate  and the minority leader of the Senate    were informed about the terrorist surveillance program  It may be that  finally  the chairman and ranking members on the Intelligence Committee in both Houses were informed  But the full committee  under the statute  was supposed to be informed  The administration didn t follow the statute as they should have  It was only when the confirmation of General Hayden came before the Senate that the administration finally notified the Intelligence Committee     I voted against General Hayden to be Director of the CIA as a protest vote  I said he was well qualified for the job  and I voted against him as a protest because the administration had not followed the law  They should have informed me  as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the 109th Congress  and Senator Leahy  as ranking member  That is a statement of what might be considered as a collateral matter  It is relevant in this discussion because Judge Mukasey was not read into the program  I think he should have been  I don t know that he would have said anything more  But now the ball is squarely in our court    the congressional court  Legislation is pending that would make waterboarding torture and  therefore  illegal     This is the kind of question which I think is a quintessential example of what the Congress of the United States ought to decide  In a representative democracy  the Congress ought to make the determination of what is the appropriate public policy  and the Congress ought to assess the risk of terrorism    what is the risk to the United States     and then consider the conduct of waterboarding  What does it do  How frequently has it been used  if at all  Where is there an intent to use it  The Congress ought to make this evaluation and make the decision  We are the proper people to decide that issue  If the Congress enacts legislation that is signed into law  then Judge Mukasey has stated unequivocally that he would enforce it     Then there is another issue we all dance around  and that is the issue of the so called ticking bomb case  That is the situation described where a terrorist may come into possession of a powerful weapon    perhaps even a nuclear weapon    and  regrettably  that is not beyond the realm of possibility  There might be a situation where someone would know information that could stop the ticking bomb and injury to an enormous number of people could be prevented  What is to be done in that situation     The generalized statements that have been made by so called leaders in our society are that we ought not to define that situation  They say  if we were to say that torture  waterboarding  or some other extreme form of interrogation were legal under even the most limited circumstances  that we would give legitimacy to waterboarding  to torture  And then with an exception  you find people that say    as the expression goes  the hole is so big  you could drive a truck through it  But  if this Senate and the House take up our duty to decide whether waterboarding is torture  we ought to make a decision as to whether it could be used in any circumstance  Perhaps we should decide it should be used in no circumstance     There has also been discussion about legislation to define the extraordinary circumstances when torture would be permitted    with a warrant application to a judge  We ask for judicial approval on wiretapping or warrants of arrest or on a variety of issues     Then there are some who the surmise that if the President was faced with a situation of a ticking bomb  it would be up to the President to act under those exigent circumstances  and he could be relied upon  But that is not so easy either because it may well be    and I think  in fact  is    that agents of the CIA would not undertake  under a Presidential order  a violation of U S  law because no one is above the law  Even if the President were to authorize it  the President doesn t do the waterboarding or interrogation  Those people would be unwilling to undertake something that was a violation of law     There was a famous case  after World War I  where a ship was sunk by a submarine  The survivors in the lifeboat were at sea  and the submarine surfaced  The commander ordered the gunner to shoot the people in the lifeboat  The gunner resisted for a while  and then he followed his orders  He shot and killed the people in the lifeboat  The gunner was prosecuted  and he defended that he was following orders  The court said that you cannot follow illegal orders  Anybody should know better than to shoot people in a lifeboat     So we have a major issue to consider as it relates to the confirmation of Judge Mukasey  and I think the ball is now in our court  He will enforce legislation that equates waterboarding with torture     There are a couple of other points worthy of comment  I was not satisfied with Judge Mukasey s response to my questions on signing statements  We have seen that the President of the United States now does not follow the constitutional options when legislation is presented to him having been passed by both bodies  both Houses  where the Constitution says the President has the choice of signing it or vetoing it  We now find that he signs it and issues the signing statement  cherry picking  deciding which of the provisions he will enforce and which he will not enforce     One of the measures passed by Congress by a 90 to 9 vote of the Senate was prohibiting interrogation that met certain standards  The President had a famed rapprochement with Senator McCain on the point  They came to terms  We passed the McCain language  Then the President issued a signing statement which  in effect  said he retained his Article II powers not to follow it    The PATRIOT Act  which came out of the committee during my tenure as chairman  gave the FBI substantial additional powers  In consideration of that  we reserved additional oversight  And then  notwithstanding that negotiation approved by the President s agents at the Department of Justice  the President issued a signing statement cherry picking and leaving him free to disregard the oversight provision     I think Judge Mukasey should have been unequivocal in condemning that practice and should have said he would advise the President to either sign legislation or veto it but not to cherry pick  He had a very artful answer where he says he will try to avoid this kind of tension and conflict between the executive branch and the Congress     While I don t like that  I don t think it is a sufficient reason to vote against him     Judge Mukasey was forthright on his views as to habeas corpus  He acknowledged that habeas corpus is a constitutional right  unlike his predecessor  who really rejected the plain English of the Constitution  which states that habeas corpus is a constitutional right     Considering all of these factors  it is my judgment  after meeting informally with former Federal Judge Mukasey and participating in the extensive hearings and reviewing answers to many written questions  that Judge Mukasey is well qualified to be Attorney General  I think it unfortunate that there will be many negative votes against him  I think those negative votes will be in the context of this waterboarding issue  where there are very substantial emotional and political considerations involved  and Senators exercise rights to vote as they choose  But I do believe that even those who vote against Judge Mukasey will acknowledge his qualifications  He is well qualified by way of academic and professional background  and he has a very sterling record as a judge  that he is honest  forthright  and talented  He is a lawyer s lawyer or a judge s judge  When you talk to him or question him at a hearing  you get back very sophisticated  erudite answers  analytically displaying a vast knowledge of the Constitution and the cases which have been interpreted  What weighs heavily in my mind on Judge Mukasey is the urgent need of the Department for new leadership     I thank the chairman for having a special markup on Tuesday  It was extra work for the committee  but Senator Leahy called the Judiciary Committee together for an extra markup  He has exercised the leadership to bring this matter to a vote tonight     I thank the distinguished majority leader also for scheduling the vote  because the Department of Justice needs Judge Mukasey at work tomorrow morning  They need to have him sworn in sometime between the vote of confirmation tonight and 8 a m  tomorrow  when people ought to report to work at the Department of Justice  The Department of Justice has been categorized as dysfunctional  in disarray  It is in urgent need of an Attorney General  When that is done  I think we will see some nominations for Deputy  which is vacant  An Associate Attorney General is only an acting deputy  and a number of assistants are only acting     All things considered  I think it is in the national interest that we confirm former Federal Judge Mukasey  I predict he will do a sterling job as Attorney General
