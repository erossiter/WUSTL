    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  June 13  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the Senate floor regarding the subpoenas issued to two former White House officials compelling them to provide testimony and related information  for the Judiciary Committee  s ongoing investigation into the firing of U S attorneys   Three subpoenas were issued  two seeking the documents and testimony of Sara M  Taylor  former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Political Affairs  and another seeking White House documents relevant to the panel  s investigation     Below is a copy of the floor statement    First  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding  I know she yielded to Senator Leahy  and Senator Leahy  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  has made some comments which I think I ought to supplement      I believe when you have the subpoena issued for Ms  Sara Taylor  the White House staff  it is appropriate at this time  A letter was sent to Ms  Taylor on April 11 requesting testimony and documents  and there has been no response      It is my hope  as I have said at Judiciary Committee meetings  executive sessions  that we will yet be able to work this out with Ms  Taylor on a cooperative basis without any further controversy      The enforcement mechanism of the subpoenas is very lengthy  The last time it was undertaken  with the conflict between congressional oversight and the White House  it took more than 2 years  That would take us into 2009  after the election of a new President      I think with respect to the subpoena to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers  there again the request went out some time ago  and they have not been forthcoming  and I think it is appropriate to proceed    again  in a manner which looks toward conciliation  looks toward resolving it without controversy      I talked again today to White House Counsel Fred Fielding on the question as to how we are going to obtain testimony from executive branch officials who are high up in the White House  and the President made a televised statement some time ago setting forth the acceptable parameters from the President s point of view  After reflecting on it and talking to members of the Judiciary Committee    both Democrats and Republicans    I think that most of what the President wants can be accommodated      He does not want his officials  his employees  put under oath  My preference would be to have an oath  but I would not insist on that because the testimony would be subject to prosecution under the False Statements Act  18 United States Code 1001   He does not want to have the sessions public  My preference again would be to have them public  but I would not insist upon that      He does not want to have the officials come before the Senate Judiciary Committee  then before the House Judiciary Committee  and I think we can accommodate that  having members of both committees    both Democrats and Republicans    in a manageable group to obtain the necessary information       The one point where I think it is indispensable is that we obtain a transcript   If you don t have a transcript  people walk out of the room in perfectly good faith and have different versions as to what happened  I think it is in the interest of all sides to have a transcript  It is in the interest of congressional oversight so we have it precise  so we can pursue questions and have them in black and white and know where we stand  It is important for the people whose depositions are being taken that it be written down  too  so nobody can say they said something they didn t say because we know what they said when it is transcribed  I am pleased to say to the distinguished Presiding Officer  the Senator from Rhode Island who is nodding in the affirmative  as a former U S  attorney  attorney general  and one who has had experience with transcripts  as has the chairman and I  it needs to be written down      I hope we can accommodate the competing interests here  There is no doubt there are very important issues involved  The request for resignations from the U S  attorneys and the reasons why they were replaced  There is no doubt the President has the authority to remove all 93 U S  attorneys without giving any reason  President Clinton did that at the beginning of his term in 1993  I think it is equally clear the President can t replace people for bad reasons  There is a suggestion of pressure on the U S  attorney from San Diego that she was going after some of former Congressman Cunningham s associates  who is serving an 8 year sentence  and that pressure was put on some other U S  attorney in some other direction for an improper purpose  and that is an appropriate question for congressional oversight  We had a lengthy and heated debate earlier this week on the resolution to say the Senate has no confidence in the Attorney General  That was defeated on procedural grounds      But the issue of the operation of the Department of Justice is not yet finished  This inquiry is very important  Next to the Department of Defense  which defends the homeland and is our military defense  next in line is the Department of Justice  which deals with terrorism  deals with drugs  deals with violent crime and that department has to function in the interests of the American people  And getting to the bottom of this investigation is important for that purpose  So I wanted to appear to make these brief comments  following the statement by the distinguished Chairman  I thank the Senator from Minnesota      I yield the floor                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Current record
