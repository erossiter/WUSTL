    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  July 17  2007       This man has an impeccable record  an outstanding record  with 985 authored opinions   The two opinions that have been called into question are opinions which he didn t write  but merely joined  on matters which    while they might have been articulated differently  might have been more sensitive    certainly are not disqualifiers   This man ought to be confirmed        Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the Senate floor about the nomination of a Mississippi Appellate Court Judge  Leslie Southwick  to the Federal Court for the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals     Below is a copy of Senator Specter  s floor statement    Mr  President  as stated a moment ago  I have sought recognition to speak about the nomination of a Mississippi appellate court judge  Leslie H  Southwick  to be Federal Court for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals   I have asked for this time because Judge Southwick has been before the Judiciary Committee on several occasions and  because there is not much known about his record  there have been certain objections raised   As I have talked to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle  when they hear about his record  they are surprised that he is not moving through expeditiously   I thought it would be important to take a few moments to acquaint Senators with his record and  beyond that  to acquaint the public with the pending nomination           This Chamber has seen some very contentious moments  going back over the past two decades  of partisanship on judicial nominations  extensive filibusters in 2005  the holding up on judges of both sides  with Republicans held up by a Democratic controlled Senate and Democratic president  and the same thing with the Democratic President  President Clinton  held up by a Republican Senate   I moved and supported President Clinton s nominees when they were qualified  and broke ranks   It has seemed to me that we ought to be looking at the merits of these nominees and not engaging in partisanship to block nominations when courts such as the Fifth Circuit are urgently in need of additional judicial manpower       Judge Southwick has a very outstanding record  which I will detail briefly  and I want to deal with the objections which have been raised to him  which I do not think are substantial    not disqualifiers by any sense   Judge Southwick is 57 years old    a perfect age to come to the court of appeals  considering his background   a cum laude graduate of Rice University in 1972  a law degree from the University of Texas   He served as a law clerk on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals  then he was a law clerk to Judge Charles Clark on the Fifth Circuit   So he has had experience in a clerk s capacity on the court to which he has now been nominated   He practiced law for 12 years  with a distinguished practice first as an associate and then as a partner   He was Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice for 4 years      He is an adjunct professor at the Mississippi School of Law   He has been a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity doing community service   He was the recipient of the Judicial Excellence Award from the Mississippi State Bar and was rated by the American Bar Association as unanimously well qualified     When he was 42 years old  in 1992  he obtained an age waiver in order to join the Army Reserve   Then  in 2002  he volunteered  at the age of 53  to transfer to a line combat unit  and he served on forward operating bases near Najaf in Iraq     Major General Harold Cross characterized Judge Southwick s volunteering for duty in Iraq as follows    This was a courageous move  as it was widely known at the time that the 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for overseas duties in the near future          He is a man with an outstanding background and a courageous man who stepped forward at an advanced age to volunteer for service in Iraq  something that doesn t happen very often   It is a very rare occurrence     On the Mississippi Court of Appeals  Judge Southwick has participated in between 6 000 and 7 000 cases    it is hard to be precise because many of them are unreported   He has written 985 opinions himself in the course of some 12 years     The objections to Judge Southwick have focused on two cases   I wish to discuss very briefly these cases because I think  on their face  they show there is not any reason this man should not be confirmed   I discussed these cases with him   I met with him at length and talked with him about his judicial career and his service in Iraq   He is a mild mannered professional who is a confident man    not flamboyant and not overstated   We talked about legal issues   He is a solid lawyer and has been a solid judge     But the objections to him have focused on two cases   In one  a case captioned Richmond v  Mississippi Department of Human Services  the case involved a State social worker  Ms  Bonnie Richmond  who used  admittedly  an outrageous racial slur   The administrative board reviewing the matter to determine whether she should be dismissed or censured made the determination that she should not be dismissed based on the evidence before it  the racial slur was an isolated comment made outside the target s presence  it was followed by an apology which was accepted  and it did not result in significant disruption of the workplace   Under these circumstances  the review board concluded the dismissal of a public employee was not warranted     Under Mississippi law  the board s ruling could be reversed only if it was arbitrary and capricious   That is the general standard for reversing an administrative decision   The Mississippi Court of Appeals applied that standard  which is deferential to the fact finder  to determine if there was sufficient evidence to support it  and the court decided that there was sufficient evidence     This is a case where Judge Southwick did not write the opinion  only concurred in the opinion   The Mississippi Supreme Court  while finding that the administrative board needed to give more detailed reasons for its conclusions  nonetheless concluded that dismissal was not warranted    agreeing with the appellate court on which Judge Southwick sat     In the hearing before the Judiciary Committee  Judge Southwick was asked about the case  and he said the slur was  always offensive    inherently and highly derogatory   and said there was  no worse word      In the face of his overwhelmingly good record  how can a man be denied confirmation on the basis of that situation     There was another case about which Judge Southwick has been questioned  S B  v  L W   a custody case where the chancellor awarded the father custody of a child instead of the child s bisexual mother     There were numerous factors leading to the award for the father  all of which were considered and weighed in favor of the father    steady job  higher income  owner of a large residence  and roots in the community     The objection came because the majority and concurring opinions    again  not Judge Southwick s opinions  but ones that he joined    made reference to  homosexual lifestyle    But  that is the same phrase used in Mississippi Supreme Court precedent   It is also a phrase which was used by the majority in the Lawrence case  Lawrence v  Texas  and has been used by many people  including President Clinton   So  there is hardly a basis for objecting to that kind of a reference  it seems to me     My record on civil rights and on rights for people regardless of lifestyle is well accepted   I can t see how this man can be pilloried on this basis   Moreover  he wrote an opinion  in a case called Hughey v  State of Mississippi  where he affirmed the trial court s decision to disallowed cross examination as to the victim s sexual preference  saying he recognized the victim was homosexual  but that was not relevant to the defense and that such a line of inquiry would produce undue prejudice     If there is a case where lifestyle is not involved  the trial court would not allow a party to try to smear someone with a reference to his or her being a homosexual   Judge Southwick affirmed it  as anybody would   But it shows his own sensitivity on this matter     There are a couple of comments by some individuals who are very supportive     one a woman named La Verne Edney  a distinguished African American lawyer who is a partner in a prominent Jackson  Mississippi firm   She had some very complimentary things to say about Judge Southwick   He hired her as a clerk at a time when few others would hire a young African American woman   Similarly  a practicing attorney named Patrick Beasley  also African American  wrote about Judge Southwick s sensitivity on racial matters   Because of limited time  I ask unanimous consent their statements be printed in the Record without my going into them   Insert Edney and Beasley letters     I would ask unanimous consent that a fuller text be included  but in conclusion  in the last 3 1 2 minutes I have  I wish to point out what has happened in this matter     Chairman Leahy advised me this nomination would go through the Judiciary Committee on a voice vote   Then  when that effort was made  Senator Feingold objected and any member of the Judiciary Committee has the right to hold over a nominee for 1 week   So  it did not go through on a voice vote  notwithstanding the fact that Senator Leahy  the chairman  said that was his plan     Senator McConnell has advised that the majority leader  Senator Reid  had said the nomination would be confirmed before the Memorial Day recess  which is some time ago now   So  this nomination was on the brink of confirmation  according to the chairman s statement that it would go through committee on a voice vote   He didn t expect someone to raise an objection  and he was powerless to move it on a voice vote once an objection was raised  but that was his expectation and mine     And  as I said  the majority leader told the Republican leader there would be a confirmation before the Memorial Day recess     It is my hope we will not allow partisanship to once again grip this body   This Senate  under Republican control  wouldn t give hearings to President Clinton s nominees and wouldn t bring them up for floor votes   I objected to that  bucking my party  crossing party lines  and voting for Clinton nominees     We had protracted filibusters in 2004 and threats of the Constitutional     or   nuclear        option   I hope we do not go back to that   This body  as we all know  works on unanimous consent   Any Senator can raise an objection to dispensing with a reading of an amendment or a reading of the record  as we saw during the immigration debate  and can tie up this Senate endlessly if someone wants to impede the work of the Senate   It is my hope we will not descend to that     We have very important matters to take up    Iraq  the Department of Defense reauthorization bill  the override of the President s veto on stem cells  and many appropriations bills   This man  Judge Southwick    I have gone through his record in detail   My own record on the Judiciary Committee is one of nonpartisanship   If I have found nominees submitted by Republican Presidents to be objectionable  I have not hesitated to say so   But this man has an impeccable record  an outstanding record  with 985 authored opinions   The two opinions that have been called into question are opinions which he didn t write  but merely joined  on matters which    while they might have been articulated differently  might have been more sensitive    certainly are not disqualifiers   This man ought to be confirmed   I have taken the time to go into some detail on his record because I have told my colleagues about his record and many people have been surprised there is controversy     I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania for sitting overtime and my colleague from Minnesota for her patience    I think she has been patient    and yield the floor
