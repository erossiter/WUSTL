    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  April 19  2005     Senator Arlen Specter  Chairman of the U S  Senate Judiciary Committee  today introduced comprehensive asbestos legislation designed to provide compensation to asbestos victims without litigation   This legislation is the product of months of meetings and mediation with industry stakeholders and will serve as a vehicle to move this important issue through Congress   The legislation is co sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT   Orrin Hatch  R UT   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Mike DeWine  R OH   Max Baucus  D MT   George Voinovich  R OH   and Charles Grassley  R IA      There is a will in the Senate to enact legislation that should put an end to the ongoing rash of bankruptcies  growing monthly   diverting resources from those who are truly sick  endangering jobs and pensions  and creating the worst litigation crisis in the history of the American judicial system     Senator Specter said     The Senate plainly wants a more rational asbestos claims system  and I believe that this legislation offers a realistic prospect of accomplishing that result     This legislation provides substantial assurances of acceptable compensation to asbestos victims and substantial assurances to manufacturers and insurers to resolve  with finality  asbestos claims   For more than two decades  a solution to the asbestos crisis has eluded Congress and the courts   Over 75 companies have gone bankrupt  thousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly diseases    mesothelioma and other such ailments    and are not being compensated      Under this legislation  the federal government would establish a national trust fund that would be privately funded by asbestos defendant companies and insurers  with no liability by the United States Government     The trust fund  administered by the Department of Labor  would be available to claimants who meet the medical criteria for mesothelioma or other asbestos related diseases   The legislation does not provide compensation to individuals who do not have markers from asbestos with a clear line that their cancer was caused by asbestos     The total dollar amount for the fund is set at  140 billion  with significant start up funding   If the fund is unable to pay all claims  victims will also have the option to return to the tort system to seek compensation   If there is a reversion to the tort system  suits may be filed in Federal Court  the state court in which the plaintiff resides or in the state court where the asbestos exposure occurred       Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake  First and foremost  the sick and their families have suffered  But the flawed asbestos litigation system not only hurts the sick and their chance at receiving fair compensation  but also claims other victims  These include employees  retirees and shareholders of affected companies whose jobs  savings and retirement plans are also jeopardized by the tide of asbestos cases  With asbestos litigation affecting so many companies  this also impacts the overall economy  including jobs  pensions  stock prices  tax revenues and insurance costs     Senator Specter concluded   Senator Specter and  Chief Judge Emeritus Edward R  Becker  of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  held 36 meetings on this subject  dating back to August 2003  with representatives of  business  manufacturers  insurance companies  AFL CIO and trial lawyers   These meetings were designed to mediate controversial issues in previous asbestos legislation introduced in the 108th Congress and to build consensus in drafting the proposed legislation introduced today                                                                 Browse by                                                                  Current record
