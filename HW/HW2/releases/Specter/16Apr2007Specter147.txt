    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Bill would ensure Congressional oversight  expand intelligence agency flexibility                      Washington  D C    Monday  April 16  2007     U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Arlen Specter  R Pa  today re introduced legislation reaffirming that the federal government must follow the requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  FISA  when conducting electronic surveillance of American citizens in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes   The Feinstein Specter bill also would prevent delays in intelligence agency anti terrorist surveillance  while ensuring that these activities do not violate the civil liberties guaranteed by the U S  Constitution and federal law     This bill underscores that President Bush    as well as future Presidents    must adhere to the requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when conducting electronic anti terror surveillance     Senator Feinstein said     I believe this bill strikes an important balance    between the national security interests of the United States and the need to protect the civil liberties of American citizens        In this age of terrorism and asymmetric threats  it is vitally important that the President and our intelligence agencies are allowed to protect the United States from attack  It is equally important that the fight against terror not erode Americans   civil liberties  and that intelligence activities must be consistent with the Constitution and federal law      Senator Specter said   Like legislation I pursued last year  this bill ensures that the Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program and will do so in expedited fashion  We cannot allow important constitutional questions about the program to linger unresolved      Senator Specter added    This bill also underscores that orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  such as the orders recently issued for the Terrorist Surveillance Program  must be supported by an individualized finding of probable cause      For more than five years after the Sept  11  2001 terrorist attacks  the National Security Agency collected information on telephone calls to and from American citizens without a court order  as required by FISA  This activity  conducted under the   Terrorist Surveillance Program     also took place without informing  or seeking authorization from  the full membership of the Congressional intelligence committees   Since January  Terrorist Surveillance Program activities have been conducted under FISA Court approval  In addition to stating that FISA is the exclusive means for gathering anti terror intelligence  this bill will require that the Administration brief full Congressional intelligence committees on all surveillance activities   The bill also contains provisions intended to provide intelligence agencies greater flexibility to thwart terrorist attacks  and to speed the FISA process  It will extend to seven days the emergency period during which surveillance may be conducted without a warrant  as recommended by several FISA judges  Current law restricts such activity to 72 hours   Also  it would expand the ability of the Attorney General to designate FBI and NSA officials to initiate emergency surveillance  who must seek a warrant within seven days  And it would allow more leeway for the National Security Agency to collect intelligence from foreign to foreign communications   The bill also would allow for the collection of intelligence without a warrant for up to 30 days after a Congressional authorization to use military force  or after a terrorist attack on the United States     I believe that the goals of gathering anti terrorist intelligence  and protecting the civil liberties of American citizens  are not mutually exclusive     Senator Feinstein said    This legislation provides a framework for this to happen  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will agree  I urge them to support this bill       Following is a summary of the Feinstein Specter bill    The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act  reaffirms Congress  s role in setting parameters for wiretapping  while also providing reasonable new authorities and flexibility to conduct surveillance on terrorists   The bill protects civil liberties while making limited changes to ensure that the President  s warrantless surveillance program    and all other foreign intelligence electronic surveillance programs    can continue to operate and protect our nation under FISA court oversight       Key provisions              Exclusivity  Re states that all electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must follow FISA              Individuality  Clarifies that a FISA Court order applies to a specific foreign power or agent of a foreign power              Additional Time   Extends the   emergency    period during which surveillance can proceed without a warrant from 72 hours to seven days  as some FISA judges have requested              Emergency Delegation   Allows the Attorney General to designate specified FBI and NSA officials to begin emergency surveillance  provided that the Attorney General is notified within 24 hours and approves surveillance within three days  a warrant must be sought within 7 days              Informs Congress   Requires briefings on electronic surveillance conducted for foreign intelligence purposes to the full Congressional intelligence committees              Court review  Requires the Supreme Court to review  on an expedited basis  the constitutionality of the Terrorism Surveillance Program upon the appeal of a lower court decision              Wartime Authority   Expands FISA  s rule allowing wiretaps without warrants for 15 days after a declaration of war by making this a 30 day limit that also applies to a Congressional authorization to use military force or a major terrorist attack on the United States              Additional Resources   Authorizes additional personnel and an improved document handling system at the NSA  FBI  DOJ and the FISA Court to reduce the time it takes to prepare and file a FISA application   Authorizes as many new FISA Court judges as are needed to manage the caseload              Clarification   Updates FISA to clarify that surveillance of communications to and from parties outside the United States does not require a FISA court order               This legislation increases flexibility and provide additional tools and resources to go after terrorists     Senator Feinstein said    However  it does so while preserving the core principles of FISA and protecting the constitutional rights of Americans
