Honorable Michael B  Mukasey   Attorney General   United States Department of Justice   Washington  D C  20510     Dear Attorney General Mukasey     We write on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee to request important information about the reported destruction by the Central Intelligence Agency of videotapes showing interrogations of detainees and about the Department of Justice review of this matter  We were alarmed to learn of the existence of these videotapes only after they were destroyed  and to learn of the destruction of the tapes so long after the fact     This weekend  the Department announced that the National Security Division will conduct a preliminary inquiry in conjunction with the CIAs Office of Inspector General  Notwithstanding this inquiry  we request a complete account of the Justice Departments own knowledge of and involvement with these matters  When and how did Department officials or attorneys first become aware of the existence of videotapes of detainee interrogations  Did Department officials or attorneys ever view the tapes  Did the Department evaluate the legality of the interrogation techniques used in the interrogations that were videotaped  When and how did Department officials or attorneys become aware of any plan to destroy videotapes of interrogations of detainees  Were Department officials or attorneys asked about the advisability or legality of destroying the tapes  Did Department officials or attorneys communicate views on the advisability or legality of destroying the tapes  When and how did Department officials or attorneys become aware that videotapes were destroyed  What communication has the Department had with the White House about the existence  plan to destroy  and destruction of the videotapes  With whom  how  and when were there any communications between the Department and the White House about these matters     We would also like to know whether the Department or others in the Administration advised Members of Congress of the existence of these tapes or of their destruction  We learned yesterday through a Washington Post report that a small group of Congressional leaders was advised of the CIAs secret detention and interrogation program as early as September 2002  Was this group or a similar group informed of the videotaping of interrogations or of the destruction of the videotapes  If so  when did this occur and what was the rationale for not advising the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees     In addition  please describe the review that the National Security Division now intends to conduct  Who will conduct the review  How do they intend to proceed  What is the scope of the review  What specific facts and issues are involved  Senator Biden has suggested that a special counsel be appointed to conduct the investigation  How are you determining whether to proceed by way of a special counsel     Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter     Sincerely      PATRICK LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER    Chairman Ranking Member                                                                     Browse by
