    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  April 27  2006               Today the Senate Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved bipartisan legislation that seeks to promote competition in the oil and gas industries in order to reduce fuel costs   The legislation was approved by voice vote    This legislation would keep fuel prices low by preventing companies from withholding oil and gas in an effort to raise prices   A joint federal and state task force is also created by the legislation to investigate information sharing between oil companies to determine if that practice has encouraged anti competitive pricing     Additionally  the legislation aims to foster competition by requiring the antitrust enforcement agencies  Department of Justice  the Federal Trade Commission  to consider whether future consolidations need closer scrutiny   Furthermore  the legislation permits OPEC members to be sued for conspiring to control output and fix prices for crude oil    The Senate has already passed anti competitive provisions in this bill that stem from the bipartisan NOPEC legislation that the Judiciary Committee has approved several times   Those provisions were added to last year s energy bill that passed the Senate   While these provisions have been passed by the Senate previously  they have never been passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law    The legislation is sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  and Sen  Herb Kohl  D WI    The legislation is co sponsored by Senators  Patrick Leahy  D VT  the Judiciary Committee  s ranking member  Mike DeWine  R OH   Richard Durbin  D Il   and Dianne Feinstein  D CA         With the high fuel prices the American consumer is enduring  it is time for an examination of what oil and gas industry consolidations have done to prices     said Senator Arlen Specter  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee     We have allowed too many companies to merge together and reduce competition   This legislation will help address the excessive concentration of power in the oil industry  as well as ensure the OPEC countries  Saudi Arabia  Venezuela  and others  are subject to our anti trust laws   I urge my Colleagues to give this bill their full support on the Senate floor       News reports are stating that Americans could pay as much as  4 or more per gallon of gas this summer   With prices continuing to skyrocket  increased competition among companies  which this legislation promotes  is needed to ensure that Americans are paying a fair price at the pump                   The Republican controlled Congress should pass this bill immediately instead of waiting until the price at the pump skyrockets any higher   Big oil companies and OPEC have America over a barrel  and we should fight back   said Leahy  who has co sponsored the NOPEC legislation    When President Bush took office  Americans could fill their cars on gasoline that cost  1 45 per gallon  Today  fuel prices have skyrocketed over 100 percent   they have more than doubled   The end is nowhere in sight  unless we do something to help keep costs down      This bill would make it crystal clear that the government can prosecute OPEC nations and hold them accountable for fixing prices and increasing the costs of fuel for American consumers   said Senator Mike DeWine  chairman of the Antitrust and Consumer Rights Subcommittee     I m glad the Committee moved so quickly to consider this legislation  While it is true that the world price of crude oil has substantially increased  the fact that the oil companies can so easily pass along all of these price increases to consumers   and compound their profits along the way   demonstrates that there is a failure of competition in our oil and gas markets  and a failure of antitrust enforcement   Kohl said      What you have today is an oligopoly in the oil and gas industry  and I think it  s disastrous for the American people     Senator Feinstein said     It is time that Congress takes a closer look at the mergers and market consolidation that the federal government has allowed over the last decade   Competition needs to be encouraged   Oil and gas companies must not be allowed to manipulate the market at the expense of consumers       The Committee has held two hearings on February 1  and March 14  2006 to examine this issue and review the draft legislation   At both hearings  the Committee heard significant testimony indicating that companies in the oil and gas industry have the ability to exercise market power
