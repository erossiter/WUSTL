    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  June 6  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee  made the following statement in regards to immigration on the floor of the United States Senate   An excerpt of the floor statement is below   I would like to address something which is more fundamental and very serious  as we have had a statement by the majority leader that if cloture is not invoked tomorrow at 6 o clock  he will take down this bill    I think that would be grossly erroneous  I think that would be very bad procedure  If you compare what was done last year in the 109th Congress with what we have done in this Congress  you would see there was much more consideration in the last Congress than has been afforded this bill at this time    For example  in the 109th Congress  we worked the bill through the committee  We did not work this bill through the committee  That was a leadership decision  I have stated on the Senate floor on several occasions the concern of not having gone through committee  that it was probably a mistake  Well  if this bill is taken down because we haven t made sufficient progress in the eyes of the majority leader  there is no doubt it would be a mistake because had we gone through committee  we would have worked through so many of these issues which we have had to legislate on the floor    In the 109th Congress  the Judiciary Committee  which I chaired  had 6 days of committee markups  They were tough and laborious days  and we dealt with 59 amendments  We returned one Monday after a recess when the majority leader said he would proceed with the substitute bill  and a Monday back after a recess is a very tough day  But on March 27  2006  the committee made a special effort to reconvene  We had a quorum  believe it or not  by 10 o clock in the morning  and we worked through  laboriously  until the evening when we reported out a bill  That is what happened during the markup  6 days of markup in the committee where  as I say  we considered some 59 amendments    Then  when we moved to the floor of the Senate  we had 12 days on the bill  We had 4 days before cloture failed  and then we came back with 8 days more and considered in excess of 50 total votes    some rollcall  some voice votes    in passing the bill out of the U S  Senate    Now  contrast that with what we have had up to the present time  We have been on the bill 8 days  and 3 of those days were Mondays or Fridays pro forma without voting  We have only had 5 days where we have been involved in voting  Even on those days  they have not been as productive as voting days were on the bill in the 109th Congress because we have been in quorum calls  We have been negotiating  We have been trying to work through issues that  had this bill gone through committee  would have been resolved some time ago    So you have a comparison of  really  5 days  plus 3 days of pro forma  8 at the most  contrasted with 12 days before  It is more accurately a comparison of 12 to 5    12 in the last Congress where we legislated and where we passed the bill  Here  where we have voted on only 21 amendments  contrasted with more than 50 we voted on in the last Congress    We have also had a tremendous amount of Senators  time and time of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security  We met for 2 hours on Tuesdays  Wednesdays  and Thursdays  and sometimes on Mondays and Fridays as well  over a 10 week period    It is hard to calculate how many hours were put in by Senators  but I think it goes into the thousands  It is hard to calculate how much time was put in by the two secretaries  but I think that goes into the hundreds  If you talk about staff time  it is incalculable  The staff director  Mike O Neill  worked for about 20 days solid  including weekends  and that was sort of par for the course    So to pull this bill tomorrow at 6 o clock    I think it would be hard to find the right word that is appropriate in strength and not overboard  But I think  outrageous  would be a modest comment  it would be outrageous to pull this bill tomorrow    One of my staffers said this bill has been the result of blood  sweat  and fears    paraphrasing Churchill s blood  sweat  and tears    and maybe more fears than blood and sweat  But we have come a long way  We have already seen a lot of finger pointing on this floor  We seem to be a lot better in the Senate at finger pointing than at legislating  But if this bill is pulled down  then you may even see toe pointing  because 10 fingers won t be sufficient for Republicans blaming Democrats and the majority leader for pulling down the bill  and Democrats blaming Republicans for a lot of dilatory amendments    The majority leader has said these amendments are designed to kill the bill  that the people offering the amendments don t have any intention of voting for the bill  Senators who offer amendments don t have to have intentions of voting for the bill  Senators can offer amendments because they are Senators and because they think their amendments may pass  and because  who knows  they may even think their amendments could improve the bill  I think Senator Cornyn sincerely believes his amendment will improve the bill    I ordinarily keep better track of time  but I am a little wound up and concerned about where all of the work we have done may end up if this bill is pulled and  more importantly  after the work that has been done  where it would leave the immigration mess in the United States  We have 12 million undocumented immigrants  we don t know where they are or what risks they face  We cannot deport them all  We have a porous border  If we don t have comprehensive immigration reform  we are not going to put up all the fencing  the barriers  and stop the additional people  The administration has made commitments  and there will be more about how the funds will be spent  We are not going to go through with employer verification  We are not going to spend the money on foolproof identification so employers can see who is legal and who is not legal  so that we have the basis for imposing tough sanctions  including jail  We are not going to eliminate the magnet to bring more people in  It will be a colossal failure    I think it is safe to say the Senate would be the laughingstock of the country  after all of the hyperbole and publicity and all of the proposals and objections  if we are not able to finish this bill  It doesn t have to be finished this week  There is next week  We are not known for necessarily using the full week  We vote very infrequently on Mondays  almost never on Fridays  The evening session is not really practiced around here  When I came to the Senate with Howard Baker  we used to have a lot of all night sessions  One night in 1982 or 1983    I ask for 4 more minutes    We had a tax bill on the Senate floor  and it was 11 45  Howard Baker  the majority leader  was consulting with the Finance chairman  Senator Dole  There were 63 amendments pending  Senator Baker said we are going to work through the night  He said amendments  like mushrooms  grow overnight  So we worked through the night  There were some amendments taken  some amendments withdrawn  and some voted upon  It is amazing how much shorter the debate is at 3 a m  It is also amazing how many more Senators there are on the floor at 3 a m  There were a lot of people on cots in the cloakroom  but a lot of Senators were on the floor  The insomniacs outnumbered the sleepers by 2 to 1  We had a lot of comments like you heard in Parliament  Someone would be making an argument and there would be cries of  vote  vote   At 3 a m  the cries of  vote  and the lack of decorum carried the day    The point is that a few more days in the Senate will not impede the action of this body  Some of the items that are coming up on the agenda may not merit the kind of time and attention the immigration bill does    The American people are obviously sick and tired of the bickering in the Congress and in the Senate  sick and tired of the kind of finger pointing  and there will be an awful lot of it if we fail to legislate on this matter  The bill may be voted down  I think the bill will pass if we stick with it  Certainly  we ought to carry it through to conclusion    I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding me the extra time    I yield the floor                                                                 Browse by
