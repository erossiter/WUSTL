                                                                         News Room News Releases          Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in Over 20 Years                      Washington D C    Monday  March 5  2007                      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Norm Coleman  R MN  today reintroduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil     Setting America on a course towards energy independence will bolster our security  insulate our economy  and keep our environment livable     said Senator Obama     Now that President Bush agrees it is time to raise fuel economy standards  Congress must act to decrease our gasoline consumption and invest in the alternative fuels of the future           I am pleased to join my colleagues in again cosponsoring legislation that will improve vehicle fuel economy     Senator Specter said     This legislation will help the United States reduce our dependence on foreign oil and act as a responsible environmental steward by reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions      America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  As oil prices have exceeded  70 a barrel in recent years and with total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it  s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 4 percent     roughly one mile per gallon     each year   The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   The Fuel Economy Reform Act reflects the recommended approach of the Energy Security Leadership Council  s 2006 report on how to secure America  s energy future   This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised   In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year   If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028   The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   This Congress provides a window of opportunity to achieve fuel economy reform   President Bush signaled his commitment to lowering oil consumption  in part through fuel economy reform  in this year  s State of the Union Address   In December 2006  the Energy Security Leadership Council noted the Fuel Economy Reform Act as their recommended approach to secure America  s energy future                                                                 Browse by
