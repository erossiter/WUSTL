    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Monday  December 17  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   today spoke on the Senate floor in regards to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  The Senator also addressed Attorney General Mukaseys refusal to accommodate Senator Specter and Senator Leahys request for information regarding the destruction of the CIA tapes    A copy of the Senators floor statement is below     Mr  SPECTER  I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding me the time  and I wish to begin with the comment made by the Senator from Connecticut raising a question about the grant of retroactivity immunity  I believe that had that provision not been in the Senate bill  it would be a great deal easier to deal with  although there are some substantial problems with the bill as such  even in addition to the provision on retroactive immunity     But I support the motion to invoke cloture because I believe it is necessary to deal with the fight against terrorism  and I think the Government has made a case for some expanded powers  although I think we have to weigh them very carefully    to fight terrorism but still protect civil liberties in this country     I have a strong objection to the provision in the bill relating to retroactive immunity  and my objection goes to the point that the administration did not follow the provisions of law in notifying the Intelligence Committees of the House and Senate or the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committees about this program  To come at a later date and seek retroactive immunity I think is inappropriate     I found out about it when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee last year  and I moved to subpoena the records of the telephone company  and then I moved to go into a closed session  While that was in process  Vice President Cheney went to the members of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side  without notifying me    which I thought was inappropriate    and thwarted the efforts I was making to find out what this program was all about     The telephone companies  I do believe  have acted as good citizens  I would not want to see them pay damages because they were responding to a governmental request  So my idea  in order to strike a balance between the Senate bill which grants retroactive immunity and the House bill which leaves it out  would be instead to provide for the Government to be substituted as a party for telephone companies     Toward that end  I have introduced S  2402  which was considered by the Judiciary Committee last week and did not pass  on a vote of 13 to 5  Since that time  I have heard from other Senators that they think it is a good idea  I believe it has to be explored and will be explored because I will offer it as an amendment to this bill as soon as I have an opportunity to do so     What my idea does  essentially  is to substitute the Federal Government as the party defendant for the telephone companies in the cases which have been initiated  The Government would stand in the shoes of the telephone companies  with no more and no less defenses available  For example  governmental immunity would not be available as a defense to the Government because obviously the telephone companies do not have governmental immunity     The telephone companies  I think  or the defendants in these cases are highly unlikely to pay damages  But I believe it is very important that the courts not be foreclosed from making a judicial determination on the issues which are involved  Part of the concern I have is that the Government is now coming forward to try to have retroactive immunity  to absolve them from any potential wrongdoing in the past  I do not know whether there is wrongdoing  but I do not believe that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to act secretly  surreptitiously  not tell the intelligence committees as required by law  not tell the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee  and then come back at a later date and say  Please exonerate us  If we give that kind of a blank check  carte blanche to the executive officials  it would be a terrible  devastating precedent for the future     I believe it is necessary for the judicial actions to run their course  Again  let me say I think it is highly questionable that any of the plaintiffs will succeed  The defense of state secrets has been interposed in the cases against the telephone companies  Similarly  the Government would have that defense if it were substituted in their stead     But the fact is that the Congress has not been successful in conducting oversight of the Federal Government  The terrorist surveillance program was in existence from October of 2001 until December of 2005  before the Congress ever found out about it  Then we didn t find out about it as a result of our oversight activities  we found out about it because it was disclosed in a New York Times story     I remember the morning well  I was managing the PATRIOT Act re authorization  to try the give the U S  Government adequate powers to fight terrorism  Right in the middle of the final day of our consideration  the story broke about the secret terrorist surveillance program  and the comment was made on the floor of the Senate by one Senator that he was prepared to vote for the PATRIOT Act but not after he found out about the terrorist surveillance program     The Federal Government did not notify the Intelligence Committees as required by law until well after the New York Times article  Then they notified the Intelligence Committees only because they felt compelled to do so in order to get General Hayden confirmed     There is a long list of efforts by congressional oversight which have been insufficient  the signing statements in which the President has cherry picked  taking provisions he likes and excluding provisions he doesn t like  Senator McCain and the President personally negotiated the question of interrogation in the Detainee Treatment Act  There was language put in  on a 90 to 9 vote  limiting interrogation practices  Then  when the President signed the bill  he made an exclusion  saying that his constitutional authority under article II would enable him to ignore some of those provisions     Similarly  on the PATRIOT Act re authorization  we negotiated certain oversight  and then the President issued a signing statement again saying there were some items which he would feel free to disregard on the oversight provisions     On habeas corpus and detention  the Congress has been totally ineffective at any oversight  it is only the Supreme Court of the United States in Rasul and in a case now pending  Boumediene  argued recently in the Supreme Court  So the judicial oversight on checks and balances and on separation of powers  I believe  is indispensable     We have within the past few days another instance of executive resistance to congressional oversight  Senator Leahy and I wrote to the Attorney General recently    a week ago today    inquiring about the destruction of the tapes by the CIA  The Attorney General responded last week  on December 14  denying our request for information     I ask unanimous consent to have the Attorney General s letter printed in the Record     It surprised me that the Attorney General would say that in light of his very recent statements made during the confirmation hearings  If confirmed  I will review Department of Justice policies with a goal of ensuring that Congress is able to carry out meaningful oversight     When I talked to Judge Mukasey in advance of the confirmation hearings and gave him a copy of the letter which I had sent to Attorney General Gonzales  Judge Mukasey agreed with the standards established by the Congressional Research Service  saying that these are within the bounds of congressional authority on oversight      A  review of congressional investigations that have implicated DOJ  or DOJ investigations over the past 70 years  from the Palmer Raids and Teapot Dome to Watergate  and through Iran Contra and Rocky Flats  demonstrates that the Department of Justice has consistently been obliged to submit to congressional oversight        Including        testimony of subordinate DOJ employees  such as line attorneys and FBI field agents  was taken        Again     In all instances  investigating committees were provided with documents respecting open or closed cases     So here is another example of congressional oversight being thwarted  so that when you have a challenge to what has been done by the telephone companies here and you have litigation in progress  I believe it to be most inappropriate for the Congress to intercede and grant immunity retroactively     I believe our Federal investigative agencies need very substantial powers in the fight against terrorism  I have discussed the issue with Director of National Intelligence McConnell about granting the Government authority to acquire the cooperation of the telephone companies prospectively  I am waiting for a briefing on the issue  to understand the full import of what it is that the Director of National Intelligence wants  I am open to granting those powers prospectively  but I do not believe  in the context of what has happened here  that it would be advisable to retroactively give these officials a blank check when they kept these matters secret from the oversight committees  and when the Judiciary Committee sought to have subpoenas to find out about it  and we were thwarted in that effort  as disclosed by the exchange of letters between the Vice President and myself  made a part of the record                                                                        Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Current record
