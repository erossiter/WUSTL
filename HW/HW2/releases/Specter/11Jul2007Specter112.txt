    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Legislation To Help Solve the Climate Crisis                      Washington  D C    Wednesday  July 11  2007     Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM  and Arlen Specter  R PA  today introduced bipartisan legislation designed to reduce U S  greenhouse gas emissions while protecting the U S  economy and interacting with key developing countries in their efforts to deal with the challenges of global warming   Original cosponsors include Sens  Tom Harkin  D IA   Ted Stevens  R AK   Lisa Murkowski  R AK  and Daniel Akaka  D HI    The Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007 creates an economy wide mandatory tradable permits system that is modeled after the successful U S  Acid Rain Program   By setting an annual target and allowing firms to buy  sell and trade credits to achieve that target  the program is designed to achieve the most cost effective carbon reductions across the economy   The target and technology incentives are designed to avoid harm to the economy while promoting a gradual but decisive transition to new  lower carbon technologies        There is a great desire in our country to address the global warming crisis     Sen  Bingaman said     I believe our legislation represents a strong and balanced approach  It will dramatically reduce U S  greenhouse gas emissions while also spurring new energy technologies  protecting the American economy and engaging developing nations in their efforts to address climate change   It  s a bipartisan approach that strikes the right balance and would return the U S  to a position of global leadership      Sen  Specter     This legislation provides a deliberative and measured response to climate change   It brings together many interest groups in the fight against global warming  and I believe this is a bill that can be passed       The Low Carbon Economy Act is the product of a lengthy and open process   It reflects revisions of the Bingaman Specter discussion draft on climate change  first circulated in January   That draft was the basis for hearings  analyses and extensive input from a broad range of stakeholders   The environmental targets of the Act are to reduce U S  greenhouse gas emissions  GHG  to 2006 levels by 2020 and 1990 levels by 2030    To limit economic uncertainty and price volatility  the government would allow firms to make a payment at a fixed price in lieu of submitting allowances   This   Technology Accelerator Payment     TAP  price starts at  12 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent in the first year of the program and rises steadily each year thereafter at 5 percent above the rate of inflation   If technology improves rapidly and if additional policies such as fuel efficiency standards and a renewable electricity standard are adopted  the TAP option will never be engaged   Conversely  if technology improves less rapidly than expected and program costs exceed predictions  companies could make a payment into the   Energy Technology Deployment Fund    at the TAP price  to cover a portion or their entire allowance submission requirement   Under the Act  GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas are regulated   upstream       that is  at or close to the point of fuel production   For these fuels  regulated entities are required to submit tradable allowances equal to the carbon content of fuels produced or processed at their facilities   GHG emissions from coal are regulated   downstream    at the point of fuel consumption   Regulated entities that must submit allowances include petroleum refineries  natural gas processing plants  fossil fuel importers  large coal consuming facilities and producers importers of non CO2 GHGs   The proposal sets out a detailed methodology for distributing tradable emission allowances   At the beginning of the program  a majority of allowances are given out for free to the private sector   This amount is gradually reduced each year after the first five years of the program   In addition  8 percent of allowances will be set aside annually to create incentives for carbon capture and storage and jump start these critical technologies   Twenty four percent of total allowances will be auctioned by the government to generate much needed revenue for research  development and deployment of low  and no carbon technologies  to provide for climate change adaptation measures and to provide assistance to low income households   Five percent of allowances are reserved to promote agricultural sequestration  and 1 percent of the allowances will reward companies that have undertaken   early actions    to reduce emissions before program implementation   Another 9 percent of the allowances are to be distributed directly to States  which can use associated revenues at their discretion to address regional impacts  promote technology or energy efficiency and enhance energy security   To effectively engage developing countries  the Low Carbon Economy Act would fund joint research and development partnerships and technology transfer programs similar to the Asia Pacific Partnership   The bill also calls for a Five Year Review Process that requires a reassessment of domestic action in light of efforts by our major U S  trade partners  and relevant scientific and technological developments    If there is sufficient international progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions  the President could recommend changes in the U S  program designed to achieve further reductions that are at least 60 percent below current levels by 2050   If other countries are deemed to be making inadequate efforts  starting in 2020 the President could require importers from such countries to submit special emission allowances  from a separate reserve pool  to cover the carbon content of certain products    Text of the Low Carbon Economy Act and supporting materials are posted in the
