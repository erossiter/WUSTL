request of US Airs CEO  I called the three Secretaries of Treasury  Commerce  and Labor on the financing from the Alabama pension fund to save US Air from bankruptcy  Pittsburgh and PA deserve better treatment    Full text of the letter follows     October 31  2007    Dear Mr  Parker     Thank you for your October 15  2007 letter in response to concerns raised in my October 4  2007 letter  co signed with Senator Casey  regarding US Airways proposed service and employment cuts in Pittsburgh     Based on US Airways treatment of Pittsburgh under your leadership and that of your predecessors  I remain concerned that good faith efforts made on behalf of the company by Federal  state and local officials representing the Pittsburgh region have not always been reciprocated  While I am pleased that Pittsburgh will retain the Operations Control Center and heavy maintenance base  I believe the service and employment cuts proposed for January 2008 are only the latest development in a pattern of unfulfilled commitments and false expectations created by US Airways regarding the airlines presence in the region     For example  on March 30  2003  as US Airways emerged from its first bankruptcy  it rejected its lease agreements with the Allegheny County Airport Authority  I am advised that this action violated a written promise to honor the lease agreements made by US Airways only weeks earlier  Then  in May 2004  Pittsburgh was stripped of its hub status  and with it the service expectations envisioned by the public when the airport was constructed to US Airways specifications for  1 billion     While you had no involvement in these two specific actions  several comments attributed to you in the local media appear  in retrospect  to give the region a false sense of security about the future of US Airways in Pittsburgh  When the merger between US Airways and America West was announced in May 2005  for instance  you were quoted as saying that  We have no intentions of making major changes in Pittsburgh and that you would  work very hard to keep everyone employed thats employed  Then  in December 2005  it is my understanding that US Airways furloughed 30 employees at the Pittsburgh operations center after you stated on November 9  2005 that the company did not intend to furlough any employees  Further  your view of Pittsburgh as an unprofitable market conflicts with comments you made in May 2006 when you referred to Pittsburgh as marginally profitable due to previous cutbacks the airline imposed following the merger  At the time  you are quoted as saying  We feel good about where it is now  with regard to service and did not predict any more dramatic reductions in local flights  While falling short of a commitment  these comments create an expectation of stability that  regrettably  has not been achieved at Pittsburgh during your tenure     While US Airways has been unable to live up to commitments it made to and public expectations it created for Pittsburgh since the airport was constructed  it has all the while received my steadfast support  From 1995 to 2007  I wrote 11 letters to U S  Secretaries of Transportation and one to President Clinton supporting applications by US Airways for international routes  During consideration of the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriations bill  I led the effort to restore loan guarantees available to airlines following the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  On June 27  2002  I along with other members of the Pennsylvania delegation wrote to President Bush supporting Federal approval of US Airways loan guarantee application  When this loan guarantee was conditioned on the airline restructuring its pension obligations  I made every effort within my power to be of assistance  In December 2002  I wrote and placed calls to U S  Secretary of Labor Chao  U S  Secretary of Commerce Evans and U S  Secretary of Treasury ONeill  all of whom are Board Members of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation  PBGC   urging them to accept a proposal from US Airways and its pilots union which would have satisfied the loan guarantee requirements  When the PBGC declared that they did not have the authority to do so  I and several of my Senate colleagues introduced legislation which would have granted the PBGC explicit statutory authority to accept US Airways  proposal and ultimately offered it as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill  While these efforts were not successful  they represented a good faith effort on my part to do everything I could to assist US Airways     In the future  US Airways should grant Pittsburgh similar considerations  Despite a litany of cost saving layoffs and service reductions that has seen US Airways retrench from 542 daily flights and 12 000 employees in 2001 to 68 flights and 1 800 employees after the latest cuts go into effect in January 2008  the airline struggles to operate profitably in Pittsburgh  With that in mind and based on the fact that many other carriers are reportedly performing well in Pittsburgh  I question whether you and your predecessors have done everything in your power to ensure that service at Pittsburgh succeed  and this is a cause of great concern and disappointment given my long standing record of support for the airline at the Federal level     Sincerely
