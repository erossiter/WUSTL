    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  February 15  2007                      In a floor statement today  Senator Arlen Specter  R PA  objected to the Majority Leader  s action to   fill the tree     which  in effect  precludes any members from offering any changes or amendments to the Iraq bill   Senator Specter stated    It is my hope that the majority leader  Senator Reid  and Republican leader  Senator McConnell  before the day is up  will come to terms and will announce some accommodation so that there can be a fair resolution of the debate    so this body does not become irrelevant and we do not present a picture to the American people of gridlock and paralysis  but we show we are still the world s greatest deliberative body because we are about to cede that title to the House of Representatives which as we speak is deliberating  which we are not doing    and that we take up the Iraqi issue and we show the American people and the world we can reach an accommodation  we can debate in accordance with the traditions of the Senate      Last week Senator Specter offered legislation that would amend the Standing Rules of the Senate to ensure full debate of legislation and that all Senators always have the ability to offer amendment       A copy of the floor statement follows   Mr  SPECTER  We have just seen the Senate  for the better part of an hour  with a majority of the Senators on the floor  demonstrate gridlock and paralysis  I have an observation to make    and perhaps it would be an admonition or a warning    that the United States Senate is about to become irrelevant  We have  on the other side of the Rotunda  the House of Representatives taking up the issue of Iraq  which all Members here  with the speeches just made  agree is the most pressing issue facing the country  but the Senate can t address it  And the Senate can t address it because the majority leader has exercised his right under rule XV to fill the tree  which precludes any action by the Republicans  unless we Republicans exercise our right to withhold cloture    Mr  BYRD  Mr  President  will the Senator yield    Mr  SPECTER  I will yield to the Senator from West Virginia for a question    Mr  BYRD  Mr  President  I just want to interpose a point here   I think I heard the Senator make reference to the majority leader having the right to fill the tree  No  he doesn t  He does not  He has the right if no other Senator seeks recognition  But once the majority makes a motion or sends an amendment to the desk  at that second he loses the floor until the Chair states its business  and while he has lost the floor  another Senator can seek recognition   I merely make the point the majority leader does not have  the right   No other Senator has  the right  to fill the tree  If other Senators do not intervene  then of course he will fill it    Mr  SPECTER  And when he makes the amendment in the first degree and then he seeks recognition again  he gets it  an amendment in the second degree  and he does fill the tree  Last week I proposed to change the rule  This rule has been exercised by Senator Dole  Senator Mitchell  Senator Byrd and all the majority leaders in the last two decades  I think it is time we change the rule  We are not going to change the rule now  But I do believe that the Senate is in real danger of becoming irrelevant  I don t think we ought to be dominant over the House of Representatives  but I think we ought to at least be equal    Mr  BYRD  Will the Senator yield    Mr  SPECTER  No  I wish to finish  I think we ought to at least be equal  What we have is that we are close to anarchy  We have been debating the debate all week  The House has rules which we wouldn t want  where the Rules Committee goes off and comes back and limits what the House of Representatives can do  Sometimes that is despotism  and between anarchy and despotism  it is a fairly tough choice  But right now  I am finding it difficult    impossible    to answer my constituents about what the Senate is doing  I tell them the tree is filled  They think I am talking about an orchard  I tell them we are debating whether we are going to have a debate  and they can t understand what we are doing   I counted the Senators on the floor during the exchange between the majority leader and the Republican leader   We had more than 50 Senators here sitting around on the debate for a debate without reaching a resolution  I think Senator McConnell is correct  I do not say that in the partisan sense  if I can attract the attention of the distinguished Republican leader  I think he is correct  But I repeat I do not say it in a partisan sense  There ought to be an accommodation and there ought to be an agreement reached between the leaders  When you have the proposal to have a variety of resolutions  that is the way of the Senate   Senator McCain has been here for 20 years  Senator McConnell has been here for 22 years  I have been here for 26 years  Senator Byrd has been here for    I can t count that high    48 years  going onto 49  This is not the way the Senate ought to work  But it is the way the Senate has worked  with all the majority leaders in the last two decades exercising their right of recognition and filling the tree and tying up the Senate  Now the Senate is finally caught  We are finally caught where America and the world sees what we are doing  It is a little ridiculous to have this kind of gridlock and this kind of paralysis   Mr  SPECTER  Let me yield to the Senator from West Virginia who wanted recognition    for a question    Mr  BYRD  Mr  President  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding  I have this comment  First of all  I wish to congratulate the Senator  He is very observant  He is concerned about the Senate  He understands the rules  But while he understands the rules  we do not need anymore rules  We have rules  Senators need to insist on their rights as Senators and they ought to speak up so they can be heard and they ought to pay attention  We don t need new rules  We have rules that have been here for many years  and they have been tried and tried and tried again  We need to read the rules  Senators should read the rules and Senators should understand that they are Senators and they should be proud of that fact  We should demand that the rules be observed  I could do that  Every Senator can  We don t need new rules  We simply need to understand the rules we have  We need to insist on those rules  and the Chair ought as well to insist that the rules be observed  No Senator needs to seek recognition to have the rules observed    Mr  SPECTER  As a final statement  it is my hope that the majority leader  Senator Reid  and Republican leader  Senator McConnell  before the day is up  will come to terms and will announce some accommodation so that there can be a fair resolution of the debate    so this body does not become irrelevant and we do not present a picture to the American people of gridlock and paralysis  but we show we are still the world s greatest deliberative body because we are about to cede that title to the House of Representatives which as we speak is deliberating  which we are not doing    and that we take up the Iraqi issue and we show the American people and the world we can reach an accommodation  we can debate in accordance with the traditions of the Senate   I ask my colleagues to seriously consider the resolution I introduced to change rule XV  I agree with Senator Byrd  We do not need more rules  but we need a little modification of rule XV
