discuss US Airways at a news conference October 31  2007   After learning that it appears that US Airways will not offer severance packages to the machinists  pilots and the ground workers  Senators Bob Casey  D PA  and Arlen Specter  R PA  today wrote a letter to Douglas Parker  CEO of US Airways  urging him to extend similar offers to all displaced employees in the Pittsburgh region     It is our understanding that US Airways recently sent a letter to affected employees implying that pilots  ground workers and machinists slated to lose their full time jobs in Pittsburgh will not be offered severance packages  the Senators wrote  This decision is apparently due in part to US Airways determination that these workers can receive layoff pay and extended benefits  work in Pittsburgh on a part time basis or take a full time job elsewhere in US Airways system  While flight attendants may not have similar options  and therefore should have the severance option  this fact does not justify your decision against offering a severance option to other employees     Senators Casey and Specter sent a letter earlier this month to Douglas Parker after learning about US Airways plan to cut 40 flights  eliminate 450 local jobs and shift 500 local pilots and flight attendants from the Pittsburgh area as of January 2008  In the letter  Senators Specter and Casey asserted that such cuts would also adversely affect economic growth around the airport and travel to and from smaller rural airports that rely on Pittsburgh International Airport as a connector between their communities and destinations nationwide     Full text of the letter is below     Dear Mr  Parker     Recent press reports have indicated that US Airways has decided to offer severance packages to its East Coast based flight attendants  but not to pilots  ground workers  and machinists who also will be affected by the airlines decision to reduce flights and jobs in Pittsburgh  While the offer to the flight attendants is an appropriate starting point  we are writing to urge you to extend similar offers to all displaced employees in the Pittsburgh region     It is our understanding that US Airways recently sent a letter to affected employees implying that pilots  ground workers and machinists slated to lose their full time jobs in Pittsburgh will not be offered severance packages  This decision is apparently due in part to US Airways determination that these workers can receive layoff pay and extended benefits  work in Pittsburgh on a part time basis or take a full time job elsewhere in US Airways system  While flight attendants may not have similar options  and therefore should have the severance option  this fact does not justify your decision against offering a severance option to other employees  Many of these workers will likely want to remain in the Pittsburgh region and will therefore not be interested in relocating to a new job in the US Airways system outside of the region  They should not be penalized for this decision  The availability of unemployment benefits are not sufficient to appropriately compensate these workers for the hardship associated with this decision  and a part time job in most cases will not be an acceptable option    In light of the difficulties that your decision has presented  we strongly urge you to make appropriate resources and options available to all affected US Airways employees in the Pittsburgh region  The fact of the matter is that your decision will be quite disruptive to the lives of these workers  and we believe that your company should present an offer that will ease any transition necessitated by your announcement     Thank you for your consideration of our views     Sincerely     Bob Casey  U S  Senator and Arlen Specter  U S  Senator                                                                     Browse by                                                                  Current record
