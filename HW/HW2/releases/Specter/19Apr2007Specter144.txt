    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  April 19  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  made the following closing statement at the   Department of Justice Oversight    hearing today    Senator Specter  s statement follows       Mr  Attorney General  we begin with the recognition of the long  arduous route you ve taken  with great difficulty and accomplishment  As I said at the start  Harvard law and the state supreme court in Texas and White House counsel and attorney general of the United States        And I think you have been as forthcoming as you could be in your testimony today  But the issue of credibility  I think your credibility has been significantly impaired because of the panorama of responses you have made  where you denied being involved in  quote   discussions   and then your three key assistants contradicted you on that  where you then shifted to not having been involved in deliberations  And I went over with you the long list        You did touch the issues as to U S  Attorney Lam in San Diego and what would happen to U S  Attorney Iglesias in New Mexico and what would happen to U S  Attorney Cummins in Arkansas  And then your denial of knowing about memoranda  and you were at meetings where documents  memoranda  were distributed        So I think inevitably there is a loss of credibility just necessarily        You and I talked informally during the luncheon break  and you elaborated upon one of your answers where you said that when you were questioning U S  Attorney Lam s record to stay that it was different from what you had asked Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson to investigate and  in my view  there s absolutely no difference  Those are the same thing  And when you look at Ms  Lam s performance  you were involved in the deliberation  the judgment as to what would happen to her        Now  that was difficult for me to understand how you could try to make that distinction  But I know you re doing that in good faith  But the net result is  I think  necessarily a loss of credibility  And I say that to you candidly and in a friendly way        When you come to the issue of the request of all these U S  attorneys to resign  I agree with the conclusions that it doesn t do any good to ask any more questions  because I think we ve gone about as far as we can go with multiple rounds of questions today  And you have been a forceful witness  and you have had a lot of staying power        But we haven t gotten really answers  And I think it s going to take a detailed analysis  I urged you to put on the record the details as to all the U S  attorneys you asked to resign so that we could evaluate  And you have not done that  You have not done that  And I still think it would be useful if you did that as to your personal views        But perhaps it ll be the inspector general  or perhaps it ll be the Office of Professional Responsibility  or maybe they re not the right ones to do it  Or our investigation will go forward  And we ve talked to a lot of people  questioned a lot of people under oath  And we ll continue to do that to try to get the answer        When it comes to the question as to impact on the department  Mr  Attorney General  it seems to be inevitable that there has been a morale problem with this  some of the questions has disclosed  There would be an implicit message  if not an explicit message  even an unintended message that U S  attorneys ought to be on guard for their independence        And I handled the prosecutor s job and know the importance of not being concerned about any collateral influence beyond the law and the facts  And I think that has to have had an impact on the department        And for you to have said it s an overblown personnel matter  I think that can t be erased  And the clouds over a lot of these professionals can t be erased  And the worry by those who haven t been subjected to those clouds can t be erased       Now  I m not going to call for your resignation  I m not going to make a recommendation on that        I think there are two people who have to decide that question  You have to decide it in the first instance  And if you decide to stay on  then it s up to the president to decide  He is the appointing power        And I ve signified the concerns that I have and the impact that I think it has on the department  But I think it s beyond the purview of a senator        I mean  senators can do whatever they like  And I m not questioning anybody who wants to do it differently  But for myself  I want to leave it to you and the president        Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                    Current record
