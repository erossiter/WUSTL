League Commissioner Roger Goodell regarding the NFL Network  The letter questions the Leagues justification for restricting the distribution of game programming  The Senators urge the Commissioner to take prompt action to make games more broadly available than solely on the NFL Network     The NFL appears to be moving incrementally closer to limiting distribution of its programming to subscription

    December 19  2007    Mr  Roger Goodell   Commissioner   National Football League    Dear Commissioner Goodell     We write today to express concern that the National Football League is exercising its substantial market power to the detriment of consumers  Specifically  we are concerned that the NFL member teams are using the NFL Network  to restrict the output of game programming  In an effort to obtain carriage of the NFL Network by all cable and satellite providers as part of their basic programming package  the NFL will air eight late season games exclusively on the NFL Network  Forcing providers to carry the NFL Network as part of their basic programming packages would mean that all their customers  even ones not interested in the programming  would have to pay for it     The NFL has reportedly sought to increase the pressure on satellite and cable providers by demanding that local broadcast network affiliates ensure that their distribution of these games is limited to narrowly defined local markets  This will mean that consumers in our home states will not have the choice of seeing these late season games  Residents of Vermont will not be able to see what may be an historic contest between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants  Likewise  residents of Erie  Crawford  Warren  Mercer  Somerset  Bedford  Cambria  Blair  Clearfield  Jefferson  Elk  Cameron  Centre  Huntingdon  Mifflin  Juniata  Fulton  Clinton  McKean  Potter  and Franklin counties in Pennsylvania will not be able to see the important match up between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the St  Louis Rams     This decision to limit the output of professional football game programming appears designed to sustain and strengthen the market power of the NFL and its member teams  In accordance with the decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Shaw v  Dallas Cowboys  172 F 3d 299  3d Cir  1999   the sale of broadcast rights to satellite and cable providers is not covered by the NFLs antitrust immunity  As you know  we have previously expressed concern about the NFL member teams restricting the output of game programming  Almost exactly a year ago  we held a hearing focused on the NFL Network as well as the efforts of the NFL to restrict output through its exclusive sale of the Sunday Ticket  At that hearing  Stanford University Professor Roger Noll  one of the Nation s foremost experts in sports economics and regulatory policy  characterized the NFL Network as a profit enhancing reduction in output in the sense that the game that is on NFL Network  the eight games  will be available to fewer people than had those games been offered on broadcast television     The NFL appears to be moving incrementally closer to limiting distribution of its programming to subscription television  Businesses are generally free to set their own prices and to decide with whom to deal  but unlike most other businesses  the NFL and its member teams have long been beneficiaries of exemptions from some aspects of federal antitrust law relating to broadcast rights to their games  These exemptions may have made sense at one time  when leagues were far less commercialized and were committed to making their television rights available for free  over the air broadcast  Now that the NFL is adopting strategies to limit distribution of game programming to their own networks  Congress may need to reexamine the need and desirability of their continued exemption from the Nations antitrust laws     We ask that you take prompt action to make games like the Patriots Giants and Steelers Rams games more broadly available than just on the NFL Channel  We also ask you to provide us with a justification for the decision by the NFL and its member teams to restrict distribution of game programming in light of the fact that such conduct is not immune from the antitrust laws     Sincerely     Arlen Specter Patrick Leahy
