    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  March 16  2005                      Washington  D C    U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R PA  made the following statement today regarding his vote on oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge               Mr  SPECTER   Mr  President  I have sought recognition to outline my reasoning for my vote today against the Cantwell amendment to remove the assumption of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  oil and gas exploration lease revenues from the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution                  I have looked at this issue very closely   I have read a great deal of information  met with many concerned groups  and listened to arguments on both sides   And I have come to my own conclusions                  First  I believe exploration will have a minimal impact on the environment   The plans include drilling on a footprint the size of the Philadelphia Airport   It can be done safely by limiting the acreage eligible for exploration  combined with today  s technology to mitigate environmental impacts of exploration in the area   Such technological advances include  the extended reach of multi directional drilling  which can decrease   footprints     reduce waste  and increase the amount of product recovered  high resolution imaging that produces more precise well locations and consequently reduces the number of wells needed to access reserves  and the use of ice roads and winter season drilling techniques to maximize the season and reduce the amount of time to bring the reserves to market  while recognizing the needs of wildlife                  While there could be a network of pipelines  I have visited ANWR and looked at it personally   I saw caribou near the existing pipeline near ANWR   The environment in Alaska can be protected consistent with our laws and values                  Second  ANWR exploration can be part of our overall effort at oil independence   We should be doing a lot more and I have led the fight on conservation measures   While debating energy policy during the 107th and 108th Congresses  I supported significant increases in renewable energy  generated from wind  the sun  biomass  water and geothermal sources   I have also supported expanding tax credits for clean coal technologies and I led efforts to mandate a reduction of U S  oil consumption by one million barrels per day by 2013                             It is only through concerted efforts to reduce projected U S  oil consumption and to utilize domestic energy resources that our nation will be able to become energy independent   If we do not take the steps I have outlined  our dependence on OPEC will grow   While fighting for these energy policies  I have pressed for the U S  to sue OPEC under antitrust laws   I have urged the current and former Administrations to take OPEC to the U S  federal courts for conspiracy to limit oil production and raise prices   This cartel has manipulated the oil markets in violation of U S  and international law and it should be pursued                 We must take action to address the rising costs of home heating oil  diesel fuel  gas at the pump  and our long range national security needs   I feel that ANWR oil and natural gas reserves can and should play a role in this effort   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that any such action only proceed in the most environmentally safe manner                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                    Current record
