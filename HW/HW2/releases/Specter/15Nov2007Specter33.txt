    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  November 15  2007                       During the Senate Judiciary Committee s consideration of the legislation  Ranking Member Arlen Specter spoke on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act     Title I  as amended  was referred to the full Senate by a roll call vote of 10 9 as a substitute for the Intelligence Committees bill    A copy of Senator Specters opening statement at the mark up is pasted below     Senator Specter  With respect to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act there are amendments to be added  as you articulated  to Title I  And just a comment or two about my proposed amendment on substituting the government for the telephone companies  This is a very complex issue  and I was discussing it earlier with Senator Feinstein who raised the possibility of not voting on it today  but to have further opportunity to study it  I would concur with that  It does raise some very important questions  and I begin on my analysis by acknowledging the good citizenship of the telephone companies for whatever it is that they have done  We still dont know all of what that is  But I do not believe that it is appropriate  on the facts of this matter  to grant what is called retroactive immunity because of what has occurred here       The grave difficulty with this issue and related issues is the secrecy of the administration on what they have done on gathering foreign intelligence  And I believe that it is a matter which should have been subjected to some Congressional oversight or some Congressional coordination  And as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  in the midst of preparing the PATRIOT Act in December of 2005  I was surprised by the revelations in the New York Times about the program which was underway  And theres never been a showing by the government of any real effort to keep Congress informed or in the so called loop  And that could have been done in a variety of ways       For one thing  the statute requires informing the Intelligence Committee  I believe it indispensable to inform the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Ranking Member  And had we been informed as to what was happening  there could have been some informal approval  some informal imprimatur of the Congress  And if I were to be told at any stage that ranking officials in the Congress had been told  and had acquiesced however informally  I would be influenced by that in terms of what I would think appropriate to do now  But it was all secret and the administration resisted tenaciously at bringing the program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  It didnt notify the House or Senate Intelligence Committees of much of anything until they had the nomination of General Hayden to be head of the CIA  and then finally   like pulling bicuspids   found out what was going on       There are very serious questions about invasion of privacy  I have supported the administration on the expansion of powers und the PATRIOT Act and have supported them on what they are doing to protect America  and realize full well the importance of the Presidents power in Commander in Chief in fighting terrorism  But there are important constitutional restraints on separation of power  Its fundamental  And we have yet to really hold the government accountable as to what was done and we still do not know all of what was done       Now  recognizing the telephone companies as good citizens  Im prepared to see their involvement held to the minimum  They talked about being involved in litigation  well  I dont know if theres much for them to be involved in  on litigation  Talk about discovery  I dont know that theres much discovery here  Talk about being witnesses  I dont know that theyre going to be witnesses  We cant judge that now  But with the potential defenses of the state secret defense and with the variety of defenses available  they may not be involved much at all  To the extent they are involved  I think it is regrettable but inevitable       They talk about their concerns with foreign governments  well  for whatever problems they had with foreign governments and whatever it was that was done they had  A substitution is not going to aggravate that       I do not know what is going to happen on litigation  I believe there are very important privacy issues here which ought to be subjected to judicial review  The issue implicates the state secrecy defense  The courts have been fuzzy on their application of state secrecy  As I read the precedence  I believe that there is a balancing test  We know that important litigation in the federal court in San Francisco  the judge has declined to dismiss a challenge to the terrorist surveillance program on state secrets  He hasnt ruled on it  he says its premature  Im working on an amendment to this bill on state secrets which I will defer until we have dealt with the issue of substitution       Senator Kennedy has circulated some ideas which appear to be very promising  and I believe that this committee ought to deal with that issue  We ought to make an inquiry as to where the courts stand on state secrecy and perhaps hold hearings and have a congressional imprimatur on that subject       I wish that we had known more about these programs a long time ago  so that I would feel   I might feel differently about it  The committee more than a year tried to get into the issue of what the telephone companies were doing with subpoenas and the Vice President intervened  taking it up with members of this committee without ever discussing it with me in my capacity as Chairman       I dont think Congress can stand by  and in the face of what has happened  carte blanche  give a free ticket  grant retroactive immunity to suggest to future administrations that they can ignore separation of powers and they can ignore Congressional oversight and just run roughshod over the entire process without being held accountable  Then all just be vindicated  But that has to take course of judicial proceedings which will  with the courts  will make their own determinations       Thank you Mr  Chairman                                                                   Browse by
