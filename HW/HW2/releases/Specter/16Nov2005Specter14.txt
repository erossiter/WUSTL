    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  November 16  2005     Senator Arlen Specter  Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  made the following comments today on the LHHS Appropriations bill     I write to explain the background and reasons for the exclusion of earmarks in this year  s Appropriation Bill for Labor  Health and Human Services and Education     The allocation for the Subcommittee was cut by 1  which amounted to  1 4 billion   When inflation is factored in  the real reduction was approximately  5 billion     Had the  1 billion been spent on earmarks  we would have sustained intolerable cuts in programs such as LIHEAP  CDC  community health centers  community services block grant  health professionals including nursing and Head Start   With inflation considered  program cuts will occur in these and other programs such as NIH  Title I and special education even without the earmarks     I sought to avoid cutting earmarks by pressing the House to agree to a  2 1 billion emergency designation for LIHEAP   We all know that is truly an emergency because of the increased heating costs occasioned by Hurricane Katrina   I thought with the alternative of such an emergency declaration for such a worthy cause  instead of cutting popular earmarks  the House would agree   Notwithstanding my persistent efforts with the House leadership  they refused to budge     The removal of the earmarks has focused the attention of the members of both bodies about the blatant inadequacy of the allocation for this Subcommittee which funds the major capital assets for our nation for health  education and worker training   I believe this move is realistically calculated to have an impact on our next year  s allocation     In essence  when looking at programs like LIHEAP where so many elderly and poverty level families will have the alternatives of either   heating or eating    and the cuts in other key programs  that it would be inappropriate  really unconscionable  to keep the earmarks this year    I know that a great many people are disappointed and that a great many important projects will have to be deferred for a year   Among many tough choices in this job  this is the toughest one I have made in my tenure in the Senate                                                                    Browse by                                                                                                                     Current record
