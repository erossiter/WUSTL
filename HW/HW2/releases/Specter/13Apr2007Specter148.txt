    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Joint Interagency Base Will be Under State Jurisdiction                      Harrisburg   Friday  April 13  2007     Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Robert Casey  and Governor Edward G  Rendell today announced that the U S  Air Force has agreed in principle to support Governor Rendell  s plan to establish a joint interagency base at Willow Grove under the state  s control     This is a significant and historic development for Willow Grove and for the commonwealth     Governor Rendell said    I am delighted that the Air Force has agreed to partner with Pennsylvania to save the core capabilities of the Willow Grove installation  and I want to thank the Air Force for its support of this effort     With its key strategic location  excellent airfield  and existing facilities  it was vitally important that Willow Grove be maintained to support national defense  homeland security  emergency preparedness and other government missions        The installation will be leased to the state and eventually transferred to state ownership  It will continue to support military operations  including flight operations  for the Pennsylvania National Guard  Army Reserve and other units  as well as additional government agencies     The idea of abandoning the airfield at Willow Grove made no sense to me or to members of our Congressional delegation  The continued operation of the airfield at Willow Grove means that this installation will remain an asset for the safety and security of Pennsylvania  s people and the entire region     Governor Rendell added     In particular  I must thank Congressman John Murtha for his efforts to make this plan a reality   Coupled with the outstanding support of Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz and senators Arlen Specter and Robert Casey  we worked together to reach this important milestone     Rendell noted   The effort to earn Air Force support for this project was spearheaded by U S  Representative John Murtha of Johnstown  who represents Pennsylvania  s 12th Congressional District      After speaking with Governor Rendell and Adjutant General Jessica Wright  I became convinced of the need to maintain the existing Willow Grove property as a hub for our defense and homeland security needs     Murtha said    I  m pleased that we were able to bring about a positive outcome for the commonwealth and the Air National Guard      U S  Representative Allyson Schwartz  whose 13th Congressional District includes the Willow Grove installation  praised the decision of the Air Force and the efforts of the Governor and Congressional delegation      This plan means that Willow Grove will continue to support our national defense and homeland security needs well into the future     Schwartz said    The Air Force decision to support Pennsylvania  s plan recognizes the importance of maintaining these capabilities   I have long supported the effort to maintain the military functions at Willow Grove and this is a major step in that direction       Senators Specter and Casey recently wrote jointly to Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne to endorse the concept of maintaining essential military capabilities at Willow Grove     I am pleased by Secretary Wynne  s prompt and positive response to the letter that Senator Casey and I sent last month     Specter said    Willow Grove represents a key strategic location in proximity to Philadelphia  Washington  D C   and New York  and I have always believed that we should consider all that Willow Grove has to offer as a national and homeland security asset prior to abandoning it as a resource        I want to thank Secretary Wynne  Governor Rendell  and the Congressional delegation  in particular Congressman Murtha  for their lengthy work on this issue     Casey said    Maintaining operations at Willow Grove will provide a great security and economic benefit for the region and the entire commonwealth     Current plans are that the Navy will leave Willow Grove in 2011  Under the Pennsylvania plan that has earned support from the Air Force  the Navy will transfer the installation to the Air Force for continued military purposes and the Air Force will in turn lease it to the state       The Willow Grove of the future will function in much the same way as Fort Indiantown Gap as an installation under state jurisdiction with operations by federal government agencies and National Guard and reserve military units     Governor Rendell concluded
