    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Philadelphia  PA   Sunday  September 9  2007     Philadelphia  PA   Senator Arlen Specter  ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  appeared on CNN s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday  September 9  2007  Joined by Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   Senator Specter discussed the situation in Iraq  An excerpt of the conversation follows  WOLF BLITZER  To preview what should be a key week in the course of this conflict from the U S  perspective  Two guests  Joining us from Philadelphia  the Republican Senator Arlen Specter  the ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee  And with us here in Washington is Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California  She s a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee     Senators  thanks very much for coming in  Senator Specter  I ll start with you  All eyes now on General Petraeus and his testimony tomorrow before the Congress on what to do next in Iraq  But a lot of people are saying that this guy s been proven wrong before  including almost exactly three years ago  just before the U S  presidential elections  when he wrote an op ed in The Washington Post saying this     I ll read you a couple sentences why he says at that time there were reasons for optimism  I see tangible progress  Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the ground up  The institutions that oversee them are being re established from the top down  And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward  leading their country and their security forces courageously in the face of an enemy that has shown a willingness to do anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq     Senator Specter  that was widely optimistic at that time  Three years later  you could say the same thing now  and he s presumably going to say something similar right now  Do you think this general has the credibility to convince you and other members of the Senate that they know what they re doing    SEN  ARLEN SPECTER  R   PENNSYLVANIA  Well  notwithstanding the fact that he may have been wrong in the past  General Petraeus has a very strong reputation and I think he does have credibility  But Wolf  we re going to look behind the generalizations that General Petraeus or anybody gives us and probe the very hard facts to see exactly what the situation is     As I ve said in the past  unless we see some light at the end of the tunnel here  very closely examining what General Petraeus and others have to say  I think there s a general sense that there needs to be a new policy  General Petraeus himself in the last couple of days has said that he s prepared to see the withdrawal of some troops  talked about a brigade  so let s see specifically what develops     BLITZER  Well  there s conflicting reports on that  Senator  Some suggesting that he s not even ready for a brigade of about 4 000 U S  forces to start withdrawing by the end of this year  We ll see what he testifies tomorrow  But let me ask Senator Boxer  do you have confidence in General Petraeus     SEN  BARBARA BOXER  D   CALIFORNIA  Well  I will have the chance to question him on Tuesday in front of the Foreign Relations Committee  My chairman  Joe Biden  has just gotten back from Iraq  as you know  and I think we ll know then  It s too soon to know  I don t know what he s going to say     But let me tell you what I do know  Wolf  I do know what has happened since the surge  There has been no political reconciliation  We have had the deadliest three months  the deadliest summer ever in the war in Iraq in terms of the loss of our troops  We have 78 percent of the Iraqi people saying  please leave the country     The Brits have withdrawn  We ve had other reports saying the surge hasn t worked  So I intend to question General Petraeus about it  But the last point I d make is  General Petraeus is really the messenger  The policy comes from President Bush     BLITZER  Well  President Bush       BOXER  And that s where I m going to keep the focus     BLITZER  President Bush was very firm in reacting to the new Osama bin Laden videotape in drawing consequences for the United States s stance in Iraq  Listen to what he said      BEGIN VIDEO CLIP     BUSH  If Al Qaida bothers to mention Iraq  it s because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq  which is to drive us out and to develop a safe haven      END VIDEO CLIP     BLITZER  All right  Those are enormous ramifications for the United States if the president s right     BOXER  This president amazes me  Every time I see that fugitive terrorist on television taunting America  I think of how wrong this president was in turning away from going after that murderer who murdered our citizens  and moving into Iraq and not having any way of getting us out  while this guy keeps dyeing his beard apparently and making new tapes     It s an outrage  and we need to finish our work in Iraq    we must do that now    redeploy our troops out of there and focus on getting Osama bin Laden and focus on the war on terror     BLITZER  Realistically  Senator Specter  how much time does the Bush administration have  do you think  to come up with a strategy that will generate the kind of bipartisan support everyone is looking for    SPECTER  Well  Wolf  I think that this month is critical  and the next few days are very  very critical  And then I think you ll see on the floor of the Senate a very  very vigorous debate to see if we can come to a consensus     You have to have 60 votes  But when we took up the issue in July  we only took up one of the resolutions  the Warner resolution  We really need to take up    rather we took only up the Levin resolution  We need to take up the resolution by Warner Lugar and the resolution by Salazar Alexander  And I think that this month is going to be very critical when you look at how much time the president has     BLITZER  But are you going to go along  Senator Boxer  the Democrats  with additional funding  for example  There s reports the president might be seeking an additional  50 billion to continue to fund the war  fund the U S  troops in Iraq  Will you try to kill that funding using all the means  the legislative techniques you have in the Senate     BOXER  Well  I personally believe there s a time in which you say  Mr  President  I ll give you the funding  but not to continue what you re doing  So I will  in fact  try to change the mission  But I think Arlen has said something       BLITZER  But will you filibuster that  50 billion request  assuming it comes in     BOXER  Well  I don t think it s necessary to do that  because I think we need to get back to what Arlen Specter has put out there  And I agree with him completely  I think that Senator Reid  who is  as you know  our leader in the Senate  Democratic leader and the leader of the Senate  is going to put a range of options on the table     Arlen is right  we need to get to 60 votes  We had about 53 or 54 for a time deadline to get out  We had a majority of the United States Senate  But we think       BLITZER  But if you get to those 60 votes  it would be a symbolic message to the president  as opposed to binding legislation  forcing a specific timeline for a withdrawal     BOXER  But we to have to get to 67 because he s going to veto anything that comes to his desk     BLITZER  Do you see any prospects you can get to a two thirds override of a presidential veto     BOXER  Wolf  today I doubt it because we can only get a few independent thinking Republicans like Arlen Specter to break with the president  But you know what  The American public is clear  They are tired of this war  They want to see us bring our troops home  And I believe in democracy  so I can t tell you we have 67 votes  Maybe we might for some kind of alternative that s going to come before us  But the fact is  we keep on pushing  we keep on trying and we make it a political issue in the Senate races  You know  the Republicans have 22 seats up  and if we have to go and make the Iraq war an issue again  we ll do that until we get the votes necessary to end this war     BLITZER  You think realistically  Senator Specter  there s any prospect whatsoever that following this week of General Petraeus s testimony  Ambassador Ryan Crocker s testimony  some new consensus might emerge that will allow this process to go forward in a less partisan way     SPECTER  Well  we re going to try very hard to do that  Let me just correct something Senator Boxer said  I haven t broken with the president  but I have an open mind     BOXER  Good    SPECTER  I want to know exactly what the facts are and there are quite a few of us who are in the center  who are deliberating this matter  who do believe that some new policy is necessary     And  Wolf  you say there have been conflicting reports  but I was encouraged by the report that General Petraeus is willing to have some call down  at least a brigade  The negotiations have to go forward between the Congress and the president and within the Congress  within the Senate  but we have to work at trying to find a consensus  something we can agree to     BLITZER  Well  when I say conflicting reports  The New York Times and The Washington Post  as you know  did suggest that perhaps    perhaps    General Petraeus was ready to see a symbolic withdrawal by the end of this year or early next year of one brigade  4 000 U S  troops  from the 168 000 who are there     But other sources close to General Petraeus then told our senior Pentagon correspondent  Jamie McIntyre  he was going to recommend no U S  troops are withdrawn until the spring of next year at the earliest  otherwise that could undermine the overall mission  All right  we re going to pick up      SPECTER  Well  Wolf       BLITZER  Yes  go ahead  Senator    SPECTER      that s why it s important to hear from him     BLITZER  Obviously  We ll hear from the horse s mouth tomorrow    SPECTER  We re not going to make our generalizations about what appears in the newspapers  We might on CNN  but we re going to take a close look at exactly what the facts are to see if we can figure out a consensus policy                                                                   Browse by
