    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C     Wednesday  July 25  2007     We ought to look at the record and make the decision in fairness to this man and in fairness to the entire process of confirmation of Federal judges   Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the floor of the Senate on the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the Federal Court for the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals   Below is a copy of Senator Specters floor statement   Mr  SPECTER  I have sought recognition to reply to a floor statement made earlier today by the senior Senator from Illinois concerning the pending nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals    The Senator from Illinois asserted that there are too many questions about whether Judge Southwick would bring a measure of fairness in cases involving civil rights and the rights of ordinary people in his court  But in the course of the speech of the Senator from Illinois  he only raised one question   That one question was about a specific case   The Senator from Illinois went on to say  This perception as to whether he will be fair or evenhanded is determinative in my mind  Whether you agree with that perception  it is there   I begin by disagreeing categorically with the Senator from Illinois that it is a matter of perception  It is a matter of fact  When he says this perception as to whether he will be fair or evenhanded is determinative  I disagree strongly  What is determinative is what are the facts of his record taken in totality   The one question which the Senator from Illinois has raised involves a case where the Mississippi intermediate appellate court upheld a finding by an administrative board that an employee should not be fired under the circumstances which I will now describe   The employee had made a racial statement which was a one time comment  The slur was not in the presence of the targeted coworker  The employee apologized to the coworker  The coworker accepted the apology  The incident did not produce any significant workplace disruption   The administrative board then made the determination that the incident did not warrant dismissal of the employee  The question then presented to the court on which Judge Southwick sat  the intermediate appellate court  was whether the finding by the administrative board was arbitrary and capricious  that is  whether there was sufficient evidence for them to find to that effect   When Judge Southwick testified before the Judiciary Committee  he was emphatic in his statement that the slur was unacceptable  that he did not agree with that kind of conduct  and that it was the worst kind of word to use   the so called N word   but that his role as an appellate judge was to make a legal determination on whether there was sufficient evidence to uphold the decision or whether the administrative board was arbitrary and capricious   The Senator from Illinois then said that the Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously reversed the majority opinion  But  the fact is    and this is implicitly acknowledged by the Senator from Illinois     that the only reversal was on the very narrow ground of whether there had been sufficient findings by the administrative board to come to its conclusion   The Mississippi Supreme Court agreed with the Mississippi intermediate appellate court that dismissal was an inappropriate remedy  That was really the core of the case  But the State Supreme Court said there ought to be more facts stated by the administrative board in coming to that conclusion  which was a highly technical modification as to what the appellate court had said   The Senator from Illinois further made a very brief reference  a one sentence reference  in his speech  to a custody case in which he voted to take an 8 year old girl away from her lesbian mother  I disagree with Judge Southwick s position in these cases  That is the only thing he had to say about the custody case which has been cited against Judge Southwick   Here again  as in the case involving the racial slur  Judge Southwick did not write the opinion  He concurred in the opinion  I think fairly stated as a legal matter  when someone writes the opinion  there is full responsibility for everything in it  In a sense  one might say the same thing about someone who concurs  That person could write a separate concurring opinion  But unless there is something extraordinarily wrong  out of line  that is not a common practice   In the second case to which the Senator from Illinois referred   only one sentence   there were many factors which led to the award of custody to the father  such as he had a steady job  he had a higher income  he owned a large residence  and he had roots in the community  Although the Senator from Illinois did not refer to one sentence in the opinion    again  which Judge Southwick did not write but concurred in    there was a reference to a homosexual lifestyle which has been used frequently  including the Lawrence v  Texas decision  It is perhaps not the most sensitive kind of language  and perhaps there could have been a substitution for it  but it certainly does not rise to the level of a disqualifier   The Senator from Illinois has said that Judge Southwick could not be fair to run of the mill litigants in the courts and cited a couple of studies  which are not identified  which do not specify any authors  and on their face  in the statement by the Senator from Illinois  I think fairly stated should be entitled to really very little  if any  weight  But let s take a look at some of the specific cases that Judge Southwick has decided   In a case captioned McCarty Farms Inc  v  Caprice Banks  Judge Southwick affirmed an award of permanent partial disability benefits for a woman who experienced a 70 percent industrial disability to her right arm and a 30 percent loss to her left  However  Judge Southwick wrote separately to argue that injured workers deserve more evidentiary options to prove damages   He would have instructed the court to consider wage earning capacity as well as functional or medical impairment   In the case captioned Sherwin Williams v  Brown  Judge Southwick held a 45 year old carpet layer was permanently and totally industrially disabled due to an onsite injury and that the carpet layer made reasonable efforts to obtain other employment  Judge Southwick concluded he was entitled to permanent total disability benefits   In a case captioned United Methodist Senior Services v  Ice  Judge Southwick affirmed the award of workmen s compensation benefits to a woman who hurt her back while working as a certified nursing assistant  despite her first employer s claim that she exacerbated the injury during her subsequent employment  In addition  Judge Southwick recognized that the evidentiary standard the employer sought to impose would have prevented many plaintiffs from receiving compensation for a work injury   In Kitchens v  Jerry Vowell Logging  Judge Southwick reversed the Workers Compensation Commission s decision that a truck driver from a logging company did not suffer a permanent loss of wage earning capacity  and remanded the case for further consideration   In Total Transportation v  Shores  a 6 to 4 decision  Judge Southwick joined the other three dissenters  who would have upheld an award of workmen s compensation benefits for a truck driver s widow where the majority ruled in favor of the employer   In Burleson v  Hancock County Sheriff s Department  a 6 to 3 decision  again Judge Southwick joined in dissent  arguing that a public employee was unconstitutionally fired  while the majority ruled in favor of the employer   Similarly  Judge Southwick has ruled numerous times in favor of tort victims and against businesses  In Ducksworth v  Wal Mart Stores  Judge Southwick voted to reverse a trial court s verdict against a customer who had slipped on an unknown substance at Wal Mart   In Breland v  Gulfside Casino Partnership  Judge Southwick voted to reverse summary judgment for a casino in a slip and fall action brought by a patron who had suffered multiple injuries falling down a casino staircase   In Martin v  B  P  Exploration  Oil  Judge Southwick voted to reverse summary judgment against the plaintiff  who injured her ankle upon exiting a gas station s restroom on an allegedly poorly constructed access ramp   In Wilkins v  Bloodsaw  Judge Southwick voted to reverse a grant of summary judgment in favor of a Pizza Hut which was sued by a mother who was injured when her disabled son fell as she tried to help him exit the restaurant   Similarly  Judge Southwick has voted in favor of criminal defendants on numerous occasions  often in dissent  For example  in Jones v  State  a 5 to 5 decision  Judge Southwick dissented  arguing for reversing a conviction because the indictment did not provide the defendant with sufficient clarity to know with certainty what crime was being charged   In Parker v  State  Judge Southwick dissented  arguing that a murder conviction should be reversed because the trial judge failed to give a proper jury instruction   In Mills v  State  a 6 to 3 decision  Judge Southwick dissented from the majority  affirming a drug conviction on the grounds that the court should not have admitted a statement by the defendant s 4 year old son  and the State failed to disclose a piece of evidence against the defendant that it had in its possession   In Harris v  State  a 5 to 4 decision  Judge Southwick dissented from the majority opinion  affirming a drunk driving conviction on the grounds that the trial court erroneously allowed the State to avoid proving all the elements charged in the indictment   In Hughey v  State of Mississippi  Judge Southwick affirmed the trial court s decision to disallow cross examination as to the victim s sexual preference  recognizing that whether the victim was homosexual was not relevant to the defense  and that such a line of inquiry could produce undue prejudice   This Hughey v  State of Mississippi case  where Judge Southwick excluded a victim s sexual preference  is a strong indication    much stronger than the one line in the argument by the Senator from Illinois concerning the issue of a homosexual lifestyle   There are also testimonials  and I will offer two  La Verne Edney  a distinguished African American woman partner in a prominent Jackson  Mississippi  law firm  a member of the Magnolia Bar Association  the Mississippi Women Lawyers  Association  and a member of the Mississippi Task Force for Gender Fairness  has shared her compelling story of Judge Southwick  who gave her an opportunity when few would  This is what she said  and I quote   When I finished law school       I believed that my chances for landing a clerkship were slim because there was only one African American Court of Appeals judge on the bench at the time and there were very few Caucasian judges during the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals       who had ever hired African American law clerks      While Judge Southwick had many applicants to choose from  he saw that I was qualified for the position and granted me the opportunity   Ms  Edney further observed  It did not matter the parties  affiliation  color or stature  what mattered was what the law said and Judge Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly  Judge Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the discussions of issues presented for discussion  Having worked closely with Judge Southwick  I have no doubt he is fair  impartial  and has all of the other qualities necessary to be an excellent addition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit   Now  contrast what Ms  Edney said  a prominent lawyer engaged in all of the advocacy groups    gender fairness  women trial lawyers  Magnolia Bar    compare that to the opinion of Judge Southwick in one case  where he joined in a concurring opinion  where there was a racial slur immediately apologized for  with what this woman  who was his law clerk  found in a very detailed relationship showing fairness and justice   Patrick E  Beasley  a practicing attorney in Jackson  Mississippi  who also happens to be African  American  endorsed Judge Southwick for  among other qualities  his fairness to minorities  This is what Mr  Beasley had to say  I speak from personal experience that Leslie Southwick is a good man who has been kind to me for no ulterior reason  I am not from an affluent family and have no political ties  While I graduated in the top third of my law school class  there were many individuals in my class with higher grade point averages and with family pedigrees to match  Yet  despite all of the typical requirements for the clerkship that I lacked  Judge Southwick gave me an opportunity  Despite all the press to the contrary  Judge Southwick is a fair man and this is one of the qualities that makes him an excellent choice for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals   Mr  SESSIONS  Mr  President  will the Senator yield for a question   Mr  SPECTER  No  But I will be glad to respond to the Senator from Alabama when I finish my speech  I will be glad to respond to him at length   The overall record    I have changed my mind  I will yield for a question   Mr  SPECTER  Maybe the Senator from Illinois will change his mind  too   Mr  SESSIONS  Mr  President  for the first time  on the question of Judge Southwick s ruling  the Senator s remarks make clear to me that he was required as a judge  as I understand it  to not reverse the administrative panel s opinion unless it was arbitrary and capricious  I believe is what the Senator said   It seems to me that sometimes we make a mistake  and I was going to ask the Senator a question  as one of the most able lawyers here in this body for sure  about whether he thinks sometimes we ascribe to the judge who has to rule on a case following the law  that somehow we would suggest he may have approved this racial slur even though he may have ruled in a way different from that   In other words  does the Senator think we ought to be careful in this body not to unfairly suggest that the judge approved this racial slur  which I know he did not  as a result of that ruling   Mr  SPECTER  Mr  President  the question posed by the distinguished Senator from Alabama is illustrative of the unfairness of citing that case against Judge Southwick  because he did not sanction the slur which was uttered   In fact  the administrative review board did not sanction the slur  The administrative review board had only the question to decide as to whether that was grounds for permanent dismissal  That is the only question they had to decide  And then when the cases came before the Mississippi intermediate appellate Court  as the Senator from Alabama has noted  that court had only to decide whether the ruling by the administrative review board was arbitrary and capricious  which means that there was insufficient evidence to sustain it   So Judge Southwick is removed by two major barriers from any conceivable approval of a racial slur  first  on the fact that the administrative board said it was bad  Judge Southwick said it was bad  and  in addition  there was sufficient evidence for the administrative board to find what it did   Now  on the critical question as to whether there were any grounds for permanent dismissal because of what was said  everybody said no    that is  the administrative board  the intermediate appellate court  and the State Supreme Court    contrary to the bland assertion by the Senator from Illinois that the intermediate appellate court was reversed  The Supreme Court said everybody is correct  there are not grounds for permanent dismissal  but we think the administrative board should have given more details as to the reasons why it came to that conclusion   Mr  SESSIONS  Mr  President  I thank the Senator for his effort and the time it takes to be able to examine the complexities of this situation  Most of us are too busy to do it  You do indeed have a passion for the truth  and you have done well in getting there  and I thank you for sharing those thoughts with us   Mr  SPECTER  Well  I thank the Senator from Alabama for complimenting me for my passion for truth  It so happens that is the title of the book I wrote    Harper Collins  available online   Back to the case  though  Mr  President  and I will be brief here  I would point to Judge Southwick s overall record  It is an excellent record  cum laude from Rice  J D  from the University of Texas Law School  clerk for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  an adjunct professor in the Mississippi College of Law  unanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association   And then an extraordinary thing  When he was in his fifties  he volunteered to go to Iraq in the Judge Advocate General s Corps  and was in areas with very heavy fighting  He interrupted a 12 year service on the Mississippi appellate court to do that  That is an extraordinary act  really extraordinary  for somebody in his position to do   I sat down with Judge Southwick at some length to talk to him  and he is an enormously impressive man  He is very mild mannered  He has been on the court  as I say  for 12 years  He has participated in 6 000 cases  he has written 985 opinions  and all they can extract out of this record is one case which  as the colloquy with the Senator from Alabama points out  doesn t establish a peppercorn  That is a legal expression for being practically weightless in terms of what their objections are   The Senator from Illinois then went through the history of the last two nominees who were shot down   I have a reputation and a record to back it up  to have supported President Clinton s nominees  crossing party lines  when they were qualified   The Senator from Illinois makes it a point    not that it has anything to do with this case    that the Republicans didn t give 70 of President Clinton s nominees a hearing   That was wrong  That was wrong  But what we are doing here is we are visiting on Judge Southwick somebody else s sins  If I thought he was not qualified  I wouldn t be taking the lead that I am in this case   When we go through these issues  it is reminiscent of the very contentious controversy which was raised on this floor in 2005 when the Democrats were filibustering judges in retaliation for what had happened during the Clinton years and the Republicans were threatening the so called constitutional or nuclear option  We ought not go back to those days   When you have a man with the record of Judge Leslie Southwick  he is being picked on  With the extensive record he has  to cite one case and to talk about perception    I repeat  when the Senator from Illinois says that perception is determinative  I say that this body ought to vote on the facts   I am pleased to see that a number of Democrats are interviewing Judge Southwick  and I believe they will find him to be very impressive  as I did  I strongly urge my colleagues to look at the facts very carefully  The Senate should not function on perception  The Senate should not function on what somebody else concludes or believes  We ought not do that  We ought to look at the record and make the decision in fairness to this man and in fairness to the entire process of confirmation of Federal judges   I yield the floor                                                                  Browse by
