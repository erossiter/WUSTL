    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  October 17  2007        Today  Senator Arlen Specter  ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  participated in the hearing on the nominationof of Michael B  Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States  Below is a transcript of his opening statement  Mr  Specter     This is a very important confirmation hearing  I believe more important than most confirmations of the attorney general  really approximating the importance of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing  And I say that for a number of reasons     First  the department is dysfunctional     Second  there has been a broad expansion of executive power  necessary in part because we are at war  fighting a serious international enemy     And  third  because it takes the Supreme Court and the other federal courts so long to intervene that the opinions of the attorney general to guide the executive branch on what is constitutional is more important in this setting     We start with a department which urgently needs a restoration of integrity and honesty and independence  We have seen a situation where there have been serious allegations of political influence  and it is very important that those matters be cleared up and that the new attorney general function on hiring of merit and firing for cause     We have seen broad expansion of executive authority  and understandably so when we re at war  But at the same time  there has to be a balancing of constitutional rights and civil liberties     I supported the Patriot Act  chaired the committee that produced it  and managed it on the floor  supported the Protect America Act  But at the same time  I m very concerned about what is happening with constitutional rights     The detainee situation is still a matter of some urgency  It casts a shadow over the administration of justice in America and holds us up for very substantial criticism worldwide     We have seen a terrorist surveillance program put into effect without telling the chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee  A matter of that constitutional magnitude ought to at least be shared with the top officials  if not us  then the speaker of the House and the majority leader  to have some congressional input and some congressional oversight     And we have seen the signing statements  where the president has agreed  when we passed the Patriot Act  to accommodate detailed oversight and then on a signing statement  says  I may not have to do that and may not be willing to do that under my Article II powers     Or on the celebrated rapprochement between President Bush or Senator McCain over interrogation tactics  carefully negotiated and then a signing statement     The conventional understanding of constitutional authority is when the Congress enacts legislation  presents it to the president and he signs it  that that s the law that he has to faithfully execute  under the Constitution     And I m awaiting an attorney general who will tell the president some things he may not like to hear     We have a judicial system which functions in accordance with our traditions  but we still haven t resolved the detainee issue  Congress has legislated on it and you have combat status review tribunals which are a joke  You can have a substitute for habeas corpus  but it has to be meaningful     And now the administration has come forward with yet another effort there  I think  to foreclose a Supreme Court decision  which is imminent with five justices having granted a petition for reargument on the detainee issue     There are so many matters to take on this hearing that I think it s likely to be longer than most     We need to examine the nominee s attitude on reporter s privilege  Can the Department of Justice live with a shield for reporters  with the exception of national security matters  on a balancing test     What would Judge Mukasey have to say about the evolving approach of the Department of Justice to demand waivers or subtly or by virtual compulsion in the face of the attorney client privilege     And as we are proceeding in this hearing room  the Senate is engaged in debates on the appropriations process  And there again is a challenge  this time acquiesced in perhaps by the Congress     The Appropriations Committee came up with legislation  a bill for Commerce  State and Justice  and then there s a move to recommit it to the president s figure  not to use the figure established by the committee or by the Senate  And if we succumb to that  that will be a further enlargement on executive authority     At 11 o clock  the Senate will take up the appropriations bill on Labor  Health  Human Services and Education  where I m the ranking member  so I ll have to be in and out  But in my absence  we ll be watching closely and participating extensively because this is such a very  very important matter     Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                                   Browse by
