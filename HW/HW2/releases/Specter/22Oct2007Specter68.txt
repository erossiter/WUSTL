Consideration Of FISA Bill                       Washington  D C    Monday  October 22  2007       Related Resources     PDF  655 8 KBs        Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa   and Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   today sent a letter to White House Counsel Fred Fielding again requesting access to documents relevant to the Committees upcoming consideration of legislation to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA      The letter renews Judiciary Committee requests that have long gone unmet for documents relevant to the legal justification of the Administrations warrantless electronic surveillance program  termed by the White House as the Terrorist Surveillance Program  The Judiciary Committee on June 27 issued subpoenas for documents related to the programs legal basis  At the White Houses request  Leahy extended the deadline for fulfillment of the subpoenas from July 18 to August 20  but the White House also missed the later deadline  The Administration has not yet provided documents to the Judiciary Committee  which shares jurisdiction over the legislation and is expected to consider a bill in the weeks ahead     The text of the letter follows     October 22  2007     Mr  Fred Fielding   Counsel to the President   The White House   Washington  DC 20530     Dear Mr  Fielding     Since the existence of the Presidents secret wiretapping program became public in December 2005  the Judiciary Committee has been seeking information on the legal justifications for conducting such surveillance outside the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  We have done so through oral and written requests and by conducting oversight hearings  Former Attorney General Gonzales was asked about these matters  The lack of satisfaction with his responses led to further investigations  including the ongoing probe by the Justice Departments Inspector General  In light of the Administrations failure to respond fully  the Committee was prepared in November 2006 to consider subpoenas to telecommunication companies  Those subpoenas were not issued at that time  however     After our repeated requests did not yield the information the Committee requested  the Committee proceeded in June to authorize subpoenas for documents related to the legal justification for the Administrations warrantless wiretapping program and to serve those subpoenas upon the Administration     You have now had more than ample time to collect and process the relevant documents  Responsive information to those subpoenas is long overdue  You have made commitments to provide responsive information over the last several months and even recently  but no such information has yet been provided     Instead  we read that a White House spokesperson has now conditioned the production of information on prior Senate agreement to provide retroactive immunity from liability for communications carriers  That is unacceptable and would turn the legislative process upside down  If the Administration wants our support for immunity  it should comply with the subpoenas  provide the information  and justify its request  As we have both said  it is wrongheaded to ask Senators to consider immunity without their being informed about the legal justifications purportedly excusing the conduct being immunized  Although the two of us have been briefed on certain aspects of the Presidents program  this cannot substitute for access to the documents and legal analysis needed to inform the legislative decisions of the Committee as a whole     By letter dated October 5  2007  your office committed to assembling the documents responsive to our subpoenas by todays date  We expect the commitments of your office to take priority over any White House comments to the media  Accordingly  we urge your compliance with the Committee subpoenas and other information requests without further delay  We can discuss precise arrangements for the production of and access to the documents  but they should be provided in a manner that permits them to be reviewed and considered by all Members of the Committee and appropriate Committee staff     Sincerely
