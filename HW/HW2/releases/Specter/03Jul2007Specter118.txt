    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  July 3  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee  introduced on Friday legislation to regulate the use of presidential signing statements in the interpretation of an Act of Congress   The Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2007  S  1747  has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee      Presidential signing statements can render the legislative process a virtual nullity  making it completely unpredictable how certain laws will be enforced     Senator Specter said    This legislation reinforces the system of checks and balances and separation of powers set out in our Constitution       The bill seeks to protect the constitutional system of checks and balances by  first  preventing the President from issuing a signing statement that alters the meaning of a statute by instructing the courts not to rely on signing statements in interpreting an act  and second  granting Congress the power to participate in any case where the construction or constitutionality of an act of Congress is in question and a signing statement was issued when the act was signed   While there are legitimate uses for signing statements  such as instruction for the executive branch on how to administer a law  this legislation seeks to curtail the President from using a signing statement to rewrite the words of a statute or using a signing statement to selectively nullify provisions he does not like    This bill is similar in substance to the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2006  which Senator Specter introduced on July 26  2006   The Senate Judiciary Committee also held a hearing on this topic on June 27  2006    A copy of Senator Specter  s floor statement is below   Mr  President  I seek recognition today to offer the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2007  The purpose of this bill is to regulate the use of Presidential Signing Statements in the interpretation of acts of Congress  This bill is similar in substance to the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2006  which I introduced on July 26  2006  The Senate Judiciary Committee also held a hearing on this topic on June 27  2006      I believe that this is necessary to protect our constitutional system of checks and balances  This bill achieves that goal in the following ways      First  it prevents the President from issuing a signing statement that alters the meaning of a statute by instructing Federal and State courts not to rely on Presidential signing statements in interpreting a statute      Second  it grants Congress the power to participate in any case where the construction or constitutionality of any act of Congress is in question and a presidential signing statement for that act was issued by  i  allowing Congress to file an amicus brief and present oral argument in such a case   ii  instructing that if Congress passes a joint resolution declaring its view of the correct interpretation of the statute  the court must admit that resolution into the case record  and  iii  providing for expedited review in such a case      Presidential signing statements are nothing new  Since the days of President James Monroe  Presidents have issued statements when signing bills  It is widely agreed that there are legitimate uses for signing statements  For example  Presidents may use signing statements to instruct executive branch officials how to administer a law  They may also use them to explain to the public the likely effect of a law  And  there may be a host of other legitimate uses      However  the use of signing statements has risen dramatically in recent years  When I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill last year  I noted that as of June 26  2006  President Bush had issued 132 signing statements  Since then  he has issued an additional 17 statements  for a total of 149 to date  In comparison  President Clinton issued 105 signing statements during his two terms  Moreover  President Bush s signing statements often raise objections to several provisions of a law  For example  a recent report by the Government Accountability Office released June 18  2007  found that  for 11 appropriations acts for fiscal year 2006  President Bush issued signing statements identifying constitutional concerns or objections to 160  different provisions appearing in the acts  While the mere numbers may not be significant  the reality is that the way the President has used those statements threatens to render the legislative process a virtual nullity  making it completely unpredictable how certain laws will be enforced      The President cannot use a signing statement to rewrite the words of a statute nor can he use a signing statement to selectively nullify those provisions he does not like  This much is clear from our Constitution  The Constitution grants the President a specific  narrowly defined role in enacting legislation  Article I  section 1 of the Constitution vests   all legislative powers       in a Congress    Article I  section 7 of the Constitution provides that when a bill is presented to the President  he may either sign it or veto it with his objections  He may also choose to do nothing  thus rendering a so called pocket veto  The President  however  cannot veto part of bill  he cannot veto certain provisions he does not like      The Founders had good reason for constructing the legislative process as they did  by creating a bicameral legislature and then granting the President the veto power  According to The Records of the Constitutional Convention  the veto power was designed by our Framers to protect citizens from a particular Congress that might enact oppressive legislation  However  the Framers did not want the veto power to be unchecked  and so  in article I  section 7  they balanced it by allowing Congress to override a veto by two thirds vote      As I stated when I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill last year  this is a finely structured constitutional procedure that goes straight to the heart of our system of check and balances  Any action by the President that circumvents this finely structured procedure is an unconstitutional attempt to usurp legislative authority  If the President is permitted to rewrite the bills that Congress passes and cherry pick which provisions he likes and does not like  he subverts the constitutional process designed by our Framers      The Supreme Court has affirmed that the constitutional process for enacting legislation must be safeguarded  As the Supreme Court explained in INS v  Chahda    It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative action in article I  section 1 and 7 represents the Framers  decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single  finely wrought and exhaustively considered  procedure        So  while signing statements have been commonplace since our country s founding  we must make sure that they are not being used in an unconstitutional manner  a manner that seeks to rewrite legislation  and exercise line item vetoes      As I have previously explained  President Bush has used signing statements in ways that have raised some eyebrows  An example is the signing statement accompanying Senator McCain s   anti torture amendment   to the Department of Defense Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act  otherwise known as the   McCain Amendment    In that legislation  Congress voted by an overwhelming majority  90 to 9  to ban all U S  personnel from inflicting   cruel  inhuman or degrading   treatment on any prisoner held anywhere by the United States  President Bush  who had threatened to veto the legislation  instead invited Senator McCain to the White House for a public reconciliation and declared they had a mutual goal  to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture        Now from that  you might conclude that by signing the McCain amendment into law  President Bush and his administration has fully committed to not using torture  But you would be wrong  After the public ceremony of signing the bill into law  the President issued a signing statement saying his administration would construe the new law   in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power    This vague language may mean that  despite the enactment of the McCain Amendment  the administration may still be preserving a right to inflict torture on prisoners and to evade the International Convention Against Torture      Now  the National Defense Authorization Bill  like the McCain amendment  has a crucial provision regarding torture  it provides that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals  CSRTs  in Guantanamo Bay   may not consider a  detainee s  statement that was obtained through methods that amount to torture    See section 1023 4  e   But who knows how this provision will be enforced if deemed inconsistent with the unitary executive theory      And  the McCain amendment is just the tip of the iceberg  On close examination of the same signing statement  we see that President Bush has declared the right to construe the entire Detainee Treatment Act and all provisions relating to detainees  in a manner consistent with the unitary executive theory and with his powers as Commander and Chief  This is extremely troublesome  Like the DTA  this bill has crucial sections relating to detainees  Specifically  this bill contains much needed provisions that protect detainees  due process rights in CSRT procedures  including allowing detainees a right to legal counsel  a right to compel and cross examine witnesses  and a right to have their status determined by a military judge  Should a similar signing statement be issued to S  1547  that all sections related to detainees will be construed in a certain way  there is really no way to know how these crucial provisions will be enforced      We must ensure that such provisions  and for that matter  any and all provisions in this bill  are not subject to revision by a Presidential signing statement      In addition to these examples  I have noted another instance in which a questionable signing statement was issued  for the PATRIOT Act  We passed the PATRIOT Act after months of deliberation  We debated nearly every provision  often redrafting and revising  Moreover  we worked very closely with the President because we wanted to get it right  We wanted to make sure that we were passing legislation that the executive branch would find workable  In fact  in many ways  the process was an excellent example of the legislative branch and the executive branch working together towards a common goal      In the end  the bill that was passed by the Senate and the House contained several oversight provisions intended to make sure the FBI did not abuse the special terrorism related powers to search homes and secretly seize papers  It also required Justice Department officials to keep closer track of how often the FBI uses the new powers and in what type of situations      The President signed the PATRIOT Act into law  but afterwards  he wrote a signing statement that said he could withhold any information from Congress provided in the oversight provisions if he decided that disclosure would   impair foreign relations  national security  the deliberative process of the executive  or the performance of the executive s constitutional duties        As I noted last year  during the entire process of working with the President to draft the PATRIOT Act  he never asked the Congress to include this language in the act  At a hearing we held last June on signing statements  I asked an executive branch official  Michelle Boardman from the Office of Legal Counsel  why the President did not ask the Congress to put the signing statement language into the bill  She simply didn t have an answer      Given this backdrop  I believe this bill is necessary  As I noted when I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill last summer  this bill does not seek to limit the President s power  and it does not seek to expand Congress s power  Rather  this bill simply seeks to safeguard our Constitution      This bill will provide courts with much needed guidance on how legislation should be interpreted  The recent GAO report on Presidential Signing Statements found that Federal courts cited or referred to presidential signing statements in 137 different opinions reported from 1945 to May 2007  It also shows that the Supreme Court s reliance on presidential signing statements has been sporadic and unpredictable  In some cases  such as United States v  Lopez  115 S Ct  1624 at 1631  1995  where the Court struck down the Gun Free School Zones Act  the Supreme Court has relied on Presidential signing statements as a source of authority to interpret an act  while in other cases  such as the military tribunals case  Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  126 S Ct  2749  2006   Scalia dissenting  it has conspicuously declined to do so  This inconsistency has the unfortunate result of rendering the effect of Presidential signing statements on Federal law unpredictable      As I stated when I initially introduced the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2006  it is well within Congress s power to resolve judicial disputes such as this by enacting rules of statutory interpretation  In fact  the Department of Defense Authorization bill already contains at least one   rule of construction   provision  See section 845 e   This power flows from article 1  section 8  clause 18 of the Constitution  which gives Congress the power   To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers  and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States  or in any department or officer thereof    Rules of statutory interpretation are   necessary and proper   to execute the legislative power      Several scholars have agreed  Jefferson B  Fordham  a former dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School said     I t is within the legislative power to lay down rules of interpretation for the future    Mark Tushnet  a professor at Harvard Law School explained    In light of the obvious congressional power to prescribe a statute s terms  and so its meaning  congressional power to prescribe interpretive methods seems to me to follow    Michael Stokes Paulsen  an associate dean of the University of Minnesota Law School noted    Congress is the master of its own statutes and can prescribe rules of interpretation governing its own statutes as surely as it may alter or amend the statutes directly    Finally  J  Sutherland  the author of the leading multivolume treatise for the rules of statutory construction has said    There should be no question that an interpretive clause operating prospectively is within legislative power        Furthermore  any legislation that sets out rules for interpreting an act makes legislation more clear and precise  which is exactly what we aim to achieve here in Congress  Congress can and should exercise this power over the interpretation of Federal statutes in a systematic and comprehensive manner      Put simply  this bill seeks to implement measures that will safeguard the constitutional structure of enacting legislation  In preserving this structure  this bill reinforces the system of checks and balances and separation of powers set out in our Constitution  and I urge my colleagues to support it                                                                 Browse by
