    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Philadelphia  PA   Friday  May 13  2005                      U S  Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania  s senior Senator  made the following comments regarding the Department of Defense  s Base Realignment and Closing list      Pennsylvania has done better on this base closing activity than in any time in the past  when we were very hard hit for example  with the closing of the Philadelphia Navy Yard back 1991  which I fought all of the way to the Supreme Court of the United States   I had a chance to question Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld when he appeared before the Defense Subcommittee three weeks ago and told him that Pennsylvania had been very hard hit in the past and urged him to consider that in what closures there were   Out of the total work force of some 67 000  we have a net loss of 1 800 jobs and frankly I don  t like that       On one base closing we were second in the nation  hurt right behind California in terms of impact and of course California is a much bigger state with many more bases        We will fight the recommendations of the Dept  of Defense to close Willow Grove Naval Air Station  it  s a very important air reserve  which accommodates all three branches of the military   There are units in Pittsburgh closed  which I also disagree with   I will continue my practice  when they have the hearings  to appear personally as the advocate for Willow Grove and the installations in Pittsburgh       There are procedures to challenge the listing by the Dept  of Defense with the Base Closing Commission and I intend to join with the Pennsylvania delegation  Senator Santorum  Governor Rendell  and we  re going to be putting up a battle       There were some bright spots too   The Naval Support Activity in Philadelphia gained almost 300 jobs  a few more than the civilian losses at Willow Grove and we are going to pursue the possibility of having the spots opened at the Supply Depot in Philadelphia made available to the civilians who are losing their jobs in Willow Grove    Also as to Willow Grove it ought to be noted that Sec  Rumsfeld was explicit yesterday in saying that the communities which are hit will get some economic aid   We are going to pursue that       Letterkenny which had been substantially downsized in the past gained 409 jobs  Tobyhanna about 300 jobs       I compliment the community activities around the state   I think Pennsylvania faired as well as it did because of the activities in making our case to the Dept  of Defense before the Secretary published the list        It didn  t just happen now   Some fourteen months ago  I brought in the key Dept  of Defense official to meet with representatives from the communities all around Pennsylvania   These communities really went to work   I visited Letterkenny  and there was a civilian group which was large and active   Tobyhanna has had a Blue Ribbon task force for some time and presenting the best case there     There had been a lot of concerned angst in Carlisle  Central Pennsylvania  about the Army War College   I made a special point when I saw Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  it was one of the light moments in the hearing  sometimes they are pretty heavy  but I pointed out to Sec  Rumsfeld that President George W  Bush visited Carlisle last year during his campaign   He was the only sitting president to visit the War College since the other George W   George Washington  and in Carlisle they have an enormous portrait of George Washington marching into Carlisle on a great white stallion   But there was a lot of worry that the War College might have been closed and it survived                                                                    Browse by                                                                                                    Current record
