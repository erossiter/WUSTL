                                                                         News Room News Releases          Continuing Resolution has Funding at  7 Billion above the President s FY 2007 Budget                      Washington  D C    Tuesday  January 30  2007     Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced a  2 3 billion increase for key health  human services  education and job training initiatives that were included in the final federal funding package for the current fiscal year  This boost represents  7 billion more than what was proposed in the President s original FY 2007 budget     Previous funding levels for the departments of Labor  Health and Human Services and Education have been insufficiently low   Specter said   Health and education are our nation s two greatest capital investments  and I look forward to working with Senator Harkin to further increase funding levels for these departments  which have not even kept up with the rate of inflation     This money represents a long  hard fight to get adequate funding for the health and education programs that America desperately needs   Harkin said   But we must continue to do more and this must remain a priority for this country and this Congress    Harkin and Specter are the Chair and Ranking Member of the Labor  HHS and Education Appropriations Subcommittee  The pair originally attempted to include this funding increase with the budget resolution in March 2006  when their amendment overwhelming passed the Senate 73 27  The new money in this final fiscal package will return federal spending for vital programs that keep America competitive and provide the basic safety net for our most vulnerable citizens to their FY 2005 levels   The  463 5 billion legislation remains within the overall budget cap  established by the Republican led 109th Congress    A description of the funding increases contained in the FY 2007 Joint Funding Resolution for health and education include     A  620 million increase for the National Institutes of Health  That increase will allow NIH to award an additional 500 research grants to our brightest biomedical scientists  in areas such as cancer  heart disease  and diabetes   It will also create a new  40 million program to support innovative  thinking outside the box research   And it looks to the future by providing  91 million for grants to first time investigators   our nation s next generation of biomedical researchers  The resolution includes  69 million for the National Children s Study     A  260 increase in the maximum Pell Grant from  4 050 to  4 310  According to the College Board  the 35 percent inflation adjusted increase in public four year college published tuition and fees between 2001 02 and 2006 07 is higher than any other five year increase from 1976 77 to the present   Meanwhile  the Pell Grant maximum award has been  4 050 for the past four school years    As a result  the more than 5 million college students  who receive Pell Grants  have had no extra help from their Pell Grant  considered the foundation of Federal support for student financial aid     A  250 million increase for Title I Education funding to help the federal government fulfill its commitment to fund the No Child Left Behind Act  The increase includes  125 million increase for Title I grants to school districts   the cornerstone program of the law   This money is enough to provide full Title I services to 38 000 disadvantaged students across the country who are at risk of being left behind   The resolution also provides  125 million targeted specifically to schools that aren t making the grade under the No Child Left Behind Act     A  200 million increase for Grants to States for Special Education to help school districts better serve almost 7 million students with disabilities     A  207 million increase for Community Health Centers  Community Health Centers serve 16 million Americans annually  providing low cost primary care  pediatrics  preventative health screenings  mental health care and much needed dental care   They are the front line of providing affordable care to the uninsured  40 percent of CHC patients are uninsured  and another 45 percent are insured through Medicaid  Medicare and state systems of care  This increase will provide the funds to open more than 300 new Community Health Centers in neighborhoods across America and provide  25 million for base adjustments to existing centers        A  100 million increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for and respond to an outbreak of pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases  Monies will enable the CDC to enhance global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza  ensure rapid investigation of potential outbreaks  establish the infrastructure for critical diagnostics  and communicate to the general public the risks and possible recommendations to lower risks     A  104 million increase for Head Start   This increase will restore last year s 1 percent budget cut and also provide a small cost of living adjustment for Head Start grantees  Without an increase in FY 2007  programs would have to make the difficult decision to reduce the number of children they are serving or make even more significant cuts to the services they provide to low income children and their families     A  76 million increase for the Ryan White CARE State Grant program  This increase will help states provide services and healthcare to people living with HIV and AIDS       A  20 million increase for Meals on Wheels and other senior nutrition programs   This increase will restore last year s across the board cut and provide a small increase to offset inflation and a growing elderly population  Increasing federal funds for this program will help alleviate waiting lists for services and will go a long way toward improving the health and well being of some of America s most vulnerable citizens     A  146 million increase to prevent the Social Security Administration  SSA  from furloughing staff for more than one week  This year  SSA will process almost 4 million

as a result of this additional funding     A  52 million increase to the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services for the 1 800 MEDICARE call centers for the final months of the fiscal year  These centers were created to help seniors understand their Medicare options  and have become even more important since the Medicare prescription benefit was instituted  Originally  22 million calls were expected this year  because of the uncertainty with the prescription drug program  the estimate has expanded to 35 million calls  and existing funding to fully staff the centers is inadequate     A  25 000 000 new grant program  targeted to urban areas  has been created to discourage youth in high crime cities from involvement in violent crime
