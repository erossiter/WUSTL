    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  October 31  2007                       Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke about FISA and the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the Attorney General of the United States during a Judiciary Committee hearing entitled  FISA Amendments  How to Protect Americans Security and Privacy and Preserve the Rule of Law and Government Accountability   A copy of Senator Specters opening statement is pasted below     Senator Specter    Thank you  Mr  Chairman     I am glad to see that we have come a long way in the last 18 months since legislation was introduced in mid 2006 to bring the terrorist surveillance program under the FISA Court     And we have some very important considerations to protect U S  persons  to have the FISA Court review the procedures  and to handle minimization in an appropriate way     With respect to the request for retroactive release of liability  I have great reluctance  Part of that stems from the secrecy that the government has interposed  When we were seeking subpoenas last year for the telephone companies  we were thwarted by action of the vice president in contacting Republican members without notifying the chairman     And as I see the situation  I think the telephone companies do have a strong  equitable case  but my inclination is that they ought to get indemnification  that the courts ought not to be closed     I doubt very much the cases will be proved  but if plaintiffs can prove them  I think they ought to have their day in court  And it is costly  but that s part of the cost of the war on terrorism     Finally  yesterday  we had a closed door briefing on what is happening  And I believe we need more briefings     The government has been reluctant to follow the statute on informing the Intelligence Committee about FISA until they needed support for the confirmation of General Hayden as director of the CIA     And the session we had yesterday was an important one  And I think we need more information from the administration     The chairman has referred to the pendency of the nomination of Judge Mukasey to be attorney general     And that is a matter which covers the issues which are before us now or are a first cousin at a very minimum     And it is my hope  Mr  Chairman  that we would be able to resolve the issues on Judge Mukasey sooner rather than later  And I know that s your inclination as well  and that you had wanted to bring the matter to a determination by the committee early     I think it may be advisable to have a closed door session  where we talk about waterboarding and we talk about torture and we talk about those techniques     Earlier this week  in the wake of the issue on waterboarding  I had an extensive briefing by General Hayden  There are people who overlap the Intelligence Committee with the Judiciary Committee who know about the details  and I believe it is a matter that the full committee ought to be informed about     I think that the extensive letter which Judge Mukasey has submitted goes about as far as he can go  He has repudiated waterboarding  he has rejected it  but he has stopped short of making a determination of legality    And let s face the facts  The facts are that an expression of an opinion by Judge Mukasey prior to becoming attorney general would put a lot of people at risk for what has happened     Now  they may be at risk regardless of what Judge Mukasey says or what the next attorney general says  And last week former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was in France  and there was an effort made to initiate a prosecution against him     And extraterritorial jurisdiction is being asserted by many countries under the doctrine of crimes against humanity     Ordinarily  a prosecution can be brought only where the act occurred  but what Judge Mukasey would say on that subject has repercussions in that direction     The standard has been articulated of whether it shocks the conscience under the Rochin decision  And that depends upon a totality of circumstances  It depends on who is the individual  what access the individual has to information  how important the threat is  what is the likelihood of getting information which would be critical in saving lives     We all dodge around the so called ticking bomb case  Nobody wants to articulate a principle of there are any exceptions to torture     And it is probably advisable not to be explicit in that situation  because you may make exceptions which will be broadened  as the expression goes  that you can drive a truck through     But we do know that the Department of Justice is in dire straits  If there s one thing that this committee and perhaps the entire Senate is unanimous on  it s that the Department of Justice is dysfunctional     I think we need extensive assurances  But as I carefully read Judge Mukasey s letter  I don t know how much more he could say than what he has said  considering the exposure to people in collateral circumstances and considering the impossibility of predicting what may be faced with respect to a future potential danger  if the so called ticking bomb hypothetical were to reach fruition     But what I would like to see is us  Mr  Chairman  go into a closed session like we had yesterday  I thought it was very fruitful when we were behind closed doors and could talk more openly about the subject matter of what the telephone companies have been doing  and to share information from those who know more about the interrogation techniques and the waterboarding than many members of this committee know     And the Intelligence Committee is privy to that  and they should be  But so should this committee  when we have to make a measurement and make a decision about the adequacy of what Judge Mukasey has said on a subject which could defeat his confirmation     No doubt the confirmation is at risk at this moment because he has not answered the question categorically  And I think we need to have a very frank discussion with more facts available  And I believe that can only be done in a closed door session     I would hope we might do that early next week  Hopeful we could get Judge Mukasey on the agenda for next week and either fish or cut bait on this important matter                                                                   Browse by
