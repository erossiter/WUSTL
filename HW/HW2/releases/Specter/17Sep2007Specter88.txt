    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Monday  September 17  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  today made the following comments regarding the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to serve as Attorney General     Below is a transcript of Senator Specters press conference       SPECTER     It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will move promptly on the confirmation proceedings as to Judge Michael Mukasey     I met with the judge the morning  talked to him about the process and about his own background  He comes to the nomination with excellent academic and professional qualifications  a Columbia grad  Yale Law School  been a practicing lawyer for many years  an assistant United States attorney  a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York    chief judge there  Handled many complex trials     There will have to be  obviously  a very probing inquiry into his background in the confirmation hearings  We will need some time to review his background  do the spade work  and then the hearings will give us an opportunity to go very deeply into his background     He comes with some recommendations from a wide variety of groups  When the vacancy had occurred on the Supreme Court a couple of years ago  he was widely mentioned as a prospect     In making this selection  I think President Bush has made a very conscience and deliberate effort to choose someone who would not be controversial  Judge Mukasey had  in fact  been recommended by one of the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee     It is my hope that we will not get bogged down in preconditions on his nomination with respect to certain pending requests which the committee has outstanding to the administration  such as the background documents on the determination for constitutionality of the Foreign Intelligence     Terrorist Surveillance Program  or on the background materials on the issue of the resignations of the United States attorneys  or on the witnesses to come forward    the White House personnel  where we have not had an opportunity to question them yet  But it is my hope that those issues will be separated     We do not have confirmed people as attorney general or deputy attorney general or associate attorney general  and there are many of the slots of assistant attorney general which are yet unfilled  So  it is very important that the Department of Justice have senior leadership to carry on its important functions     There is no doubt that the Department of Justice has been in disarray for some time  My own characterization and the hearings which we ve held has been that it is dysfunctional  It has very  very important role to play on the investigation of terrorism  prosecution of violent crime  prosecution of organized crime  drug interdiction  antitrust  civil matters  The morale of United States attorney    some 93 across the country    has been reputed in    also in disarray     So that I think it is very important to act promptly  not with undue haste  getting an opportunity to review Judge Mukasey s background  But to act promptly and not become snarled in the requests which are outstanding    to make those preconditions for proceeding in an expeditious way with this confirmation proceeding      QUESTION     Mr  Chairman    Mr  Senator        SPECTER     That s all right        LAUGHTER      QUESTION     You talk about this getting bogged down  snarled in possible requests over other information  As you know  this is a contact sport here on Capitol Hill       Have you talked to Chairman Leahy about trying to more through that or talking to other members who might want to put holds on this nomination for that express purpose      SPECTER     I have not discussed the matter with anybody on the committee because we ve only had the nomination now for about half    little more than a half an hour  I found out about it last night       But I have spoken about this subject before  and expressed my view that there not ought to be an entanglement between the outstanding requests by the Judiciary Committee to the administration and this confirmation proceeding      QUESTION     Senator  did you get to speak with Judge Mukasey about whether and how he would try to answer some of those outstanding questions  about the firings  for example  Did you get an idea from him about whether and how he might try  as A G   to answer some of those outstanding questions      SPECTER     Well  I have discussed preliminarily  I am scheduling a meeting tomorrow at noon for a longer session  There wasn t a whole lot of time this morning       But I ve asked him about his record on law enforcement contrasted with civil rights  The issue about the attorney general not being the attorney for the president  that that s the job of White House counsel  That he is  if confirmed  a member of the Cabinet  but he has a broader duty  as the chief law enforcement officer of the country  to the people of the country  And I think Jude Mukasey is on target on that       I ve discussed with him some of his cases  He presided over the Padilla case  which drew a lot of notoriety and comment  He ruled that Padilla couldn t be retained as an enemy combatant but insisted that Padilla have counsel  And was pretty firm  really tough  with the Department of Justice in saying to it that they provided counsel when they hadn t done so in a prompt way  He had a rather direct  curt exchange with officials in the Department of Justice       Talked to him about his rulings on cases involving defendants  rights and discussed with him two cases where he had suppressed evidence  which is a sign of balance by a judge       SPECTER     He presided over the trial of the case involving the so called Blind Sheik  and has written on the subject of terrorism and national security       But those are issues which we ll be going into in real depth during the confirmation proceedings  I just want to hopefully get him started      QUESTION     Senator  do you think that it s improper for the Democrats to press those demands as a contingent  make the nomination and the confirmation contingent on the White House s willingness to produce more material  Or what    how far can they go to get  inaudible       SPECTER     Well  when you ask whether it is proper  senators have very wide latitude in their approaches to all of Senate responsibilities  including confirmation  So that I would not want to pick a fight with anybody by saying who is improper  but I would say that it s very much in the national interest now to move ahead with the confirmation because of the unusual circumstances       This is not a run of the mill circumstance for two reasons  Number one  in the long history of the country  I don t think the Justice Department has been in such disarray  And secondly  you have top spots unconfirmed  unconfirmed attorney general  unconfirmed deputy  unconfirmed associate  And if you took a look at the organizational chart  there are many others who are unconfirmed among the assistant attorneys general ranks      QUESTION     Senator Specter  given how much rancor there was surrounding the Olson    the potential for an Olson nominee  do you think Mukasey is a better choice at this time       And also  do you think that the White House gave in  given that there was a preemptive strike by Democrats to say Olson was a no go      SPECTER     Well  I think that Ted Olson would have made an outstanding attorney general  I don t know whether the president ever had any plans with respect to Ted Olson for attorney general  all of that was speculation       But when you have the majority leader saying the man  if nominated  is not going to be confirmed  that s more than a danger signal  that s a stop  look and listen    red light    blinking red lights on a train crossing       So  I think that whomever the president was thinking about  and it s only speculative  that selecting Judge Mukasey is a very obvious effort to take someone who is noncontroversial and who has a very strong background and who has the kind of attributes that we d be looking for in an attorney general    subject to a rugged confirmation proceeding  which is in order for somebody of this high rank       QUESTION     Senator  it sounds like you re saying that the urgency to fill these spots at the top of Justice outweighs the need to answer some of these remaining questions about the firings  for example  Are you saying that or are you saying that it should just be done first  that that s the order of things      SPECTER     Well  I think the vacancies and the disarray of the department make it an unusual situation       I think the committee is correct in asking for the background data of the resignations of the U S  attorneys  I think the Judiciary Committee is correct in wanting to have the testimony of White House officials in some palatable form  I think the committee s correct  in light of what happened in the Ashcroft hotel incident  to get the background material on the deliberations within the department on the terrorist surveillance program       Those are all very  very important matters  But I don t think they are as important as what s happening in Justice day in and day out today      QUESTION     And if the Democrats do try to use the nomination as leverage on the document fight  what do you think that ll do to the wonderful spirit of comity that we have here in the Senate of late      SPECTER     Oh  I think it would be another strong item of promotion of comity  like we see so often in the Senate chamber and the House       Things are pretty biting and pretty bitter  We all know that  And I think the president has gone the extra mile to find somebody who would be acceptable  somebody who would be good       Listen  the newspapers over the weekend were speculating about Judge Mukasey with the support of one of the members of the Judiciary Committee on the Democratic side and thought that might kill the prospects for his nomination     So the president reads the clips       QUESTION     Senator  in an op ed piece about a month ago  after the Padilla case was decided  Judge Mukasey wrote that he didn t think it was a victory for the rule of law and that the country should    particularly in light of the problems that the government faces when it s dealing with suspected terrorists  And he said that the Congress should consider proposals that would allow  in effect  detention of suspected detainees like people that are held for mental disabilities  insanity  that sort of thing  to bypass    maybe even a national security court outside of the current system      SPECTER     Well  I know        QUESTION     Do you  inaudible  or know more about it      SPECTER     I know about the op ed  but I haven t had a chance to read it because events are unfolding at a very fast pace  And we will be studying that  and we will be asking him questions about it       There have been a number of proposals for a special court to handle national security cases  There have been suggestions that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ought to handle them because of the confidentiality and because of the potential state secrets involved       There is no doubt in my mind that the current system is deeply flawed at Guantanamo  and the review board does not hear not only not competent evidence  but they do not have any reasons    in most cases you don t have the habeas corpus judicial review  So that if there were some court structured which would be    maintain confidentiality but give detainees a right to confront their accusers    confrontation    and some reason for detention in a different judicial kind of proceeding  it would be a vast improvement over the combat status review board       So in making the proposal to move away from the combat status review board  that s a blow for civil rights  constitutional rights      QUESTION     Senator Specter  you talk about the bogging down of this process  Ideally  how quickly do you think that Mr  Mukasey can be confirmed  Do you think that the three weeks that they talked about the previous confirmation is possible  likely      SPECTER     Well  I don t want to set up a timetable  I think that s something that Chairman Leahy and I ought to discuss       The White House had grandiose ideas on confirmations of Roberts  They wanted to start the Roberts hearings on August 28th  they wanted Alito confirmed before the end of the year  And had we followed their wishes  we might still have two vacancies on the Supreme Court       So  I want to work it out with Senator Leahy on a timetable which is comfortable from all points of view  We need some time to study the man s record before you go to hearings  But we also need to move with deliberate speed      QUESTION     Senator  you said you have to go in there and spade into his record  your term  What are you looking for  What are you looking at      SPECTER     I want to get an idea on his balance as to civil rights  the constitutional rights  A good sign when he said Padilla was entitled to counsel  that s very positive  A good sign that there are some cases where he s not followed prosecution and has suppressed evidence  But I want to know more about him       I want to see how he sounds on the witness chair  Hes a soft spoken man  I want to see how he responds      QUESTION     After clamoring for a replacement for Attorney General Gonzales  do you think that puts the Democrats in a bit of a political bind  in terms of asserting these demands that the White House would produce information in addition        SPECTER     Does it put the Democrats in a political bind  No  I wouldn t go so far as to say that  They have shown great adroitness at avoiding binds                                                                     Browse by

record
