    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Monday  July 9  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the floor of the U S  Senate about the White House  s assertion of Executive Privilege     Below is copy of Senator Specter  s remarks   I wish to make a comment or two on the subject broached by the distinguished chairman of the committee on the current issue with the challenge on executive privilege where letters were received today from the White House Counsel indicating that executive privilege would be asserted   It is my hope that we will yet be able to resolve this controversy because of the importance of getting the information which the Judiciary Committee has sought in its oversight capacity      We are dealing with a Department of Justice which I think  fairly stated  is dysfunctional   We have seen the Attorney General of the United States come before the Judiciary Committee and says he was not involved in discussions  not involved in deliberations  and then was contradicted by three of his top deputies  contradicted by documentary evidence in the e mails      I think it is generally conceded that the President of the United States has the authority to remove U S  attorneys for no reason  just as President Clinton did when he took office in 1993  but you cannot remove a U S  attorney for a bad reason      There have been questions raised as to the request for the resignation from the U S  attorney from San Diego  that she perhaps was hot on the trail of confederates of former Congressman Duke Cunningham  who is serving 8 years in jail   I do not know whether that is true   We have yet not had an explanation from the Department of Justice as to why her resignation was requested      Similarly  a cloud has existed over the reasons for the requested resignation for the U S  attorney from New Mexico  with some suggestions that he was asked to resign because he would not bring prosecutions for vote fraud when he thought there was no basis  and some of us thought there was a basis   That has not yet been explained  and the request for resignations generally has not been explained      The Department of Justice is second only to the Department of Defense in importance to the United States   The Department of Justice has the responsibility for investigating terrorism  has the responsibility for investigating and prosecuting drug dealers in international cartels  the responsibility for investigating and prosecuting organized crime and violent crime   Yet it is pretty hard to make a more conclusive description than to say that the Department of Justice is dysfunctional  and the Attorney General insists on staying   I think  as to his own decision  it is a matter for him personally   I am not going to tell him what to do  nor am I going to make a recommendation to the President   Under separation of powers  it is the President s call   I don t want the President to tell me how to conduct my office in the Senate and I am not going to impede upon his executive authority  but I do believe that the inquiry which the Judiciary Committee is conducting might produce facts  if we get to the bottom of things  find out what they are  which would lead us to a new Attorney General  which I think is very much in the national interest      So I am hopeful we can yet avoid the confrontation   I think  candidly  there is a lot of posturing on both sides   I don t think it is realistic to seek a contempt citation brought against the President    that is newspaper talk    contempt citation brought against anybody in the executive branch  because there are arguments on both sides of this issue   I hope we can work it out so that we don t test the good faith of the executive branch in asserting privilege or the good faith of the legislative branch  the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee  in seeking facts as part of our oversight responsibility   I hope we can work it out      I said a long while ago I would be prepared to accept the President s terms  with only one exception  and that was the importance of having a transcript as to what happens   The President made an offer on national television months ago saying he would allow White House personnel to come in and be informally questioned  but he did not want to have them under oath  and I would prefer to see them under oath   But I would give on that issue  because what they say is subject to a criminal prosecution with a 5 year penalty  the same as a perjury conviction for a false official statement under 18 U S  Code 1001     Mr  LEAHY   Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question on that point     Mr  SPECTER   I yield      Mr  LEAHY   Would the distinguished Senator accept the offer of the President  if the rejoinder of the President was if we did it the way you describe    transcript  knowing that the criminal code applies    but once you have done that  there would be no follow up   Even if you were to find something out during that meeting  there would be no follow up  there would be a promise of no subpoenas  there would be no further proceedings      Mr  SPECTER   I will be pleased to respond to that relevant inquiry   Senator Leahy and I have discussed this before   We have discussed just about everything  because we do things on a joint basis    about as pure as Ivory Snow  99 4   We have some disagreements  but we try to work them out on a bipartisan basis because we think it is the right way to approach it      The Senator from Vermont has said he thinks we would be barred from a follow up  and I don t know whether that is part of the offer which the President has made  but we can get it clarified further   I do not think we could make the commitment not to pursue a subpoena at a later time if we felt the informal interviews were insufficient   I don t think we can give up our authority in that process  and if we could  I wouldn t agree to that because I don t know what the informal interviews are going to produce and I would to want retain the right to exercise our right to subpoena             I would acknowledge at the same time that if we exercise our right to a subpoena that the President could exercise whatever rights he has on executive privilege   We would be back to square one  but at least we would have the advantage of the questioning   I know the questioning of Senator Leahy  a tough prosecutor from Burlington  VT   I have been there   And on an informal basis  Senator Leahy can extract quite a lot of information  and Chairman Conyers has the capacity to extract a lot of information   I might even have a relevant question or two to ask in the course of the proceedings      I think we can get a lot of information   I want to have that information   I want to find out as much as I could before I go to court on what is going to be a 2 year battle   It is going to outlast the President s term   It is going to outlast Attorney General Gonzales s tenure   I don t think the next President is going to reappoint Attorney General Gonzales      Let the Record show there is a smile from staff in the back   It was intended to be not serious      Then the President doesn t want there to be these witnesses to go before both committees  and that is all right   I think Chairman Conyers and Chairman Leahy  in consultation with their ranking members  can work out a smaller group from the House and Senate  bipartisan  bicameral  sufficient to ask the questions   Then I would prefer that it be public   But as long as the transcript is published  I would give that up as well      I think it is so important that we get to the bottom of this important issue so we can have the Department of Justice function in the interest of the public that I am prepared to make those concessions  but I want a transcript   I would even be willing to give up the transcript if I am compelled to   I would take the interviews rather than have nothing   It would be at least something   But I would say to the President  the executive branch  that the transcript protects not only the questioners but the persons being questioned so there is no doubt as to what was said   I have been in closed door meetings and had a number of participants walk out and  in perfectly good faith  have different versions as to what occurred   That happens when you are in a closed session   That happens when you are in a closed meeting  in perfectly good faith   That is why a transcript would protect Sara Taylor   It would protect Ms  Harriet Miers   It would protect the people who are being questioned      It is my hope we can yet work this out   Before taking the floor  I asked Senator Leahy if he would be willing to accept    he doesn t want to go as far as I do  and I can understand why he would insist on a transcript    I say I would like to have a transcript    but rather than have nothing  I would be willing to go into a closed session and have Senator Leahy question  Chairman Leahy question  Chairman Conyers question  and I question  some others question  to find out what we can   If at the end of that process we feel it is necessary to revert to subpoenas  we cannot  I think    but in any event should not    give up that power that resides with the legislative branch   I don t think we have the authority to give it up  but if we had the authority to give it up  I wouldn t want to give it up      But I want to pursue this matter and I want to get the information   When you talk about a criminal citation  a citation for criminal contempt  you are talking about a very serious matter   I have great empathy for the witnesses  Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers  who have been subjected to these subpoenas   If they assert executive privilege  and I agree that they are compelled to  I think once they are instructed by the President that the work they did for him is subject to his executive privilege  as he sees it  I think they have no choice   But when you bring a criminal contempt citation against Sara Taylor  people aren t going to understand she is an innocent pawn in the midst of this proceeding   If you bring a criminal contempt citation against anybody  there is an inference of some wrongdoing   You don t have a criminal charge customarily unless there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed   That is when you have a warrant of arrest   That is when you have an indictment   Of course  a contempt citation is different  but if you call it a citation for criminal contempt  that has a tarring effect which is very serious and which is very profound      The U S  attorney has to bring the charge  and the U S  attorney has discretion   It is not an automatic matter that if the Congress refers the issue for a criminal contempt citation  it is mandated   U S  attorneys have discretion as to what they do   They can bring it or not  depending upon their conclusions  upon their allocation of resources   And they can bring it on what they want to do   I could see how a U S  attorney might not want to spend a whole lot of time on this matter   I can see how the taxpayers of the United States wouldn t like to spend a whole lot of time on this matter   But that is where we are heading if this posturing continues     Most importantly  we will not find out the underlying facts on the request for the resignations of these U S  attorneys  and that is important to do so we can make a final evaluation by the Judiciary Committee as to what our conclusions are on this matter  and it would bear heavily on the continued service  the continued activity  by Attorney General Gonzales in holding that position
