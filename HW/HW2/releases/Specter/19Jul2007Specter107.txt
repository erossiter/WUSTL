    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  July 19  2007     U S  Senators Bob Casey  D PA  and Arlen Specter  R PA  and Representative Phil English  R 3rd  sent a letter to John Paul Woodley  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works  requesting that the Army Corps of Engineers include funding for Presque Isle in its fiscal 2009 budget recommendation  Past Corps budget proposals have failed to include funding for Presque Isle    The Members wrote  As the Army Corps moves forward with development of its fiscal 2009 budget we would like to respectfully request that you include funding for Presque Isle in Erie  Pennsylvania in your proposal for the Construction General Account      Inclusion of the project in the Corps budget proposal would provide local leaders with a better sense of the Corps commitment to the project and will assist the Pennsylvania delegation in their effort to secure funding for Presque Isle  The letter is part of a two pronged effort by the congressional delegation representing Erie County to maximize funding in both 2008 and 2009      The Army Corps and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources jointly administer a sand replenishment program to address erosion problem  The Corps has been working to prevent erosion of the Erie shoreline since 1824      While the recreational benefits of this project are well known  it is also important to note that Presque Isle plays an important role in reducing potential flood damage  Presque Isle is also essential to sustaining and protecting a unique ecosystem and a distinct bird sanctuary  they went on to write    Senator Casey  Senator Specter  and Congressman English are also working on a bi partisan basis to strengthen the federal commitment to the project in 2008  Senators Casey and Specter secured  1 million for Presque Isle in the U S  Senate Appropriations Committee as contained in the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill  Congressman English secured  500 000 in the House of Representatives Energy and Water Fiscal Year 2008 Appropriations Bill  Upon passage of the Senate version of the bill  House and Senate members will meet in a conference committee to determine the level of funding the project will receive in 2008  Senators Casey and Specter are committed to working with Congressman English to maximize the federal investment in the project  It is expected that legislation providing funding for Army Corps projects will be enacted sometime in the fall     Senator Casey also met yesterday with Assistant Secretary Woodley to discuss the importance of Presque Isle and other priority projects in Pennsylvania    Full text of the letter is included     Dear Assistant Secretary Woodley     As the Army Corps moves forward with development of its fiscal 2009 budget  we would like to respectfully request that you include funding for Presque Isle in Erie  Pennsylvania in your proposal for the Construction General account  Thank you in advance for your consideration of our views     Presque Isle State Park is a 3 200 acre sandy peninsula that arches into Lake Erie  While the recreational benefits of this project are well known  it is also important to note that Presque Isle plays an important role in reducing potential flood damage  Presque Isle is also essential to sustaining and protecting a unique ecosystem and a distinct bird sanctuary     Unfortunately  the beaches of Presque Isle are continually eroding  The Army Corps and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources jointly administer a sand replenishment program to address this problem  It is our understanding that the Corps has been working to prevent erosion of the Erie shoreline since 1824     Congress has provided over  3 5 million for this project since 2001  With enactment of the Revised Appropriations Continuing Resolution for fiscal 2007  P L  110 5   Congress granted the Corps the discretion to decide the level of federal investment in Presque Isle  The Corps only allocated  90 000 for this initiative  despite the fact that both the Senate and the House versions of the fiscal 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill would have provided for a significantly greater investment in this project     Many local officials associated with this project have also noted a connection between Presque Isle and the proposed dredging project at Conneaut Harbor in Ohio on Lake Erie  While we understand the funding constraints facing the Corps  we respectfully urge the Corps to investigate the possibility of utilizing sand taken from Conneaut on the beaches of Presque Isle consistent with all laws  rules  regulations  and necessary water quality and environmental protection certifications and permits     Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request  This project is a priority for each of us  Moving forward  we would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential methods for meeting Presque Isles sand replenishment needs     If you have any questions  comments  or concerns  please feel free to contact us directly or have your staff contact Ed Williams on Senator Caseys staff at 228 5135  Matt Kelly on Senator Specters staff at 224 8188  or David Stewart on
