    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  March 20  2007     U S  Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman John Tierney  D MA  today unveiled two bipartisan bills    one dealing with Senate races  the other focused on House contests    to restore public confidence in the Congressional elections process  Both bills would allow qualified candidates to receive campaign financing from a public fund instead of from lobbyists and other special interests     I am joining Senator Durbin in introducing legislation in the Senate to provide for public financing because I believe it will be a significant step in improving public confidence in the election process   said Specter   The public is understandably very distrustful of what happens in public life when there are contributions by interested parties in the political process in terms of whether that influences our official decisions   I think that it does not  but there is great public skepticism on that question and I think public financing will go a long way to restoring public confidence in the electoral system        Today the amount of money spent in top ten competitive Senate races averages  34 million per campaign    double what it was just four years ago  It takes a mountain of money    about  7 million on average    even to lose a Senate campaign  This is not sustainable     said Durbin     People who say the public shouldn  t have to pay for elections are missing the point   The American people already pay for elections    in ways that favor incumbents and special interests and in a Congressional agenda spawned too many times by those who finance our campaigns  Public financing will cost us only a fraction of what the current system costs          The legislation  known as the Fair Elections Now Act  would create a voluntary system that gives Senate candidates the option to stop dialing for dollars and attending fundraisers  without unilaterally disarming against a well financed opponent   For those who participate  fundraising would be limited to raising   seed money    in amounts of no more than  100 per person to pay for campaign start up costs   In addition  participating candidates would be required to demonstrate sufficient public support to merit Fair Elections funding by raising qualifying contributions of  5 each from a minimum number of state residents  based on the population of the state    Having demonstrated their viability  the candidates would be eligible to receive Fair Elections funds   This legislation establishes a formula for determining the level of public funding provided to qualifying candidates for the primary and general election cycles   The amount would vary based on the population of the state  with the allocation for the primary equaling two thirds of the allocation for the general election  The allocations would also be adjusted for the cost differences in the various media markets covering each state   Participants would receive vouchers for purchasing broadcast air time and would receive a 20  discount below the lowest unit cost on all advertising purchased near the end of the primary and general campaigns   The legislation is modeled after the Fair Elections type systems that have already been implemented at the state and local levels such as those in Arizona and Maine                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                                                                       Current record
