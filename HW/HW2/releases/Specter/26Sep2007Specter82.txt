    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases          Amendment Seeks to Shut Down National Drug Intelligence Center                       Washington  D C    Wednesday  September 26  2007     Today  Senator Arlen Specter  the longest serving Senator from Pennsylvania  took to the Senate floor to urge his colleagues to vote against an amendment  offered by Senator Coburn  R Okla   which seeks to shut down the National Drug Intelligence Center  NDIC  in Johnston  Pennsylvania     In his statement  Senator Specter touted the important work of the NDIC  as well as the value of its Johnstown location     Johnstown has the advantage of being much less expensive  being able to provide these vital Federal services for about one third of the cost  while being reasonably close to Washington  DC  which is the location of many of the other entities with which it cooperates  Specter said     The NDIC  established in 1993  provides strategic drug related intelligence  document and computer exploitation support  and training assistance to the drug control  public health  law enforcement  and intelligence communities of the United States  The highly regarded agency seeks to reduce adverse affects of drug trafficking  drug abuse  and other drug related criminal activity     The NDIC employs more than 340 federal employees and contract personnel in Johnstown and plays an important role in the regions economy and identity     The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment tomorrow     Below is Senator Specters floor statement     Mr  SPECTER  Mr  President  I have sought recognition to respond to the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma  Mr  Coburn  to eliminate the National Drug Intelligence Center  which is located in Johnstown  PA  That center was created in 1992 and performs a very important function  The National Drug Intelligence Center  commonly referred to as the NDIC  partners with the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement  to provide intelligence  to identify  track  and sever the nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism  The NDIC created an entity called HashKeeper  a company software program which is provided to the Federal Government for use in Iraq  The cost of this center is about one third of what it would be if it were located in the Washington  DC  area     I think it makes good sense to decentralize Federal functions to the extent it is possible and practical  Everything does not have to be located in Washington  DC  Everything does not have to be located in a big city  Our country is more vulnerable when everything is concentrated in one area     Johnstown has the advantage of being much less expensive  being able to provide these vital Federal services for about one third of the cost  while being reasonably close to Washington  DC  which is the location of many of the other entities with which it cooperates     The jobs which are provided are very substantial for my constituents in Pennsylvania  an obvious interest that I have as a Senator representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  These are several hundred jobs  they are very important  It is a legitimate interest to want to maintain our industrial base in Pennsylvania and to maintain governmental activities in Pennsylvania  But there is good value in having the NDIC function  in general  and there is extra good value in having it function in Johnstown  PA     The NDIC has been complimented by a broad number of agencies  In a November 21  2001  letter  the FBI praised the NDIC for its work on financial crimes  saying     Through the analysis of these documents  over 400 specific intelligence products have been produced for the FBI  the Department of Justice  the Department of Treasury  and U S  Attorney s Offices  The work NDIC produces continues to initiate actionable leads and identify avenues of investigation  NDIC has integrated seamlessly with the FBI investigation and has enhanced the way the FBI will investigate future financial cases     The participation of NDIC   continues to be invaluable     In a June 23  2006  letter  the Drug Enforcement Agency had this to say     The Fort Worth Resident Office    that is of DEA    amassed thousands of documents  but was unable to properly exploit the information they contained  The valuable report    referring to the NDIC report    caused several of the principals to negotiate pleas to pending charges  If not for the willingness of the members of NDIC to confront these challenges in a cooperative effort  this investigation would not have reached its current level of success     There have been many plaudits given to the NDIC by the special agents in charge of FBI offices  such as the FBI agent in charge of the Tampa Field Division  the FBI special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Division  the DEA special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Division  the FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte Division  and the DEA special agent in charge of the Oklahoma City District Office  This last is ironic  in a sense  In a March 25  2006  DEA cable  the DEA Oklahoma City District Office had this to say     In support of phases one and two  NDIC deployed two teams in Oklahoma  each consisting of one special agent  one computer exploitation and five document exploitation personnel  Actionable intelligence was generated and passed to the appropriate DEA offices  The OKCDO thanks all NDIC personnel    that is the Oklahoma City District Office thanks all NDIC personnel    who planned and participated in this operation  The intelligence and operational knowledge gained was beneficial to OKCDO  and its law enforcement partners        In concluding    the two most popular words in any speech    I acknowledge and respect the work the Senator from Oklahoma  Mr  Coburn  is doing  He and I have worked very closely in his almost 3 years in the Senate  I observed his work in the House of Representatives  and I know his work as a medical professional  I understand what he is doing in subjecting to an analytical eye Federal expenditures  But I do not believe he should target the NDIC     I concur that we ought to be holding down Federal expenditures  and I think that close scrutiny of all such projects is very much in the national interest  But I believe the facts are very strong in support of continued operation of the NDIC in Johnstown  PA


