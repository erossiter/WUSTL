    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  March 13  2007                      Today  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the Senate floor regarding the Department of Justice with respect to U S  Attorneys and the Inspector General  s report on the Federal Bureau of Investigation  s use of National Security Letters       The Senator  s floor statement follows    Madame President  I have sought recognition to comment about the events in the Department of Justice in the course of the past week  ten days  with respect to the requests for the resignations of seven United States Attorneys and the disclosures that the FBI was improperly using the National Security Letters      With respect to the matter about the request for recognition for resignations from the United States Attorneys  I believe it is important for the Judiciary Committee to proceed with its inquiry to find out exactly what happened      There is no doubt    I think it is undisputed    that the Attorney General has the authority to replace United States Attorneys  There is a serious question if they are replaced for improper motives  We know that when President Clinton was elected that one of the first acts in early 1993 when he took office was to replace all 93 of the United States Attorneys     I had occasion recently to discuss this with the Attorney General of Pennsylvania  Tom Corbett  who is a United States Attorney at that time for the Western District of Pennsylvania  He had a position in the United States Attorneys organization to make those telephone calls  and that was handled in due course  and nobody challenged the authority to replace United States Attorneys       Now questions have arisen as to whether United States Attorneys were replaced because    for example  the question has been raised as to the U S  Attorney Lam in the Southern District of California in San Diego whether she was replaced because her conviction of former Congressman   Duke  Cunningham  who is as you know serving an eight year sentence  whether she was about to investigate other people who were politically powerful      Ms  Lam was questioned about that  I asked her whether she considered the request for her resignation to be inappropriate and she said she was surprised by it   And I pressed her for her own conclusion  Well  I think we may need to do more by way of inquiry to examine what her performance ratings were to see if there was a basis for her being asked to resign      We had the situation with Mr  Cummins  who was a U S  Attorney in Arkansas  He received a telephone call which he then relayed to other United States Attorneys  And he did it on an e mail very shortly after the telephone call   And the questioning that I had for Mr  Cummins was what was said  The e mail did not contain the language of the caller from the Department of Justice  It had Mr  Cummins  sense  or feelings that it was a warning  After little discussion  one lawyer to another  he said  well  it may have been friendly advice   Well  that perhaps requires a little more analysis  if not a little more inquiry      Then we had the situation with the United States Attorney from New Mexico  where according to the news reports  and we have to find this out from the actual witnesses  where there had been concerns expressed by people in New Mexico as to whether he was doing his job properly  Those concerns  at least according to the press  and we have to find this out from the witnesses  those calls  according to members of the press  or according to what has been reported in the press  were relayed to White House officials and they passed them on to the Department of Justice  Well  we have to take a look at that      We have to ask ourselves the question as to whether there is impropriety in that  If the Department of Justice is to evaluate whether a United States Attorney ought to be retained  is it relevant as to what people think about him   The comments may require that we take a look at whether he was doing his job      Those are matters which we have yet to determine  So that when we have declarations made on the Senate Floor concluding  condemning the Department of Justice toys for what it has done  I would say that is premature      When the issue came up about the hearing  which was a week ago today  in my capacity as Ranking Member of the Committee  I was asked to waive the seven day rule and I agreed do so  I agreed to do so because I thought it was important to move ahead promptly  When Senator Leahy has raised the issue about other witnesses coming in I think he s correct on that      The issue is raised about bringing in form White House counsel Harriet Miers  The issue is raised about bringing in people from the Department of Justice  other people in the office of the White House Counsel   I think that ought to be done      I do not think it is necessary to subpoena them  We will see  Before subpoenas ought to be issued or before there even ought to be an issue raised about subpoenas we ought to make a determination as to whether people are willing to come in voluntarily  When you talk about subpoenas  the first public reaction is    Why do they have to be subpoenaed   Why don t they come in voluntarily   Do they have something to hide      Then the next question is  are they guilty of something  if they have to be subpoenaed   So let s proceed in the regular course of business      I was a District Attorney for some eight years and Assistant D A  before that and have been on the judiciary committee for 27 years  The regular way to do business is to ask people to come in  and if they refuse to come in  then you can talk about subpoenas and you can get tough  if it is necessary to do that   I regret I couldn t be here what Senator Schumer was on the floor earlier today   And he has made public statements about the Attorney General politicizing the office  Well  that may be Senator Schumer s opinion  his judgment  but let s get down to specific facts as to what is involved on the politicization   We are all working here in a political field       I frankly have a concern to see Senator Pete Domenici on the web site of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee   I have a little concern about some of the statements which have been made by members of this body rushing to judgment before we have had these witnesses in       There s been a request for witnesses from the Administration  from the White House   Well  why condemn the parties  why condemn the Department until we have found out what the facts are       My view  as I expressed last Thursday at the Executive Session  has been to tone down the rhetoric      We have now  on the heels of the issue of the request for resignations of the United States Attorneys  we have the disclosures that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had misused the national security letters  We gave them broader powers in the PATRIOT Act  We broadened the powers from cases involving foreign powers to national security matters generally  and we put in a provision as to exigent circumstances    that means an emergency  But we find at least preliminarily that the FBI used the exigent category more broadly  Some situations they were supposed to go back and get statements of probable cause with judicial authorization      We gave the F B I  these broader powers under the PATRIOT Act because of the importance of fighting terrorism   And that is a major problem in the United States today  an enormous problem worldwide  But we re concerned that where the FBI exercises these greater powers  that there be an appropriate regard for civil liberties  for constitutional rights   If it weren t for the fact that we inserted in the reauthorization the authority of the Inspector General to make these audits  we wouldn t have found out what was going on      So that in evaluating what the Department of Justice has done  I think it is important to look thoroughly at the issues raised by the Inspector General  It  s a thick volume  We  re going to need oversight hearings  Senator Leahy  Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  has already announced that  I think we may have to go further and consider changing the authority of the FBI under the PATRIOT Act  if they do not use the powers within the confines that the Congress has prescribed  the President has authorized  Then we may have to limit their power      So there are serious issues which confront the Department of Justice at this time  and the Judiciary Committee in its oversight capacity and its investigative capacity has the full authority and power to find out what the facts are  and we will speak plainly      I will have no hesitation in making a factually based judgment  if they have acted improperly  and let us see the background for the firing of these U S  Attorneys and let us see what the details are on the National Security Letters and what the Department of Justice does to correct the situation      I yield the floor                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Current record
