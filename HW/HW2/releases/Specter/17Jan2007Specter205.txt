    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  January 17  2007                      Today  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   spoke on the Senate floor today in reaction to the Administration  s announcement that   the electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program will now be conducted subject to the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      Senator Specter  s floor statement as delivered in reaction to letter from Attorney General Gonzales on the Terrorist Surveillance Program follows     I thank my colleagues for yielding this time  I have sought recognition to express my approval  I am glad to see that the Attorney General of the United States  in telephone calls to Senator Leahy and myself and now in letters  has advised that there is a new procedure to have the requests for wiretaps on al Qaida members submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  On December 16  the New York Times broke the story that there were wiretaps going on under a Presidential order without complying with the customary requirement that probable cause be established and submitted to the court  which would authorize the issuance of a warrant  to authorize the wiretap      On that day  Friday  we were in the final stages of floor debate on the PATRIOT Act  and the disclosure that morning that there were warrantless recordings going on was quite a shock and quite a problem  because I was managing that bill in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee      I said on the floor at that time that there was a clear cut violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  which provides that the Act is the exclusive way for having a wiretap for foreign intelligence surveillance  The President has sought to justify the surveillance under his article II inherent powers  That raises a complicated issue  which can only be determined by the courts by weighing the invasiveness of the wiretapping  invasiveness into privacy  contrasted with the importance of national security     Most of last year found this item as the No  1 priority of the Judiciary Committee and my No  1 priority as chairman  We had a series of hearings  four hearings  I introduced legislation to try to bring the program at that time under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act     The administration had refused to disclose the details of the program to the Judiciary Committee  They maintained that attitude consistently up until today  They finally did submit it  after a lot of pressure  to the Intelligence Committees  first a subcommittee of the Senate Intelligence Committee  then when the House resisted only a subcommittee  it was finally submitted to the full committees  really it was only submitted when the time came for the confirmation of General Hayden for Director of the CIA     I have not been privy to what was disclosed to the Intelligence Committee  but based on my chairmanship of that committee during the 104th Congress  I have some doubts as to the adequacy of the disclosure  I know when I was chairman  the chairman was supposed to be informed about those classified and secret programs  but that was in fact not the case     When the matter later moved into litigation and the Federal court in Detroit declared the surveillance program unconstitutional  and then the appeal was taken to the Sixth Circuit  I introduced substitute legislation  S  4051 last year  and I ve reintroduced it already this year  which would have provided for expedited review in the Federal courts and mandatory review by the Supreme Court  The bill also would have required individualized warrants for calls originating in the United States  because the administration had disclosed that  if there were changes made in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  there could be a warrant for all outgoing calls but not incoming calls because there were so many     I am glad to see that we may now have all of that resolved  We are not sure  I want to know the details of this program     Senator Leahy has already spoken on the subject today and has put into the Record a letter that he and I received today from the Attorney General  The key parts are as follows     I am writing to inform you that on January 10  2007  a Judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued orders authorizing the Government to target for collection international communications into or out of the United States where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization  As a result of these orders  any electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program will now be conducted subject to approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court     That language says there will be probable cause established  I think we need to know more about the procedures for the determination of probable case  whether it is on individualized warrants or it is a group program  We will need to know more about the determination of an individual being an agent of al Qaeda  and we will need to know more about what is meant by an associated terrorist organization  to see that probable cause has been established under the customary standards     The letter from the Attorney General goes on to say     In the spring of 2005  well before the first press account disclosing the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance Program  the Administration began exploring options for seeking such FISA Court approval      It would have been my hope that the Attorney General  in our oversight hearings  where he was called and asked about this program  would have made that disclosure  A lot of time and effort went into the Judiciary Committee hearings and went into the drafting of legislation  I personally met with the President last July 11 and secured his agreement to submit this program to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  For a variety of reasons  which I shall not detail now  that legislation did not move forward     Then  as I ve noted  there was substitute legislation when the Federal court in Detroit declared the program unconstitutional and the matter came before the Sixth Circuit     The Attorney General s letter says  as is appropriate  that the program will have  the speed and agility necessary to protect the Nation  from terrorist attack  and that has always been a major concern  that we be protected  but that we be protected with an appropriate balance  so that there not be an intrusive wiretap without the customary court approval     The Attorney General had advised me that there would be a meeting today  which I am just informed has been canceled  but there needs to be oversight beyond what has been disclosed in this letter     But at least there is a very significant first step  It is regrettable that these steps were not taken a long time ago  I would like to have an explanation as to why it took from the spring of 2005  and at least from December 16  2005  until now  when there has been such public furor and public concern     Further  the letter of the Attorney General says     Accordingly  under these circumstances  the President has determined not to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program when the current authorization expires      It would be my hope that the program is terminated now  since there is an alternative method which the Attorney General has announced  I do not know when the program will expire  They have it in place for 45 day periods  We do not know when the last one started  so we do not know when this one will end  But  with an alternative program in place  it ought to be terminated now  to have the regular procedures for the establishment of probable cause  to protect civil liberties  And  as the Attorney General says  to address concerns in taking care of the protection of the country
