    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  March 8  2007                      Today  Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   introduced two pieces of legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Services  IRS  Code of 1986      The first bill  S  813  changes the code to allow above the line deduction of the contingency fees portion of an award of damages   The second bill  S  814  amends the code to allow the deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense of attorney advanced expenses and court costs in contingency fee cases   Clients often seek contingent fee arrangements when they have a legal claim    Under these arrangements  clients contribute their cases and attorneys contribute their time  effort and expertise   When clients win a case or obtain a settlement  a portion of the recovery  typically one third  goes to the attorney   With certain exceptions  the IRS has always taken the position that  1  the entire recovery is includable in the income of the litigant and  2  the attorneys fees are deductible  if at all  as miscellaneous itemized deductions   This treatment is unfair and S 813 seeks to correct that   Because miscellaneous itemized deductions may be subject to certain limitations or are disallowed completely in calculating Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   there may be unfair hardship for many litigants  who never receive the portion that is paid to the attorney   Also  because the attorney also pays tax on the attorneys   fee award  there is essentially double taxation of this portion of any recovery   This legislation ensures equitable and fair treatment of the contingency fee portion of a taxable award in all types of litigation    The second piece of legislation  S  814  amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit attorneys to deduct payments of litigation expenses on behalf of contingency fee clients as an ordinary and necessary business expense   Currently the IRS deems these advances to be loans  so the attorney cannot deduct litigation related payments when they are made   Under the Specter legislation the payments would be treated as ordinary and necessary business expenses  allowing the attorney to receive the benefit of the tax deduction of the expenses as they are incurred  and recognize the income associated with those expenses if and when damages are recovered  This bill should encourage lawyers to represent individuals who may not be able to afford to pay an attorney or pay these costs         In his floor statement Specter illustrated the necessity of this tax code change    On a personal injury claim  the plaintiff frequently is without funds and can really only move forward with a litigation on a contingent fee   It is customary for the attorney to advance the costs of filing fees and whatever other costs there may be          He went on to say that    The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that those are loans from the attorney to the client and that is a complicated matter because under the cannons of ethics there is authority that an attorney may not loan money to the client    this legislation would make it explicit under the Internal Revenue Service Code that these advanced costs could be deducted                                                                    Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Current record
