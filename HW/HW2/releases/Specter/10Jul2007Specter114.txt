    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  July 10  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the floor of the Senate regarding habeas corpus    A copy of his remarks are below   Mr  President  I thank my distinguished colleague from Vermont  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  for his generous remarks   I compliment him on his leadership on the committee and for his work generally  but especially on our efforts to restore habeas corpus     The Great Writ has been the law since 1215 for Great Britain  and it has been the law of the United States of America since the founding of the Constitution   That writ allows someone in detention to receive evidence of a reason for detention before the detention can continue  Regrettably  the legislation in the Military Commissions Act  passed last year  eliminated the writ of habeas corpus       I offered an amendment last September  which was defeated narrowly 48 to 51  and then on December 5  2006   Again on January 4 of this year  with the new Congress  I reintroduced legislation to bring back the writ of habeas corpus     We have on the detainees in Guantanamo a procedure on what is called the Combat Status Review Board   The procedures there are fundamentally unfair in not establishing any colorable reason for detention   That has been demonstrated in a variety of contexts     One which I would quote at the outset is an opinion which appears in 355 F  Supp  443  in a case captioned  In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases   where the court comments about the procedures in the case captioned  Boumediene v  Bush    This involves an individual  a detainee  who was charged with associating with alQaida   This is what the transcript says      Detainee   Give me his name               Tribunal President   I do not know               Detainee   How can I respond to this     Then the detainee goes on to comment about his inability to respond to the charges that he associated with someone from alQaida because he does not have any way to identify the  individual with whom he was supposed to have associated   Nobody could even give him his name     At one point the detainee comments about his difficulty in responding to a charge when there is no charge  and as the opinion says  everyone in the tribunal laughs   The court notes the laughter reflected in the transcript is understandable   This exchange might have been truly humorous had the consequences of the detainee s enemy combatant status not been so terribly serious and had the detainee s criticism of this process not been so piercingly accurate     But here is a case reported where the Combat Status Review Board upheld detention when they could not even tell the detainee the identity of the person who was supposedly an alQaida person with whom he was supposed to have been associated     There has been considerable comment about the fundamentally unfair tactics in the Combat Status Review Board  but none came into sharper focus than the declaration of LTC Stephen Abraham  who worked on the Combat Status Review Board  and who found  with some substantial detail  the process was fundamentally flawed   Results were influenced by pressure from superiors rather than based on concrete evidence     I ask unanimous consent  Mr  President  that the text of the declaration of LTC Stephen Abraham be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks to permit me to abbreviate the length of this floor statement     The PRESIDING OFFICER   Without objection  it is so ordered     Mr  SPECTER   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia came down with the decision in the Boumediene case saying that the act of Congress was effective in eliminating habeas corpus  but in so doing  the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia really ignored the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Rasul v  Bush     To read the opinion of the Court of Appeals  for a student of the law  is not hard to understand  it is impossible to understand   I think a fair reading of the circuit opinion  simply stated  is that they flagrantly disregarded the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States  which under our system of laws they are obligated to uphold   They analyzed Rasul and said Rasul was based on the statute providing for habeas corpus and not on the constitutional mandate that habeas corpus is a part of the Constitution of the United States     There can be no doubt that habeas corpus is a constitutional mandate because the Constitution explicitly states that habeas corpus may be suspended only in time of invasion or rebellion  and no one contends that we have either invasion or rebellion   The opinion of Rasul is explicit     Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that relevant portions of the Rasul opinion be printed in the Record following my statement       The PRESIDING OFFICER   Without objection  it is so ordered     Mr  SPECTER   Without taking the time to read them into the Record now because they are apparent on their face that the opinion by Justice Stevens goes through the chronology of the writ  starting with King John at Runnymede in 1215 and running through the adoption of the constitutional provision in the U S  Constitution     Now  it is true there is also a statute which provides for a writ of habeas corpus   The Court of Appeals said the portion of Justice Stevens  opinion as to the constitutional basis for habeas corpus was dictum and that the holding involved the statute   The Court of Appeals says since the holding involved the statute  the statute could be changed   It is true the statute was changed by the Congress of the United States  but the Congress of the United States  by statute  cannot change the constitutional mandate of habeas corpus     For the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to say the constitutional basis for habeas corpus in Rasul was not the holding but only the statute was the holding is  simply stated  ridiculous   It is insulting to the Supreme Court of the United States for what the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did   Pretty harsh words  but accurate words  and I say them with respect for every court   But as a lawyer who has worked with the Constitution for a number of decades  it was hard for me to comprehend how the District of Columbia Court of Appeals could come to that conclusion   But they did   Well  I think it is about to be corrected     There has been a curious history on the petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia   There were only three votes for the original petition for a writ of certiorari  which surprised people because Justice Stevens did not vote for certiorari   But  instead  he joined with Justice Kennedy in an opinion saying they would await another appeal from the Combat Status Review Board   The speculation by the analysts was that Justice Stevens was reluctant to see certiorari granted because Rasul might be overruled     But then after the declaration of LTC Stephen Abraham appeared in the public press  there was a petition for reconsideration of the writ of certiorari   On this occasion  it was granted in a very unusual procedure   It made the front pages   I have studied the Constitution for a long time  and I did not know that a petition for reconsideration on a writ of certiorari takes five votes   Perhaps my distinguished colleague from Vermont knew that  I asked that question of quite a few lawyers   I have not found one yet  and some very learned in constitutional law who knew if you petition for reconsideration on a writ of certiorari  it takes five votes     Mr  LEAHY   Mr  President  if the Senator will yield on that point  when I saw that in the press I went and looked it up too   It was a surprise to me   It will be interesting to see what might come out of it  but I think it goes back  though  to what the Senator and I have talked about   We should not have to be bucking this to the Supreme Court for them to decide   We should correct the error here     I will be leaving the floor at this moment  Mr  President  but I want to assure the Senator from Pennsylvania  when they do allow our amendment to come up  I will be here with him proudly side by side on this issue   We can correct what otherwise would become a historic mistake   With his help  his leadership  we will do that     Mr  SPECTER   Mr  President  I thank my colleague from Vermont for those comments   I do not think there is a more important issue to come before this body   What happens in Iraq  obviously  is of enormous importance   But if we lose the basic fundamental rights to require evidence before somebody is held in detention  if we lose the right of habeas corpus  it is a very sad day in America     But  in any event  now the Supreme Court of the United States has granted certiorari in the Boumediene case   The speculation is that Justice Kennedy was the fifth vote  along with Justice Stevens   They do not tell you who the five votes are  but we know there were three votes initially from Justice Souter and Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg granting it  voting to grant certiorari before  and Justice Stevens and Justice Kennedy writing a separate opinion  and the other four Justices voting to deny certiorari     So I think this case is headed to the Supreme Court of the United States for reversal by the opinion by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia   But I believe the Congress should act in the interim   That is why Senator Leahy and I are pressing this issue on the Department of Defense authorization bill   I hope it will not be cited as grounds for veto if we are successful in putting this amendment through   We cannot offer it yet because there is an amendment pending  and the request to set the amendment aside  which requires unanimous consent  was objected to   But this is a very important amendment   The procedures in Guantanamo under the Combat Status Review Board are woefully inadequate  do not satisfy the requirements of the Supreme Court of the United States in having a collateral proceeding which is adequate to protect the rights of someone who is in detention     So when we are permitted to offer the amendment  we will do so   But I ask my colleagues to consider the background as to what has happened here  the importance of it and its abrogation  what is happening with Guantanamo  the disrepute there  and what is happening with the Combat Status Review Board so that the Congress can correct what I consider to be an error made last year and stand up and not await a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States     I thank the Chair  and I yield the floor
