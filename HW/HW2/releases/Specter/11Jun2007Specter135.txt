    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Monday  June 11  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the floor of the Senate regarding S J  Res  14  the Resolution of   No Confidence    in Attorney General Gonzales    A copy of the floor statement is pasted below    I have sought recognition to speak about the resolution of no confidence on Attorney General Gonzales   This resolution poses many currents and cross currents and many overlapping currents and cross currents  And I have written down five of the currents which I believe are involved in the analysis of this issue      First  have I lost confidence in Attorney General Gonzales   Second  is this resolution politically motivated  Third  does Senator Schumer have a conflict of interest  Fourth  will this resolution likely lead to the departure of Attorney General Gonzales or give him more reason to stay on  And fifth  is the principal reason for this resolution to help the Department of Justice or to embarrass Republicans   It is an interrelationship and a wing of these various considerations which has led to my own conclusion on this resolution      First of all  have I lost confidence in Attorney General Gonzales  Absolutely  yes   Attorney General Gonzales has made representations which are false  He said he was not involved in discussions  He was contradicted by three of his top aides and by documentary evidence  e  mails   He said he was not involved in deliberations   Again  he was contradicted by three top aides and documentary evidence    the e mails   He said he was not involved in the memoranda which were circulated on this matter    again  contradicted by three top aides and documentary evidence      He said that the terrorist surveillance program brought no objection within the Department of Justice  And we find  on examination  that there were serious dissents within the Department of Justice on the constitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program  so much so that Alberto Gonzales  when he served as White House counsel  was one of those who went to the hospital room of then  Attorney General John Ashcroft to get the attorney general  Ashcroft  to certify that the program was constitutional      So there is no doubt in my mind that there is no confidence which is residing in Attorney General Gonzales   This is much more than a personal matter  This is a matter for the administration of the Department of Justice  which is second only to the Department of Defense on the welfare of the people of the United States      The Department of Justice has the responsibility for investigating terrorism and anti terrorism  has the responsibility for enforcing our drug laws  and has the responsibility for enforcing federal laws on violent crime and on white collar crime      The attorney general has the responsibility for supervising 93 U S  attorneys around the country who have very  very important positions  something that I know something about in some detail  since I was the district attorney of Philadelphia for some eight years   And there is no doubt that the department at the present time is in shambles      The Attorney General called me before his hearing came up and asked for my advice  And I said  set out the reasons why you asked these individuals to resign    just set out the reasons why   He did not do so   The day after a very tempestuous hearing in the Judiciary Committee  he called me again and asked for my advice as to what he ought to do   And I said  Al  you still haven t responded as to why you asked these people to resign     I took the position  at that time  and I take the position at the present time that I m not going to ask the president to fire Attorney General Gonzales   That s a matter for the president to decide   I m not going to let the president tell me how to vote and I m not going to say to him how he ought to run the executive branch on grounds of separation of power   And similarly  with Attorney General Gonzales  as to what he does  that is a personal decision for him to make   But I have been very emphatic in the Judiciary Committee hearings  as we have investigated this matter  that I think the attorney general has not done the job and that the Department of Justice would be much better off without him     The second question that I look at is  is this resolution politically motivated   And I think that it certainly is   This ties in on the cross current as to whether Senator Schumer has a conflict of interest   And I believe he does   And I said so to Senator Schumer  eyeball to eyeball  confronting him in the Judiciary Committee meeting     The day after New Mexico s U S  attorney  David Iglesias  testified about a conversation that Iglesias had with Senator Domenici  the Democratic campaign committee posted on the Web site criticisms of Senator Pete Domenici   The following day the Democratic fund raising apparatus  led by Senator Schumer  published a fund raising letter   And there s no doubt about that conflict of interest     Senator Schumer has been designated to lead the investigation because he s the chairman of the relevant subcommittee   So I think there is no doubt about the overtone of heavy politicization and the conflict of interest     Will this resolution    the third consideration I have is whether it will likely lead to the departure or give the attorney general a reason to stay on   My own hunch is that the thrust of the resolution  if it really seeks his ouster  is going to be a boomerang and is going to be counterproductive     My own sense is that there is no confidence in the attorney general on this side of the aisle  but that the views will not be expressed in this format   Already  some who have called for his resignation on the Republican side of the aisle have said they will not vote for this resolution   Others have declined to comment about his capacity but have said that this is not the proper way to proceed  that our form of government does not have a no confidence vote     Is the principal reason for this resolution to help the Department of Justice or to embarrass Republicans   I think clear cut it is designed to embarrass Republicans   It s designed to embarrass Republicans if the Senate says if we have    the Senate has    no confidence in the attorney general   And it s designed to embarrass Republicans who vote against the motion to invoke cloture because it will be a  gotcha  30 second commercial in later campaigns   It will be used to say that whoever votes against the motion to invoke cloture is sanctioning the conduct of Attorney General Gonzales and anybody who votes against the motion to invoke cloture is going to be the recipient of those 30 second  gotcha  commercials     Now  there are many reasons to vote against the cloture motion   One reason is    and a dominant reason is    that the Senate has a lot more important things to do than to engage in this debate on this issue     Thursday night  the majority leader took down the immigration bill   Regrettably  he had cause to  because the Republican senators who had objected to the immigration bill wouldn t allow any amendments to come up   They wouldn t allow their amendments   they didn t step forward with their amendments nor would they allow others to offer amendments   But we were on the verge of getting a list   Took a little more time   The majority leader took down the bill     But the national interest would be a lot better served had we continued with the bill on Friday or perhaps on Saturday    we could work on a Saturday    or returned to the bill today or still return to the bill today instead of taking up this resolution     Another reason why people could justifiably vote against cloture is because the investigation is not completed   That is still hanging fire  so why have the resolution before we finish our investigation     There is another reason    that the Constitution  arguably  expresses the way to deal with Attorney General Gonzales  and that is by impeachment  that it s not in line to have a resolution of disapproval   That s the British system  a system of no confidence     It is my sense that many on this side of the aisle  if not most  if not almost all will vote against cloture here because there are ample reasons to vote against cloture     But as I look at this matter as which is the most    more weighty  the more compelling  the more important    candidly stating that I have no confidence in Attorney General Gonzales or rejecting the outright political chicanery which is involved in this resolution offered by the Democrats    I come down on the side that the interests of the country and moving for improvements in the Department of Justice is to make a candid statement that I have no confidence in the Attorney General  which I have said repeatedly   It s no surprise   And I m going to deal with this resolution on the merits and vote to invoke cloture     I yield the floor                                                                 Browse by
