    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  December 5  2007     Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  took to the Senate floor to address Senator Reids comments yesterday on the Senate floor that President Bush is the man who is pulling the strings on the 49 puppets he has here in the Senate     When the majority leader makes a proposal and asks for Republican assistance  many of us have been willing to listen to what he has to say  Specter said  But he doesn t improve his case when he starts calling us puppets  I wonder if he is up to the job when he resorts to that kind of a statement  which only furthers the level of rancor and insults and animosity with that kind of an insulting comment     In his speech  Senator Specter suggests that Senator Reids comments violate a section of Rule 19 of the Standing Rules of the Senate that states  No Senator in debate shall  directly or indirectly  by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator    A copy of Senator Specters floor statement is below     Mr  SPECTER  Mr  President  I have sought recognition to comment about a statement made by the majority leader  Senator Harry Reid  yesterday that        President Bush  he is the man who is pulling the strings on the 49 puppets he has here in the Senate     I have had my staff advise his staff that I intended to make some comments about that so he would be notified and could come to the floor if he chose to do so  His office is right adjacent to the floor  He is a minute or 2 away  I believe that is a very inappropriate statement     I refer to rule XIX of the Senate rules  which provides     No Senator in debate shall  directly or indirectly  by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator     It is my view that being called a puppet is in direct violation of that rule  I don t think there is much doubt about it  That is a term of derision  of ridicule  of censure  and it is an opprobrious term to make that statement     I am especially concerned about it because in the immediate past there have been many Senators who have directly disagreed with the President    hardly puppets of President Bush or hardly puppets of anyone  Under our Constitution  the separation of powers makes the Congress separate from the executive branch and from the courts  That separation and that independence is something that Senators prize so very highly  So I don t take it lightly  and I don t think the other 48 of my colleagues take it lightly to be called puppets     Let s look at the record  Within the past month  on November 8  35 Republicans voted to override President Bush s veto of the Water Resources and Development Act  The veto was overridden  35 disagreed with the President  It hardly sounds like there are 35 puppets there to vote to override the President s veto     On April 11  18 Republicans joined in support of the Stem Cell Enhancement Act of 2007  That is an issue that this Senator has worked on extensively since 1998  when stem cells first came upon the scene  and I was chairing the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services  We have had some 20 hearings  Twice we enacted legislation to authorize the use of Federal funds for embryonic stem cell research  It doesn t sound like the 18 Senators who bucked the President s position are puppets     On November 13  less than a month ago  17 Republican Senators voted to support the SCHIP program  which the President was on record as opposing  He didn t like the amount of money that was involved with children s health  On November 7  10 Republican Senators voted in support of passage of the Labor  Health  Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  despite the President s promised veto  He did veto it     So here you have 4 situations readily at hand  where 35  18  17  and 10 Republican Senators disagreed with the President  It doesn t sound like the Senators are puppets in that context     Yesterday Senator Reid also complained about the necessity to file cloture some 56 times  Well  each time cloture was filed  there is a complex story behind the cloture  On a good many of those occasions  cloture was filed and the so called tree was filled  which precluded Senators from offering amendments  There was a time when Senators proudly said that any Senator could offer any amendment on any bill at any time  There might be some limitations postcloture on germaneness or on some rules  but a practice has developed in this body to foreclose that  The jargon is the filling the tree  and when the tree is filled  nobody can offer an amendment     Regrettably  that has been done by Republicans as well as Democrats  When it is hard to affix blame around here for the logjam  for our inability to get much done  you can usually divide it 50 50 between the parties  So to say Senator Reid has had to file cloture on 56 occasions doesn t tell you very much     Then the issue he took up yesterday in filing for cloture on the AMT  alternative minimum tax  Senator Reid filed for cloture on the House bill  which stands very little chance of passing the Senate because it is fully offset with controversial revenue raisers  Now it is true that Senate Democrats offered to remove the offsets but to keep them in place for the tax extenders  The Republican position has been that it is illogical to use permanent tax increases to offset a temporary extension of current tax policy  So there is a good reason for what is being done here     There is no doubt the AMT has to have a fix  If it is not done  there will be some 23 million Americans who will be taxed instead of the 3 million now  So we are all dedicated to that proposition  If you take a look at the Record on August 2 of this year  I offered an amendment to the small business tax relief bill to repeal the 1993 AMT rate increase     On July 20  2007  I voted in support of a Kyl amendment to the educational reconciliation bill  which fully repealed the AMT     On March 23 of this year  I voted in support of a Lott amendment to the budget resolution that would have allowed for repeal of the 1993 AMT rate increase     Again  on the same day  March 23  I voted in support of a Grassley amendment to the budget resolution that would have allowed the full repeal of the AMT     The same day  I voted in support of the Sessions amendment to the budget resolution that would have allowed families to deduct personal exemptions when calculating their AMT liability     The Record is full of good faith efforts to solve this problem  But as indicated  as stated  the course which the majority leader has taken is unsatisfactory to people on this side of the aisle  Whether it is satisfactory or unsatisfactory  it is not appropriate to call 49 Republican Senators puppets  We are trying to move through the business of the year    the people s business  We have 2 1 2 weeks  Not a whole lot has been done  We were in on Monday  no votes  In yesterday  one noncontroversial vote  We didn t come in until noon today     I have been around here a substantial period of time and I wonder how we are going to get through all of the unfinished appropriations bills and the many other matters that are pending on the calendar  When the majority leader makes a proposal and asks for Republican assistance  many of us have been willing to listen to what he has to say  But he doesn t improve his case when he starts calling us puppets  I wonder if he is up to the job when he resorts to that kind of a statement  which only furthers the level of rancor and insults and animosity with that kind of an insulting comment     I would be interested in the majority leader s reply  if he cares to make one  I will be near by the Senate floor     I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum
