    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  August 1  2007     Senator Arlen Specter  the Ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  submitted the following statement into the Congressional Record today     I have sought recognition to comment on proposed legislation to revise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to facilitate the electronic surveillance of targets reasonably believed to be outside the United States in order to obtain foreign intelligence information relating to international terrorism  When the Act was passed in 1978  communications outside the United States were characteristically transmitted via satellite and were not covered by the Act which applied to wires  In the intervening 29 years  such communications now travel by wire and are covered by the Act     The civil and constitutional rights of U S  persons would not ordinarily be involved in electronic surveillance of targets outside the United States  If persons inside the United States were surveilled while targeting outside the United States  then the minimization procedures would reasonably protect civil and constitutional rights of persons inside the United States     As the Director of National Intelligence  Michael McConnell  outlined the current threat  there is an urgent need to enact this legislation promptly  certainly before the Congress adjourns for the August recess  Such modifications to FISA should have been enacted long ago and legislation has been pending for months as proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and myself     I am concerned by provisions of the proposed legislation which would give extensive authority to the Attorney General  Regrettably  Attorney General Gonzales does not enjoy the confidence of many  if not most  Members of Congress  There is in the Congress generally considerable skepticism about the Administrations Terrorist Surveillance Program because it was kept secret for so long and concerns continue to be expressed that some portions have still not been adequately explained to the public  even where that might be done consistent with national security     There has been considerable discussion among members of the Senate raising at a minimum serious concerns and  beyond that  objections to giving Attorney General Gonzales any additional  even if temporary  authority     Discussions have been undertaken with the Director of National Intelligence to substitute his position for that of the Attorney General  or  in the alternative  to substitute the Secretary of Homeland Security or some other official outside of the Department of Justice who has been confirmed by the Senate     I am putting these concerns on the record now so that they may be considered and resolved at the earliest time so that legislation can be concluded before Congress adjourns for the August recess                                                                   Browse by                                                                                                                                                      Current record
