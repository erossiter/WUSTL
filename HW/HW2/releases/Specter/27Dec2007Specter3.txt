    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases            As Interviewed on MSNBC                            Thursday  December 27  2007     Islamabad  Pakistan   Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter responded to the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  Senator Specter is traveling in Pakistan and was scheduled to meet with Bhutto the night of her assasination  He spoke via phone with MSNBC  A transcript of the interview is below    HALL  On the phone with us now is Senator Arlen Specter  who is in Islamabad and was  according to what I m being told  expected to meet with Benazir Bhutto sometime tonight     Senator  are you there     SPECTER  I am     Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I were scheduled to meet with Benazir Bhutto this evening  We were scheduled to go to a dinner with President Musharraf  We had met with President Musharraf earlier today and  en route to the dinner  about ready to go  we heard the tragic news     HALL  And how did you learn the news  sir     SPECTER  Watching CNN  We heard  first  that there had been a suicide bomber attempt  that Benazir Bhutto was OK  Then we heard she d been hurt  critically  and then the news came in that it had been fatal     HALL  And tell us a little bit about what you were planning to meet with her regarding  We know that Hamid Karzai met with her  as well as Pervez Musharraf  on the security issue concerning the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan     What was the focus of your meeting      SPECTER  Well  Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I are in the region  We had been to Israel on our way to Syria  And we had meetings with President Musharraf today  and we also saw Afghanistan President Karzai  who just coincidentally was in town     And we had a meeting with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto this evening at nine o clock Pakistan time  and it was scheduled then because she had a full day of campaigning     And our concerns are about what is happening here  the stability  what s happening with the supreme court  what s happening with our fight against terrorism  our efforts to capture Osama Bin Laden  and what is happening to the very substantial funding the United States has put in here  what the prospects were for the election     I ve known Benazir Bhutto for the better part of two decades  having been visiting her in Karachi back in 1988 and when she was prime minister in 1995  And we were looking forward to talking to her to get to her evaluation on whether the elections would be honest and open  and to get her sense of the situation      HALL  And what did you think her    the impact that she played while  of course  she was alive  with her opposition group  and now with her assassination     Obviously  you felt that she was importance  a critical piece of this puzzle  in that you were planning to meet with her at 9 p m   at the time there      SPECTER  Well  Benazir Bhutto was a very prominent person this year  the leader of a major party  had a real opportunity to become prime minister  a brilliant woman with a family background  Her father had been prime minister  She had been prime minister twice     She had a lot of popular support  and she was the first woman prime minister of Pakistan and a very prominent woman internationally  sort of  the symbol of modernity  so that it s a tremendous loss  and we        HALL  And what do you think is the        SPECTER      we can t let the terrorists win  We have to rebound and we have to be sure that democracy moves forward in Pakistan      HALL  But Senator  we re looking at the images out of Pakistan  and I don t want to paint a picture bleaker than it is  but certainly  immediately following the assassination  people spilling out into the streets blaming  some of them  anyway  Pervez Musharraf    quite a picture of instability     What needs to happen  in your opinion  being there      SPECTER  Well  it is easy to blame people  but it s premature  There has to be an investigation  There has to be determination  to the extent possible  as to what happened     When you have an assassination  this sort of a violent act  you have to expect people to be erupting in the streets  But there will be a tomorrow  There will be elections here  We have to assert the democratic process and we have to move forward     We cannot let the crazy suicide bombers take over the world  And that is our job for tomorrow      HALL  And still very early into this breaking news  Senator    again  to update our audience  we are following developments in Pakistan in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  Senator Arlen Specter was expected to meet with her this evening     Senator Specter  the impact    so many people are wondering  with Pakistan being so crucial to this war on terror  that there may perhaps be a vacuum in that country  now  with the assassination having taken place and this could offset all of the work  the  10 billion that s been put into Pakistan and the support of Pervez Musharraf since 9 11      SPECTER  Well  we are not going to allow this incident  tragic as it is  to upset the very important work at hand  You have the Pakistani government working with the United States government  They have been allies of ours     We have not been pleased with some of the things that they have done  like having the chief justice under house arrest or having an emergency suspension  which has been eliminated     But the elections are going forward and we are going to rebound from this event and do what is necessary to defeat the terrorists and to have the democratic elections  We are not going to give in     And we will rebound  and stability will be restored after the outbursts which are present tonight  It may take some time  but we re going to win      HALL  Senator  do you have confidence in Pervez Musharraf and the job that he s done and doing      SPECTER  I do have confidence  When Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I met with him today  we raised a number of our concerns in a very candid discussion     We are concerned that the substantial U S  funding be directed toward the specific purposes of fighting terrorism  And we are checking to see if some of it might have been diverted     But by and large  we think the monies are going in the right direction  We expressed concern about what is happening with the supreme court here  We expressed concern about the state of emergency  but that has been reversed     The elections are going forward and he is our best hope there  It is not a perfect situation  Nothing is  But we have to utilize the government which is here to help stabilize it and to move forward      HALL  All right  Senator Arlen Specter from Islamabad     Thank you very much  Senator  for your time  just on the very day you were expected to meet with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto     Thank you  Senator
