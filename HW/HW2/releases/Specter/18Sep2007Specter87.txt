    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  September 18  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  today spoke on the Senate floor regarding an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that he and Senator Leahy  D Vt   introduced yesterday entitled Restoration of Habeus Corpus for those Detained by the United States     The amendment is currently pending before the Senate and a cloture vote is expected tomorrow  Wednesday  at approximately 10 30 a m    Below is a copy of Senator Specters floor statement follows      Mr  President  I have sought recognition to comment on the amendment to restore the constitutional right of habeas corpus    an amendment that is pending before the Senate and will be voted on tomorrow morning at 10 30 on a motion to invoke cloture       The issue of the availability of habeas corpus for the detainees at Guantanamo is a matter of enormous importance  It is a matter of a fundamental constitutional right that people should not be held in detention unless there is an evidentiary reason to do so  or at least some showing that the person ought to be in detention  It is a constitutional right that has existed since the Magna Carta in 1215  and it has been upheld in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of the United States       In the decision of Hamdi v  Rumsfeld  Justice O Connor  speaking for a plurality  said that they all agree that  absent suspension  the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States  What Justice O Connor was referring to was the express constitutional provision in Article I  Section 9  Clause 2  that habeas corpus may not be suspended except in time of invasion or rebellion  Obviously  if there cannot be a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus  there is a provision in that clause recognizing the existence of the constitutional right of habeas corpus  You cannot suspend a right that doesn t exist       As amplified by Justice Stevens  in the case of Rasul v  Bush  the statutory right to habeas corpus applies to those held at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  Although Guantanamo Bay is not within the territory of the United States  it is under the complete jurisdiction and control of the United States       In that case  Justice Stevens noted that application of the  writ of  habeas corpus to persons detained at the base is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus  At common law  courts exercised habeas jurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained within sovereign territory of the realm  as well as the claims of persons detained in the so called  exempt jurisdiction   where ordinary writs did not run  and all other dominions under the sovereign s control  That is obviously a conclusive statement of the Supreme Court that in Guantanamo  under the control of the United States  the writ of habeas corpus would apply in accordance with the historic reach of habeas corpus under the common law  Although Justice Stevens wrote as to statutory habeas  his historic analysis implicates the right to habeas under the common law and the Constitution      Justice Stevens went on to point out  Habeas corpus is  however  citing from Williams v     Kaiser  a writ antecedent to statute      throwing its root deep into the genius of our common law       And continuing  he said that the writ had received explicit recognition in the Constitution  which forbids suspension of   t he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus    unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it        Obviously  the exceptions  Rebellion or Invasion do not apply in the Guantanamo situation       Justice Stevens went on to say   A t its historical core  the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention  and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest       Justice Stevens then went on to note this    referring to the opinion of Justice Jackson  concurring in the result in the case of Brown v  Allen  The historic purpose of the writ has been to relieve detention by executive authorities without judicial trial       And he goes on to say  Executive imprisonment has been considered oppressive and lawless since John  at Runnymede  pledged that no free man should be imprisoned  dispossessed  outlawed  or exiled save by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land  The judges of England developed the writ of habeas corpus largely to preserve these immunities from executive restraint       Going on  Justice Stevens pointed out  Consistent with the historic purpose of the writ  this Court has recognized the federal court s power to review applications for habeas corpus in a wide variety of cases involving Executive detention  in wartime as well as in times of peace       In a very curious decision  in Boumediene v  Bush  the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ignored the historic common law analysis of the Rasul case in concluding that the Supreme Court s decision was based solely upon the statutory provision for habeas corpus  The Boumediene court reasoned that Rasul could be changed by an act of Congress  the Military Commissions Act  which was passed in 2006  In that case  instead of looking to Rasul  as noted in the New York Times article by Adam Liptak on March 5 of this year  the Boumediene court looked to case law decided before Rasul  Liptak points out  Instead of looking to Rasul  which was recent and concerned Guantanamo  the appeals court  reverting to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  justified its decision by citing a 1950 Supreme Court decision  Johnson v  Eisentrager  That case involved German citizens convicted of war crimes in China and held at a prison in Germany  The court ruled that they had no right to habeas corpus       Liptak points out the inapplicability of the Eisentrager case  stating  The Court s reliance on Eisentrager was curious  Both Antonin Scalia  dissenting in Rasul  and John Yu  an architect of the Bush administration s post 9 11 legal strategy  have written that they understood Rasul to have overruled Eisentrager       The Boumediene decision seemed to ignore the finding in Rasul that the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay fell within the jurisdiction and control of the United States  If detainees at Guantanamo Bay fall within United States jurisdiction  as Rasul found  the aliens held at Guantanamo have a greater claim to habeas corpus rights  For example  Courts have held that aliens within the United States cannot be denied habeas corpus without violating the Suspension Clause       Following its discussion of Rasul and Eisentrager  the Boumediene decision relied upon the proceedings in the Combatant Status Review Tribunals which  realistically viewed  are totally insufficient  The procedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were taken up by the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia in a case captioned  In re Guantanamo Detainees Cases  355 F Supp 2d 443  2005        Beginning on page 468 of the opinion  the district court noted a proceeding in the Combatant Status Review Tribunal where an individual was accused of associating with al Qaida personnel  The court noted      T he Recorder of the  Combatant Status Review Tribunal  asserted  While living in Bosnia  the Detainee associated with a known Al Qaida operative The detainee then said  Give me his name  The Tribunal President said  I do not know  The detainee then said  How can I respond to this  The detainee went on to say     I asked the interrogators to tell me who this person was  Then I could tell you if I might have known this person  but not if this person is a terrorist  Maybe I knew this person as a friend  Maybe it was a person that worked with me  Maybe it was a person that was on my team  But I do not know if this person is Bosnian  Indian or whatever  If you tell me the name  then I can respond and defend myself against this accusation       Later in the court s opinion  the detainee is quoted to the following effect  That is it  but I was hoping you had evidence that you can give me  If I was in your place    and I apologize in advance for these words    but if a supervisor came to me and showed me accusations like these  I would take these accusations and I would hit him in the face with them  And at that  everyone in the tribunal room burst into laughter       This is illustrative of what goes on in the Combatant Status Review Tribunals  They charge someone with being an associate of al Qaida  but they cannot even give the person a name       There was a very informative declaration filed by Stephen Abraham about what goes on in a Combatant Status Review Tribunal       I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks this declaration       Colonel Abraham identified himself as a lieutenant colonel in the U S  Army Reserves who served as a member of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal and had an opportunity to observe and participate in the CSRT process       Among other things  Colonel Abraham points out  On one occasion  I was assigned to a CSRT panel with two other officers    We reviewed evidence presented to us regarding the recommended status of a detainee  All of us found the information presented to lack substance       What were purported to be specific statements of fact lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence  Statements allegedly made by percipient witnesses lacked detail  Reports presented generalized statements in indirect and passive forms without stating any source of the information or providing a basis for establishing the reliability or the credibility of the source  Statements of interrogators presented to the panel offered inferences from which we were expected to draw conclusions favoring a finding of enemy combatant but that  upon even limited questioning from the panel  yielded the response from the Recorder  We ll have to get back to you  The personal representative did not participate in any meaningful way       On the basis of the paucity and weakness of the information provided both during and after the CSRT hearing  we determined that there was no factual basis for concluding that the individual should be classified as an enemy combatant       The details of Colonel Abraham s statement are very much in line with the opinion of the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia in the matter captioned  In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases  They had charges but presented absolutely no information     Consequently  there can be no contention that Combatant Status Review Tribunals are an adequate and effective alternative approach to Federal court habeas corpus  There must be a type of review which presents a fair opportunity for determination as to whether there was any basis to hold a detainee  For such a purpose  Combatant Status Review Tribunals are totally inadequate       It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to legislate in the pending Department of Defense authorization bill to reinstate the statutory right of habeas corpus  It is my judgment that the Supreme Court of the United States will act on the case now pending there to uphold the constitutional right  disagreeing with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Boumediene v  Bush       Initially  the U S  Supreme Court had denied to take certiorari in the case  and it was curious because Justice Stevens did not vote for cert  where three other Justices had  But then after the declaration by Colonel Abraham was filed on a petition for rehearing  which required five affirmative votes by Supreme Court Justices  the petition for rehearing was granted  and the Supreme Court of the United States now has that case       I have filed a brief as amicus curiae in the case  urging the Supreme Court to overrule the District of Columbia case and to uphold the decision in Rasul v  Bush  which holds that there is a statutory right to habeas corpus and that is rooted in historic common law that predates the Constitution  tracing its roots to the Magna Carta with John at Runnymede in 1215  But pending any action by the Supreme Court of the United States  which is not by any means certain  notwithstanding my own view that the Supreme Court will reaffirm Rasul and reverse the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbias ruling in Boumediene  the Congress should now alter the statutory provision in 2006 and make it clear that the statutory right to habeas corpus applies to Guantanamo because of the total inadequacy of the fairness of the procedures under the Combatant Status Review Tribunal                                                                   Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                 Current record
