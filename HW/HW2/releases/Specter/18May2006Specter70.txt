    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  May 18  2006     Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter  R PA   Senator Richard Lugar  R IN   Senator Christopher Dodd  D CT   and Senator Charles Schumer  D NY  today introduced the Free Flow of Information Act  a bill seeking to protect the public s right to information through a free press   This legislation would provide appropriate protections for professional journalists and their employers from having to reveal information that a journalist learned under a promise of confidentiality and in the course of carrying out news gathering functions      There is no doubt about the value of investigative reporting to the public interests in exposing corruption  malfeasance  and misconduct  but there are also weighty considerations on law enforcement and national security     Senator Specter said     This bill seeks to clear up the ambiguities journalists and the federal judicial system face in balancing the protections journalists need with the ability of the courts to conduct fair and accurate trials          I believe that the free flow of information is an essential element of democracy   In order for the United States to foster the spread of freedom and democracy globally  it is incumbent that we first support an open and free press nationally   The role of the media as a conduit between government and the citizens it serves must not be devalued     Senator Lugar said     All of us want to ensure that our national security is protected  We should also protect and preserve the public  s access to critically important information  And the public interest shouldn  t be caught up in government   fishing expedition   nets   said Senator Dodd   This measure is not perfect  But it offers common sense protections that can better ensure that important information for the American public ultimately is preserved       A free and independent press is one of the principal guarantees of liberty in this country   But there needs to be a very careful balance between the freedom of press and our vital national security interests   This bipartisan bill is the best step toward protecting that freedom enshrined in our Constitution  while allowing the government to protect national security in the very small percentage of cases where the law has actually been violated     said Senator Schumer     Under this legislation  a federal prosecutor  including independent prosecutors or agencies  in a criminal case may not compel a journalist or employer of a journalist to reveal protected information unless a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that  the prosecutor has   exhausted alternative sources     the prosecutor tailors the subpoena as much as possible  the prosecutor gives reasonable and timely notice for a demand for documents  the public interest favors disclosure  the information sought is   critical    to the investigation  and there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred    However  the legislation also provides that a journalist or employer of a journalist must disclose information needed to prevent an act of terrorism or harm to the national security      The Senate Judiciary Committee held two hearings to discuss possible reporter privilege legislation and heard from 16 witnesses  including former New York Times reporter Judith Miller and TIME Magazine reporter Matthew Cooper                                                                 Browse by                                                 Current record
