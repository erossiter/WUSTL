    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Tuesday  May 8  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee  made the following statement in regards to immigration on the floor of the United States Senate   A copy of the floor statement is below     We all know the history of the immigration legislation from the 109th congress  The Judiciary Committee reported out a bill  came to the floor of the United States Senate  had many amendments  and it was passed with substantial bipartisan support  The House of Representatives had a very different configuration on the bill  They were concerned only with border security  contrasted with the senate bill which was a comprehensive bill    We have had numerous meetings in an effort to structure a consensus bill in the course of the last many weeks  For many weeks we have met Tuesday  Wednesday  and Thursday from four o clock to six o clock with as many as a dozen Republican Senators present  with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce present    We have had  very substantial White House involvement reflecting the President s statement that he wants a comprehensive immigration reform bill  We have spent many hours on extended meetings with Democrats   There were  a half a dozen Democrats attending these meetings and a rather unique process illustrated last week where we met for 2 1 2 hours with a dozen senators being present  pretty hard to keep a dozen senators sitting in one room at one time going over a great many ideas  We have come to an agreement on what we have called a    quote     grand bargain   unquote  which is the outline of an immigration bill           We have proposed  and are prepared to enact  legislation which would provide for 6 000 additional border patrol  to bring the number to 12 000      We are proposing very strong employer sanctions   We do not want employment in the United States to be a magnet for illegal immigration  and it is now technically possible to have foolproof identification   It can be costly and we re still working through the details  but there s no doubt that we want to secure the border and stop illegal immigration as the first item     We are talking about triggers so that we don t move ahead to dealing with the11 million undocumented immigrants or dealing with a temporary worker program until we have solved the problem of securing the border and providing for identification so that there is a basis for using tough sanctions on the employers  but you can t do that unless they have a fair opportunity to know who is legal and who is illegal   We are rejecting the idea of amnesty for the 11 million undocumented immigrants   They re going to have to earn being on the citizenship path at the end  We are going to require that they pay their taxes  that they have community roots  they have a substantial period of employment  that they learn English   We re going to do our best to deport those who have criminal records  and there is a real security risk with some of the undocumented immigrants who have criminal records and where they do commit crimes     It is a practical impossibility to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants   We  re trying to structure a temporary worker program which is temporary  coming only for the purpose of filling needs and then returning to their native countries   We are looking at a system so that if there are Americans  United States citizens  people in this country who can take the jobs  that they will have the first choice     The Majority Leader has stated publicly his intention to proceed under Rule 14 to file a bill this week  perhaps tomorrow  and list it for floor debate next Monday   There s a lot of concern among Republicans about proceeding in that way with concern that the bill  which was reported out of committee  does not have widespread support and the bill which has passed the Senate does not have widespread support  and that there is a disinclination how it will go   Nobody knows for sure  but a disinclination to support a motion to proceed  raising the possibility that there may be a filibuster there   There is a concern in many quarters that we need more time  that we ve been proceeding diligently  very extended meetings   I have to confess there s been a fair amount of wheel spinning  but that we are not yet ready to proceed next Monday on the 14th to take up the bill the last two weeks before Memorial Day  as the Majority Leader has scheduled     I can understand the Majority Leader s concern about moving ahead and holding our feet to the fire to try to produce a bill  but we re still working on it   Staff worked over the weekend   There was a meeting at the White House on Sunday   I had an extended discussion yesterday with Senator Kennedy   Senator Kennedy met with one of the Secretaries  and we re working at top speed   It would certainly be preferable if we could come up with a bill that would not have to have 2611  which passed the Senate last year  or the Chairman s Mark or the bill that came out of Judiciary   But I ve been asked about this every time I step into the corridor  so I thought it would be useful to give this brief summary without talking later to impact on Senator Leahy s time  but with the note that some Democratic time on the judicial nomination was taken up by Senator Durbin earlier    I yield the floor


