    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases            I hope  as I said earlier  my colleagues will  on the merits  take a close look at a comparison between the legislation we will produce with the unacceptable  unsatisfactory anarchy we have in immigration law today                          Washington  D C    Wednesday  June 27  2007                      Today  U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  spoke on the floor of the Senate regarding S  1639  the immigration bill    A copy of the floor statement is pasted below    I thank the distinguished majority leader  I have sought recognition to comment on two subjects on the pending immigration bill     First  it is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will focus very closely on the extraordinary problems the United States faces today by the current status of our immigration laws and weigh very carefully  notwithstanding any objections people may have to the pending bill  the comparison of the bill with the status quo  what is in existence at the present time  The ultimate decision on whether to vote for or against the bill depends upon not what we would like to have  not what would be perfect  maybe not even what would meet the desires of the individual Members  but a comparison between what bill finally emerges and the status quo  what is happening at the present time  because what we really have in our immigration law is chaos and anarchy      We struggled through legislation in the 109th Congress  It came through the Judiciary Committee  which I chaired in the 109th Congress  passed the Senate  and a different kind of a bill passed the House of Representatives  We could not go to conference  we did not resolve the issue  and it is back again this year  As I have said on a number of occasions on the floor  I think it probably would have been preferable to work through committee  I think at this juncture  you can strike the  probably   It would have been preferable to work through committee in regular order  Whenever we leave regular order  we get into trouble      So we structured it differently  We structured it with a hard working group of Senators  up to 12  sometimes a rotating group  and we came up with a bill  We have been struggling with it on the Senate floor  We have found objections on all sides  We have found objections on the right that it is amnesty  and we have found objections on the left that it does not satisfy humanitarian needs and provide for family reunification  but we continue to push ahead  But I think it is plain that if the Senate does not come up with a bill  doing the best we can now  the subject will be cut off for the indefinite future  Certainly it will not come back up this year when we have a very crowded agenda on appropriations bills and patent reform and many other subjects  It is unlikely to come up next year in a Presidential and congressional election year  Then we are looking at 2009  and we have no reason to expect that the issue will be any easier in 2009 than it is today except that we would have lost more time      We also ought to bear in mind that the Senate bill is not the final product  We will yet have a House bill  we will yet have conference  and we will yet have an opportunity to meet objections which are presently lodged against the bill      Just a word of explanation  When I tear up  it is a result of chemotherapy  it is not a result of sadness on the current status of the immigration bill      There is unity of judgment in both the House and the Senate  and I think broadly across America  that we need to reinstate the rule of law  We need to fix our broken borders  We need to have law enforcement against individuals who knowingly hire illegal immigrants  That is a very major part of the pending bill  The current bill provides for an increased Border Patrol from 12 000 to 18 000    6 000 new people      It provides for additional fencing  although fencing was legislated in the 109th Congress  It provides for drones to fly overhead  It provides for fencing to protect urban areas  While you can t build an impenetrable fence of more than 2 000 miles above the border  we do cover a great deal of border protection  But no matter how secure the border is  as long as there is a magnet so people can get jobs in the United States which are better than other places  immigrants will be attracted  illegal immigrants will be attracted  That is why we have structured provisions in this bill to have foolproof identification so employers will be able to know with certainty whether an individual is a legal or an illegal immigrant  That being the case  if employers hire illegal immigrants knowing they are illegal immigrants because they are in a position to make that determination  it is fair to have sanctions  and for repeat offenders tougher sanctions  and for repeat offenders  confirmed recidivists  to have jail time so we will provide the incentives of law enforcement on white collar crime  which is very effective as a deterrent  I have seen that from my own experience as a prosecuting attorney      In this bill we have issues which are agreed upon by everyone to secure our borders  to impose the rule of law  and to control illegal immigration  But that is not the end of the issue on comprehensive legislation  We have a guest worker program  In the midst of many objections which I am receiving about the bill  I am also hearing a great deal from people who say we need to have immigrant workers  that they are a vital part of our workforce  The landscapers have contacted me  The farmers have contacted me  Restaurateurs have contacted me  Hotel associations have contacted me  The agriculture needs in California have been expressed repeatedly on the floor of this body  So we do need the workers  The Chamber of Commerce and the other organizations are very forceful in articulating that need      We have tried to balance it so we do not take away American jobs and so we are sensitive to the objections which the AFL CIO has raised  We reduced the number of the guest worker program from 400 000 to 200 000  We tried to take into consideration the H 1B workers so that we bring in people with advanced degrees and technical knowledge to help Silicon Valley and other entities which are seeking more along that line  The bill is structured in a very sensitive way in that direction      Then we have the 12 million undocumented immigrants  No one knows the exact number  but that is the number which we have utilized  a number which the Pew Foundation says is about right from their surveys  We have a cry that we will be giving amnesty to these 12 million individuals  We have done our best to structure a bill which requires these undocumented immigrants to earn the right to the path of citizenship  We have imposed fines  We have the requirement in the bill now  through amendment  that they have to pay back taxes  We require they learn English  We require the undocumented immigrants hold jobs for a part of our society  We have a so called touchback provision which I am not enthusiastic about  I have grave reservations about punitive measures which do not have some substantive meaning  but that concession has been made to try to avoid the amnesty claim  We have gone about as far as we can go  Amnesty  like beauty  may be in the eye of the beholder      One thing is plain  The 12 million undocumented immigrants are going to stay in the United States one way or another  They are going to stay here unless we find a way to identify those who are criminals and who could and should be deported  those who may be problems on terrorism  It is agreed that you can t deport 12 million undocumented immigrants  But if we can find a way to so called  bring them out of the shadows   we can identify those who ought to be deported in manageable numbers      Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has accurately said that the current situation  with 12 million undocumented immigrants  is silent amnesty  So they are here  one way or another  silent amnesty or amnesty  But one thing we could do if we move ahead with the legislation is to avoid the anarchy which is here at the present time      I urge my colleagues  in formulating their judgment on the next critical cloture vote and on the issues of the point of order which will be raised  both of which will require 60 votes  to consider very carefully our best efforts at legislation which may be improved upon even more on the pending amendments  may be improved upon even more  contrasting that with the current situation  the status quo  which is totally objectionable      I want to comment about one other subject  and that is the procedures which we are undertaking on this bill  We have come to an approach which  quite frankly  I would prefer not to have seen adopted  I would have preferred to have proceeded as we did at the start of the consideration of this bill before the majority leader took it off the calendar  where we were entertaining amendments from all sides  When the majority leader moved for cloture  I joined most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle  on the Republican side  in voting against cloture so people could have an opportunity to offer their amendments and the minority would not be stifled  I think on some occasions in the past  there have been efforts to stifle the minority and not allow them to bring up amendments  I stood with my Republican colleagues in voting against cloture      Then we spent hours on the floor of the Senate where the objectors    really the obstructionists  well  let s call them objectors  I withdraw the comment  obstructionists     were exercising their rights  It is better to use a more diplomatic language and to accord all colleagues the full panoply of their rights  They were exercising their rights  But we sat around here  As the manager of the bill  I have to sit on the floor because something may happen  unlikely  but something may happen  I sat around for hours again yesterday  I don t mind hard work  but I do mind no work  But we sat around for hours on Thursday afternoon where the objectors wouldn t offer amendments  and they wouldn t allow anybody else to offer amendments  That is unacceptable  just unacceptable      So I joined my colleagues  seven of us on the Republican side  and voted for cloture to cut off debate  and it failed  Then understandably the majority leader took the bill down  Now we have a very limited period of time  because we are about to embark on the 4th of July recess  When we come back there is a full agenda  As I said earlier  if we don t take the bill up now  it is not going to happen this year and probably won t happen next year  When we look at 2009  the same kind of problems we will face then  we face now  except they will be worse      So a procedure has been structured now where we have 25 amendments  That is going to be the full extent  Yesterday the distinguished junior Senator from Oklahoma said he wanted an opportunity to offer amendments  I don t disagree with his philosophy  but in order to have had that opportunity  they had to have been done when we first had the bill on the floor  If the bill is to be moved along  we are going to have to proceed as we are now      Our plan is to seek unanimous consent on these 25 amendments for a limited period of time  We have the proponents of the amendments  and opponents  and they are prepared to take a limited time agreement  Now we are equally divided  If Senators get down to business and get down to issues in an hour  you can debate the salient points  You probably aren t going to change any minds  anyway  around here  but you can have the debate in a pro forma way and get it done  But those time agreements will not proceed if there are objections to the time agreements  and we won t be able to have even limited debate      The plan has been worked out  I don t like the plan  but it is the best we can do  It is the least of the undesirable alternatives  As a manager  I am going to move to table Democratic amendments  and Senator Kennedy  as the manager  is going to move to table Republican amendments  So if there is no agreement on this limited time  there won t be any debate at all  and we are going to move right ahead for the disposition of the bill  If someone seeks recognition to speak with the managers controlling the floor  we will ask for unanimous consent that the speaker agree that no amendment will be offered and that there will be discussion only on the bill and for a limited period of time  a very limited period of time      That is not the way the Senate ordinarily does business  Ordinarily if there is a request for unanimous consent on a time agreement on a pending amendment  if there is an objection  then there is no time limit and people debate it at some length  or they may filibuster it  But that is not going to happen on this bill at this time  because the day for amendments to be offered and regular order to be followed is past      If we are to have a resolution of this issue  we are going to have to move ahead under this constricted and constrained procedure which  again  I don t like  but we are being forced to by the circumstances which we find ourselves in      Just as we respect the rights of the objectors to raise the objections they have  we have rights  too  The way we are proceeding is fully within the rules of the Senate  It is going to be a rough ride  We are in trench warfare  and it is going to be tough  But we are going to see the will of the Senate work one way or another  I hope  as I said earlier  my colleagues will  on the merits  take a close look at a comparison between the legislation we will produce with the unacceptable  unsatisfactory anarchy we have in immigration law today      I yield the floor                                                                 Browse by
