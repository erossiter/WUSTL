SEN. THOMAS SUPPORTS IDEA FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) voted today to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), S. 1248, which opens educational doors for children with disabilities. The Senate voted 95-3 to extend funding for the program through 2009.  
   "I am pleased Congress has provided such strong support for IDEA. Our emphasis should be on helping schools support children with disabilities and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all children receive the best possible education. This is vital not only to their future, but to the future of our country," Thomas said. "This bill will help states meet their Constitutional obligation of providing a quality public education, and also reduce the administrative, fiscal, and procedural burdens on state and local educators." 
   Key provisions of the IDEA legislation include: 
   * Clarifies teacher certification for Special Education teachers. 
   * Encourages informal and speedy resolution of problems, helps prevent misidentification of students, and reduce bureaucratic paperwork for teachers. 
   * Makes schools safer by providing greater clarity and flexibility in the law, as well as supporting approaches, including behavioral interventions, that prevent dangerous discipline problems. 
   * Provides increased financial resources. 
   * Facilitates the transition for students with disabilities from school to post-secondary experiences. 
   * Strengthens implementation of the law to ensure that every child with a disability receives a free appropriate public education. 
   Sen. Thomas co-sponsored an amendment with Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) which created a 15 state demonstration program allowing waivers of various IDEA rules and requirements with the purpose of reducing paperwork. States can apply to be one of the 15 sites for this demonstration project. 
   In 2002, 6.5 million children with disabilities were served under the program. The bill now goes to conference to be reconciled with a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives. IDEA was enacted in 1975.
