SEN. THOMAS ON MINING PROVISION BEING DROPPED
  "It's important to give a voice to those who are so closely connected to our public lands. I'm glad I was able to speak out on behalf of sportsmen and others who felt they were left out of the debate. The mining provision never belonged in the budget reconciliation package. I expect this issue to come up next year and I'd like to continue to address the needs of sportsmen and promote the multiple-use of our public lands."
