SEN. THOMAS TAPPED BY PRESIDENT TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
  President Bush invited Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) and Senate and Finance Committee leaders to the White House today to discuss the details of Social Security reform.  
   President Bush invited Wyoming's senior senator because of his distinguished legislative record, background in tax reform, and fiscal responsibility. 
   "Social Security needs to be strengthened for our children and grandchildren. I'm looking forward to meeting with the President as we move forward with our legislative agenda for this Congress. This reform is part of my agenda to improve the quality of life for the people of Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   "The plan for Social Security is full of options for Americans to consider - it plainly gives us more opportunities to secure our financial future," Thomas said. 
   As part of the Administration's plan, Social Security will remain the same for people who are currently drawing, but the reform will give the next generation a chance to save using personal accounts. The personal account will be an added tool for citizens and will not add to the total amount obligated through Social Security. In fact, every plan set out by the Social Security Administration that contains a personal account reduces the cost of permanently fixing the system.
