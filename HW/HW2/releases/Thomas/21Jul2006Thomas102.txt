NATIONAL DAY OF AMERICAN COWBOY ON JULY 22
  In its second year, the National Day of the American Cowboy, introduced in the Senate by Sen. Craig Thomas, recognizes cowboys and cowgirls as a significant part of our nation's history.  
   "The popularity of Cowboy Day continues to grow by leaps and bounds," Thomas said. 
   "I'm excited to once again recognize cowboys and cowgirls for their important contributions to our nation's history. I look forward to bringing the Presidential Message to Cheyenne Frontier Days." 
   A Senate resolution to recognize the second-ever "National Day of the American Cowboy" slates July 22, 2006 as the day of celebration. The plan is to see the fourth Saturday of July continue to be celebrated as part of the history of our nation. 
   President Bush has offered his support again this year for the National Day of the American Cowboy. 
   In a Presidential Message to be read at Cheyenne Frontier Days, the message will read in part: 
   "The cowboy is an American icon that holds a cherished place in our Nation's history. Our past is filled with wonderful stories of cowboys who embodied the finest American values of daring, discipline, and patriotism." 
   Senator Thomas will be on hand at Cheyenne Frontier Days today and Saturday. He will ride in the Saturday morning parade and take part in a time of recognition for the National Day of the American Cowboy.
