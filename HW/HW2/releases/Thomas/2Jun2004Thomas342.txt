SEN. THOMAS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NPS INITIATING TEMPORARY WINTER USE PLAN FOR GRAND TETON, YELLOWSTONE PARKS
  The following is a statement by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) regarding today's decision by the National Park Service (NPS) to begin a Temporary Winter Use Plan Environmental Assessment for Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway.  
 The temporary plan would allow the NPS to complete a long-term analysis of the environmental impacts of winter use in the parks. 
   "I support the park developing a winter use plan. The dueling federal court actions and uncertainty about the next winter season, offers a prime example about why we need to prevent venue shopping. As legal battles continue we need to have a winter use plan for visitor access and related businesses. I support the Administration's efforts to get a temporary plan in place. In fact, I wrote to Secretary Norton in March encouraging her to move forward with an interim plan. I am hopeful that we can develop a long-term plan soon and that the DC court does not swoop in and derail the positive steps being taken by the Administration."
