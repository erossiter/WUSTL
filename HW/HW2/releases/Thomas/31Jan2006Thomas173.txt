SEN. THOMAS REACTS TO STATE OF THE UNION
 The following is Sen. Craig Thomas' reaction to President Bush's State of the Union Address:  
   "President Bush set in place a vision for where he wants the Congress and the nation to be - and vision is the foundation of strong leadership. I felt particularly connected to the issues he addressed - specifically energy and health care. I remain very connected to energy and health care policy as I have throughout my legislative career," Thomas said. 
   "I was pleased to hear his specific reference to clean coal technologies. Clean coal will be the foundation for Wyoming coal to continue to be a main source for electricity generation for power hungry markets. 
   "It was important to hear the President's strategy for how to address global challenges. And I believe we need to remain confident in our global endeavors, whether in international trade with China, future trade agreements, or national security. 
   "Our mission in Iraq remains an important front of the War on Terror. We need to remain steadfast in our mission and only bring our troops home once Iraq can stand up and fight for itself - we have seen good progress toward democracy there. From tyranny under Saddam to free elections that occurred last fall, the Iraqi people have seen a new day dawn. 
   "Here in Congress, we need to put our differences aside and return to a place where we can debate the merits of legislation and not simply posture for political gain. We have a chance to make decisions today that will affect future generations. We need to make changes that will improve people's quality of life."
