SEN. THOMAS: KOREA REOPENS BORDER TO U.S. BEEF
  Just ahead of a U.S.-Korea free trade negotiation, Sen. Craig Thomas is lauding Korea's decision to open its border to U.S. beef.  
   "As we seek fair trade around the world, I'm pleased to see that Korea will reopen its market to U.S. beef. Their decision validates the United States' rigorous scientific process for ensuring a top quality product," Thomas said. 
   Thomas received a letter from Korean Ambassador Tae-Sik Lee late Friday saying Korea will resume U.S. beef imports effective immediately. 
   "We need to continue along avenues that promote fair trade, with fewer restrictions," Thomas said. "The USDA has crafted a solid set of procedures to ensure the safety of our beef exports and we're starting to see the world respond favorably." 
   Thomas noted that the United States exported 24 percent of its beef to Korea and 37 percent to Japan in 2003, before BSE was discovered in a cow in Washington state. 
   "The Asian market represents a substantial portion of our world beef exports, so it's certainly good news for Wyoming producers to solidify a significant trading partner." 
   Thomas has been a strong advocate for opening Asian markets since the decision to ban U.S. beef back in 2003. In addition to being a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Thomas is the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee. 
   The U.S. beef industry has lost $6 billion or more in income since the first border closure in 2003.
