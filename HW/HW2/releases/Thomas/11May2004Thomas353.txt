SEN. THOMAS DISCUSSES 'COVER THE UNINSURED' WEEK
  May 10-16 is Cover the Uninsured Week, a national campaign to draw attention to the escalating number of Americans without health insurance in this country. Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) joined his colleagues in the Senate today to highlight the plight of over 40 million people across the nation who are lacking health insurance. Thomas is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.  
   "The one thing that I hear the most about from Barnum to Baggs is the cost of health insurance. Over 14 percent of folks in Wyoming do not have health insurance, and the main reason for that is that our health care system has become too expensive. We have the best health care in the world, but it doesn't do anyone any good unless it's affordable." 
   While folks in Wyoming have been working at the state level to address the issue of the uninsured, Senate Republicans have been crafting federal solutions. Yesterday, the Republican Uninsured Task Force released its recommendations to decrease the number of uninsured Americans. A key part to the success of lowering the number of uninsured Americans is to make health insurance more affordable. The Task Force proposed several provisions to control health costs and are estimated to save the nation's health care system $137 billion a year. The Task Force also outlined several actions that can be taken at the federal level, which coincide with Wyoming State Planning Grant recommendations such as tax credits and strengthening the safety net. 
   "I am pleased that the state and Senate Republicans are talking about potential solutions to the uninsured issue. We have all known for a long time that we have a problem and it is time to stop talking about the problem and focus on creative federal and state solutions," Thomas said. "I want to congratulate my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for his efforts on this issue as a member of the Uninsured Task Force and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I look forward to working with him and other members of the Task Force as we address this important issue," Thomas said. 
   For the past couple of years, the State of Wyoming has used funds it received for a State Planning Grant given by the Department of Health and Human Services to explore the uninsured issue in the state. The recently completed State Planning Grant report noted that Wyoming has over 70,000 people who are without health insurance, 20,000 are children. The report also explored options on how to fix the situation and made some of the following recommendations: 
   * Expand Public Programs (i.e., Medicaid and CHIP) 
   * Fully fund CHIP at the state level 
   * Provide a Buy-In option to Public Programs 
   * Increase Reimbursement for Public Programs 
   * Improve Coordination among Safety Net Providers 
   * Targeted tax credits and federal subsidies 
   * Expand Community Health Centers 
   * Create Purchasing Pools 
   * Mandate participation in employer sponsored coverage 
   * Increase personal responsibility for health 
   * Improve education efforts of the uninsured on programs available to them 
   * Improve education efforts about the true cost of health care - folks need to become better consumers 
   * Universal Access
   Cover the Uninsured week is sponsored by some of the largest organizations in the nation, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. The campaign will be co-chaired by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Hundreds of events are slated in communities across the country to increase awareness of the issue.
