SEN. THOMAS ON 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
  "As America's first national park, Yellowstone is a particularly special place to celebrate this anniversary. Yellowstone's designation precedes the creation of the National Park Service by 44 years. The natural wonders here are like no other place in the world."  
   "Our national park system has been described as 'America's best idea.' National parks are inherently democratic and open to all, and therefore, represent American values." 
   "Parks keep us in touch with our natural and cultural history and provide a link to the past. In addition to recognizing the Park Service's past, it is important to look forward and build upon the progress made in the last 90 years. We must develop tangible management and policy goals and work vigorously to achieve them," Thomas said. 
   "As Chairman of the Parks Service Subcommittee, I am committed to this task. I look forward to working with Secretary Kempthorne, the Park Service and the public to develop a vision for the Park Service for the next century."
