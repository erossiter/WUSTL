SEN. THOMAS URGES PRESIDENT TO REOPEN BEEF TRADE WITH JAPAN
  "The Japanese beef market is incredibly important to our nation's cattle industry and their embargo has gone on long enough.  
 Our beef industry is safe," said Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. "I urge the Administration to resolve this embargo using all available means. It's critical to the continued economic viability of our beef industry," Thomas said. 
   Thomas and his Senate colleagues on the Agriculture Committee sent a letter to the President today urging him to resume beef trade with Japan and other export markets. 
   "When the beef processing companies start cutting production, you know the problem needs to be addressed. Many in the beef industry blame their losses on a closed Japanese market," Thomas said. "I don't want this to have any further negative impact on the beef sector or our fragile rural economies," Thomas explained. 
   The letter asked the Administration to take the matter up with officials at the highest levels of the Japanese government. Senator Thomas is a member of the Agriculture Committee and has served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade under the Senate Finance Committee.
