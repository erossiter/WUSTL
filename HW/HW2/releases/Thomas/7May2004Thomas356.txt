THOMAS LEADS FIGHT TO RAISE PILT PAYMENTS TO COUNTIES
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) is once again leading the fight in Congress to increase funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program that compensates western counties with significant federal lands. PILT provides compensation to local governments for federal lands within counties that would otherwise generate property taxes.  
   Thomas, a long-time and successful advocate for the program, has organized a group of 56 lawmakers petitioning key Senate appropriators to boost the program to $255 million for FY 2005. In a letter to Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT) and Byron Dorgan (R-ND), Chairman and Ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Thomas said the Department's budget request is insufficient for the federal government to keep its commitment to public land counties. The current PILT authorization level is $340 million, however, the Department of the Interior's FY 2005 budget request is $226 million. 
   "Clearly there is a lot of support in the Senate for this program. We believe that the Interior's budget request is inadequate," Thomas said. "In addition to the regular residents of our country's public land counties, millions of Americans who visit national parks, forest, and other public lands rely on county governments to provide high quality services and a clean and safe environment. The PILT program makes this possible." 
   Last year, Wyoming's senior senator led the effort to provide $225 million for the PILT program. Wyoming counties received $14.3 million in FY 2004 as a result of Senator Thomas' efforts, Thomas said. Additional information regarding the PILT program, including payment schedules to Wyoming counties, is available at www.blm.gov/pilt.
