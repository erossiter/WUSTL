SEN. THOMAS ON FUTUREGEN ANNOUNCEMENT, INTEGRATED GASIFICATION COMBINED CYCLE
  "FutureGen is one way to prove the use of Wyoming coal, but Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle needs to be developed further in the interim. Section 413, which I authored in the Energy Policy Act, also calls for demonstration of these coal technologies in our state - the home of our nation's largest supply of coal."  
   "I will continue to advocate for full funding of Section 413, as part of the Energy Policy Act. If we don't prove advance coal technologies in the West, we're doing the nation a disservice in terms of supplying clean energy to power hungry markets," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas said he will continue to pursue efforts for siting of the Frontier Line and for attracting energy companies to Wyoming to build IGCC power plants. 
   Thomas continues efforts to fund a demonstration project for Wyoming coal's use in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process. And he is still working on energy corridor designations to site the Frontier Line, as well, to deliver the electricity Wyoming will produce. In addition to both of those the senator is putting together a coalition of like-minded senators who want to see clean coal power developed in the West.
