SEN. THOMAS ADDRESSES SUGAR TRADE CONCERNS AT NATIONAL SYMPOSIUM
  Continuing his pursuit of fair trade for the Wyoming sugar industry, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) addressed the International Sweetener Symposium in Vail, Colorado, to discuss ways to eliminate global distortions that put the U.S. and Wyoming's sugar industries at risk.  
   "Sugar is one of the few products in Wyoming that is grown, produced, and marketed solely from our state. The impact of the sugar industry in Wyoming goes well beyond the farmer and his family; it impacts entire communities, creates jobs and provides valuable economic opportunities for our rural areas," Thomas said. 
   Thomas noted that in the past year, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been hard at work at framing a comprehensive trade agreement that would address existing distortions in agriculture around the world. The Wyoming Senator said that working within the WTO structure will be crucial to Wyoming's sugar industry. 
   Senator Thomas also said the Bush Administration has made a commitment to complete a comprehensive agreement. Thomas said, however, that completion of such an agreement will not be done at any cost. "Sometimes it is better to not have an agreement than to agree to a bad arrangement," Thomas stated. 
   In recent weeks, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Zoellick led trade negotiators in reaching an agreement in the WTO to open markets for U.S. goods and services, and eliminates global restrictions that create an un-level paying field for U.S. products. Ambassador Zoellick attended meetings in Geneva, Switzerland to establish a blueprint for future negotiations. The framework sets forth an ambitious agenda on agriculture, including: 
   * Elimination of all agricultural export subsidies 
   * Major cuts in foreign tariffs on U.S. farm exports 
   * Expanded market access for U.S. farm products 
   * Substantial reductions in trade-distorting agricultural support programs 
   * New disciplines, including more transparency, on state trading enterprises 
   * Harmonization of domestic support 
   * Cotton issues will be handled in the agriculture negotiations 
   * Countries will be able to identify a limited number of products as sensitive and negotiate accordingly 
   Thomas concluded his remarks by saying that he looks forward to working with the WTO and USTR to ensure that nation's agricultural producers will fair opportunity to compete in the international market. 
   "I am confident that we can utilize trade opportunities to improve the quality of life at home and abroad," Thomas concluded. 
   The International Sweetener Symposium is sponsored by the American Sugar Alliance. This year, over 350 individuals from the U.S and the international community participated.
