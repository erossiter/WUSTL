SEN. THOMAS' NATIONAL HERITAGE BILL PASSES OUT OF SENATE
  The Senate passed today a bill sponsored by Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.). The bill, The National Heritage Partnership Act, S. 2543, establishes restrictions and criteria for National Heritage Areas in the United States. Sen. Thomas is chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee which has jurisdiction over this issue. 
   "My bill reigns in the growth of this program by establishing clear guidelines, caps the amount of federal money an area can receive, and specifically includes language that protects the rights of individual property owners. The bill intends to uphold private property owner's rights, not degrade them," Thomas said. "At the present time, there are no federal guidelines requiring what a heritage bill must contain. The current system is draining resources from other important programs." 
   Since 1984, 24 National Heritage Areas have been created. These areas range in scope from the National Oil Heritage Area which includes a small area in Pennsylvania to one that literally engulfs the entire state of Tennessee. Though they receive federal designation, none of the Heritage Areas establish any type of federal zoning or federal land management. 
   Each of the current Heritage Areas are a result of an Act of Congress over the past two decades. In the last couple of years, the number of proposals in Congress has greatly increased-currently, more than 35 bills are pending to establish individual heritage areas or study the suitability and feasibility of areas for heritage status. 
   The Thomas bill establishes actual criteria for this program, explicitly provides for private property rights protections and creates some fiscal controls.
