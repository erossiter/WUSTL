SEN. THOMAS, GOV. FREUDENTHAL SURVEY DAMAGE IN WRIGHT
  Sen. Craig Thomas joined Gov. Dave Freudenthal to survey damage in Wright today and to meet with the incident commander, mayor, county commissioners, Red Cross and residents directly affected by the recent tornado. 
   Thomas talked about the pending FEMA disaster relief with the group and said he would continue to encourage the agency to give every consideration to Wright in their federal funding determination. Thomas was encouraged by the FEMA's quick response to the incident and their diligence in making the assessments on the ground.
   "They need to be flexible with their determination about federal funds," he said from Wright today. "What I've seen here in this small town is certainly significant damage. We owe these folks some certainty about getting back on their feet. I continue to encourage Wyoming to join together and give to the disaster relief efforts already under way," Thomas said. 
   Thomas will be speaking with the Undersecretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response about the federal funding determination this afternoon.
