SEN. THOMAS REINTRODUCES GRAND TETON LAND BILL
  Sen. Craig Thomas announced on Tuesday, Jan. 16, that he has reintroduced a bill to add nearly 50 acres to Grand Teton National Park as part of a strategy to preserve the integrity of our national parks.  
   Thomas' bill, which was approved unanimously by the Senate in the 109th Congress, will add 49.62 acres to the eastern boundary of the Grand Teton National Park near Lost Creek. 
   "I'm pleased to once again sponsor legislation to allow this enormous display of generosity to become reality. An additional 50 acres will help continue the preservation efforts for this outstanding part of Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   "Lands such as these are extremely important to set aside for folks to enjoy. This area is not only one of the most scenic in the country, but has tremendous value as wildlife habitat." 
   The largest single lot within the 50-acre area is currently owned by the Halpin family. The other lots are owned by foundations who obtained interests in the land from the Halpin family in anticipation that the land would eventually be donated to the National Park Service for inclusion in Grand Teton National Park. 
   Owners of the lots within the identified area have agreed to donate their parcels to become National Park Service (NPS) land in perpetuity. 
   Thomas' bill directs the Secretary of Interior to accept the donation. In 1950, Congress passed legislation requiring that no further extension or establishment of national parks could be undertaken except by express authorization of Congress. That law requires Congress to consider and pass legislation if the Secretary is to accept the donated land. 
   Thomas, the ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee, fully expects the bill to be brought before the full Senate for a vote in the near future.
