'MORE FUNDING FOR CLEAN COAL, FUTUREGEN'
  In a letter to Congressional appropriators today, Sen. Craig Thomas urged the inclusion of $100 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative and the redirecting of $257 million for the FutureGen Initiative as part of his vision to ensure Wyoming's dominance in the energy economy.  
   "I saw an opportunity to designate $257 million for FutureGen, and once appropriators see it through - Wyoming is well-positioned to grab it," Thomas said. 
   "Coal is our nation's greatest resource. I want this technology to take place in Wyoming. So, I'm directing resources to make it happen," Thomas said. We can achieve low-emissions from coal-fueled power plants. And Wyoming coal should power the nation." 
   "FutureGen is vastly important as our nation's coal consumption rises. Coal consumption for electricity is expected to increase 38 percent by 2025. We need these technologies in place to allow coal to more readily meet our nation's current and future energy needs," Thomas said. 
   Thomas continues his vision to make Wyoming the major supplier of our nation's energy needs. He brought energy industry leaders together with educators this month at the University of Wyoming to talk about cutting edge technologies and how students can be part of Wyoming future. 
   He plans to maintain his efforts by ensuring that funding mechanisms in the Energy Policy Act continue to make coal a viable electricity generator. His efforts on the Energy Committee to include provision, on the Finance Committee to finance the efforts, will continue as he fosters increased communication between industry, educators, and the federal government to enhance the economy for Wyoming.
