SEN. THOMAS IN GLACIER NATIONAL PARK
  As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) is visiting Glacier National Park in Montana this weekend. Sen. Thomas will be touring facilities and the park, and will be attending a National Park Foundation reception today promoting the Junior Ranger Program-First Lady Laura Bush also is scheduled to be in attendance.  
   "I am pleased that the First Lady is here today in Glacier National Park to demonstrate her support for the Junior Ranger Program and the National Park Service. 
   "As travelers load up their cars this summer and head out to America's national parks, they will be visiting some of our nation's most treasured resources. To ensure access and enjoyment of our parks for future generations, new policies must encourage access while promoting fiscal constraint and spending efficiency by park managers. 
   "Our national parks are being loved to death-plagued by funding needs and management issues. After his election in 2000, the President proposed a five-year, $4.9 billion plan to reduce maintenance backlog in our national parks. The dollar amount was based on a 1998 review by the General Accounting Office. There continues to be a great deal of talk about funding needs, but what many people don't realize is that the National Park Service (NPS) budget has more funds per employee, per acre, and per visitor, than at any other time in the agency's history-largely due to the efforts of President Bush. 
   "Congress, the National Park Service, the Administration, and all those interested in improving our public lands, must identify initiatives that protect resources, improve visitor services and develop management plans. Working together, we can ensure these areas remain affordable and accessible for everyone."
