LEGISLATION AIMS TO AID WOUNDED MILITARY MEMBERS
  Those wounded while serving their country will benefit from recent legislation cosponsored by Sen.  
 Craig Thomas, (R-Wyo.) and adopted this week in the Senate. 
   The legislation provides $25,000 to $100,000 to military personnel, based on the severity of their injury, whether in combat or elsewhere. Those in service will pay $1 a month for the coverage as part of their Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance. 
   "Many times, a service member faces a long road to recovery. This money will help families who have left their jobs and homes to be with their loved ones," Thomas said. 
   The legislation is a part of the $81 billion emergency supplemental to fund ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It must still be approved by the House of Representatives. 
   The measure will be retroactive to the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, which began in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. The measure was adopted by voice vote. 
   Members have been meeting with wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, many of whom have lost limbs or have been seriously wounded. It was through one of those meetings that this legislation originated. 
   Ryan Kelly, from Prescott, Arizona, Jeremy W. Feldbusch from Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and Heath Calhoun, from Clarksville, Tennessee, along with Jeremy Chwat, the Public Policy Director of the Wounded Warrior Project, made the appeal directly to Senate Veterans Affairs Committee about the need for this legislation during a recent visit. 
   "I'm pleased we could see this bill through so quickly. It was only two weeks ago that they brought this idea to Veterans Affairs and now they're seeing their idea adopted by the U.S. Senate," Thomas said. The amendment received tremendous bipartisan support.
