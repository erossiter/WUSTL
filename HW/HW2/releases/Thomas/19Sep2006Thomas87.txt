SEN. THOMAS ON GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK TRANSPORTATION PLAN
  The following are Sen. Craig Thomas' comments regarding today's announcement that the Grand Teton National Park's transportation plan is available for public review.  
   "As Grand Teton puts forward its vision for park transportation needs, it underscores the growing popularity of our national parks and the challenges increased visitation could bring to both the park and to gateway communities." 
   "I am certainly pleased to see the pathways proposal move forward after securing $9 million for the effort. I believe pathways will contribute to the best possible experience for Grand Teton visitors," Thomas said. "My hope is that visitors will be able to experience the beauty of Grand Teton in a safe manner without having to be behind the windshield of a vehicle." 
   "As we move forward with the process, I want to ensure that both the transit business plan and the results of the ongoing study of the Moose-Wilson Road are implemented according to the needs of the park and the community. It's important for the public to remain engaged because changes to traffic patterns and access can have a profound affect on both the community and the resource.".
