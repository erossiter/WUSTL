SEN. THOMAS SPEAKS COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  Here are several of the President's Budget Proposals Sen. Craig Thomas is watching: 
   Clean Coal (Clean Coal Power Initiative) 
   "I'm looking for specific funding for the clean coal power initiative at DOE to support Wyoming's efforts for both turning coal into liquid fuel for our transportation sector, as well as to strengthen the role coal can play in electric generation," U.S. Sen. Craig Thomas said. 
   "I told the President that we need to start seeing more financial backing and support for the initiatives in the Energy Policy Act," Thomas said after a recent meeting at the White House. 
   "We have made great strides at improving the environmental performance and efficiency of coal, but we must demonstrate those efforts on a commercial scale. Clean coal funding is the key to demonstrating advance technologies that will allow our electricity and transportation fuel sector to take full advantage of our most abundant domestic fossil resource."  
   "Wyoming provides more than a third of our nation's coal and there are a number of energy projects that will be built in my state with appropriate funding through the Department of Energy. The Energy Policy Act authorized these policy goals and it's appropriate for the Clean Coal Power Initiative to fund the demonstration of these activities in Wyoming," Thomas said. "We can pursue alternative fuels, but as of right now, we are not able to fully fuel our nation's energy needs using switch grass and sunshine. Over the next 10-15 years what we have is an abundant natural resource that with the proper technology can produce both fuel and electricity in an environmentally friendly way." 
   Loan Guarantees - Advanced Energy (Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005) 
   "It's foolish to let South Africa and China aggressively pursue coal-to-liquids with their federal dollars and not have our own loan guarantee program funding projects in the United States. I'm pleased to see the President's request for $9 billion for our loan guarantee program created two years ago in the Energy Policy Act. We need to get these commercial-scale projects under way for things like coal-to-liquids, nuclear power, bio-diesel, and solar to hydrogen projects. It's been two years since this title became law and its time to get these projects under way," Thomas said. "Wyoming has a coal-to-liquids plant with cooperative agreements already in place to make 13,000 barrels of coal-derived diesel per day." 
   Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, established a loan guarantee to be run by the DOE to provide financial assistance in the form of low interest loans to project that move forward the commercialization of viable technologies. 
   "We know these technologies work, but they have yet to be completed on a commercial scale," Thomas said. "Anytime someone tries to get a commercial scale project done for the first time it makes sense that the federal government help get it up and running. Any subsequent project will have a much easier time attracting private investors." 
   National Science Foundation (Wyoming supercomputer) 
   "With the recent announcement that Wyoming has landed the supercomputer, we're watching the NSF budget closely to make sure they have the resources to support projects they've announced but have yet to fund." 
   Thomas noted that the National Science Foundation budget funds NCAR and that the President's proposal calls for an increase in funding for the NSF. 
   Deficit and Entitlement Reform 
   "In the broad sense, I'm looking for the President's leadership on reducing the deficit. There are savings to be had if we are willing to make the tough choices to keep our budget in line," Thomas said. 
   "We can make a serious dent in spending if we're willing to commit to entitlement reform. Entitlements represent a massive amount of federal spending - that amount only continues to grow. We have to examine the role of the federal government in terms of what we can sustain over the long term. If we continue on this path, Medicare will eat up so much of the federal budget that we'll have no money left for anything else. Our Medicare system is unsustainable." 
   Tax Incentives - Improving Savings Nationally 
   The President has incorporated core components of Senator Thomas's SAVE Initiative (for Lifetime Savings Accounts, Retirement Savings Accounts, and Employer Retirement Savings Accounts) in his 2008 Budget under tax incentives: 
   Tax incentives: 
   * Expand tax-free savings opportunities 
   * Create two new savings accounts, a Lifetime Savings Account and a Retirement Savings Account 
   * Consolidate employer-based savings accounts 
   "My reasons for introducing these savings opportunities were threefold. First of all, we must address our nation's appallingly-low personal savings rate," Thomas said. "Personal savings rates in the United States since 1960 have reached a new low at less than 2 percent. My legislative effort encourages additional savings and reduces the temptation for individuals to tap into retirement savings for other purposes." 
   "Secondly, our tax code is entirely too complex and contributes to lack of participation in the tax-preferred vehicles that already exist. These bills, by allowing individuals to accumulate tax-free interest and by streamlining current savings vehicles, represent an important step toward fundamental tax reform." 
   "Finally, as the Social Security system strains under increasing pressure, it is even more important that we provide a better, more responsive, simpler system for Americans to accumulate personal savings for retirement," Thomas said. 
   National Park Service (NPS) - Operations Budget 
   "After spearheading funding letters for national park operations for the last several years, I'm certainly pleased to see the President put more emphasis on our national parks with the single largest increase the NPS has ever seen," Thomas said. "After announcing the Centennial Challenge, it's great to see the President back up his initiative with the proper funding to get started. Our national treasures deserve to be treated well as the Park Service seeks to protect its resources and provide outstanding visitor services." Thomas and 36 of his colleagues sent a letter in September 2006 seeking additional funding for the NPS leading up to and including the Centennial Challenge initiative. 
   Rural Health Care - Equity With Urban Counterparts 
   Rural Health Care Funding has in past years been cut the President's budget proposal. It has been zeroed out in this budget as well. 
   "I feel these programs are the lifeblood of what rural states, like Wyoming, need to have in order to support their fragile rural health networks. Rural providers don't currently get equal reimbursement from Medicare as their urban counterparts. Folks in rural areas often face greater hurdles in accessing care and that care needs to be affordable. Through my work with the Senate Rural Health Caucus, we have sought a restoration of funds for rural health in the budget. It appears we may have to look at it again this year." 
   Senator Thomas's Watch List for the 2008 Budget: 
   * Plans for deficit reduction 
   * Clean Coal funding (Clean Coal Power Initiative - CCPI, specifically) 
   * EPACT Title XVII funding (DOE Loan Guarantees) 
   * National Park Service Centennial Challenge 
   * Energy tax incentives for development of alternative fuels and infrastructure modernization 
   * National Science Foundation Funding (Wyoming supercomputer) 
   * Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) 
   * Secure Rural Schools Funding - efforts to use public land sales to fund program 
   * Tax reform (no new taxes, pro-growth initiatives) 
   * Entitlement reform - Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security 
   * Rural Health Program Funding Reductions - have sought restoration of $235 million for rural health programs in the past couple budget years 
   * Highway Funding 
   * Missile funding.
