SEN. THOMAS: 'I WANT SOME ANSWERS REGARDING CANADIAN BEEF'
  Earlier today it was announced that the Canadian government discovered a new case of BSE in a Canadian cow. This was the second discovery of BSE in less than a month. 
   "This discovery brings up serious issues about the safety of beef coming from Canada. Before the United States Department of Agriculture opens the border to Canadian beef, I want some answers," said Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   The Senate Agriculture Committee has announced that they will hold an oversight hearing on this issue during the first week of February.
