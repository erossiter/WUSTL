SEN. THOMAS: WYOMING FOLKS OPEN THEIR HEARTS, HOMES
  "What we have seen in the past 10 days has obviously been one the most terrible natural disasters in our nation's history.  
 We have also seen the generous spirit of our nation thrive in a time of confusion and loss. The giving nature of the American people has been on display from coast to coast. I'm particularly proud of the people of Wyoming who have opened their hearts and homes to help out the hurricane victims," Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said today. "We just never know when we'll be the ones in the path of a storm - like the folks of Wright. I was so impressed with how they came together as a community." 
   On the heels of a $10.5 billion relief package that passed last week in an emergency session of Congress, another $51.8 billion was slated by Congress today for emergency relief. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is spending more than $500 million a day in the Gulf region. 
   "The objective right now is to get the victims back on their feet, and provide for their basic needs - to bring some semblance of normalcy. This will be an ongoing effort, but progress is being made hour-by-hour, day-by-day. It's a testament to the courage of people throughout the Gulf Coast. It will take years to rebuild New Orleans and the other coastal areas, but I'm confident the Gulf Coast will thrive again," Thomas said. 
   Thomas said any investigation into the initial response after the storm should come after people's needs are being met.
