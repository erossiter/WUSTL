MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERAN BILL GOES TO PRESIDENT
  Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi and Rep. Barbara Cubin, all R-Wyo., are pleased a bill headed for the President's desk provides significant funding for the Wyoming Army and Air National Guard, veterans and military construction.  
   "Our military men and women deserve to have the best training and base facilities and this bill delivers the proper funding," the delegation said. "This bill is a commitment to our troops and shows our respect and appreciation to our nation's veterans." 
   The Wyoming Army National Guard will receive $2.8 million for a Readiness Center Division Redesign Study in Casper. The Wyoming Air National Guard will receive $7 million for a Composite Airlift Support Complex in Cheyenne. 
   The Senate unanimously passed the fiscal year 2006 Military Construction Appropriations conference report Friday. The bill provides about $5 billion for active duty military construction, about $70 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs and about $22 billion for the Veterans Medical Service. 
   Also Friday, the House passed the conference report by a vote of 427-0. The bill will now go to the President who is expected to sign the legislation into law.
