SEN. THOMAS SECURES EXTRA $4 MILLION FOR GRAND TETON
  Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that his request for an additional $4 million for the Pathways Project in Grand Teton National Park received final approval in Congress.  
   "National Parks are a major asset to our state's tourism industry. Pathways will give folks the chance to see the park by walking or riding their bikes, rather than out the window of a vehicle," Thomas said. 
   Last year Thomas was able to secure $4 million for the initial phase of the pathways project for Grand Teton National Park. 
   "Pathways will improve the quality and safety of visitor access. As we look at the 20-year vision for Wyoming's economy - tourism continues to be a driver of our state's economy," Thomas said. 
   "Linking primary destinations in Grand Teton, including the sections of greatest safety concern for visitors, is certainly a priority. It only makes sense to me to offer an alternative way to bring the gateway communities of Jackson and Teton Village together with restaurants, lodging, and other services," Thomas said. 
   "Improving the quality of our parks, which in turn enhances our quality of life in Wyoming, continues to be a priority," he said. 
   Diane Shober, Director of the Wyoming Travel and Tourism said, "We're very pleased Senator Thomas continues to enhance access to our parks. Wyoming has wonderful natural resources and we want people to experience the parks firsthand." Shober said tourism surveys indicate a growing trend in travelers wanting to incorporate physical activities such as hiking and biking into their vacation plans. 
   Wyoming's senior senator is the Chairman of National Parks Subcommittee. The House conferees approved today the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development bill which contains the funding for the Pathways project for Grand Teton National Park.
