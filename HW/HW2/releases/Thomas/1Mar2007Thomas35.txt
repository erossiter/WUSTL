SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON 9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS
  Sen. Craig Thomas on Thursday, March 1, made a statement regarding the 9/11 recommendations bill presently before the Senate, including homeland security funding for Wyoming.  
   The Senate is currently debating S. 4, the "Improving America's Security Act of 2007" or more commonly known as the 9/11 recommendations bill. The bill attempts to implement among other things the two remaining recommendations from the 9/11 study panel which weren't passed during the 109th Congress. Under Republican leadership last Congress, 37 of the 39 panel recommendations have already been passed and signed into law. 
   However, a provision of S. 4 deals with TSA employee collective bargaining rights, which were not originally part of the panel's recommendations. Senator Thomas believes that the proposed provision is not in the best interest of national security. It would greatly hinder TSA's flexibility to respond to terrorist threats, fresh intelligence and other emergencies because Homeland Security officials would be required to get approval from unions for every change in policy or personnel assignments before they deal with potential threats. 
   There is also a Homeland Security funding formula change in S. 4 that would strip more funding away from smaller populated states like Wyoming. Senator Thomas believes that rural states also face risks. By taking away federal funding for Wyoming and other less populated states, the government is turning a blind eye to safety of rural America. Senator Thomas is working with colleagues to ensure the Homeland Security funding formula doesn't rob rural states to give urban states a greater share. Many urban areas have yet to use all of their Homeland Security Funding, but have argued in the Senate for a bigger piece of the pie.
