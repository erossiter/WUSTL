NEW AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SWORN IN
  "I look forward to working with Secretary Johanns on the agricultural issues that are of utmost importance to the nation and Wyoming," said Sen.  
 Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. 
   Former Nebraska Governor, Mike Johanns, was sworn in today as the 28th Secretary of Agriculture. Johanns takes over for Ann Veneman, who has been appointed as the next Executive Director of United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). 
   "In my discussions with him, he had a clear notion about where he wants lead our agricultural community. His vision for the future is one that will have a positive impact on Wyoming's ranchers and agricultural producers. The new Secretary will be a help to me in dealing with rural agricultural issues and with legislation to support country-of-origin labeling (COOL)," Thomas said. Wyoming's senior Senator is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   "Johanns can deal strongly with trade issues, not only in terms of opening markets, but in protecting the interests of sensitive products, such as sugar beets. His responses during the hearing make me believe he understands our point of view and will utilize his rural background to address my concerns. As Governor of Nebraska, he has shown great leadership on agricultural trade issues and dealing with problems such as drought. I know he'll be dedicated to the needs of rural states," Thomas said. 
   Secretary Johanns was confirmed by the Senate Agriculture Committee yesterday, and was the first of President Bush's new cabinet secretaries to take office.
