SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON ABANDONED MINE LAND FEE
  SEN. CRAIG THOMAS ON ABANDONED MINE LAND FEE:  
   "If we're not able to fix the underlying reclamation program, my preference is to allow the fee to expire. The money collected has never been fully appropriated. It doesn't seem responsible to continue to collect a fee when it's not being distributed as the law provides. States are currently owed $1.1 billion, of which, $450 million is owed to the state of Wyoming," Sen. Thomas said. 
   In the spirit of cooperation with other members, Thomas agreed to have the fee extended through 2007 so that all the parties can use the time to come up with a reasonable solution that includes addressing Wyoming's priorities. 
   "Wyoming's share will continue to grow until the program can be modernized," Thomas said. "I'll continue to reach out to members to find a mutually agreeable solution. It's a challenging issue, but it's time to get it resolved." 
   The Abandoned Mine Land reclamation program was created by the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The program is funded by fees collected on every ton of coal mined in the United States. Existing law has always credited half of the fee to States and Indian tribes, and half to the federal government. That provision remains in effect today. 
   Currently, the AML fee has been extended to September 2007.
