AGRICULTURE SECRETARY HEEDS SEN. THOMAS' WARNING ON CANADIAN BEEF
 "This is a big win for our cattle producers and for ensuring the safety of our food supply.  
 I'm relieved that Secretary Johanns responded to my warning about potentially harmful beef coming into our country," said Sen. Craig Thomas today. 
   Johanns made the decision today to delay the effective date for allowing imports of meat from Canadian cattle 30 months and older. 
   "This move is about safety and it's about consumer confidence," said Thomas, R-Wyo. "I told Secretary Johanns about my concerns and this delay makes the most sense in light of the ongoing investigation into BSE in Canada," Thomas explained. 
   "I co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Burns to prevent the importation of beef from cattle 30 months and older until completion of a USDA investigation. The move today by Johanns does this very thing," Thomas said. 
  "I always believed this was a reasonable approach based on the recent discoveries of BSE in Canadian cattle," Thomas said. "We raised the level of awareness about the need to immediately address this problem. The Secretary heard my concerns and took action." 
   Thomas, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, met with Secretary Mike Johanns last week to discuss his concerns and ask for answers about beef trade. "Now, we need to make certain that Canada is complying with their own safeguards for preventing the spread of mad cow," Thomas said.
