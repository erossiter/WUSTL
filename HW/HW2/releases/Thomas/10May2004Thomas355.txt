STATEMENT BY SEN. THOMAS: IRAQI RESOLUTION CONDEMNING PRISONER ABUSE
  The following is a statement by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on the Senate passage today of Senate Resolution #356 condemning the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, urging a full and complete resolution to ensure justice is served and expressing support for all Americans serving nobly in Iraq. Sen. Thomas voted in favor of the resolution which was adopted 92-0.  
   "I am very disappointed and troubled by the events at Abu Ghraib prison. As Americans, we hold ourselves to a higher standard and the appalling actions of those responsible for the treatment of Iraqi detainee's falls far below those standards. Our credibility has been called into question by those we are trying to help, as well as the rest of the world. These incidents of cruelty and mistreatment are inexcusable. Unfortunately, the foolish actions of a few have cast a pall on the hundreds of thousands of American military personnel who continue to do a job with great honor, courage and commitment. 
   "These terrible events have dealt a blow to our cause of building a free and democratic Iraq. Our task is to win in Iraq and to win at home. We will hold accountable those who are responsible for these actions. As a nation, we must act deliberately to correct the situation, and to insure it will not happen again. We must also encourage our military leaders to identify how the chain of command broke down and implement corrective measures. We need to get the facts out in an open and transparent manner, and we need to hold wrongdoers accountable. This resolution will help us identify those responsible, and begin the process to move forward with our mission of rebuilding Iraq and winning the war on terrorism."
