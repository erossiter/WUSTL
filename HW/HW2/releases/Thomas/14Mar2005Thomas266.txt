SEN. THOMAS INTRODUCES BILL TO EXTEND GLENDO WATER CONTRACTS
  Sen. Craig Thomas introduced legislation late last week to extend the Glendo Reservoir water storage contracts for Wyoming and Nebraska irrigation districts until December 31, 2007.  
   "This bill gives the Wyoming irrigation districts access to water in Glendo Reservoir," Thomas said. "For farmers and ranchers, especially in southeast Wyoming, water from Glendo is vital to their livelihood," Thomas said. 
   The move also allows Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado to continue to negotiate with the Department of Interior on a recovery program for endangered species along the Platte River. "I'm confident the states can come to an agreement soon and this will allow irrigators to keep using water until that process is complete and into the future," Thomas said. 
   The water contracts were originally set to expire in 1998 and have been extended twice. The current contract expires at the end of this year. Five irrigation districts in Wyoming and four in Nebraska are affected by the legislation. 
  Thomas, R-Wyo., has been the original sponsor of a bill to extend the Glendo Reservoir water storage contracts twice in the past. 
   The irrigation districts in both Wyoming and Nebraska are in favor of extending the contracts, as is the state of Nebraska. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., as well as Nebraska Sens. Chuck Hagel and Ben Nelson.
