SEN. THOMAS OFFERS REFLECTIONS ON 9-11 ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) made the following statement regarding the third anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  
   "We have had three difficult years since our homeland was attacked. During this time, the world has discovered what we here in our country have always known - America is unbreakable. We were shaken on that bright morning, but we have picked up the pieces. 
   "We have done our best to make our country and the world a safer place. We have accomplished much, freeing millions of people from tyranny, and bringing terrorists to justice. But we are not finished. We will continue to fight this war on terrorism, and we will never forget the terrible attacks of September 11. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the victims and their families."
