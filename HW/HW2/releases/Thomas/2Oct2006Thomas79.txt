SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DIRECTOR BOMAR CONFIRMATION
  Sen. Craig Thomas on Bomar:  
   "In the short time we've had to get acquainted, I've been very impressed with her openness and willingness to take on tough issues. With that kind of determination, I'm confident she'll be an excellent leader for the parks. Her written responses to me on a number of hot button issues facing parks in Wyoming certainly showed an aptitude and resolve to safeguard our nation's treasures," said Thomas, the Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. 
   "As we get moving on projects to celebrate the NPS centennial in 2016, I'm excited about the prospect of the Centennial Challenge. Together with the President, the Interior Secretary, and our new parks director my hope is to craft a plan that promotes high-quality experiences for park visitors and provides necessary improvements to numerous park units," Thomas said.
