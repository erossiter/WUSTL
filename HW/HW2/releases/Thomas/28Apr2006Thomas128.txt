SEN. THOMAS ANNOUNCES MAJOR ENERGY PACKAGE
  A group of senators led by Sen. Craig Thomas will offer a package of energy solutions Monday that will have a significant impact in reducing fuel prices in the nation.  
   "We want to lay out a clear path of commonsense energy provisions that will lower fuel prices," Thomas said. "We're serious about improving our energy outlook. And while it won't happen overnight, it simply won't happen at all without the will to enact the legislation to get us there." 
   Proposed Energy Solutions: 
   1. Refining Capacity - Ease the permitting process for new construction of refineries 
   2. Oil and Gas Production on Outer Continental Shelf - significant resource to increase domestic production 
   3. ANWR - One million barrels of oil per day 
   4. Long-term contract purchase authority - Would authorize DoD to enter into alternative fuel purchase agreement over the long term; creates a market for alternative fuel industry 
   5. Liquefied Natural Gas terminals - Repeal provisions that have blocked construction of these essential facilities 
   6. Marginal Wells - Expand opportunities to increase domestic well production at existing fields 
   7. Accelerated depreciation and bonding authority for the construction of oil and gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines 
   Thomas plans to unveil a package of bills on Monday to develop domestic resources and cut through bureaucracy holding up ways to improve our energy outlook and lower fuel prices. 
   A group of senators will join Thomas in the proposed energy package, which will take concrete steps toward a nation less dependent on foreign oil, while achieving lower fuel prices. 
   "If Clinton hadn't vetoed ANWR 10 years ago, we wouldn't have oil prices skyrocketing to more than $70 a barrel today," Thomas said. 
   "I have a serious approach to addressing our nation's energy outlook," Thomas said. "Now it's time to get it done."
