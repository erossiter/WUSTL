DROUGHT STRICKEN PRODUCERS TO GET MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE
  In response to growing concerns about the impact of drought across the West, Department of Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman has declared three counties in Wyoming as contiguous disaster counties.  
 These counties have acquired this designation because they are contiguous with counties in Nebraska that have received the disaster designation. 
   "Wyoming is in its fifth year of drought, and despite the recent rains across the state, the ramifications of these drought-ridden seasons continue to impact Wyoming's producers. Mother Nature does not discriminate. We must continue to work together to improve the conditions throughout the West," Thomas said. "As long as this drought continues, I will continue to urge Secretary Veneman and the Department of Agriculture to designate other Wyoming counties disaster areas under this program." 
   The disaster designation will allow farm operators in Goshen, Laramie, and Niobrara counties to apply for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), provided eligibility requirements are met. FSA will consider each loan application on its own merits, taking into account the extent of losses, security available, and repayment ability. 
   In accordance with the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, counties that are attached to primary natural disaster counties may be designated as contiguous disaster counties, such as the case with the three Wyoming counties. 
   Local FSA offices can provide affected farmers with further information.
