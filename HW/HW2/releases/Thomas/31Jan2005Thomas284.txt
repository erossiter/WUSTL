SEN. THOMAS: SAMUEL BODMAN A CLEAR CHOICE FOR ENERGY SECRETARY
  "Dr. Bodman is the clear choice for our nation as we face tremendous energy and national security issues today," said Sen.  
 Craig Thomas after the hearing for Samuel W. Bodman to become Secretary of Energy. 
   "I believe his education and experience as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Deputy Secretary of Commerce as well as the knowledge he gained in the private sector, gives him a solid foundation to be an effective Energy Secretary," Thomas said. 
   The responsibilities of the Department of Energy are extremely diverse and complex - ranging from national security, energy policy, and science and technology, to environmental management. 
   The Senate Energy Committee met last week to consider the nomination of Bodman to be Secretary of Energy before the Senate voted to confirm Bodman by unanimous consent. 
   "We've worked diligently to pass an energy bill, but the time is now to buckle down and finally pass a comprehensive energy policy," Thomas said. "We must strive for our nation's energy independence. In 2003, Wyoming ranked 6th in the nation in proved reserves of crude oil, 2nd in natural gas, and 3rd in coal reserves, so I happen to think energy independence is achievable," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas asked Bodman to give special attention to the use of coal and the need to develop technologies to make coal cleaner and more efficient. "Most importantly, we need your commitment to continue coal research and development," Thomas said.
