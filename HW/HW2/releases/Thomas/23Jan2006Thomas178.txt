SEN. THOMAS: F.E. WARREN MISSILE STOCKPILE IS NECESSARY
  Continuing his advocacy for the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) met today with U.S. Marine Corps General James Cartwright, Commander of U.S Strategic Command, to discuss the role of ICBMs in the forthcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. 
   "What we have seen, and what General Cartwright confirmed today, is that the ICBM force remains very relevant to the defense of this nation," Thomas said. "We continue to work with the Pentagon to ensure that land based missiles are part of a modern national defense that focuses not only on protecting us from the dangers of non-affiliated terrorist enemies, but also rouge nation states now and into the foreseeable future. Numerous studies have shown that the 500 missile threshold is appropriate at this point in time." 
   "The missile mission at F.E Warren is important, not only to the defense of our nation, but to Cheyenne and Wyoming. I will continue my work with the Pentagon and the Air Force to modernize the facilities and capabilities to ensure its long term sustainability of the base," Thomas said. 
   F.E. Warren currently houses 150 missiles. 
   Thomas was joined at the meeting by Senators Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).
