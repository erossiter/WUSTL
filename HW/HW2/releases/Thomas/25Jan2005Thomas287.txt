SEN. THOMAS EARNS 'NATIONAL PARKS ACHIEVEMENT AWARD'
  Wyoming's senior Senator was recognized as one of the most visible proponents in the nation for our national parks. Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) was presented with the National Parks Achievement Award today by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). Thomas received the high honor for his leadership as the Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee and for his many efforts to improve visitors' experiences like the Grand Teton Pathway system.  
   "Wyoming is blessed to be home to Grand Teton and Yellowstone, the crown jewels of the national parks system. My work reflects a commitment to these parks and the entire parks system. We have accomplished a great deal, but there is much more that I plan to do. I will continue my efforts in Congress to protect our nation's treasures while enhancing visitor experiences and maintaining fiscal discipline," Thomas said. 
   Tom Kiernan, President of the NPCA said, "Senator Thomas has made the Grand Teton Pathway Project possible and plays a critical leadership role in focusing important attention to the overall fiscal distress that our national parks are facing. We are privileged to recognize his important contributions for the parks." 
   The Park Achievement Award recognizes outstanding efforts by an individual, group, or entity whose singular accomplishments or actions in a specific locality or region, or on the national level on behalf of the National Park System, are worthy of public recognition. The award may also be presented to individuals on behalf of a specific accomplishment or their sustained contributions over a period of years. 
   The NPCA is the only private, nonprofit, advocacy organization dedicated to educating the public about our national parks and protecting, preserving, and enhancing the U.S. National Park System.
