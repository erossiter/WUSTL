SEN. THOMAS SAYS BEEF EXPORTS TO JAPAN NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
 During a phone call from the agriculture secretary today, Sen. Craig Thomas said the failure on the part of USDA inspectors to uphold the beef export agreement with Japan needs immediate attention.  
   "We're standing on pretty shaky footing if our inspectors won't do their job," Thomas told Mike Johanns today. "We've worked very hard to reopen the Japanese market to U.S. beef to let sloppy inspections threaten one of our most significant trading partners." 
   "Secretary Johanns assured me that he was taking the matter very seriously and taking action to ensure that the beef being shipped to Japan complies with our agreement." 
   "Asia represents a very large portion of the market for our beef and Japan is the largest part of that market. The road to reopening trade is a long one and we can ill-afford to undercut those efforts. It's unfortunate that we are facing this hurdle just as we achieved some gains in opening up beef trade with South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
   Currently, the United States has an agreement with Japan to only export beef containing no spinal column and bone tissues. 
   In a related but separate issue, Thomas has called for a hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee on the failure of USDA to investigate anti-competitive market behavior of meatpackers under the Packers and Stockyards Act. In a letter to the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Thomas said widespread inaction and mismanagement in conducting investigations into anti-competitive market behavior requires more oversight. 
   Thomas is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee. Thomas efforts have been vital in the reopening of beef trade with Asian markets.
