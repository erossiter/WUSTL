SEN. THOMAS DEMANDS CONSUMER PROTECTION AGAINST MAD COW DISEASE
  "Because of serious safety issues regarding beef coming from Canada, I am introducing two bills to safeguard consumers and protect our country from importing diseased beef," said Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   "Before the USDA opens our borders to Canadian beef, we need to ensure the safety of beef imports arriving at our meat counters," Thomas said. "There are safety issues that remain about beef coming in from Canada and we need to take additional steps to protect our consumers from mad cow disease," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is working with fellow Senators to sponsor legislation to set strict limits on beef product imports due to the danger of mad cow disease. The Senate Agriculture Committee will hold an oversight hearing regarding questions about mad cow disease on Feb. 3. 
   Thomas is also working with colleagues to reintroduce a bill to implement mandatory country-of origin labeling, or COOL, by October 2005. "Consumers need to know where their products are made. When you go to the meat counter you ought to know where your steaks come from. Surely safety should be one of the consumers' first rights to choose," Thomas said. 
   "Any controversy over COOL should not delay protection of our border from what has become an obvious problem in Canada," Thomas said. "We need to take immediate action to protect our food supply and give consumers the ability to make informed choices about their beef," Thomas said.
