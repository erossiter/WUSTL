SENATE OKS SALE OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LAND TO GREEN RIVER
A bill authored by Sen. Craig Thomas' that passed the Senate late last week will allow the City of Green river to purchase 132 acres of identified Bureau of Land Management land.  
 The additional land will allow the city to expand and take steps to address the need for more housing that have become necessary due to increased energy development. Green River is, in effect, surrounded on all sides by BLM land. 
 "The folks of Green River are running out of room to meet the needs of their families and their community and this option allows Green River the opportunity to expand," Thomas said. "With increased energy production and jobs there is rapid growth and more people. Our cities and towns need some breathing room." 
 The Thomas bill, S. 2373, directs the BLM to sell 132 identified acres to the City of Green River for fair market value. Sen. Mike Enzi co-sponsored the legislation. 
 After originally arranging for BLM land experts to look into the proposed sale, Thomas saw an opportunity to push the sale forward after being approached by city officials from Green River about the need for more land. 
 "With the amount of expansion being seen in Southwest Wyoming, it's important to help local governments get a hold of their growth. There needs to be equal focus on planning for our energy development and planning for the growth that it brings," Thomas said. 
 The bill passed the Senate the evening of Thursday, Dec. 7, and awaits approval by the House. 
 "Measures like this one originate from working closely with officials in Wyoming to address issues important to local communities," Thomas said.
