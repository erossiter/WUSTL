SEN. THOMAS: 'PREBLE'S MOUSE LISTING NEVER MADE SENSE'
  "After seven years of debating a bad idea, the common sense trap finally caught the mouse.  
 The Preble's mouse never should have been designated as threatened or endangered; it simply didn't make sense. Advances in genetics have clearly shown that the Preble's mouse is not a distinct species that should be listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Preble's mouse listing is a good example of the problems with the ESA - it created unnecessary regulation at the expense of people in southeastern Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced this afternoon its decision to remove the Preble's meadow jumping mouse from the Endangered Species List. The mouse inhabits Albany, Laramie, Platte, Goshen, and Converse counties in Wyoming. 
   Thomas has been an outspoken proponent of endangered species reform and has sponsored legislation that would improve the implementation of ESA.
