DELEGATION GOES TO BAT FOR WYOMING TRONA INDUSTRY
  Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi and Rep. Barbara Cubin (All R-Wyo.) recently sent a letter to Philip Merrill, President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im). The Ex-Im is considering financing the purchase of U.S equipment and services in order to build a trona plant in Turkey. The delegation maintains that construction of the plant would have disastrous consequences for Wyoming's trona industry. In the letter, the Wyoming Congressional Delegation spoke on behalf of the trona industry's importance to Wyoming, particularly in Sweetwater County.
