SEN. THOMAS: WYOMING'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING
  Reviewing the latest economic numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said today the nation's economy and job base is vibrant and growing with 34 consecutive months of job growth.  
   "Wyoming continues to push the envelope in providing high quality jobs to folks throughout the state. Our energy sector is paving the way for our state's robust economy, and we continue to look for new ways to increase Wyoming's payrolls," Thomas said. 
   Since August 2003, the economy has created nearly 5.4 million jobs (121,000 new jobs in June). The economy has experienced 34 consecutive months of job growth and is creating better jobs in high-wage fields. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, lower than the averages of the last four decades. Wyoming has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 3.3 percent. The state's employee workforce increased by 8,400 in the month of June. 
   "I am confident that we will continue to see jobs added across the nation. Our job market is full of variety and everyone can have a job if they want one. We have seen that in the face of unprecedented disasters, Americans bond together to form a solid workforce that is anxious to rebuild and move forward." 
   Thomas is a member of both the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Energy Committee.
