SEN. THOMAS: TAIWAN OPENS BORDER TO U.S. BEEF
  Taiwan has announced today that it has opened its border to U.S. beef, following the Asian markets of South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore.  
   "In our ongoing efforts for fair trade, it's important to strive for opening markets to U.S. beef. Our beef is safe and our country follows rigorous scientific guidelines to ensure a quality product," U.S. Senator Craig Thomas said. 
   "With Japan recently shutting its door to our exports due to the discovery of spinal material in one shipment of beef, it's good to rebound with the news about Taiwan. This isolated case, involving a strict agreement with Japan, shouldn't hinder beef exports of the safest meat in the world." 
   In 2003, the United States exported more than $76 million worth of beef to Taiwan, with boneless beef products accounting for $56 million. Taiwan's market is now open to more than 90 percent of total U.S. ruminant and ruminant products whose value reached $325 million in 2003. After the discovery of a BSE-infected cow in the United States, $4.8 billion worth of U.S. beef and beef product exports were banned. Markets accounting for $3.8 billion have since been recovered. 
   "We need to continue to look for avenues that promote fair trade, with fewer restrictions," Thomas said. "The USDA has crafted a solid set of procedures to ensure the safety of our beef exports." 
   Thomas has been a strong advocate for opening Asian markets since the decision to ban U.S. beef in 2003. In addition to being a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he is the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee. 
   Since the first border closure in 2003, the U.S. beef industry has lost about $6 billion in income.
