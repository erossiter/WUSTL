SEN. THOMAS TOUCHES ON UW'S ROLE IN RURAL HEALTH
  As he marks the opening of the UW Health Science Center in Laramie today, Sen. Craig Thomas will highlight the University of Wyoming's role in the continuing efforts to shore up fragile rural health care networks.  
   "Improving rural health care is one of my top priorities for Wyoming. I met with rural health leaders this past spring seeking their ideas about the future. It's clear we need affordable, quality rural health care services and UW's efforts are a great beginning. Their efforts will serve to fill the gaps that currently exist in our rural health network," Thomas said today at the dedication of the new facility. 
   "My vision for the future requires a strong rural health network. We have many challenges because of high suicide rates, substance abuse, and diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. The UW Health Science Center will train allied health professionals to deliver comprehensive care across a wide range of specialties." 
   "Cross-training students in many health care disciplines will improve health care options for Wyoming folks in need of a wide range of services offered from a single location. Rural folks have been forced to travel long distances for specialty care. With the UW bridging the gap of services, our rural health network can only improve. UW educational opportunities are critical as we look to our state's future needs and combat workforce shortages in Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is the Chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus. He continues to be instrumental in providing rural health care specific funding for the nation and the state of Wyoming. He put back into the budget $100 million in rural health care funding this year when the Senate budget was passed. All of the funding levels for rural health programs were at equal or higher levels from the previous year. The measures are currently pending on the Senate floor.
