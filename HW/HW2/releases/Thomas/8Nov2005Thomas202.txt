SEN. THOMAS: GULF RESIDENTS COMMITTED TO RECOVERY
  After a visit to New Orleans to witness firsthand people knee deep in recovery efforts, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas said residents are committed to recovery - even close to the levy. 
   "We visited the 9th Ward to see a family whose home is right next to the levy. They are as committed to rebuilding their home in New Orleans as anyone else. I walked through the family's home with the mother -- their property is still in complete shambles from the flooding. The devastation is simply amazing," Thomas said. 
   "I continue to believe we need a comprehensive plan in place for recovery. There needs to be an established list of priorities to accomplish for the region. There are limits to what the federal government can provide as we move forward." 
   "There needs to be assurance that the levy will be secure. But we need to remember that this was not as simple as a levy failure - it was one of the most dramatic hurricane force events our nation has seen." 
   "I was impressed by the local efforts in New Orleans. We need to continue to assist with the recovery in the Gulf region. Their port is important for both agriculture and energy interests. The recovery of their economic infrastructure is a broad concern that needs to be addressed as quickly as possible."
