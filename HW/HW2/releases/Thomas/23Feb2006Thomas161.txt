SEN. THOMAS: WYOMING'S SUGAR BEET INDUSTRY LOOKING FORWARD
  In a tour of the Great Western Sugar Cooperative's Torrington plant today, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) had a positive meeting with factory officials and says he is encouraged about Wyoming's sugar industry.  
   "What I saw today, and what I have seen in the past, is that Wyoming's sugar industry is moving in the right direction. We have a significant opportunity in the next few years to really plant our sugar beet producers at the forefront of the industry," Thomas said 
   "As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am in the fortunate position of helping to create the upcoming Farm Bill. The folks in Torrington do good work, and I will work to include their interests in the agriculture bill," Thomas said. 
   "One of the unique things about the Torrington plant is that it operates on Wyoming coal and natural gas; it is a study in the collaborative effort of Wyoming's agriculture industry using Wyoming's energy industry to produce a high-quality product," Thomas said. "I will do my best to ensure that Wyoming sugar has a broad market to appeal to." 
   Last year, Senator Thomas opposed the Administration and USDA officials by voting against the Central American Free Trade Act (CAFTA). CAFTA put Wyoming's 181 sugar beet producers in financial peril. Thomas, who is Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, said at the time, "I'm disappointed that a line has been drawn in the sand and there has been a lack of communication on the part of sugar and a lack of communication on the part of the Administration. It makes it difficult to find some common ground." 
   Thomas met with Derrel Boll, the factory manager, along with two division managers. The Senate Agriculture Committee will take up reauthorization of the Farm Bill in 2007.
