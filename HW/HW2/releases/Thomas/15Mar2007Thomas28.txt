SEN. THOMAS: GOP TURNS AWAY DEMOCRAT IRAQ BILL
  In turning back an ill-advised resolution on Thursday, March 15,seeking to undercut our military's efforts in Iraq, Sen. Craig Thomas made the following statement:  
   "This is a critical time for our troops and our country. As a Marine I cannot imagine being in combat while members of Congress try to act like field generals," Thomas said. "But that's what the Democrat leaders are doing." 
   "We just sent General Petraeus to Iraq a few weeks ago and already some in Congress want to say the new plan is failure before it even gets started. It's ridiculous. Today we debated the Democrats' seventeenth resolution on Iraq - that's seventeen times in a few weeks they've sought to dictate military policy based on polling data." 
   "I believe everyone sincerely appreciates our troops and knows they are doing all they can for our country. But Congress should not try to micromanage the war from offices in the Capitol." 
   "Our time should be spent working with our military leaders to provide them the tools to get the job done. We should also be fully engaged with the leadership of Iraq to ensure they are taking the steps to take control of their country. Unfortunately, many of these resolutions are aimed at 2008 presidential politics and are sending the message to our troops that we do not believe they can complete the mission," Thomas said. 
   The Senate turned back S.J. Res 9, the Reid Iraq Resolution, 48-50, which sought to restrict the ability of the Commander-in-Chief's use of force. 
   The Senate approved S. Res. 107, the Murray Iraq Resolution, 96-2, which says Congress should provide funds for training, equipment and other support for troops in the field; and health care to those who have served. 
   The Senate also approved S. Con. Res. 20, the Gregg funding resolution, 80-16, which says Congress should not eliminate or reduce funds for troops in the field.
