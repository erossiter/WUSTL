SEN. THOMAS JOINS EFFORT TO ENSURE VOTE ON ANTI-TERROR AMENDMENTS
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-WY, today joined a Republican effort to ensure that the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on a variety of security related amendments that Democrats have refused to consider. Sen. Craig Thomas signed a letter to invoke cloture on the amendments, which will halt debate on the provisions and enable the Senate to vote.  
   "These amendments are vital to the security of our nation, and should be a part of the 9/11 Recommendations bill," Thomas said. "While Democrats are busy appeasing unions and offering amendments that have nothing to do with the 9/11 study panel's recommendations, we are moving forward with commonsense legislation that will better protect our nation. The time for being shut out of this debate is over." 
   The amendments will help prevent terrorists and criminals from entering our country, expedite the deportation of criminal aliens, and increase penalties for supporting terrorism. 
   The provisions include: 
   * Making it a crime to recruit people to commit terrorist acts; 
   * Increasing the maximum penalties for existing offenses regarding the material support of terrorism; 
   * Making it a federal offense to aid the family or associates of a terrorist with the intent to encourage terrorist acts; 
   * Prohibiting judicial review of decisions to revoke visas from individuals who are on U.S. soil; 
   * Allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain criminal aliens during pending removal proceedings and after removal has been ordered, until criminal aliens can actually be removed; 
   * Expanding the terrorism hoax statute so that it punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense listed in the official list of terrorist offenses; and, 
   * Increasing the maximum penalties for perpetrating a hoax about the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during wartime.
