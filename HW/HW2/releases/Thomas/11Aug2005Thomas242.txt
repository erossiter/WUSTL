SEN. THOMAS: HIGHWAY BILL MEANS JOBS FOR WYOMING
  "I'm pleased the highway bill has now become law and that the Wyoming Delegation was able to secure $102 million for WyDOT's top highway priorities.  
 The highway bill allocated $1.25 billion to Wyoming over five years. The delegation's role was to secure as much funding as possible for Wyoming's highways. WyDOT has the best idea of which projects deserve top priority in the state," said Wyoming's senior senator. "This means a great many jobs for Wyoming folks - both in trucking industries and construction." 
   "It was good to see this bill come through this Congress. During the 108th Congress, I was a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee - I worked very hard to ensure Wyoming would receive its fair share of funding through the allocation formula."
   "Wyoming has a short construction season, so now that the transportation folks know they have funding available, projects can get started. Federal funds account for nearly 70 percent of WyDOT's Highway Construction budget. I believe this funding will provide some certainty for Wyoming and help the department (DOT) plan for their long-term needs," Thomas said.
