ENERGY PRICE ACT TACKLES HIGH FUEL PRICES
  With an aggressive approach to improve our domestic energy supply and lower fuel costs, Sen. Craig Thomas today introduced the Energy PRICE Act of 2006.  
   "This plan lays out commonsense energy provisions to increase supply and better our infrastructure to lower fuel prices," Thomas said. "This solid foundation of energy proposals builds upon the best ideas my colleagues and I set out in the Energy Policy Act of 2005." 
   "We're looking at conservation, efficiency, refining, and production measures. I'm serious about improving our nation's energy outlook and so are my colleagues whose provisions are included in the package." 
   Thomas conferred with a number of other senators and sought the inclusion of their proposals in support of the overall package in addition to his own provisions. 
   "Nobody is going to change fuel prices overnight - and the same folks who have defeated measures like these in the past are the real cause of high prices," Thomas said. 
   Here is a snapshot of the proposals:
