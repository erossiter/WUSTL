SEN. THOMAS REITERATES NEED TO BETTER AUDIT PACKERS
  Sen. Craig Thomas wants the USDA to take responsibility for the auditing and conduct of meatpackers. 
   "It's USDA's responsibility to ensure there's responsible oversight of the industry. What we learned through hearings was that the audits are not being done," Thomas said. "We have suffered long enough with inadequate protection for producers and consumers - I believe it's time for that to change." 
   Thomas co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), S. 622, to establish an Office of Special Counsel at USDA to investigate and prosecute livestock competition abuses.  
   Thomas requested an Agriculture Committee hearing last year on the Packers and Stockyards Act to provide oversight of the auditing process. During the hearing he asserted the extent of the problem and that there was no excuse for these audits not to have taken place. 
   "We need fair competition in livestock markets," Thomas said. "There needs to be transparency in how the packers are conducting business. What is most concerning is that the packers have become too concentrated. If our local ranchers can only market to huge meatpackers who appear to be coordinating prices with each other - there's definitely something wrong." 
   "A handful of large packers are asserting control over the market causing a serious disadvantage to our family-run ranches. The fact that the meatpackers could be controlling prices makes me wonder if they're getting too big for their britches," Thomas said. 
   Currently, the Deputy Administrator at USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) oversees the Packers and Stockyards program and has the responsibility of enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act. GIPSA personnel responsible for investigating violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act would be transferred to The Office of Special Counsel. This position will also serve as a liaison between the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission and will be appointed by the President and approved by the United States Senate. 
   The bill also makes a number of changes to the Packers and Stockyards Act and Agricultural Fair Practices Act to provide additional protections for livestock producers in their dealings with packers. 
   It would: 
   * Establish an Office of Special Counsel at USDA to investigate and prosecute violations on competition matters. 
   * Prohibit unfair or deceptive practices by a person that affects the marketing, receiving, purchasing, sale or contracting of any agricultural commodity. 
   * Make it unlawful for a processor to not act in good faith with producers regarding agricultural contracts. 
   * Give producers contract protections against confidentiality clauses, premature termination, unfair capital investments and arbitration provisions. 
   * Strengthen the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by clarifying the definition of unfair practices committed by packers. 
   * Remove a disclaimer clause in the Agricultural Fair Practices Act that currently allows processors the ability to not bargain in good faith with producers who belong to a cooperative marketing association. 
   "This anti-competitive behavior is just another way for packers to strong-arm their suppliers. USDA should be rebuffing this kind of behavior, but it's obvious to me it's not getting done," Thomas said. 
   "I'm supportive of an effort to re-establish the intent of the Packers and Stockyards Act. We need to protect livestock producers from the packers and provide USDA with the tools to better enforce the standards."
