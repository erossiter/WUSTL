  Sen. Craig Thomas has made an audio statement available today on this web site. 
   Here is the text of the statement:  
   "First off, Susan and I want everyone to know how thankful we are for the thoughts and prayers we've received from folks across Wyoming and around the country. I'm doing good and feeling great. My doctors are encouraged with how well I'm responding to treatment and, in fact, my doctors are amazed that I continue to do 60 push-ups a day. 
   "I wanted to thank you personally for your support in the re-election, and your support for my current fight. 
   "I'm thankful for everyone's kind words and well wishes. The cards and letters have certainly been an encouraging thing. 
   "Wyoming people always show so much "heart" during these times. 
   "After a week of chemotherapy, my doctors say I have exceeded benchmarks they have set for me. I'll be moving forward with treatment in the weeks ahead with my sights set on getting back to the Senate before the start of the 110th Congress. 
   "There's much to do in the coming session and I remain committed to an aggressive agenda. 
   "I don't expect the changes in Congress to affect my pursuit of common sense legislation for rural health care, energy, public lands, and improvements to our national parks. 
   "By continuing strong relationships with like-minded senators from both parties, I'm optimistic about delivering results on the most important issues facing Wyoming and the West."
