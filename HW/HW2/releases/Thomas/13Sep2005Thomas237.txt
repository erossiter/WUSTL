SEN. THOMAS CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION OF GAS PRICES
  "Rising gas prices just after Hurricane Katrina are more than suspicious and demand investigation.  
 I want to know how retail gas prices are being set and what the ongoing impact will be for Americans, including Wyoming families and businesses. We called for answers before the Hurricane, and I'm demanding answers for the people now," Sen. Craig Thomas said. 
   "The Federal Trade Commission should do everything in its power to protect consumers against unfair manipulation of gas prices. The public deserves some answers. They deserve to know that any improper behavior will be dealt with quickly," Thomas said. 
   Thomas and members of the Senate Energy Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras citing unprecedented retail energy prices. The hearing prompted Thomas to become even more skeptical about how retail gas prices are being determined. 
   A report is expected to Congress no later than November 6, 2005. The FTC is expected to issue interim reports of its findings.
