WYOMING OUTFITTER TESTIFIES ABOUT WILD AND SCENIC BILL
  At a Senate Energy and Natural Resources hearing today, world-renowned fisherman Jack Dennis, spoke in favor of Sen. Craig Thomas's legislation to recognize some of Wyoming's most remarkable and pristine rivers with a Wild and Scenic designation.  
   Thomas's bill, S. 1281, would designate 21 segments along 14 rivers and streams in Wyoming as "Wild and Scenic." 
   Upon bill introduction, Thomas said, "This will be a lasting legacy for Wyoming and for the visitors who enjoy the rivers, scenery, fishing, and wildlife we have at our disposal. These rivers generate millions of dollars annually to the state of Wyoming and will contribute to the economic stability of our local economies." 
   Dennis, a well known Wyoming guide, outfitter, and fly fishing author, talked about his vast experience with rivers around the country and the world, noting the importance of raising awareness about the state's rivers. 
   Dennis said that the designation is not only good for rivers, it's good for river users who fish and float the waters. In addition, it's good for sportsmen and women who rely on healthy habitat for hunting and fishing, it's good for businesses that depend on tourism, and it's good for the state of Wyoming, he said. 
   The Snake Headwaters Legacy Act of 2007 will protect these unique rivers while ensuring that access, multiple-use, and private property rights are not restricted.
