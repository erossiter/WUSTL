SEN. THOMAS RETURNS TO WORK IN SENATE
Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that he is back to work in the United States Senate and ready to take care of business.  
 The senator was released Saturday, Dec. 2, from Bethesda National Naval Medical Center. He began treatment for leukemia on Nov. 9. 
 "I'm back, ready to vote, and looking forward to taking care of Senate business. There's much work left to do - numerous spending bills, confirmations, and work to be done before the holiday break," Thomas said. 
 "Doctors were very encouraged with how quickly I bounced back after just three weeks of treatment. I'm thankful for all the support I received along the way. Now, I've got my sights set on the people's business." 
 Dr. Brian Monahan, Director of Hematology and Medical Oncology at the National Naval Medical Center said upon the diagnosis that, "The majority of people with Craig's great physical condition and general health attain remission." 
 "I'm proud to join the thousands of other cancer survivors in Wyoming. I'm excited to return to the Senate and I'm ready to get back to work for Wyoming." 
 "Susan and I have been overwhelmed by the kind thoughts and well wishes from everyone during this time. We're so thankful for your support," Thomas said.
