SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON RELEASE OF FINAL 9-11 REPORT
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) made the following statement today regarding the release of the 9/11 Commission's final report.  
 The Commission has worked for over 20 months to arrange its findings. 
   "The 9/11 Commission has done a very comprehensive job and I am pleased with their findings. For a time, it looked like politics were going to distort the objective of the Commission. Instead, the Commission stepped above partisanship to make an objective, rational series of conclusions about what happened that tragic day nearly three years ago. 
   "The Commission has forward-thinking ideas about the future of this nation and our security, and we must continue to take all appropriate steps to ensure that their positive ideas are put into action. By learning from the past, we can look to the future to take the necessary steps to prevent another catastrophe."
