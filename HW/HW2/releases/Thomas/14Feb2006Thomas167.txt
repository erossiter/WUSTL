SEN. THOMAS SEEKS ANSWERS FROM USDA ON LARAMIE LAB
  In a letter to the USDA's Agriculture Research Service, Sen. Craig Thomas heralds the importance of the Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Laboratory (ABADRL) in Laramie to continue its mission to protect U.S. livestock amid concerns about the facility's future.  
   "I'm concerned about the apparent lack of focus by the USDA about the facility's future," Thomas said. "At a time when the scope of the work to safeguard livestock is rapidly expanding, our laboratory should be ramping up its capabilities, not downgrading them." 
   "This facility clearly belongs in Wyoming and the folks at the local, state, and federal levels should work cooperatively to ensure that ABADRL remains a significant contribution to our agricultural safety needs."
