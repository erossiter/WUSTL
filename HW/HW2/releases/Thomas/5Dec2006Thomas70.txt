SEN. THOMAS PANS FEDERAL LANDS FEE HIKE
As the Department of Interior announced an even higher fee for its America the Beautiful pass today, Sen. Craig Thomas is calling into question the program and the $80 fee for the pass.  
 "I had opposed the recreation fee being expanded beyond the national parks and now my worst fears are being realized - higher fees with no guarantee that the money is going back to the site being impacted," Thomas said. 
 "An $80 fee is certainly higher than what folks should have to pay to recreate on federal lands. My concerns about the price of the pass are echoed in a study conducted by the University of Wyoming, which showed very little tolerance for a pass priced above $70." 
 "If there's a budget problem in our land management agencies, let's get to the root of it - address it head on - and not put budget shortfalls on the backs of recreational visitors." 
 Thomas instituted the parks-only recreation fee demonstration program in 1997 that saw the beginning of the National Parks Pass. The national parks program was a successful one that put money back into sites being visited, but Thomas has cautioned against the expanded federal lands program. 
 "The public lands fee issue is very different from the parks-only version which I authored and worked hard to get implemented. My parks-only demo had widespread support," Thomas said after the rider was placed in the Omnibus Appropriations bill in late 2004 to expand the fee to all public lands. 
 Following a competitive process, the land agencies contracted with the University of Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center to collect and analyze data to assist in providing a basis for making a decision on the price of the pass. The purpose of study was to research the potential revenue implications of different price levels.
