THOMAS EXTOLS NATION'S JOB GROWTH
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) announced today that both the nation and Wyoming are creating jobs at a steady clip, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report of its final 2005 numbers.  
   Overall, the nation saw its employment coffers increase by 2 million jobs. In Wyoming, 21,400 jobs have been created since May 2003. 
   "These numbers don't lie. We are in a good place, and we have the incentive and the opportunities to keep growing. More people are buying homes, and household incomes are at an all time high. Wyoming has a 3.8 percent unemployment rate, one of the lowest in the nation," Thomas said. 
   Nationwide, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent - lower than the average of the previous three decades. 108,000 jobs were created in December, and revisions to previous months added 71,000 jobs. The economy has created more than 400,000 jobs over the last two months, over 2 million jobs over the past 12 months, and over 4.6 million since May 2003. 
   "Wyoming's economy is clearly one of the most stable in the nation, and that is reflected in our job growth. We have added to our job availability resume, and have made Wyoming more attractive to a more diverse group of people. 
   "I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to promote pro-growth legislation. These numbers didn't happen overnight; the Republican agenda and commitment to progress is clearly reflected in these employment statistics. We have worked hard over the past year, but there is much more to accomplish in 2006," Thomas said.
