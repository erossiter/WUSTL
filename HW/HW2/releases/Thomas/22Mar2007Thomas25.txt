SEN. THOMAS: BUDGET NEEDS FAR MORE TRANSPARENCY
  Sen. Craig Thomas offered an amendment to the Budget bill on Thursday, March 22, to eliminate 22 "reserve funds" which Democrats included in their budget. Reserve funds allow policy makers to identify a funding need, but not have to account for the spending anywhere in the budget. As much as $200 billion could be spent on new programs without busting the budget, according to the CBO.  
   "The Budget process is where we're supposed to make hard choices, but this budget clearly fails to do that," Thomas said. "We need increased transparency, spending restraint, and discipline in the budget process. We're supposed to identify how much to spend, instead we're asking taxpayers to sign 22 blank checks." 
   "Anyone who lives on a budget knows that it requires tough choices - choices between different priorities - that's the whole purpose of a budget," Thomas said. "This budget creates almost two dozen ways to say 'okey-dokey' to uncontrolled spending." 
   "By creating a reserve fund, Democrats are saying 'we know we have to pay for some of these things, but we'll worry about it later.' It's like counting on winning the lottery to pay your mortgage." 
   "With the 'reserve spending' and other goodies in the Budget bill it could result in a $1 trillion tax hike. I am pretty sure taxpayers would prefer we prioritized spending needs, instead of sticking them with a $1 trillion tax bill." 
   "The American public has said loud and clear that they want fiscal discipline in Washington. I heard them and I could not agree more. Perhaps some of my friends in the Senate didn't get the memo."
