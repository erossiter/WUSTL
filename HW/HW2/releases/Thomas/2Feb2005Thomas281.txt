SEN. THOMAS: IT'S TIME TO REIN IN HERITAGE AREA DESIGNATIONS
  "People are slapping 'Heritage Area' designations on places all over the country like it's free - they're not, they're up to $10 million a piece," said Sen. Craig Thomas.  
   "What started as an idea has become a program that's beginning to get out of control. We need to have criteria to recognize areas that are nationally significant, not just hand out federal labels and checks because someone thinks it's a good idea," Thomas, R-Wyo., said. 
   "In the past, some proposals introduced in Congress have recognized an entire state as a heritage area, there's certainly nothing special about that type of proposal. My plan establishes criteria to evaluate Heritage Area proposals and exercise some fiscal responsibility," said Wyoming's senior senator. 
   National Heritage Areas represent proposals initiated by local individuals to obtain Congressional recognition for their community. Often this is done as a means to promote economic development and tourism. Designated areas qualify for federal funds to promote these sites. 
   Since 1984, 27 National Heritage Areas have been created. These areas range in scope from the National Oil Heritage Area which includes a small area in Pennsylvania to one that literally engulfs the entire state of Tennessee. During this past Congress, several dozen bills were introduced to create new heritage areas around the country. Though they receive federal designation, none of the Heritage Areas establish any type of federal zoning or federal land management. 
   In response to the increasing amount of Heritage Area Designations that are making their way through Congress, Senator Thomas introduced Tuesday, S. 243, the National Heritage Area Partnership Act. The Thomas legislation would plot out a course of action for funding and establishing Heritage Areas, including: 
   * Establishing criteria for evaluating new heritage area proposals 
   * Prohibiting the use of Federal funds for acquisition of property in National Heritage Areas 
   * Establishing a National Heritage Area program within the National Park Service 
   * The use of specific language to protect private property rights 
   * Requiring the annual reporting of fund allocation and expenditure by National Heritage Areas and provides for annual audits 
   * Capping the annual appropriation for National Heritage Areas at $15 million 
   "Heritage Areas are a good idea, but right now, it's an idea that lacks focus and meanders. We need a common sense approach to recognize unique areas," Thomas said.
