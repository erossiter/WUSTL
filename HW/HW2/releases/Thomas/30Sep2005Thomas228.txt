SEN. THOMAS TARGETS ENERGY RESEARCH LEADERS
  Sen. Craig Thomas is targeting research and development education leaders at the University of Wyoming about the opportunities available within the Energy Policy Act of 2005 at an upcoming public meeting.  
   "Now that we have a broad energy policy in place, Wyoming students can be integral part of our energy economy," Thomas said. "Wyoming is the preeminent energy source for our nation. Wyoming schools should be the hub for research and development education for the industry. Our state's educators can make that happen through the expansion of critical R&D education specific to cutting edge energy technologies." 
   Thomas will hold a listening session on Oct. 13, 2005 to highlight the Energy Policy Act of 2005's research and development opportunities for higher education. 
   The public meeting will involve faculty of the Office of Research and Economic Development and the Institute of Environment and Natural Resources at University of Wyoming. The public is encouraged to attend. The time and location of the event will be determined at a later date.
