SENS. THOMAS, ENZI CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR COOL IMPLEMENTATION
  Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi (both R-Wyo), sent a letter August 12, to Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, regarding Country of Origin Labeling (COOL). The Wyoming Senators requested the Chairman oppose any efforts to delay the implementation of COOL during the fiscal year 2005 appropriations process. Sens. Thomas and Enzi said, "COOL is important because it helps consumers make informed decisions about their food purchases. It also gives ranchers and farmers the opportunity to reap the rewards of producing the highest quality agricultural products in the world."
