SENS. THOMAS, BUNNING TO CONTINUE FIGHT FOR COAL-TO-LIQUIDS
  Sens. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., and Jim Bunning, R-Ky., today were unsuccessful at including a coal-derived fuels provision on a bill aimed at increasing our nation's energy security while implementing an aggressive environmental performance standard, at a Senate Energy Committee business meeting.  
   The Thomas-Bunning coal-to-liquids amendment was defeated in the committee 12-11 along political party lines. 
   "If the goal is to increase our nation's energy security through greater domestic fuel use, there's no better way to do that than through coal-to-liquids technology. Consumers across the country want clean, affordable fuel for their cars and trucks. I believe fuel derived from coal will be the most useful, flexible fuel source for our country over the next 20 years," Thomas said. "Coal-to-Liquid technology can provide our nation with a sound way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Unfortunately, too many Democrat senators who have previously claimed to support this technology could not back up their words with action." 
   Sen. Jim Bunning said, "Our dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security and will cost families across the country who rely on their car to get to work and on electricity and gas to heat and cool their homes. Coal-to-Liquid technology will help meet a growing energy demand with a secure, cleaner, domestic fuel. We rely on our coal reserves to provide electricity to the country and we could rely on coal to power our vehicles and planes as well. I am disappointed the committee rejected our amendment, but I look forward to working with my friend Senator Thomas to offer this legislation again on the Senate floor." 
   The Energy Committee met to consider a legislative measure which incorporates four separate smaller bills which received testimony over the month of April, those bills are: 
   * S. 987 - to increase mandated amounts of renewable fuels blended into gasoline 
   * S. 1115 - to promote energy efficiency in buildings, lighting and vehicles 
   * S. 962 - to increase R&D of CO2 capture and sequestration 
   * S. 731 - to provide mapping of geology capable of sequestering CO2 injections 
   Thomas and Bunning saw S. 987 as the most problematic piece of legislation. The bill mandates a massive increase in the consumption of ethanol. The senators believe that picking a single feedstock for fuel that raises food prices, does not have sufficient infrastructure, and will not meet our nation's long-term fuel needs, is a misguided approach for an energy bill. 
   The Thomas-Bunning amendment would set a blending requirement for coal-derived fuels at 21 billion gallons by the year 2022. Although the senators believe coal-to-liquids could easily meet or exceed the amount of ethanol produced over that timeframe, the standard mirrors the current advanced biofuels standard in the bill.
