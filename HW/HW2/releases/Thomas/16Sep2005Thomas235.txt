SEN. THOMAS: WYOMING CENTRAL TO AMERICA\'S ENERGY FUTURE
  "America must learn and lead - especially in the wake of skyrocketing energy prices, Middle East conflict and the tragedy of the Hurricane Katrina disaster - to become energy independent and to do so with no more excuses, just decisive action," Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said today.  
   "It\'s not enough to talk about the future - we must act now with aggressive exploration of new technologies to achieve a more autonomous future. Wyoming is key to our national energy future and it is up to federal and state regulators to work cooperatively and with focus to help get the job done," said Thomas, one of the ranking members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   Thomas will expand on this message during his upcoming address to the Interstate Oil and Gas Commission (IOGCC) at their annual meeting in Jackson. 
   "In Wyoming, our people and families have suffered the economic boom-and-bust cycles that have dominated our history. With the passage of the Energy Policy Act, along with more key actions that must begin, we can finally take the steps we need to bring a more stable environment to our energy economy. I'm anxious to work with the members of the IOGCC and their partners to implement the needed changes - and urge them strongly to join me in taking action now," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is slated to address the group on Monday, Sept. 19 at 8 a.m. The meeting will be held at the Snow King Resort, in the Grand Room. 
   The IOGCC is a multi-state government agency that champions the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health, safety and the environment. Established by the charter member states' governors in 1935, it is the oldest, largest and most effective interstate compact in the nation.
