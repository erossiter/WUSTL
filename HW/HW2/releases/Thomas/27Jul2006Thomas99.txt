SEN. THOMAS ON JAPAN REOPENING ITS BORDER TO U.S. BEEF
  "It's certainly welcome news to see Japan once again reopen its market to U.S. beef. We've made a step in the right direction, but I believe their stipulation about allowing cattle 20-months of age or younger is far more restrictive than it should be," Sen. Craig Thomas said.  
   "While I'm pleased we didn't have to resort to sanctions against Japan yet, my hope is that their latest decision will stick and lead to more trade opportunities for our beef producers." 
   Thomas is the Chairman of the Senate Subcomittee on International Trade and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
