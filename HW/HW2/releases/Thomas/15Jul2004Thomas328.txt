SEN. THOMAS AWARDED BEST AND BRIGHTEST AWARD AMONG CONSERVATIVES
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) was recognized this week as one of the "Best and Brightest 2003" by the American Conservative Union (ACU).  
 The award is presented to members of Congress scoring 85 percent or higher in the Senate in conservative voting in the 108th Congress. 
   "I am honored by the ACU with this award," Thomas said. "To quote the late President Ronald Reagan, 'Government has an inborn tendency to grow. And, left to itself, it will grow beyond the control of the people.' President Reagan was an advocate of less government rather than big government. I believe that the battle to maintain this balance is valid and I will continue to support the initiatives to keep it so." 
   For the past 33 years, the American Conservative Union (ACU) has issued its annual Rating of Congress, widely recognized as the gold standard of conservative ratings for the United States Congress and Senate. The ACU scorecard integrates votes on economic and budget matters, social and cultural issues, defense and foreign policy concerns, and institutional reform issues to create a balanced picture of an individual Member of Congress' ideological predisposition. 
   The award is presented each year to members of Congress who are stalwart defenders of the conservative vision of individual liberty and limited constitutional government. 
   Access to the ACU Rating of Congress-including the entire Wyoming delegation-from 1971 to 2003 can be found at www.conservative.org.
