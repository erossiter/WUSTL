SEN. THOMAS: IMMIGRATION DEAL BADLY BUNGLED
  Sen. Craig Thomas said the immigration compromise recently struck in the Senate allows blanket amnesty and will cost our nation vast amounts of money in entitlement spending.  
   "Senate deal-makers have failed to make the necessary changes to enact a strong national immigration policy. What we have before us will grant amnesty at most every turn. This policy affords a path to citizenship for nearly every type of illegal immigration possible." 
   "This poorly crafted compromise will end up costing taxpayers trillions of dollars in entitlement spending. Our already straining Social Security and Medicare system will take on far more than it can handle - costing taxpayers for many years to come." 
   "The Heritage Foundation recently reported that if current adult illegal immigrants in the U.S. were granted amnesty, the net retirement costs to government, - their benefits minus taxes - will be well over $2.5 trillion." 
   "I'm against creating a special law that rewards illegal behavior by providing a path to citizenship. And I'm against this so-called compromise." 
   "I was clear at the outset of our immigration debate last year that I would oppose a bill that is either weak or allows amnesty. While there are certain limited exceptions which merit special attention, none of them make a case for blanket amnesty," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas' Priorities: 
   * Opposes amnesty in any form; 
   * Supports strengthening border security and protection; 
   * Supports mandatory electronic employment verification; and, 
   * Supports tough employer accountability provisions which increase penalties for those who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.
