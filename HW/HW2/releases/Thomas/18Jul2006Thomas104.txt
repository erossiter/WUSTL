SEN. THOMAS URGES PRESCRIPTION DRUG SYSTEM UPGRADES
  Sen. Craig Thomas urged the Administrator in charge of the Medicare prescription drug benefit to implement policies and procedures to help maintain beneficiaries' full access to Medicare coverage and to their local pharmacies.  
   Thomas and his colleagues wrote to the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mark McClellan, suggesting a series of improvements to make sure pharmacies continue to participate in the Medicare prescription drug program, providing as much convenience and access as possible for seniors nationwide. 
   "People were very skeptical about the changes to the Medicare system. But we have seen that their fears were unwarranted. And while we are all aware that the Medicare system is not perfect, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we keep it up-to-date," Thomas said. 
   "What we have seen is that the new Medicare policies are working. Thousands of seniors across Wyoming are seeing the financial benefits of our updated policies. The days of choosing between medicine and milk are over," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas has fought to make sure rural, independent and local community pharmacies, and chain drug stores, remain strong and continued partners in the Medicare drug benefit. 
   "We have different needs in rural areas, and our beneficiaries need access to the services being provided," Thomas said. 
   "As Chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I am constantly looking out for ways to improve access to high-quality health care for folks in rural Wyoming."
