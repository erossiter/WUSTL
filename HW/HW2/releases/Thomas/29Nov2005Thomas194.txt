SEN. THOMAS TO TOUR GRAND CANYON
  Sen. Craig Thomas will travel to the Grand Canyon National Park from Nov. 30 through Dec. 3 to learn about the issues facing the park including those related to high rates of visitation, concessions, recreation fees, transportation, visitor services, and maintenance backlog.  
   "It's a great chance to see the Grand Canyon first hand and get a feel for the challenges facing park managers along the Colorado River," Thomas said. 
   "One major issue unique to Grand Canyon is the Colorado River recreation management plan. Demand for rafting is heavy in the park and the number of permits available each year is limited. It's interesting to see how different managers approach the issues that face their park," Thomas said. 
   As Chairman of the National Park Subcommittee, Thomas makes regular visits to national park sites around the country.
