SEN. THOMAS ON SEN. KERRY'S RECENT COMMENTS ON MILITARY
  "Regardless of what Sen. Kerry meant to say, the comments he actually made were offensive - he needs to make a clear apology. I know from personal experience that our troops at FE Warren, Camp Guernsey, and those I have met in Afghanistan and Iraq are extremely bright and well-trained individuals. We can disagree with each other on policies, but our military personnel should never have to question our support and respect for what they do everyday to protect us."
