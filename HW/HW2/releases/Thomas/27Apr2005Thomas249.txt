SEN. THOMAS TOUTS RETIREMENT SAVINGS AFTER SOCIAL SECURITY HEARING
  "There seems to be this presumption that Social Security is retirement - it's not, it's a supplement," said Sen. Craig Thomas after the Social Security hearing in the Finance Committee Tuesday.  
   "That's why I came out with my savings plans this year, to encourage Americans to save for their own retirement. It's one leg of the three-legged retirement stool. My plan provides incentive for people to have their own savings," Thomas said. 
   The SAVE Initiative introduced by Thomas in March encourages Americans to save more money. "Allowing individuals to save money and accumulate tax-free interest is an important part of people's retirement outlook," Thomas said. 
   "As Social Security strains under increasing pressure, it's even more important that we recognize that Social Security was never intended to be a sole source of retirement income. We must provide a simpler, more responsive system for Americans to accumulate personal savings for retirement," Thomas said. 
   The savings proposals include Lifetime Savings Accounts, Retirement Savings Accounts, and Employer Retirement Savings Accounts - LSAs, RSAs, and ERSAs. The group of Senate bills, S. 545, 546, 547, were filed March 8. 
   "These go a long way toward ensuring the financial security of all Americans. It's important to address the appallingly low personal savings rate in this country," Thomas said. "Personal savings rates in the United States since 1960 have reached a new low - now at less than 2 percent. These bills will encourage savings for pre-retirement expenses as well as for retirement security," Thomas said.
