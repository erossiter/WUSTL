SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON DEATH OF ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  "Having Al-Zarqawi out of the picture is certainly a positive step as coalition forces continue to pursue an Iraq that's free from tyranny. As Americans we should continue to support our men and women in uniform - their efforts prove that we are moving toward a more stable and democratic country for the Iraqi people and the world. 
   "There has been significant progress in Iraq with the recent appointments of ministers for Defense, Interior, and National Security. These positions are vital in order to bring the country together."
