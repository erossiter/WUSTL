SUPREME COURT NOMINEE SAMUEL ALITO VISITS SEN. THOMAS'S OFFICE
  Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito visited with U.S. Senator Craig Thomas today in the senator's office, after the judiciary committee voted to refer the nominee to the full Senate.  
   "After meeting Judge Alito today, I let him know that I will vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court. He represents the kind of justice who will interpret the law with respect to the Constitution and not legislate from the bench. His judicial experience is second to none and I'm confident he will do an excellent job handling his Constitutional responsibility," Thomas said. 
   "Even though some tried to turn his hearing into a show, Judge Alito demonstrated his vast knowledge of the law. After more than 700 questions over an 18-hour period, this skillful, fair-minded judge has cut through any partisan stunts to prove his fitness to serve our highest court," the senator said.
