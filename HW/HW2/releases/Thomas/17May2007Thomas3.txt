SEN. THOMAS SAYS 'NO' TO DEMOCRATICS BUDGET, TAX HIKES
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today voted against the irresponsible Democratic budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2008, saying it is "exactly the wrong prescription for our economy." The proposal passed the Senate 52-40.  
   "Their proposal drastically increases spending and the size of government, ignores entitlement reform, and increases our national debt by $2.5 trillion. 
   "Our economy has added more than 7.9 million new jobs over the past few years, and people's after-tax income has risen by 10 percent since President Bush took office," Thomas said. "The Democrats' budget proposal passed today will undo much of what we have achieved by calling for the largest tax increase in U.S. history - over $700 billion." 
   "We need to be cutting spending and getting our fiscal house in order, not substantially increasing the size of government on the backs of hard-working Americans." 
   The $2.9 trillion Democrat budget passes the buck to current and future taxpayers by: 
   Spending $23 billion over the President's discretionary request for FY 2008, totaling $82 billion over FY 2007; 
   Spending $205 billion over the President's discretionary request over five years; 
   Ignoring entitlement spending by allowing it to go unchecked at the tune of $416 billion over five years; and, 
   Raiding the Social Security Trust Fund for more than $1 trillion over five years.
