SEN. THOMAS ACCEPTING FALL INTERN APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) is currently accepting applications for his Washington, DC internship program for fall 2007.  
   "My internship program will provide our state's youth with a unique perspective on the inner workings of the U.S. government," Thomas said. "I believe that the knowledge and training that our interns receive, during their four-month stay in my office, are important for the development of future Wyoming leaders." 
   Interns have a wide range of responsibilities, including helping respond to constituent requests, attending legislative hearings, giving U.S. Capitol tours, and shadowing the Senator to observe his job on a day-to-day basis. In addition to their work, interns are also encouraged to take advantage of the many sights and activities that our nation's capitol has to offer. 
   Interns receive a monthly salary and are responsible for their round-trip airfare and living expenses while in DC. Senator Thomas offers three different Congressional Intern sessions each year. In addition to the fall session, there are two four-month sessions held during the spring and summer semesters. The dates for the fall session are September 4 - December 21. 
   Applicants are typically residents of Wyoming, in college, and are 21 years of age or older. 
   For those students who attend the University of Wyoming, 15 credit hours may be earned after successful completion of the university's requirements. More information is available on the University's website, by clicking here. 
   Candidates should apply on-line. The application can be found on Senator Thomas' website by choosing the "Students" tab on the left and then clicking on "Intern Program." For more information, please contact Senator Thomas' office at 202.224.6441. The cut-off date for applications will be June 29, 2007.
