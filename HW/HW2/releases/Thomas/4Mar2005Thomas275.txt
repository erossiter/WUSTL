SEN. THOMAS ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF HIS NEW WEBSITE
  After a series of tweaks and changes, Sen. Craig Thomas' (R-Wyo.) new Web site is complete and ready for public use.  
 The Web site has been significantly updated, adding features and making it more user friendly. 
   "For many folks in Wyoming, the Internet is a valuable resource and an essential tool for getting out information. My updated Web site will help folks find the information they are looking for more quickly. We've tried to make the site a "one-stop shop" for the latest news. Many popular sites from around Wyoming have links on my pages. I'm excited about the prospect of reaching people across the state with information they can use," Thomas said. 
   For media members, the Thomas Web site also includes updated issue statements, photos, press releases, and radio and TV clips that are currently available. The visual appearance of the site has also been changed. The home page features a montage of Wyoming's outstanding features, links to Senator Thomas' committees, and the latest news from the Thomas' office. Also featured on the home page is a sign-up box for Thomas' e-mail newsletter. 
   Wyoming's senior senator encourages people to take some time to explore his new Web site. The Web address remains the same: http://thomas.senate.gov/
