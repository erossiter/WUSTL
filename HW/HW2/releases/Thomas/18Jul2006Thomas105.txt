SEN. THOMAS TAKES SIDE OF STEM CELL BILLS
  "I'm a strong supporter of moving forward with research, but I believe we can do so within the boundaries of an ethical standard."  
   "I believe the pluripotent cells offer us both solid research and a sound ethical standard. As with many issues, we need to seek a balance - on this issue balance means seeking alternatives. I support the two Senate bills as alternatives to the House bill," Thomas said. 
   "One thing the House bill does is step over an ethical line when it comes to federally funded research which might encourage the destruction of human embryos." 
   The three bills: 
   1. The House-passed "Castle-DeGette" bill (H.R. 810) 
  H.R. 810 would lift President Bush's ban on federal funding for new human embryonic stem cell research. Senator Thomas vote: No 
   2. The Brownback/Santorum "Fetal Farming Prohibition" bill (S. 3504) 
   This legislation would make it illegal to do research on embryos created in "fetal farms". These are places where human embryos are grown in either a human or an animal uterus for scientific research purposes. Senator Thomas vote: Yes, for prohibiting fetal farming 
   3. The Santorum/Specter "Pluripotent" stem cell bill (S. 2754) 
   This bill would require the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research and develop ways to get pluripotent stem cells without destroying an embryo. Pluripotent cells can morph into almost any type of cell in the body - just like an embryonic stem cell, but don't call ethical standards into question. Senator Thomas vote: Yes, for developing pluripotent lines, that don't require embryos to be destroyed.
