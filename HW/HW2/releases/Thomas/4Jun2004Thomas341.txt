JOB CREATION CONSISTENT WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY
  New job numbers released today show that one year after the President's jobs and growth bill became law, more people are working and the economy is growing stronger, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said. Numbers released today show that 248,000 new jobs were created in May alone, with a total of 947,000 in the last three months. Since August of 2003, the economy has created more than 1.5 million new jobs. These are new, non-farm payroll jobs.  
   "These numbers are a clear illustration that the economic recovery is well underway. People are getting back to work and we must continue our efforts to establish an economic environment that will create more jobs so that all who want to work can find work," Thomas said. "The President's jobs and growth policies have put the economy on the road to recovery." 
   The national unemployment rate stayed constant at 5.6 percent in May. Real after-tax incomes are also up by 11 percent since December 2000, a substantial improvement when compared to the figures following the last recession. Productivity by American companies grew from 2000 to 2003 at the fastest 3-year rate in more than 50 years. This has bolstered company's financial strength and will lead to significantly higher real wages for workers. 
   With the passage of the President's economic package: 
   * 1.5 million new jobs have been created since August 
   * The Gross Domestic Product grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate-the fastest in 20 years 
   * National homeownership is at 68.6 percent-an all-time record high 
   * Family take-home pay is rising also, at nearly 4 percent
   "America has a choice: It can continue to grow the economy and create new jobs as the President's policies are doing, or it can raise taxes on American families and small businesses, hurting economic recovery and future job creation. A pro-growth agenda, strong education system, and help for American workers to gain the skills to secure good jobs are the right ways to respond to the challenges of our growing and changing economy," Thomas said.
