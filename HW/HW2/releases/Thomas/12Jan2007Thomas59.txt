SEN. THOMAS: COAL-TO-DIESEL AGREEMENT 'STEP FORWARD'
  During a press conference today where DKRW announced a license agreement with Sinclair to purchase 13,000 barrels per day of coal-derived diesel fuel produced from their proposed Medicine Bow Plant in Hanna, Wyo., Sen. Craig Thomas offered this statement:  
   "This deal represents a step forward in efforts to use more of our nation's most abundant fossil energy supply, coal, to produce key transportation fuels that will power our nation's economy," U.S. Senator Craig Thomas said today. 
   "Development of coal-to-liquid facilities in the United States has been long overlooked as an alternative to importing foreign oil. We need to aggressively pursue these opportunities and I'm pleased that our nation's private sector has seized the opportunity and is moving forward with their plans to use Wyoming coal." 
   "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 recognized the role coal-to-liquids production will play in meeting our future fuel needs. It is important that those provisions be fully implemented and supported by the federal government in a timely fashion," Thomas said. 
   Thomas has been a key advocate for coal on the Senate Energy Committee, including provisions to pave the way for these advance technologies to take place. Wyoming's senior senator will continue to advocate for the implementation of those policies at the Department of Energy to allow forward-thinking companies to take advantage of the opportunities brought about by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
