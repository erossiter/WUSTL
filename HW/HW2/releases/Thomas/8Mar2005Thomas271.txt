SEN. THOMAS' SAVE INITIATIVE TO SPUR SAVINGS, SIMPLIFY PLANS PROPOSALS ARE PART OF PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., introduced the SAVE Initiative today, a group of three savings proposals aimed at improving savings rates and simplifying savings plans for all Americans. 
   "Allowing individuals to save money and accumulate tax-free interest is an important step toward tax reform," Thomas said. "As Social Security strains under increasing pressure, it's even more important that we recognize that Social Security was never intended to be a sole source of retirement income. We must provide a simpler, more responsive system for Americans to accumulate personal savings for retirement," Thomas said.  
   The savings proposals include Lifetime Savings Accounts, Retirement Savings Accounts, and Employer Retirement Savings Accounts - LSAs, RSAs, and ERSAs. The group of Senate bills, S. 545, 546, 547, were filed today. 
   "These go a long way toward ensuring the financial security of all Americans. It's important to address the appallingly low personal savings rate in this country," Thomas said. "Personal savings rates in the United States since 1960 have reached a new low - now at less than 2 percent. These bills will encourage savings for pre-retirement expenses as well as for retirement security," Thomas said. 
   LSAs and RSAs each have a $5,000 annual contribution limit, non-deductible contributions, and tax-free earnings. Lifetime Savings Accounts have no minimum distribution rules and can be converted from Coverdell Education Savings Accounts and Qualified Tuition Plans. For the Retirement Savings Account qualified distributions begin after age 58 or upon death/disability. Balances under the different IRA plans can be converted to an RSA. 
   The Employment Retirement Savings Accounts (ERSA) will combine and streamline current rules for 401k, simple 401k, 403b, Governmental 457, SARSEP, or simple IRA accounts. The ERSA will be available to all employers. 
   "I'm pleased the President has made these accounts a priority in a very tight budget year - it further amplifies the notion of how important it is to save," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas is a member of the Senate Finance Committee. Thomas announced the plans at a press conference today along with Treasury Secretary Snow and Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas. 
   Here is a summary of the Proposal to Expand Tax-Free Savings: 
   A. LIFETIME SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (LSA) 
  * $5,000 annual contribution limit (indexed for inflation). 
  * Available to all individuals - no income limits, no age limits. 
  * Contributions would be nondeductible (similar to Roth IRAs). 
  * Earnings would accumulate tax-free and all distributions would be excluded from gross income. 
  * No minimum required distribution rules would apply at any age throughout owner's life. 
  * Contribution limit of $5,000 applies to the individual owner of the account, not the contributor. 
  * Contributors could make annual contributions to the accounts of other individuals. 
  * Annual aggregate contributions to an individual's accounts could not exceed $5,000. 
   Conversion: This is a brand new vehicle, but balances from Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) or Qualified Tuition Plans (QTPs) could be converted to LSAs. 
  Individuals could continue to contribute to ESAs and QTPs as under current law. 
  Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) would be retained. 
   B. RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (RSA) 
  * $5,000 annual contribution limit (indexed for inflation). 
  * Available to all individuals no income limits (contributions cannot exceed compensation), no age limits. 
  * Contributions would be nondeductible (like Roth IRAs). 
  * Earnings would accumulate tax-free, and qualified distributions would be excluded from gross income. 
  * Qualified distributions could be made after age 58 or in the event of death or disability. 
  Nonqualified distributions: Distributions in excess of prior contributions would be included in income and subject to an additional tax. 
  Conversion: Roth, Traditional, and Nondeductible IRAs could be converted to RSAs. 
   C. EMPLOYER RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (ERSA) 
  One Retirement Plan: Employer Retirement Savings Accounts would combine the array of existing retirement plans into one simple uniform regime: 
  * 401 (k) 
  * SIMPLE 401 (k) 
  * 403 (b) 
  * Governmental 457 
  * SARSEPs 
  * SIMPLE IRAs 
  Access: Available to all employers
