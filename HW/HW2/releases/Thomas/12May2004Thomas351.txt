SEN. THOMAS AMENDMENT WILL HELP DROUGHT STRICKEN PRODUCERS
  After years of battling for drought relief for Wyoming's agricultural producers, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) was able to add a crucial amendment to the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, which passed the Senate late yesterday. 
   Senator Thomas' amendment would allow producers, who are forced to sell livestock on account of drought, additional time to replace their herd(s) and defer taxes on the sale of the herd. The amendment would apply to livestock sales in taxable years after December 31, 2001. 
   "Wyoming's producers are facing their seventh year in a row of drought conditions. We are seeing smaller producers having difficulty surviving and we must do something to help them alleviate the financial hardships that this severe drought has caused. We can't make it rain, but we can help in other ways," Thomas said. 
   Thomas' amendment would assist in two key areas: 
   * The current IRS code grants a taxpayer two years to replace livestock sold on account of drought, flood, or other weather-related conditions. Senator Thomas' proposal extends the time period from two to four years and gives the Treasury Secretary authority to extend the four year time period on a regional basis if weather-related conditions continue beyond three years. 
   * If certain conditions are met, the proposal provides that a taxpayer may elect to defer paying taxes on the income received from the sale until the replacement time period has expired. 
   "As we face another year of drought, we must continue our pursuit to help our producers anyway we can. By easing the tax burden a little, we give them a chance to rebuild and start again," Thomas said.
