SEN. THOMAS PRAISES PASSAGE OF LOBBYING REFORM
  Sen. Craig Thomas on Friday, January 19, praised the passage of lobbying reform legislation that passed the United States Senate last night by a vote of 96-2.  
   "This bill is a significant victory for public transparency and for those of us who believe a strong ethics code should be an integral part of government," Thomas said. "Republicans remained committed to passing comprehensive lobbying reform and limiting wasteful spending throughout this debate. Using a broad range of amendments, we strengthened the Senate legislation significantly." 
   "One example is the success we had for the American public by passing Senator DeMint's amendment to increase earmark disclosure requirements. Another example of our effort was the 'Second Look at Waste Act,' which will provide an important check on wasteful spending. Republicans will continue to work to increase transparency in government and promote responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars." 
   "I continue to be concerned about runaway government spending, as well as the size and scope of our government. I will continue to use all the tools available to promote the responsible spending policies our country needs for a sound financial future," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is a member of the Senate Ethics Committee. The committee enforces Ethics rules for the Senate.
