SEN. THOMAS BLASTS DISTRICT COURT FOREST RULING
  In blasting a recent court ruling he termed "absurd," Sen. Craig Thomas says that if a federal court had its way it would stop public rights on public lands - even so far as the permitting for Christmas trees in the Black Hills National Forest in Northeastern Wyoming.  
   All forms of multiple use - from fire mitigation that would reduce wildfire buildup near homes, to any permitting on Forest Service lands, are threatened by this misguided opinion, Thomas said. 
   Thomas will strongly urge the US Department of Agriculture and US Justice Department to challenge and appeal the lower court ruling. Thomas is also reviewing legislative options in the Senate. 
   "From a safety perspective it's irresponsible. Thinning trees and other wildfire safety precautions are a matter of public safety. We can't take away the tools of the Forest Service to help keep the land and people who live nearby safe," Thomas said. 
   "In addition, these scrooges are going to take away Christmas tree permits? This is why courts shouldn't be managing forests. I'm doing all in my power to get the administration to fight the District Court ruling in California that has put a stop to these important forest projects," Thomas said. 
   "People of Wyoming understand that our public lands are meant for everyone to enjoy. Clearly a California court does not. The management of our vast national forests is already a tough job, without some court in California trying to make it more difficult. 
   On Sept. 21, a federal judge in the Eastern District of California halted projects on Forest Service lands nationwide retroactive to July 2, mandating an appeal for each request for permitting. The court issued an order which clarified an earlier judgment from July 7, 2005 by saying that the July judgment would apply nationwide.
