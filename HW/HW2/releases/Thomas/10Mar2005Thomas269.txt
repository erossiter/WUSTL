SEN. THOMAS TACKLES ELECTRICITY ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY
  Sen. Craig Thomas introduced today the Electric Transmission and Reliability Enhancement Act of 2005 - the plan will bring much needed modernization to the regulatory side of the electric industry.  
   "The bill will ensure consumers have access to adequate and affordable electricity," said Thomas, R-Wyo. "The current electric market is inefficient and outdated. It doesn't allow the industry to provide consumers with the savings they could otherwise receive with a system that works effectively. My plan will produce a more reliable and efficient transmission system. While achieving those ends, I will continue to ensure that Wyoming coal remains a primary source for electricity production," Thomas said. 
   "In my continuing efforts to pass a comprehensive energy bill, we must include an electricity title, and any electricity title should include these fundamental building blocks of wholesale market reform," Thomas said. "The title should appropriately balance the role of the federal government in the development of a reliable and secure electricity delivery system for our nation," said Wyoming's senior senator. 
   The electricity industry currently operates under outdated laws and conflicting regulations. "Changes are long overdue to provide the certainty necessary for meeting consumer needs," Thomas said. Thomas is a member of the Senate Energy Committee. These reforms make wholesale electric markets work more effectively and are part of a Thomas' plan to pass comprehensive energy legislation. 
   Here is a summary of the Electric Transmission and Reliability Enhancement Act of 2005: 
   * Permit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to require all utilities to offer open non-discriminatory access to the transmission grid; 
   * Establish a nation-wide organization that would have the authority to establish and enforce reliability standards; 
   * Repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA); 
   * Reform Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PUPRA); 
   * Provide greater price and transmission availability information, outlaw roundtrip trading, and prohibit the reporting of false information for the purpose of price manipulation; 
   * Increase civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act.
