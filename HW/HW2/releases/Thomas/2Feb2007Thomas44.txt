SEN. THOMAS: STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT, DESERVES REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Friday, Feb. 2, said that the "State Children's Health Insurance Program" should be reauthorized and improved to ensure it addresses the needs of children. State Children's Health Insurance Program was designed to provide low-income, uninsured children access to health insurance, not for States to use it as a slush fund for other health care costs.  
   "This program is vital to so many of our nation's most vulnerable children," Thomas said. "In Wyoming, more than 5,000 uninsured children are receiving the helping hand that they need. However, some states have been using the program to cover more adults than children. Congress enacted SCHIP with one thing in mind - help those children, who through no fault of their own, are not protected by Medicaid and whose parents can't afford to pay for their health insurance." 
   SCHIP was enacted in the "Balanced Budget Act of 1997," and serves more than 6.6 million children, who do not qualify for Medicaid, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The program is responsible for reducing the number of uninsured children by one-third. However, some states use the program to cover low-income adults, including parents, pregnant women, and even those without children. 
   Responding to calls for additional funds and expansion of the program, Thomas said, "I believe that we should focus on improving the program that is currently in place. We need to use this opportunity to make need adjustments to get back to the original intent of the law, which is to help as many children as possible. Adding more money to SCHIP without making common sense reforms is something I find very troubling."
