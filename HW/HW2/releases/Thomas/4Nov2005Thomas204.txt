SEN. THOMAS HEADS TO GULF FOR FIELD HEARING
  Sen. Craig Thomas will attend a field hearing in New Orleans on Sunday and Monday as part of the Commerce Committee trip to review recovery operations underway in the Gulf region.  
   "This is a good opportunity to see the recovery efforts firsthand. As we get set to do a joint hearing with Commerce on our nation's rising fuel prices, I'm looking forward to seeing the progress being made," Thomas said. 
   "Millions of people have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina - and even larger scale - almost every American is feeling the impacts of this disaster. I'd like to see the progress of our nation's natural gas and crude oil supplies that are so dependent on Louisiana's infrastructure," Thomas said. 
   Thomas will provide an update on Monday after he has a chance to see the recovery of the city, infrastructure, and energy interests in the Gulf region. 
   The Commerce Committee's field hearing will focus on the full recovery of the region. A joint hearing between the Commerce and Energy committees will take place Wednesday, Nov. 9, to review fuel prices with energy industry CEOs and state attorneys general expected to testify.
