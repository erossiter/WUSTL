CNN TO AIR SEGMENT ON WYO POLITICS TONIGHT
  Sen. Craig Thomas spent the past weekend in Cody attending 4th of July events and parades followed closely by a crew from CNN.  
   CNN's Candy Crowley and a crew of three took in the views of the Shoshone National Forest from Thomas's cabin near Wapiti while interviewing Thomas about his thoughts on Wyoming politics. 
   The segment is scheduled to air tonight at 8 p.m. EST (6 p.m. in Wyoming), check your local TV listings. 
   Crowley also followed the senator during the events surrounding the Cody Stampede. The CNN crew took some time to visit with folks from Wyoming about how their way of life affects their political decisions. 
   Crowley is a veteran reporter regularly appearing on CNN's "Inside Politics" program. She attended a western style barbecue with Thomas and Cody Stampede organizers; spent time in downtown Cody with locals and visitors; and took a trip between Cody and Wapiti with Thomas to see where the senator grew up. 
   Thomas spent the balance of the week conducting town meetings in Powell, Greybull, Worland, and Ten Sleep, and will host a breakfast town meeting in Thermopolis on Friday morning.
