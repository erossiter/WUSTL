SEN. THOMAS ACCEPTING SUMMER INTERN APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) is currently accepting applications for his Washington, DC internship program for summer 2007. The Senator's intern program, which lasts four months, is designed to give Wyoming's youth a unique perspective into the inner workings of the United States government.  
   "I firmly believe that all of our interns walk away with a deeper appreciation and understanding of how our government operates, and an instilled sense of civic duty," Thomas said. 
   Interns have a wide range of responsibilities, including helping respond to constituent requests, attending legislative hearings, giving U.S. Capitol tours, and shadowing the Senator to observe his job on a day-to-day basis. In addition to their work, interns are also encouraged to take advantage of the many sights and activities that our nation's capitol has to offer. 
   Interns receive a monthly salary and are responsible for their round-trip airfare and living expenses while in DC. Senator Thomas offers four different Congressional Intern sessions each year. In addition to the summer session, there are two four-month sessions held during the spring and fall semesters. The dates for the summer session are May 21 - August 24. 
   Applicants are typically residents of Wyoming, in college, and are 21 years of age or older. 
   For those students who attend the University of Wyoming, 15 credit hours may be earned after successful completion of the university's requirements. More information is available on the University's website, by clicking here. 
   Candidates should apply on-line. The application can be found on Senator Thomas's website by choosing the "Students" tab on the left and then clicking on "Intern Program." For more information, please contact Senator Thomas' office at 202.224.6441. The cut-off date for applications will be April 13.
