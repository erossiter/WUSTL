SEN. THOMAS STEPS IN TO STRIKE DOWN USDA RULE ON CANADA BEEF
  "We cannot afford to risk the safety of the beef supply in America.  
 Before we reopen our border to Canadian beef, it is critical that we make sure the Canadian beef supply is safe and that Canada's food safety and BSE prevention regulations are being properly enforced," said Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. 
   "Today I join Senator Burns in introducing a bill addressing BSE and Canadian beef which will strike down part of the new USDA rule expanding Canadian beef imports," Thomas said. "Under the bill, Canadian beef and beef products from cattle over 30 months of age would not be allowed into the United States," Thomas said. "The science has shown that the younger cattle are the safest for importation," Thomas explained. 
   Before Canadian beef imports can be expanded, USDA must first do two things: 
   1. Make a determination that Canada is in full compliance with its ruminant feed ban and other BSE safety measures, and 2. Present a report on the determination to the Agriculture Committees of both houses of Congress 
   "I believe this is a reasonable approach based on the recent discoveries of BSE in Canadian cattle. This is necessary to maintain food safety as well as consumer confidence. This bill will help ensure that our beef supply remains the safest in the world," Thomas said. 
   Thomas, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee met with Secretary Mike Johanns today to discuss his concerns and ask for answers about where we are headed in terms of beef trade. "It seems we deserve to know what direction we're heading with Canada and Japan in terms of trade," Thomas said to Johanns today during the Agriculture Committee meeting.
