SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON SNOWMOBILE USE PROPOSAL
  In response to the release of the National Park Service's (NPS) Temporary Winter Use Plans Environmental Assessment, for Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) expressed his hope that people will continue to have multiple-use access to their national parks. The NPS offers five options for winter-use in the parks. The public comment period for the plan will run for 30 days. 
   "Today's announcement is certainly an important one; however, a final decision needs to be reached quickly so that visitor's travel arrangements can be made and businesses can plan for the winter. Unfortunately, with winter fast approaching, time is not on our side and any further delay will put communities, jobs, and people's livelihood at risk. 
   "I'm encouraged that the National Park Service has come out with a temporary winter use plan. It is important that a balanced result be achieved. We must remember that the parks were created for people to enjoy and limiting access to the gems of the national park system would be a tragedy. 
   "It is my hope that the final decision includes an option allowing some users of the parks unguided access. I look forward to working with the NPS, local business owners, and other concerned folks to ensure that we come up with a fair solution. It is vitally important that those folks who are directly impacted by winter-use are given a chance to make their opinions heard."
