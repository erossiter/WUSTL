WYO DELEGATION TO MONTANA: REJECT FLAWED PETITION
  In a move to prevent Montana from increasing natural gas costs in the nation and harming Wyoming's coalbed methane production, Wyoming's Congressional Delegation calls on the Montana Board of Environmental Review to reject a petition to employ unworkable water standards for the Tongue River.  
   Sens. Craig Thomas, Mike Enzi and Rep. Barbara Cubin said Montana's rules unfairly target Wyoming's coalbed methane production and provide no significant environmental benefit. Moreover, the proposed statute threatens jobs and revenue for local, state, and federal government. 
   "We believe it is essential to sustain responsible production of CBNG (Coal Bed Natural Gas) resources in the Powder River Basin. The petition, under the guise of environmental benefit, could severely limit CBNG production without any significant additional protection for water quality or existing water uses in Wyoming or Montana. We urge the Montana Board of Environmental Review to reject the petition. The proposed rules lack scientific basis, pose a serious threat to energy supply, have questionable legal basis, and threaten ongoing cooperative efforts," the Wyoming Delegation wrote. 
   The delegation concludes the letter by calling on both Wyoming and Montana to continue to work cooperatively to have stable energy development while protecting the environment and natural resources of both states.
