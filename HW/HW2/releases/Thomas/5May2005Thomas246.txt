SEN. THOMAS ON ROADLESS RULE: PUBLIC INPUT A MAIN INGREDIENT
  Sen. Craig Thomas on the Final Roadless Rule announced by the Forest Service today:  
   "The rule gives states a greater role in managing roadless areas - and that's an important consideration, especially in states that have a large amount of federal land," Thomas said. 
   "This decision helps right the wrong of the Clinton Administration's attempt to circumvent local management of federal roadless areas. I've long been a proponent of multiple-use of our public land. In order to achieve that standard, public and state input is a main ingredient. The proper management of our national forests, as we have seen recently with the Forest Service decision on oil and gas leasing, is of utmost importance to our local and state economy. With further cooperation on the use and management of these roadless areas, we can readily address Wyoming's specific needs," Thomas said. 
   The rule allows governors to petition the secretary of agriculture to develop regulations to manage roadless areas that meet specific needs within each state. 
   USDA will accept state petitions from governors for 18 months after the effective date of the final rule. During the state-petitioning process, the Forest Service will continue to maintain interim measures to conserve inventoried roadless areas.
