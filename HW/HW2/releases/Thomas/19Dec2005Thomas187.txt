SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON ENERGY TRAINING GRANT
  In response to the Department of Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao's announcement today about a $2.4 million federal grant to establish a worker training program in Casper, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas said: 
   "Wyoming has added 6,600 new jobs over the past year and there are still vacancies. Training opportunities such as the regional training center will help fill the void and should serve as a springboard to further economic development opportunities in other sectors." 
   "With passage of the energy policy this year, Wyoming will lead the way for energy development in the future. Technology is driving the energy industry and we need to provide our workers with the skills that reflect this trend." 
   "Today's energy industry uses highly advanced technologies to tap into resources. We need our energy workforce to mirror this progress." 
   Thomas is a senior member of the Senate Energy Committee. He held a summit in October at University of Wyoming to highlight the importance of the state's educators keeping step with energy development technology to ensure Wyoming's place in the energy market.
