SEN. THOMAS: SENATE DEMOCRATS SHOW TRUE COLORS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Wednesday, March 28, 2007, was denied the opportunity to offer an amendment to the "Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act," which sought to remove billions of dollars in extraneous spending from the troop funding measure.  
   "Democrats showed their true colors today by spending more and more of taxpayers' hard earned dollars on their own pet projects." 
   "I am disappointed that Democrats have decided to block any consideration of my amendment, which would impose fiscal discipline on a process that has run amok. It's ridiculous that we couldn't even have a vote." 
   "The American public wants Congress to debate the tough issues, and spend their dollars wisely," Thomas said. "Adding pet projects to emergency spending bills - which by definition are outside the normal budget process - is not the right way to accomplish that goal." 
   Some of the non-emergency and unrelated spending measures that could have been stripped from the bill by the Thomas amendment include: 
   * Transportation Department backlog projects ($389 million) 
   * Fisheries ($216 million) 
   * Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ($640 million) 
   * Conservation security ($115 million) 
   * Tree assistance ($40 million) 
   * Guided tours of the Capitol ($3.5 million) 
   * Asbestos abatement ($25 million) 
   * Presidential nominating conventions ($100 million) 
   * Milk Income Loss Contract program ($31 million) 
   * A Minimum wage increase.
