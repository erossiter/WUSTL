SEN. THOMAS' FOCUS GROUP SEEKS IDEAS ON ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., traveled around Wyoming during President's Day week talking with people about Endangered Species Act reform. His efforts focused on solutions and he solicited many different perspectives - Fish & Wildlife Service, Game & Fish, Energy interests, outfitters, dude ranchers, cattle ranchers, federal agencies, sportsmen, and environmentalists. A series of focus groups in Jackson brought many problems and solutions to the table. "There was a good turnout and a wide-range of ideas," Thomas said.  
   Thomas worked with Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, as part of the Environment and Public Works Committee last year, along with other senators to discuss a reform bill. 
   Many points came through regarding ESA reform during the Feb. 23-24 Jackson meetings. Here is a summary of some of the points people brought up: 
   * ESA is being utilized too much for local and county land management 
   * An independent commission or committee for peer review should involve people other than those who work on listing and delisting of species 
   * Redefine definition of science (law requests and best available science) 
   * Early involvement at the local and State level and utilizing working groups, and/or cooperative agency status prior to listing a species. More local input into listing and recovery of species 
   * Better agency communication and working with public prior to listing 
   * Too easy to petition for listing; too many listings without evidence 
   * Have recovery plan prior to listing 
   * When numbers are met, execute delisting immediately 
   * Provide more incentives for state and private to work together 
   * Funding is an issue as far as who will pay once a species are delisted 
   * Too much emphasis on listing and not trying to get listed 
   * Wildlife such as elk, deer, moose are being compromised because of wolves and bears, other predators (mountain lion) Downturn in wildlife will have huge affect on outfitting, recreation, dude ranching, (conflicts with predators vying for food source) 
   * FWS has to have oversight and accountability (no checks and balances) 
   * Key issue: Nobody is saying to gut the act, or do away with the ESA 
   * People agree Grizzly Bear and wolf warranted recovery, but they want to see delisting done properly and measures in place to safeguard against failure of species 
   * More money for research prior to consideration of listing; use of DNA
   Thomas focus is to find solutions to make ESA work better. He mentioned the numbers of listings versus what has been recovered being notable. He also brought out the idea that ESA has been used as a land planning and management vehicle.
