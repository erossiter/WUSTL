SEN. THOMAS MEETS WITH JAPANESE AMBASSADOR ABOUT U.S. BEEF
 Sen. Craig Thomas met with the Japanese Ambassador, Ryozo Kato, today to discuss Japan's prohibition of U.S. beef.  
   Thomas and several members of the Finance Committee took the opportunity to express frustration with the time it has taken for Japan to resolve the problem. Beef producers in the United States, as well as consumers and beef importers in Japan are being hurt by the Japanese government's inaction, the panel members said. With scientific support on the side of U.S. beef producers, it's time for Japan to lift the ban, was the group's message to Ryozo. 
   Kato said he would call Tokyo directly with the information from the meeting with the panel. 
   In addition to Thomas, the meeting was attended by Finance Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking member Max Baucus, D-Mont., Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. 
   The U.S.-Japan Business Council (USJBC) has put together a document to explain the situation and what Japan needs to do to address the current state of affairs. Here are some of the documents points: 
   * U.S. exports measured roughly $1.4 billion in 2003 and have been as high as $2.1 billion in 1995. 
   * Japan imposed a ban on imports of U.S. beef in response to the U.S. announcement that a single cow born in and imported from Canada tested positive for mad cow (BSE) in December 2003 
   * The U.S. government and industry have been undertaking important steps for safety: 1. increasing testing 2. removing spinal and brain tissue from food and animal feed supplies 3. cooperating with the Japanese government and international organizations such as OIE - Organization for International Epizootics on internationally acceptable measures 
   * The import ban has been in place longer than necessary 
   * Japan's requirement for 100 percent testing of beef consumed for BSE is a measure not based on sound science, accepted international practice/protocol 
   * In late 2004 Japan officials agreed to start allowing imports from the United States under certain conditions, such as animals 20 months of age or younger 
   * The Government of Japan has not stated clearly when Japan will resume imports under these conditions 
   The U.S.-Japan Business Council recommends: 
   * Increase high-level government involvement 
   * Apply science-based standard 
   * Undertake public education campaign
