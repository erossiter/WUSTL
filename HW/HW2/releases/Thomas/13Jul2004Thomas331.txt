SEN. THOMAS ISSUES STATEMENT ON USDA ROADLESS DECISION
  The following is a statement by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) regarding the proposed roadless rule from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  
 The new rule would allow governors to petition the USDA if they desired to keep certain areas of their states roadless. The decision overrides a rule created by the Clinton Administration that made nearly 60 million acres across the nation off-limits to public access. 
   "We've known for nearly four years that the last second policymaking trademarked by the Clinton Administration is not the Wyoming way. What has happened today is a step in the right direction as we work to manage the land and ensure public access to these areas. The USDA plan allows for public input and participation once the governor has submitted his/her petition. Public input is a key ingredient that has been missing since the Clinton days in the White House. 
   "In the wake of drought and seemingly endless forest fires, we have given ourselves a chance to save our land before it goes completely up in smoke. This is a first step, but it is a good one and I look forward to working with the Administration to continue our journey to make our public lands more accessible."
