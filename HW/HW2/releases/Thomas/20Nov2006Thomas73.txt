SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON WINTER-USE PLAN AND SNOWMOBILES
  Sen. Craig Thomas made these comments about the Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks Draft Winter Use Plan which is out for technical review:  
   "This plan appears to balance winter-use in our national parks with safety and environmental concerns. As with any plan that considers competing points of view - it's not perfect, but I'm pleased that our public land managers recognize the importance of maintaining visitor access to our national parks in Wyoming." 
   "I am sure there will be many questions about closing Sylvan Pass and requiring the use of guides, but I encourage the public to remain engaged and provide their input on the winter-use plan as it moves forward." 
   Two years ago, Thomas included a provision to cement the interim winter use rules for the 2004-2005 season. At the time the rules were tied up in court, causing a great deal of uncertainty for both concessionaires and snowmobile users heading into the winter season. The legislative fix ended a number of lawsuits spawned in early November 2004 by the release of the winter use regulations. 
   At the time, Thomas said, "I think most folks are tired of a DC court deciding how we do things in Wyoming. I'm glad I could provide some certainty for these folks." 
   "I plan to keep a common sense approach to access in the parks that's fair to everyone involved."
