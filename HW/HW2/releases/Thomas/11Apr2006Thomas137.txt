TRADE CHAIRMAN URGES CHINA TO FIX IMBALANCES
  Sen. Craig Thomas is urging Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi to fix several trade imbalances which have a significant impact on the economy as the Chinese leader pays a visit to the United States this week.  
   Thomas made his concerns known in a letter to the vice premier delivered just ahead of Wu Yi's visit to the U.S. 
   "One of the more significant issues between Wyoming and China is their ban on U.S. beef," Thomas said. "Opening up markets to beef trade is tremendously important to our producers. We've come a long way in opening other Asian markets recently and it's only right that China should have a policy consistent with our other trading partners." 
   Thomas is seeking action on infringements to intellectual property rights, asking for an increase in the flexibility of the Chinese currency to respond to the market, and a reduction in government intervention in the marketplace. 
   Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi heads a large Chinese government delegation that is meeting today with a U.S. team including U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez and U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman. 
  The meeting comes shortly before President Bush hosts Chinese President Hu Jintao at the White House. 
   Thomas is the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee. The letter to Vice Premier Wu Yi, and signed by 16 other Senate colleagues, is available here.
