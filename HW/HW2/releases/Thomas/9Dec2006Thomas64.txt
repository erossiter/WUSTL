SEN. THOMAS SAVES WYOMING PARKS WINTER-USE SEASON
Sen. Craig Thomas was successful in including a provision last night to ensure the winter-use season rules for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks through Feb. 15, 2007.  
 "With the winter-use season upon us, it was imperative that we give some certainty for visitors and concessionaires about winter activities in our parks," Thomas said. 
 "Next year I hope to see through a longer-term plan for winter activities in the parks. As the Park Service works toward a more permanent solution, I felt it was necessary to give them ample time to put their final rules in place and not be derailed by lawsuits." 
 Thomas's provision was approved along with the continuing resolution, which was signed by the President today. 
 Two years ago, Thomas included a provision to ensure the interim winter-use rules for the 2004-2005 season. 
 At the time the rules were tied up in court, causing a great deal of uncertainty for both concessionaires and snowmobile users heading into the winter season. 
 The legislative fix ended a number of lawsuits spawned in early November 2004 by the release of the winter-use regulations. 
 At the time, Thomas said, "I think most folks are tired of a DC court deciding how we do things in Wyoming. I'm glad I could provide some certainty for these folks." 
 "I plan to keep a common sense approach to access in the parks that's fair to everyone involved."
