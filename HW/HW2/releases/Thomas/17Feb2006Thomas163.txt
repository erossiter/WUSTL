SEN. THOMAS TOUTS IMPACT OF ENERGY POLICY ACT
  As our nation begins to invest and realize the influence of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Sen. Craig Thomas is releasing an item-by-item list of the policy's impact. 
   "While I remain focused on more near-term solutions for our nation's energy needs, it's exciting to see our long-term energy bill efforts begin to bear fruit," Thomas said. 
   "We need to remain committed to reducing consumption and building appropriate capacity based on a diversified group of fuels. In Wyoming we're very blessed to have a little bit of nearly every energy source and a great deal of coal."  
   "Each energy source has its appropriate use in our energy outlook. We need to emphasize the right fuel at the right time in order to meet our nation's needs. I'm convinced that clean coal in our most abundant near-term solution for providing electricity to hungry markets." 
   "Very soon I'll be gathering our energy partners together in Wyoming to discuss ways to turn our energy potential into reality," the senator said. 
   Senator Thomas is a senior member of the Senate Energy Committee. He was instrumental in efforts to include Western Integrated Gas Combine Cycle technology into the energy bill as well as many other provisions. 
   In addition, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Thomas authored provisions to provide tax incentives for investments into energy infrastructure - for both pipelines and power lines. 
   Here is a list of impacts of the Energy Policy Act of 2005: 
   COAL 
   * Due to clean coal provisions in the energy bill, several coal companies have filed applications to partner with the government in building innovative clean coal plants across the country. These plants will allow the United States to use our most abundant and affordable domestic fuel to meet our growing electricity needs while keeping our environment clean. There are approximately 120 new coal-based facilities in various stages of proposal, according to the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Many will utilize the investment incentives provided in the energy bill. 
   * The energy bill is also encouraging the development of emerging technologies that can help the U.S. create gas and liquid fuels from coal. These technologies will help us use our 250 year supply of coal to reduce our dependence on imported gas and crude oil. For example, technology is being developed that can convert U.S. coal into clean, zero sulfur synthetic oil at a cost of $35 to $40 per barrel compared to the current $62 a barrel for traditional oil on the world market. 
   * By 2025, fuels from coal could replace as much as 2 million barrels per day of oil and 5 tcf of natural gas per day, according to the National Mining Association. 
   * The new technologies will help coal remain a driver in our national economy. By 2025, coal is expected to generate as much as 54 percent of the electricity consumed in the United States, according to EIA. Over the next 5 years, 55,000 new coal miners will be hired to replace existing workforce. 
   NATURAL GAS 
   * A new pilot program at the Department of the Interior established through the energy bill to help resolve a backlog of drilling permits could free up nearly 7 trillion cubic feet of new gas production over the next 15 years, with over 200 billion cubic feet in the first year alone. 
   * LNG imports: The Energy Information Administration estimates the United States will have to increase imports of LNG by more than 600 percent in the next 25 years to fulfill America's increasing demand for natural gas. The energy bill paves the way for expanded LNG imports by establishing a clear and orderly process for LNG licensing and appeals procedures. On October 7, 2005, FERC began implementing LNG procedures by adopted a final rule requiring potential developers of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to initiate a pre-filing application at least six months prior to filing a formal application with FERC. The rule should promote early identification and resolution of issues surrounding authorization of LNG import facilities and will facilitate community involvement. 
   WIND 
   * 2,500 megawatts (MW) of new wind power will be installed this year due in part to the extension of production tax credits in the energy bill. This new power alone will offset the emission of approximately 7 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, equivalent to keeping nearly 500,000 SUVs off the road, according to the American Wind Energy Association. 
   * A total of more than 14,000 MW of wind energy could be online by the end of 2007, when the tax credits expire. 
   OIL 
   * The Energy bill encourages investment in innovative oil development techniques that produce more oil from mature U.S. oil fields. One such innovation involves forcing carbon dioxide into the wells, driving oil to the surface while, at the same time, sequestering carbons that may affect our climate. This technology is being tested at DOE's Weyburn oil development site and has already doubled the oil production at this mature field. Carbon sequestration at this one site alone could produce an additional 130 million barrels of oil and sequester as much 30 million tons of C02. 
   OIL SHALE 
   * The United States has an estimated 800 billion barrels of technically-coverable oil locked up in oil shale in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, according to DOE. This compares to 267 billion barrels of reserves in Saudi Arabia, 175 billion barrels of reserves in Alberta Tar Sands and 20 billion barrels of U.S. proved reserves of crude oil. There is more oil per acre in the oil shale of the western states than there is in Alaska's North Slope. 
   * The energy bill included a new program to for R&D oil shale leases aimed at developing the technology to affordably and environmentally extract oil from the rock. A month after the bill was signed into law, the government had received 20 proposals for leases on public land in the three oil shale states, including proposals from global leaders like Chevron and Shell.
   R&D 
   * The Department of Energy this month began work on a new program that allows the federal government partner with small, innovative companies to bring new energy ideas to the market place faster while protecting the private companies' ownership of their ideas. Such partnerships in the past have given us energy saving technology like LED lighting, an innovative lighting that uses 90 percent less energy than traditional lighting. 
   NUCLEAR 
   * Because of the provisions in EPACT 05, including the loan guarantee authority, the production tax credits, and the insurance protection against licensing delays and litigation, nine generating companies and consortiums across the United States are preparing applications for permission to build between 9 and 19 new nuclear power plants. 
   * If all 19 are built, they would generate between 20,000-25,000 megawatts of new electricity between the years 2015 and 2020. 
   * Those plants would also create between 40,000 and 45,000 construction jobs and approximately 10,000 high paying, high-tech plant operation jobs. 
   ELECTRICITY 
   * Electric Reliability: The energy bill included several provisions aimed at ensuring consumers across America a reliable supply of electricity. These provisions are also intended to prevent blackouts like the massive power outage of August 2003 by instituting mandatory rules of reliability in place of the former voluntary regime. On February 3, 2006, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) finalized rules on the certification of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) and the procedures for the establishment, approval and enforcement of mandatory electric reliability standards. These are the critical first steps in enforcing a new regime of mandatory reliability standards that will also allow for regional variations and flexibility. 
   * Market Manipulation: The energy bill strengthened existing protections against the manipulation of energy prices by granting FERC authority to facilitate price transparency and by making the filing of false information or the general manipulation of wholesale energy services illegal under the Federal Power Act. These energy bill provisions were designed to prevent abuses such as the ones that drove up prices in California, Washington and Oregon in 1999 through 2001. On January 19, 2006, FERC finalized the anti-manipulation rules as required in the energy bill. Congress, in the energy bill, also enhanced FERC's ability to enforce market manipulation laws through increased penalties for violations. Because of the energy bill, the maximum penalty for violating the statute is now $1 million per day per violation. 
   * PUHCA Repeal: In the energy bill, Congress repealed the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935 because it was an arcane law that acted as a barrier to investment in much-needed energy infrastructure. Instead, Congress passed PUHCA 2005, a modern, streamlined version of the law that maintains protections for consumers against corporate abuses. On December 8, 2005, FERC issued rules that implemented the repeal of the old law and the implementation of the new law. These regulatory reforms will open the electricity and natural gas sectors to new sources of investment for necessary energy infrastructure development. 
   * Electric Mergers: On December 23, 2005, the Commission revised its merger authority under the Federal Power Act as required by the energy bill. The energy bill expanded FERC's merger authority over interstate transmission and interstate wholesale energy sales to also include acquisitions of generation facilities used in interstate commerce to further protect against potential abuse of market power. The energy bill requires FERC to make a finding that a proposed transaction will not result in cross-subsidizations of associate companies to the detriment of a public utility company. The energy bill also directed FERC to identify certain transactions for expedited merger treatment to facilitate investment. This final rule will help prevent the accumulation of generation market power and allows needed investment in generation and transmission. 
   * Gas Storage Pricing: On December 22, 2005, in compliance with the energy bill, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to modify its market-based rules for interstate natural gas storage services. The proposed rule is designed to promote the expansion of natural gas storage capacity. Greater natural gas storage is a way to mitigate natural gas price volatility. FERC's modified rule should provide further incentives for the expansion of existing and development of new natural gas storage. Under the energy bill, FERC must encourage adequate storage capacity be available to meet anticipated market demand and continue to ensure access to storage services at just and reasonable rates. 
   * PURPA Reform: Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, certain facilities that meet specific criteria, known as qualifying facilities (QFs), are eligible for mandatory purchase and sale benefits. These benefits entitle a QF to payments for its energy from a local utility at the level of what it would have cost the utility to generate the energy itself, the so-called "avoided cost". Over the past 25 years, a number of QFs have developed and some have abused the status. On January 19, 2006, in compliance with the energy bill, FERC proposed changes to the mandatory purchase regulations under PURPA. According to the energy bill, QF benefits terminate when the QF has access to a competitive wholesale market, thereby releasing a local utility from being the "captive buyer". The energy bill also directed FERC to set forth new criteria for future QFs to ensure that they are fundamentally designed to support commercial or industrial processes. 
   ENERGY EFFICIENCY: 
   * The energy bill implemented new efficiency standards for 15 large commercial and residential appliances that have, in the past, consumed a great deal of energy, such as commercial washer, refrigerators, freezers, air conditions and ice makers. 
   * In response to that mandate, the Department of Energy last month codified 15 new efficiency standards. 
   * Because of these new standards, we will save 50,000 MW off-peak electricity use by 2020 - which is an energy savings equal to more than 80 600 MW power plants. 
   CLEAN FUELS AND VEHICLES 
   * Because of the energy bill, effective February 15, 2006, gasoline in the United States is no longer required to have a 2 percent oxygenate standard, eliminating the need for MTBE, a controversial additive some say is harmful for the environment. 
   * The energy bill reduced the number of boutique fuels in the marketplace. By reducing the number of special fuels that have to be mixed at refineries, we reduce the cost of gasoline. 
   * Effective January 1, 2006, the energy bill replaces the tax deduction for buying hybrid cars with a tax credit, giving consumers a greater incentive to buy fuel-efficient cars. 
   ETHANOL 
   * Rural economies across the country are being revitalized through investment in ethanol production thanks to the ethanol mandate in the energy bill. Over the next six years alone, ethanol use will displace 2 billion barrels of foreign oil, create 234,840 new jobs, and boost American household incomes by $43 billion. 
   * Because of the ethanol mandate, 34 new ethanol plants are under construction and 8 existing plants are being expanded today. And more than 150 plants are in the works. Each plant employs between 40 and 50 people directly and creates hundreds of jobs throughout the local economy. These new plants will add more than 2 billion gallons of ethanol to the nation's fuel supply by 2007...a 50 percent growth in ethanol production capacity. 
   * In 2005, the U.S. ethanol industry supported the creation of 153,725 new jobs in all sectors of the economy, including more than 19,000 jobs in America's manufacturing sector. Ethanol added $5.7 billion to the bottom lines of American families and resulted in more than $1.6 billion in state and local tax revenue that can be used to build schools, hire first responders and improve roadways. Thanks to the ethanol mandate in the energy bill, these numbers will only continue to improve. 
   HYDROPOWER 
   * The resource agencies, in consultation with FERC, have issued an Interim Final Rule to implement the hydropower licensing reforms of the Energy Policy Act. The new rule allows any party to request a trial-type hearing on disputed issues of material fact and submit alternative conditions or prescriptions. Over the next decade, as FERC considers relicensing applications for about 20% of the nation's installed hydroelectric capacity, the new rule will ensure environmental protections while also allowing the consideration of conditions or prescriptions with lower cost or less energy impacts.
