SEN. THOMAS: SENATE CONFIRMS INDIAN AFFAIRS NOMINEE
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-WY, Vice-Chairman for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, scored a big win for Indian Country and the Bush Administration with the Senate confirmation of Carl Artman to be Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs within the Department of Interior. The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Mr. Artman by a vote of 87-1.  
   "Mr. Artman is an excellent candidate with a diversity of experience in both public and private sectors," Thomas said. "He has the leadership and academic credentials needed for this extraordinarily demanding position. He is also committed to assisting tribal governments develop the socio-economic infrastructure and fight the obstacles on many of our Indian reservations that foster hopelessness and despair." 
   "I am also encouraged by Mr. Artman's commitment to fighting and defeating the methamphetamine epidemic that is ravaging this nation's Indian communities," Thomas added. "Mr. Artman will serve the country well as Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. I applaud today's confirmation and I look forward to working with Mr. Artman in his new role." 
   The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs implements Federal Indian policy set forth by Congress and facilitates the government-to-government relationship with 561 Indian tribal governments. The Assistant Secretary is responsible for a variety of activities and programs in Indian communities including economic development, law enforcement, trust asset management, social services and education.
