SEN. THOMAS STATEMENT ON PREBLE'S MEADOW JUMPING MOUSE RULING
  The following is a statement by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on the announcement that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) has permanently extended an amended special rule for the threatened Preble's meadow jumping mouse.  
 The rule extension will allow "take" to occur as the result of certain rodent control, agricultural operations, landscape maintenance, noxious weed control, ditch maintenance, and other specified activities. The rule was set to expire on May 22, 2004. 
   "This is a positive move by the Fish and Wildlife Service that helps to relieve some of the burden on farmers, ranchers and others of having the mouse listed under the Endangered Species Act. I continue to believe the listing of the Preble's mouse was a mistake. Even Dr. Krutzsch, who first classified the Preble's mouse as a distinct species, now believes it is no different from another kind of mouse that is not listed. The 4(d) rule will not be necessary if the mouse is de-listed. I have urged the Fish and Wildlife Service to make sure they conduct a fair and thorough status review of the mouse. The status review, due to be completed in December of this year, will determine whether the Preble's meadow jumping mouse should be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. I look forward to the final decision and the opportunity to right a terrible wrong."
