SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON TRADE WITH SOUTH KOREA
 Sen. Craig Thomas on trade talks with South Korea:  
   "Expanding trade with South Korea and other nations in the region presents tremendous opportunities for the United States. 
   "About 25 percent of the world's population lives in Eastern Asia. South Korea is a key country in the region with a diverse and strong economy. 
   "Eliminating trade barriers that give our competitors an unfair advantage will be crucial to a successful agreement being reached. 
   "I will be particularly interested in the negotiations regarding beef and soda ash - two leading Wyoming exports. We need to ensure fair trade for products currently dealing with unfair global trade barriers. 
   "Because both countries are economically strong, these will be difficult and challenging discussions. I'm pleased that Ambassador Portman and the Administration have agreed to initiate the negotiations," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee under the Senate Finance Committee. The senator meets regularly with ambassadors from prominent trading nations to discuss ongoing negotiations. He participated in the trade talks in Cancun, Mexico in 2003.
