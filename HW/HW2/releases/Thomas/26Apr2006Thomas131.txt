DELEGATION SEEKS ANSWERS ON WYO CRUDE PRICES
  The Wyoming delegation is seeking answers about price differentials that exist for Wyoming crude oil and may seek further investigation if the low price cannot be clearly reconciled with what is happening in the market.  
   "While the price of crude oil has dropped significantly in the region, the price of gasoline and other refined products has remained high," the delegation wrote in a letter to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
   Depending on what answers come forward from the EIA, the delegation will go to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for further scrutiny of the price differential. 
   "While Wyoming's prices for refined gasoline are somewhat lower than the national average, the savings at the pump are not proportionate to the differential that exists for crude oil," the delegation wrote.
