SEN. THOMAS MEETS WITH SENIOR OFFICIALS OF FOREST SERVICE AND BLM
  "I have met this week with top officials in the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The lands these two agencies oversee are quite different, but I'm convinced both can be managed to produce energy while protecting the resource. In many ways Bureau of Land Management is fitted for broad use while the Forest Service areas tend to highlight uses like recreation. Currently only about 2 percent of Forest Service lands are used for oil and gas - much of that land is grassland which, while it is managed by the Forest Service, has a very different character than traditional forest areas. I support the current model for energy production in the forest, but I feel it should be limited."  
   "Energy production is a welcome and critical piece of our overall strategic plan for future economic success in Wyoming. In large part, our state's economy and job creation are driven by sound energy development and multiple-use of public lands." 
   "For over 30 years I've been working directly to ensure we remain a national leader in energy, new research technologies, and pursuing legislation that will give us an advantage. I'm proud of what we have accomplished and that work continues full speed." 
   "Equally important, is a commitment to Wyoming's outdoor heritage and legacy that includes public access and enjoyment of our special and unique public lands. Wyoming has a distinguished history of carefully managing certain lands to be open and accessible for recreation, hunting, fishing, wildlife and grazing. I recognize the economic value of these activities as well." 
   "As we move ahead, Wyoming can and should continue to support a vibrant energy economy while we seek to enhance and protect public access and enjoyment on other areas such as forests. Balance that supports multiple uses is what we should all be striving for."
