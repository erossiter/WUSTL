SEN. THOMAS: SENATE FUEL PRICE REVIEWS WILL CONTINUE
  Sen. Craig Thomas said today that Congressional investigations into market manipulation at the pumps and soaring winter heating costs will continue full speed until the energy industry provides straight answers to the public.  
   Thomas announced that the Energy Committee will hold a joint hearing with the Commerce Committee on Wednesday, Nov. 9 as part of the effort. 
   "Heating costs are skyrocketing and the impact on consumers is troubling. At a hearing in mid-October we learned that our nation's winter fuel supply is sufficient and yet the prices are rising out of control," Thomas said. "There seems to be more than just market forces at work." 
   "Market speculation is clearly part of the reason we have seen a jump in prices at the pump," Thomas said. "It is past time for some straight talk, and then solutions." 
   "On one hand, we've seen gas prices level off as production has come back online in the Gulf, but we also see consumers pinched between prices at the pump and high winter heating costs. We need to get to the heart of this for consumers," Thomas said. 
   "This is a significant issue for everyone, but particularly seniors and folks on a fixed income," Thomas said. "Hard working Wyoming folks want to know what to expect in the short term." 
   "If there are steps we should take to improve refinery capacity, production, or provide some other interim measure - we need to move quickly on a solution," Thomas said. 
   "Energy Pricing and Profits," is a Joint Hearing between the Energy and Commerce committees. Major oil CEOs and state attorneys general are expected to testify. 
   It will be the ninth Senate review of energy prices since Katrina. The Energy Committee has held five hearings on energy prices and the Finance Committee has held two since the hurricanes hit the Gulf. Thomas is a member of both the Energy and Finance committees.
