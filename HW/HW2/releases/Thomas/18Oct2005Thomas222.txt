SEN. THOMAS REVIEWS WINTER FUEL SUPPLY
  Sen. Craig Thomas pressed witnesses today regarding fuel supplies and the effect of high prices for the upcoming winter. Experts noted that winter fuel supplies were adequate for the nation. 
   "If the nation's winter fuel supply is sufficient - why are we paying so much? Don't the economics of supply and demand apply?" Thomas said. "Consumers deserve to know if there is excessive speculation causing price spikes. The only thing left to do in the short-term is to hold down consumption."
