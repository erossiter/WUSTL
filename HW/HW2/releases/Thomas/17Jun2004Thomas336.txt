WYOMING TO GET NEARLY $15 MILLION THROUGH PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today announced that Wyoming is set to receive $14,627,836 million from the distribution of Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) for Fiscal Year 2004. PILT compensates local governments for the federal lands within counties that would otherwise generate property taxes. Payments under the PILT program are in addition to federal revenues, such as income generated from the use of federal land for livestock grazing, timber harvests, oil and gas leases and mineral receipts.  
   "This money is crucial for our county governments to provide necessary services such as firefighting, law enforcement, road maintenance and infrastructure needs on federally owned lands in Wyoming," Thomas said. "We struggle every year to raise awareness in Congress about the critical role PILT plays in counties that include large amounts of federal lands." 
   In May, Senator Thomas-a long-time and successful advocate for the program-organized a group of 56 lawmakers petitioning key Senate appropriators to boost the program to $255 million for FY 2005. This year's national PILT total of over $224 million represents an increase of $6.1 million more than Fiscal Year 2003. 
   Thomas said the Department of the Interior's Fiscal Year 2005 budget request is insufficient for the federal government to keep its commitment to public land counties. The current PILT authorization level which Thomas supported is $340 million, however, the Department of the Interior's FY 2005 budget request is $226 million.
