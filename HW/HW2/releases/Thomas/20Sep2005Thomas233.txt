SEN. THOMAS: JAPAN BEEF TRADE A MATTER OF FAIRNESS
  Sen. Craig Thomas won a victory today for U.S. beef producers when the Senate passed an amendment aimed at cutting off access to the U.S. market until Japan opens their border to beef.  
   The amendment, which passed 72-26, prevents the USDA from opening the U.S. border to Japanese beef before they open their border to American beef. 
   "This is a matter of fairness. It's time for the United States to assert itself in international trade concerns - not allow other countries market access while we have the door closed in our face. Japan shouldn't be allowed access to our market while our beef producers continue to have no access in Japan," Thomas said. 
   Thomas recently sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns urging him not to open the border to Japanese beef before Japan opens its border to U.S. beef. 
   On Aug. 18, USDA published a rule to allow the importation of boneless beef cuts from Japan. Currently, no Japanese beef is allowed into the United States. 
   Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska introduced the amendment to the FY 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill today that would prevent USDA from opening the U.S. border to Japanese beef before they open their border to American beef.
