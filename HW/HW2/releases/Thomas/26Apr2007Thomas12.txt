SEN. THOMAS: DEMOCRATS HANDCUFF U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today said Senate Democrats have recklessly pushed ahead with a troop funding bill that calls for a U.S. withdrawal beginning on October 1, 2007.  
   "We had a good report yesterday from the commanding General in Iraq - General David Petraeus," Thomas said. "He indicated that we are seeing steady progress because of our new approach, and new military leadership. I'm disappointed that Senate Democrats insist on moving ahead with this ill-advised effort that makes it even more difficult to complete the mission." 
   "The effort to provide emergency funding has taken way too long - 79 days too long in fact. We have troops in the field who have very real needs that this funding could pay for. In addition, our Armed Forces are facing shortages in health care, facilities upkeep, and construction dollars." 
   President Bush has vowed that he will veto the bill, which also contains over $20 billion of unrelated war spending. 
   "I'm optimistic that the Senate will have the opportunity again, after the President vetoes this bill, to get this right and get the funding to our troops. I will do my part to ensure that we do that."
