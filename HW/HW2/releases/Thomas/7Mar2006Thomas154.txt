ENERGY PANEL, SEN. THOMAS TACKLE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee convened a hearing today to discuss the goal of energy independence. Sen. Craig Thomas will focus his efforts on near-term solutions as well as long-term solutions to energy independence.  
   "In 1973 the Arab oil embargo introduced a new weapon to global conflict. Ever since, we've been talking about our need to reduce foreign dependence. However, imports have gone from 28 percent in the early 1970s to 59 percent last year," Thomas said. 
   "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 put us on a solid footing for the future, but we need to continue working on solutions to our energy problems." 
   "Wyoming produces 10 percent of primary energy in the U.S. with less than 1 percent of the nation's population. We have abundant resources right here in the United States - oil, natural gas, hydroelectric dams, wind, nuclear power - and we need to use them. But in the interim we need to use coal and advance coal technologies." 
   Coal and Coal-to-Liquids Technology 
   "Coal is an abundant and affordable fuel that should be utilized to increase our energy independence. Gasification and carbon sequestration allow coal to be more environmentally friendly," Thomas said. 
   "Oil is the commodity we most rely on foreign countries for. We consume two-thirds of the oil we use in the transportation sector. Coal-to-liquids technology will allow us to reduce our dependence on oil imports by as much as 2 million barrels a day by the year 2025." 
   Electricity Grid 
   "It is important that we modernize our electricity grid to provide cheap, reliable energy to the nation and strengthen it against attack." 
   "We have discussed many of the proposals out there for years, we must act in the short term to reduce prices and continue our efforts for the future," Thomas said.
