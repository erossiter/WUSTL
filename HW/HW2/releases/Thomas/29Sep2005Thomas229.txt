SEN. THOMAS: 'IDENTIFY CUTS, END NEEDLESS PROGRAMS'
  "I'm astonished that the federal government has grown so large that there is no way to know how many federal programs there are - let alone how much those programs cost taxpayers. My bill will not only inventory those programs, but identify those that should be eliminated. Many programs are not fulfilling their stated mission, are duplicative, and redundant. It's time to return to fiscal responsibility," Sen. Craig Thomas said.  
   "At a time when we face record spending, I believe we must look for ways to save in other areas to offset some of these costs. My bill will create the necessary mechanisms to regularly and formally examine whether federal programs and agencies are achieving, or have achieved desired results for the American people. My sense is that we'll identify cuts and end needless programs," Thomas said. 
   Thomas, in an effort wrestle down runaway spending over the long-term, is sponsoring the Government Reorganization and Program Performance Improvement Act. The bill puts in place a Sunset Commission to inventory, evaluate, and abolish federal programs. 
   "My bill is a step toward restoring some common sense to what we're putting our dollars behind," Thomas said on the floor of the Senate. 
   "I believe that Congress must do a great deal more to hold down spending over the long-term. The time is right to discuss what I believe is a common sense proposal to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs." 
   Thomas contacted all of his Senate colleagues today seeking support for S. 1399, which will put a system in place to not only evaluate, but either improve, or abolish programs depending on their performance. Wyoming's senior senator has been working closely with the Office of Management and Budget and the White House to get this legislation under way.
