SEN. THOMAS: JOHNNIE BURTON TAKES INTERIOR POST
  Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that Wyoming's own Johnnie Burton will take the reins as Acting Assistant Secretary of Interior for Land and Minerals Management.  
   The senator recommended her to Vice President Dick Cheney, Interior Secretary Gale Norton and White House staff recently, as the position became available. 
   "I was proud to recommend Johnnie for this important leadership role at Interior," Thomas said today. "She will be a tremendous asset in a crucial position. I can't think of a more important post with dramatic impact over Wyoming's resources than the assistant secretary position. 
   "She'll oversee all of our nation's offshore and onshore energy resources. I can't think of a better person for Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   The position administers the Bureau of Land Management, Minerals Management Service, and the Office of Surface Mining agencies, all integral to Wyoming's economy. 
   "Her efforts in managing our nation's energy resources have been central to securing our country's energy economy. She has done tremendous work in getting the oil and gas production back online after the hurricanes," Thomas said. 
   Burton served as director of the Wyoming Department of Revenue, and on the governor's cabinet from 1995 to 2002. She was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1982 to 1988. She also held a leadership role in various energy exploration and service companies.
