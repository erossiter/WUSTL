SEN. THOMAS SELECTS MILITARY ACADEMY NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) has announced his nominees for appointments to the U.S. military service academies.  
 Thomas' nominations are for the graduating class of 2009 at the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. 
   "One of the distinct honors of representing Wyoming as a U.S. Senator is having the opportunity to nominate some of our brightest students to serve their country and attend a military academy. The academies are challenging both academically and physically for those selected, and their commissioning after graduation is a testimony to their character," Thomas said. 
   Young men and women interested in U.S. service academies apply to members of Congress for nominations. Those nominated are screened by academy officials; and students with the best scholastic and personal credentials are selected for admission. Final appointments will be announced over the next few months as the selections are made, Thomas said.
