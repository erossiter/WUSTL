SEN. THOMAS: THAILAND TAKES LEAD IN OPENING BEEF MARKET
  "I applaud Thailand leadership for acknowledging what we in the U.S. already know - our beef is the safest on the planet.  
 There's no reason to keep high-quality American beef out of the Asian market," U.S. Senator Craig Thomas said today. 
   Late last night, the Thai government reopened their market to U.S. beef. The United States has been working with Thailand and other countries around the world to remove the remaining restrictions on U.S. beef exports. Upon review, Thailand determined that U.S. control measures assure the safety of our nation's beef. 
   "My resolve to reopening the Asian markets is unwavering. I will take this fight on behalf of U.S. beef to the upcoming WTO talks in Hong Kong," Thomas said. 
   Wyoming's senior senator said he will continue to work with Secretary Johanns and Ambassador Portman to open the beef trade in Asian markets. 
   "The exportation of Wyoming beef is crucial to our ranchers and it remains one of my top priorities. Our ranchers shouldn't have to continuously take a hit in the wallet because of knee-jerk reaction. It's time we open the borders and get the trade flowing again," Thomas said.
