SEN. THOMAS: NATIONAL ECONOMY GROWING - OUTLOOK POSITIVE
  Reviewing the latest economic numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said today the nation's economy and job base is vibrant and growing.  
   "In the face of unprecedented national challenges, we are experiencing a robust economic expansion and sustained job creation. There is no better example of that growth than in Wyoming. Our state's economy has created thousands of quality, high-paying jobs over the past few years and that expansion is only going to continue," Thomas said. 
   Since August 2003, the economy has created nearly 5.3 million jobs (138,000 new jobs in April). The economy has experienced 32 consecutive months of job growth and is creating better jobs in high-wage fields. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, lower than the averages of the last four decades. Wyoming has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 3.2 percent. 
   "It's important that we continue to pass responsible legislation that will fuel our strong economy. We have passed pro-growth tax policies to ensure that Americans have more money to spend and invest," Thomas said. "I have introduced a package of three bills that will help folks prepare for their retirement and save more money. The SAVE Initiative that I authored promotes lifetime savings, retirement savings, and employer retirement savings." 
   "As we move forward in this legislative year, I will continue to seek ways to keep more money in the pockets of hard working Wyoming folks - where it belongs. With the upcoming summer driving months at our feet, the need to reduce gas prices has intensified the need to find creative energy solutions and I'm spearheading efforts to accomplish this work," Thomas said. 
   Thomas is a member of both the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Energy Committee.
