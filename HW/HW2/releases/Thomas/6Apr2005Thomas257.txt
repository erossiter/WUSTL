DELEGATION URGES CITIZENS TO GIVE IRS FEEDBACK
  Sens. Craig Thomas, Mike Enzi, and Rep. Barbara Cubin, all R-Wyo., are encouraging Wyoming citizens to take an active role in ensuring that taxpayers have a voice when dealing with the Internal Revenue Service.  
   Wyoming is one of the only states that does not currently have a representative on the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel (TAP), a volunteer group of citizens that make suggestions to the IRS on how to improve customer service and satisfaction. 
   "During this time of year, every taxpayer deals with the IRS and some find the experience frustrating. That is why this is a great time to voice opinions on improvements that will affect every taxpayer. Common sense solutions will help the IRS serve taxpayers better and we hope a Wyoming resident will volunteer to provide a citizen voice from our state," the delegation said. 
   TAP is looking for ordinary citizens to give an outside perspective on IRS processes and procedures that cause taxpayers problems. Applicants must have up to date income taxes, be U.S. citizens, and able to commit 300 to 500 hours during the year to the panel. IRS employees can not serve on the panel. 
   The application period runs from April 1 through April 29, 2005. For more information on TAP and how to apply, click on or call Ann Logan in Cheyenne at 307-633-0881.
