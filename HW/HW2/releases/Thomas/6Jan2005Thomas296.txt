SEN. THOMAS APPLAUDS DECISION TO KEEP SAGE GROUSE OFF ENDANGERED LIST
  "This DOI ruling is vindication for the reforms that I have pushed for in all of my years in Congress.  
 What we have is a group of laws that are terribly flawed and the science that was to support listing a species frequently isn't there. We have seen this time and again, and the attempt to list the Sage Grouse is a perfect example of a law gone haywire. I will continue to push for reforms to antiquated endangered species laws." 
   The Department of the Interior's (DOI) decision to keep the Sage Grouse off the Endangered Species List was announced this evening by Secretary Gale Norton at an event held in Arizona.
