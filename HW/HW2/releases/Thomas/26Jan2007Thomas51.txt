SEN. THOMAS ISSUES STATEMENT ON GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., on Friday, Jan. 26, issued the following statement regarding the Senate's confirmation of Army Lt. Gen. David Petraeus to be the new commander of U.S. forces in Iraq:  
   "It's fitting that the Senate has unanimously approved General Petraeus to take the reins in Iraq. His valuable leadership and battle-tested experience will allow him to execute the President's new strategy for victory in Iraq. He is the man capable of carrying out the plan in that worn torn nation." 
   "The situation in Iraq is riddled with obstacles and challenges. But I believe General Petraeus has shown through his work in Mosul that his efforts for economic development and political outreach as part of a military strategy, will allow Iraqis the opportunity to provide for their own security. And that's what they need to do." 
   "I have said for the past year that the United States' position should be that of a support role in Iraq - we cannot step in to set Iraq's government in motion for them. I believe that the General can prove to be the linchpin in the plan for Iraq to become a more unified government."
