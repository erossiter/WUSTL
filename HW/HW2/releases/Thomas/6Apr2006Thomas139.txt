SEN. THOMAS SAYS NO TO SENATE IMMIGRATION DEAL
  As the Senate reaches a compromise on immigration reform, Sen. Craig Thomas calls the deal troubling and problematic.  
   "I don't want to see any so-called compromise in the Senate become blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants. While I'm supportive of temporary workers, I believe this agreement rewards illegal immigrants with a quick path to citizenship after their work visa expires." 
   "Let's not forget that this is illegal behavior that we shouldn't be rewarding," Thomas said. "This compromise only encourages future illegal immigration." 
   The Pew Hispanic Center has indicated how many individuals the Senate compromise would affect for each case under the compromise: 
   * In the U.S. less than two years: 1.7 million 
   * Between two and five years: 2.5 million 
   * More than five years: 7.7 million 
   * Total: 11.9 million 
   "The potential effects of this deal guarantee that a greater and greater number of illegal immigrants and their families, who are currently outside the United States, will be on the path to a green card. This is a troubling and problematic deal that I plan to oppose." 
   A vote on the compromise is expected in the Senate Friday.
