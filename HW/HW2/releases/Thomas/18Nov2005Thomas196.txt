SEN. THOMAS REQUEST FUNDS AGRICULTURE RESEARCH
  In an effort to support agricultural research, Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that he was able to secure $900,000 for the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Extension Center (SAREC) near Torrington.  
   "This type of research is an important piece of Wyoming's agricultural economy. It helps farmers and ranchers improve their production efficiency. In addition, this research develops techniques that are beneficial to the environment," Thomas said. 
   The money was appropriated today as part of H.R. 3058, the Transportation, Treasury, The Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD), and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2006. 
   "As we seek to diversify and strengthen Wyoming's economy, this funding will provide opportunities for our young people and families. The jobs created by SAREC will keep people at work in Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   SAREC will be comprised of a community center building, a laboratory/processing building, and a dormitory building for use by faculty, scientists and graduate students. The community center building is expected to benefit all of Southeastern Wyoming. 
   Senator Thomas' request covers expenses for construction costs, equipment purchases and installation costs. 
   SAREC's goal is to ensure agricultural sustainability while addressing environmental concerns. The community center will provide a place for enhanced cooperation with industry and the integration of research and community outreach efforts. 
   The TTHUD Appropriations bill passed the Senate today and is anticipated to be signed into law by the President.
