SEN. THOMAS CHALLENGES FOREST SERVICE LEASE PROPOSAL IN BRIDGER-TETON
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) questioned the recent Forest Service proposal for potential oil and gas development in some of the areas of the Bridger Teton National Forest that he considers inappropriate for drilling.  
   "Some locations in the northern portion of the Bridger-Teton National Forest should be off limits to oil and gas leasing. The Forest Service should produce justification for production in the identified leasing areas," Thomas said Tuesday. 
   "We must work to ensure that the natural beauty of the Bridger-Teton National Forest is protected. This area supports a wide variety of wildlife and has many outstanding features. In addition, since the forest is in close proximity to Grand Teton National Park, we must make sure this area is well protected. 
   "I'm committed to responsible energy development but I've long held the belief that there are areas in the state more appropriate for oil and gas exploration than some of the areas proposed. Clearly, some areas should and deserve to be protected. 
   "As chairman of the Senate's National Parks Subcommittee, I am keenly aware that national forests are not national parks or all wilderness areas. As such, they should be managed to support various activities including hunting, fishing, timber production, grazing, mineral development as well as having other areas that should be set aside. I'm concerned about allowing oil and gas exploration to occur in proximity to Teton Park and the Forest Service needs to show the public why they proposed it." 
   Three years ago, Thomas took the singular stance of a no-drill area in the Upper Green River and Teton County, setting the perimeter of protection from oil and gas drilling in Teton County.
