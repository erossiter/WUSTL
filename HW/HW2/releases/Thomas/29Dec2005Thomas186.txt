REP. THOMAS: HONG KONG TO ALLOW U.S. BEEF
  After the recent decision by Japan to open its borders to U.S. beef, another Asian market has followed suit today.  
 Hong Kong, previously the fifth largest importer of U.S. beef, has reopened its border to American beef. 
   "I am pleased that another Asian market has shed its bias and will import our beef. The snowball effect that is beginning to take place in Asia is great news for Wyoming producers. Finally, we may begin to recoup what has been lost over the past couple of years," Thomas said. 
   The senator said the agreement announced today will allow the United States to export boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months of age to Hong Kong under the Beef Export Verification Program. This agreement follows Hong Kong's determination that U.S. control measures effectively ensure the safety of our beef. 
   "I believe that all of our beef is safe and will continue to push for a less restrictive agreement," Thomas said. "International trade requires a fair exchange of goods." 
   Thomas has been at the forefront of the debate since Asian markets decided to ban U.S. beef in 2003. In addition to being a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he is the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee. 
   Since the first border closure in 2003, the U.S. beef industry has lost about $6 billion in income.
