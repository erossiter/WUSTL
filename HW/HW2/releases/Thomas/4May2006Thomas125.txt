SEN. THOMAS: KEMPTHORNE NEEDS CONFIRMATION, NOT HOLDS
  Sen. Craig Thomas used a Senate Energy Committee hearing today to assure that Wyoming's needs will remain a top priority for the Department of the Interior (DOI).  
   DOI Secretary Nominee, Dirk Kempthorne, promised Thomas that endangered species reform, the protection of our national parks, and continuing multiple-use on public lands would remain in the DOI hopper. 
   "Obviously the people of Wyoming are very concerned with how their neighbor, the Department of the Interior, manages their land. Our National Parks are special places that need special protections and attention. Interior's management of the land influences almost every sector of our economy, from coal to oil and gas development, to agriculture, to tourism and recreation," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas touched on the need to continue the development of multiple energy sources to put an end to increasing gas prices and dependence on foreign oil. "We have two repositories of oil right at our fingertips?ANWR and Lease Area 181. It's time to get to the business of solving America's energy problems," Thomas said. 
   "Governor Kempthorne has proven himself as a methodical and intelligent manager. There is no need to hold up his nomination because he has creative solutions to our energy problems." 
   Kempthorne's nomination has been put on hold because of his approval of drilling plans in the Gulf Coast. "People keep saying that since Katrina, our nation's gas pumps have become the dreaded monster. But if we open up the Gulf Coast to off-shore drilling, we can certainly ease the burden on our wallets," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas invited Kempthorne to Wyoming to get a first-hand look at the issues concerning the state.
