SEN. THOMAS DEMANDS EQUITY FOR RURAL HEALTH
  Sen. Craig Thomas says the omission of rural programs from the Labor HHS bill, H.R. 3010, decimates our nation's fragile rural health network.  
   "Efforts to restore rural health funding were derailed by Labor HHS conferees. It's a sad day when proven and effective programs for rural health delivery get cut amid all the other spending," Thomas said. 
   "I realize the need to hold down spending, but these were small rural programs with a big impact on rural states. These important programs are once again bearing the brunt, while urban health programs continue on virtually untouched. Rural programs are taking a disproportionate hit." 
   "There's no mechanism for determining whether the programs funded today are worthwhile. This further underlines why we need to pass my Sunset Commission legislation. Once we determine the effectiveness of these programs, then we can better evaluate what kinds of programs should and should not receive funding," he said. 
   In a letter sent to Senate appropriators, signed by 45 member of Rural Health Caucus, Thomas requested full funding for rural health care be retained in the Labor HHS bill. It was contained when it passed the Senate, but the House version demolished the rural health provisions. 
   "There was room in the budget for these programs and support in the Congress. But now we're indiscriminately targeting rural programs for cuts that decimate rural health networks," Thomas said. 
   "Members of the caucus worked hard to include these provisions and it's tough to see all of that work torn apart. I will continue to fight for rural health equity."
