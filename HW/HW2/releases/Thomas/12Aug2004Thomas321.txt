SEN. THOMAS RESPONDS TO REMOVAL OF BLACK-TAILED PRARIE DOG FROM ENDANGERED SPECIES CANDIDATE LIST
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today announced that it will remove the Black-Tailed Prairie Dog from the endangered species candidate list. Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), who has been a strong proponent of reforming the endangered species listing process, was pleased with the announcement. 
   "I am very pleased with the decision made today. This verdict vindicates the beliefs of many in Wyoming who said that listing this species does not make sense. The Fish and Wildlife folks have taken a long, hard look at the circumstances surrounding this species and determined that it does not belong on the endangered species list. Their decision validates what I have been saying for many years - there must be solid scientific evidence to warrant a species being identified as endangered or threatened."
