SEN. THOMAS URGES WYOMINGITES TO VOTE TOMORROW
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) reminds everyone across Wyoming to vote tomorrow in the statewide primary election. Sen.  
 Thomas, who will vote in Casper, noted that this election is especially important because it is a presidential election year. 
   "As national and state elections in the past have shown, every vote is important. The only way for our democracy to work is for people, the citizens of this great state, to get out and have their voices heard. Abraham Lincoln once said, 'Elections belong to the people. It is their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blisters.' His words are still pertinent and I hope everyone uses their unique right as an American to build the course of our future." 
   In addition to the presidential election, tomorrow's primary will also decide the fate of those running for the U.S. House of Representatives, 60 Wyoming State House races, and 16 Wyoming State Senate races. 
   Senator Thomas is scheduled to vote, along with his wife Susan, at 4:00 p.m. Thomas' home polling place is the St. Stephens Episcopal Church, 4700 South Poplar Street in Casper. 
   A complete list of the 2004 Wyoming primary election candidates and other election information can be found at the Secretary of State website.
