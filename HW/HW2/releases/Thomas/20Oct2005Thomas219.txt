SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON GUN MANUFACTURERS LIABILITY
  "Holding gun manufacturers responsible for criminal use of guns doesn't make sense. We need to place blame where it belongs. I'm pleased the provision made it through the House, so we don't have to watch gun-control advocates abuse the courts with lawsuits," Thomas said. 
   "Folks in Wyoming should know that we won't let heavy legal costs threaten an industry that's important to Wyoming. This is important to our state's hunters." 
   "Forcing gun manufacturers out of business takes guns away from law abiding citizens and sportsmen," Thomas said.
