SEN. THOMAS, SENATE GIVE PERKINS BILL THE NOD, 99-0
  The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Bill passed the Senate today with a vote of 99-0, the bill creates an open door for students who would not otherwise get a four-year degree to receive occupational preparation.  
   U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said, "The Perkins program provides opportunities for folks in Wyoming to develop skills to improve their future. As we approach many issues facing our state, especially education, I'm reminded that successful programs have a common aim - to improve our quality of life - Perkins does that." 
   "Wyoming's needs are different than our urban counterparts. Educational needs in Chugwater, for instance, are different from the needs, of say, Chicago. The bill has strong support among Wyoming educators," Thomas said. 
   Trent Blankenship, Wyoming's superintendent of schools, had this to say about the legislation, "I'm very pleased by the action taken today by the U.S. Senate to reauthorize the Carl Perkins program. This legislation is important to the educational opportunities available to Wyoming's students. I have met with the Wyoming delegation to express strong support for the Perkins program and I applaud the leadership given this issue by Wyoming's congressional delegation," Blankenship said.
