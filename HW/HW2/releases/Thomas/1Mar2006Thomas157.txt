ENERGY POLICY ACCELERATES WYO COAL-TO-LIQUIDS PLANT
  Sen. Craig Thomas said the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is being utilized by DKRW to accelerate the start-up of a coal-to-liquids plant in Wyoming.  
   "I'm extremely pleased to see what has been done to get the coal-to-liquids plant underway in Hanna. After touring the site with the company and with community leaders, it's exciting to see the technology we've laid out in our energy policy begin to pay off. And it's exciting to see the number of jobs that could come to Hanna." 
   Thomas toured the site with DKRW officials and Hanna community leaders in November 2005. As a senior member of the Senate Energy Committee, Thomas advocated for provisions to bring advanced coal technologies like this one to Wyoming. 
   "This is just the beginning and I hope to see even more exciting energy opportunities come to Wyoming," Thomas said. "With the legislation in place, the market providing the opportunities, and our industry partners grabbing a hold of 'em - projects like these will keep coming Wyoming's way." 
   "The Energy Policy Act certainly spurs opportunities for industry to make the most of these important technology advances for the use of coal. While this project has been years in coming, the provisions in the energy policy have helped accelerate this opportunity." 
   "This will be an exciting opportunity for Hanna and for Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   The first phase of the Medicine Bow project is designed to produce approximately 11,000 bpd of ultra-clean diesel fuel and other fuels from coal. The project will use a coal gasification technology made possible by the General Electric Company. 
   "It's very encouraging to see the cooperation of industry partners with federal and local governments, to make this project become a reality. There has been a wonderful amount of cooperation.
