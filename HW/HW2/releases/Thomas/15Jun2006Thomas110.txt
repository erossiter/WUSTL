SEN. THOMAS ANNOUNCES NEW PODCAST WEBSITE
  Using technology to wire his audio comments to anyone with an mp3 player, Sen. Craig Thomas announced his Podcast Web site today. Audio and video is now available on the Sen. Craig Thomas' Podcast Web site at the iTunes Music Store online.  
   "My hope is that my Podcast site will allow folks to access the information in a format that fits best with their busy schedules. It's important to me to get the word out about what's happening to improve the lives of folks in Wyoming." 
   A Podcast is audio or visual content that is automatically delivered over a network via free subscription. Once subscribed to, Podcasts can be regularly distributed over the Internet or within a school's network and accessed with an iPod, laptop, or desktop computer (both Macs and PCs). 
   "I understand that some folks might be a little skeptical of this technology - I was once one of those people. But, if I can see and understand what this service has to offer, I am sure folks across the state will be able to do the same," Thomas said. 
   Thomas' Podcast is available from the iTunes Music Store. It is available at: Thomas Podcast 
   The iTunes Music Store can be accessed at Apple iTunes 
   The most recent ten audio files are available on the Thomas Podcast site. Senator Thomas is looking forward to adding video files in the future.
