SEN. THOMAS CONGRATULATES COLLEGE FOR $2M GRANT
  In a phone call to the Sheridan College dean today, Sen. Craig Thomas congratulated the school for obtaining a nearly $2 million grant to train workers in the energy trades.  
   "What a tremendous shot in the arm to fill our workforce needs in the energy industry," Thomas said in a phone call to Dr. Paul Young, who wrote the grant for the school. Thomas wrote a letter of support when the grant was submitted. 
   "Partnerships between educators and industry are vital to make the most of Wyoming's tremendous energy resources. Grants like these are the building blocks of programs, like those at Sheridan College, to train workers to be part of our state's energy economy," Thomas said. 
   Thomas met with economic development and industry leaders last July about vo-tech opportunities for training workers in Northeast Wyoming. Thomas continues to look for ways to bring people together to improve educational and economic opportunities in the state. 
   The Gillette Campus of Sheridan College will receive $1,997,385 aimed at increasing training opportunities for industrial electric, welding, and diesel programs as they support the energy industry. The project will recruit new participants as well as upgrade the skills of current workers. The college estimates that 405 individuals will earn certificates or degrees and 1,425 will receive short-term training under the grant. 
   "The ongoing growth of our energy sector depends on partnerships with educators. I'm pleased that Wyoming's schools are taking action now that we've laid the groundwork with the Energy Policy Act," Wyoming's senior senator said. 
   Thomas is a senior member of the Senate Energy Committee. He brought UW educators together last week to talk about the opportunities available to educational institutions under the Energy Policy Act to make students part of Wyoming's energy economy.
