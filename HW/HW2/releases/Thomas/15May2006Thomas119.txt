SEN. THOMAS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL GUARD AT BORDER
  Thomas Statement on National Guard at the border   
   "It makes sense to have our National Guard help protect the border as a short-term strategy. But I don't believe this should be a long-term presence. Until we've added an adequate number of border patrol to our resources on the border, the National Guard is an appropriate interim measure," Sen.Thomas said. 
   "They're talking about using only a small percentage of our National Guard force as a supplement to border patrol agents - which is prudent. We have a highly trained and capable National Guard."
