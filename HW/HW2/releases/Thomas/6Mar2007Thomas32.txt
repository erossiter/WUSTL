SEN. THOMAS ACCEPTING MILITARY ACADEMY APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Tuesday, March 6, announced that he is accepting applications for appointments to the U.S. military service academies for the 2008 school year. Sen. Craig Thomas nominates up to ten people, annually, to compete for each vacancy at four of the service academies.  
   "One of the distinct honors of representing Wyoming as a U.S. Senator is having the opportunity to nominate some of our brightest students to serve their country and attend a military academy. The academies are challenging both academically and physically for those selected, and their commissioning after graduation is a testimony to their character," Thomas said. 
   Young men and women interested in U.S. service academies apply to members of Congress for nominations. Those nominated are screened by academy officials; and students with the best scholastic and personal credentials are selected for admission. 
   The nominations are based on: 
   * Wyoming resident, 17-22 years of age 
   * Receipt of application form and all required information 
   * High school grades through at least the end of junior year 
   * Results of Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT-I) or American College Testing (ACT) scores 
   * Evaluation of leadership based on extracurricular activities, offices held, awards etc. 
   * Letters of reference from principal and two instructors 
   Following a nomination, final selection and appointment is made by each service academy based on: character, scholarship, leadership, physical aptitude, medical fitness, goals and motivation and suitability for a military career.
