SEN. THOMAS LAUDS EFFORTS TO RESUME BEEF TRADE
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., responded to the announcement today by Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns about efforts to resume U.S. beef and beef product exports to South Korea and Japan.  
   "I'm pleased to see the Secretary aggressively working on our trade routes to Asia. Opening these markets is important to Wyoming cattle producers and the American beef industry," Thomas said. 
   "Our beef is safe and each additional day we face these trade barriers costs our economy," Thomas said. "South Korea and Japan will have an opportunity to see the science behind our safety practices. Mad cow regulations should be more closely in line with the World Organization (OIE) guidelines," Thomas said. 
   According to statistics released from the Department of Agriculture, before Japan and Korea banned U.S. beef, the United States exported approximately $1.4 billion worth of beef and beef products to Japan and $815 million to South Korea. Together these markets represented 57 percent of total U.S. beef exports by value. 
   Thomas is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. He is also the Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee.
