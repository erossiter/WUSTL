SEN. THOMAS SEEKS SULFUR STANDARD FIX FOR COAL
A bill introduced by Sen. Craig Thomas Tuesday, S. 4076, is seeking a technical correction to the Coal Title of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The fix makes an equitable standard for both high-sulfur and low-sulfur coal.  
 The bill will make a clear standard for sulfur removal so that companies looking to build clean-coal power plants in Wyoming can get fair consideration for funding from the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Power Initiative. 
 "The 99 percent sulfur removal standard was a problem in the Tax Title and the Coal Title of the Energy Policy Act," Thomas said. "It's only reasonable to have a standard that all coal types can meet." 
 Thomas introduced a bill Tuesday to fix the Coal Title of the energy policy to reflect a standard that both eastern and western coal can meet. 
 The bill will bring the standard to .04 pounds of sulfur per million British thermal units (Btu) or 99 percent. Essentially, 99 percent removal from Eastern coal would bring it down to .05 pounds of sulfur per million Btu and the Western coal standard will be .04 pounds of sulfur per million Btu. 
 Thomas said the technical correction bill has a chance of moving during the lame duck session. He said the problem was brought to light by the Department of Energy after applying the standards to pending proposals. 
 Senator Thomas has also co-sponsored Sen. Norm Coleman's separate bill, S. 3883, to fix the same standards in the Tax Title of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
