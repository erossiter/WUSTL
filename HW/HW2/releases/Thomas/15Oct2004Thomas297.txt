DECISION ON SLED BAN LAUDED BY SEN. THOMAS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today announced his approval of a ruling handed down by District Court Judge Clarence Brimmer that struck down a decision made by President Bill Clinton which prohibited snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  
 Brimmer's decision will take effect immediately, opening the parks to snowmobilers this winter. 
   "It's a great thing. I'm delighted that we came to a decision on the Clinton "Midnight" Rule that has caused us so many problems. We must not forget that these parks belong to the people and the people ought to have reasonable access. We can achieve a balance so that people can visit unique areas in the parks while taking care of the environment. We look forward to operating in the parks this winter. 
   "I'm pleased that we have righted this wrong, and that Judge Brimmer, who is from the area, made the decision."
