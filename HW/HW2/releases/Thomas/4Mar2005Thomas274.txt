SEN. THOMAS TO ROLL OUT SAVINGS PROPOSALS ON MARCH 8
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., will announce the roll out of the SAVE Initiative, three savings proposals aimed at improving savings rates and simplifying savings plans for all Americans during a press conference Tuesday, March 8 at Russell 328 - the Agriculture Committee room.  
   Treasury Secretary John Snow will discuss the importance of these proposals as part of the President's budget. Representative Sam Johnson, R-Texas, will announce introduction of the House companion bills. 
   These savings proposals include Lifetime Savings Accounts, Retirement Savings Accounts, and Employer Retirement Savings Accounts - LSAs, RSAs, and ERSAs. 
   "One of the most important things a person can do for their own financial future is to save," Thomas said. "These proposals go a long way toward encouraging Americans to save by allowing people to save without penalty - both for lifetime expenses and for retirement. These bills will simplify the way people contribute, allow tax-free earnings for savings, and streamline the different employer-provided retirement vehicles. There has been such a wide array of existing plans, with a myriad of conflicting restrictions, my proposal combines the various plans into single accounts," Thomas explained. 
   Detailed summaries of each of the accounts will be available at the press conference.
