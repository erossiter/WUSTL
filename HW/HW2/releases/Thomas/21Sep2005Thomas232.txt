SEN. THOMAS: 'I INTEND TO VOTE FOR JOHN ROBERTS'
  THOMAS: 'I INTEND TO VOTE FOR JOHN ROBERTS'  
   "After watching his confirmation hearings and talking with the man, I'm convinced he will be a strong defender of the Constitution.  
 He has an exceptional ability to interpret the Constitution with respect to the law. Having such an intelligent and fair-minded person on the court to apply the law is a step away from those who want to legislate from the bench," said Sen. Craig Thomas after talking one-on-one with the nominee today. 
   "I intend to vote for John Roberts," Thomas said. 
   Roberts met with Thomas today in the senator's Washington office. Wyoming's senior senator was particularly impressed with Roberts' demeanor and his dedication to the Constitution.
