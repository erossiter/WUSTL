SEN. THOMAS TAKES MEASURES TO BALANCE AMERICAN INDIAN ISSUES
  Taking a first step to even the playing field for tribes in Wyoming and across the nation, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) agreed today to be an original co-sponsor of legislation that would clarify that tribal pension plans operate under the same rules as government pension plans.  
   The status of tribal pension plans is currently in flux because Treasury has on several occasions said that tribal pension plans are governed by the same rules as government pension plans. Recently, Treasury has backed off this position, asserting that they did not have authority to make this determination. The legislation co-sponsored by Senator Thomas is needed to clarify the current and future tribal plans. 
   "It is bad tax policy to allow the status of tribal plans to remain in flux. The sovereign authority that already exists within the Native American communities should give the tribes the ability to administer their own pension plans. It makes no sense to deny the tribes the capability to take care of their own needs," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas has welcomed American Indians to Washington this week, in celebration of the opening of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. The museum, which celebrates American Indians from South America to Alaska, opened yesterday. Over 80,000 people, from 400 tribes came to celebrate the launch of the museum. 
   "This museum is unlike anything we have in Washington. It really stands out as a unique building housing unique exhibits and stories. I am pleased to welcome members of Wyoming's two tribes to Washington. It is impossible to tell the history of the Americas without the voices of the American Indians," Thomas said. 
   Tomorrow, Sen. Thomas will head to the White House to meet with the President, tribal leaders, and seven other senators to discuss the future of American Indians. Thomas is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
