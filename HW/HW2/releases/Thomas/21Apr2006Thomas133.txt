UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING RECEIVES $1.3 MILLION FOR COAL BED METHANE STUDY
  Sen. Craig Thomas says a $1,350,000 grant the Department of Energy has awarded to the University of Wyoming to study coal bed methane will look at both impacts of development and improvements to current techniques.  
   "It's important to consider both the impacts and potential improvements we can make to coalbed methane production. Wyoming's continued success on all levels of energy development will keep us on the cutting edge our nation's energy sector," Thomas said. "We need to move forward with environmentally sound ways to develop our important energy resources." 
   The UW study will consider coalbed methane production, particularly its impact on air, water, plants, wildlife, and land use during exploration. UW will also determine the feasibility of producing gas using fewer wells and separating the water downhole. 
   UW's share of the project will be $350,000, together with the $1,350,000 grant, for a total value of $1,700,000 over the two-year life of the grant. 
   Thomas spoke this week with Harold Bergman, director of the Ruckelshaus Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (RIENR) about the study. Bergman and Roger Wilmont submitted the proposal for the project at UW. 
   "As we look at the importance of short-term production, we must keep an eye of the long-term effects. I believe there's a strong sense in Wyoming about being responsible stewards of our resources."
