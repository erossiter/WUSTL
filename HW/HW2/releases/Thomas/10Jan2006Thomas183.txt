GTNP PATHWAYS PROJECT GETS PAID
  Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) will cut a check for the funding he secured for the Grand Teton Pathways project.  
   "The Pathways will ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for park visitors. I remain committed to improving visitor services. Folks should experience everything our parks have to offer - Pathways present a one-of-a-kind opportunity to do just that," Thomas said. 
   "I will continue to seek ways to guarantee a high-quality experience for each one of the nearly 428 million visitors to our parks each year." 
   The DOT will release a final payment of $908,114 of the $4 million that Thomas secured in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act. 
   "I have enjoyed working with Mary Gibson Scott on park visitation needs. Her input has been extremely valuable in making my appropriations requests," Thomas said. 
   The final transportation plan for Grand Teton National Park is expected to be released later this spring. 
   Thomas is the Chairman of National Parks Subcommittee.
