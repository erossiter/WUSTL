SEN. THOMAS REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR IRAQ
  "I have said for the past year that the United States' position should be that of a support role in Iraq - we cannot step in to set Iraq's government in motion for them. I believe the Administration has warmed to that idea now, with a plan that includes requirements for Iraq to meet in their quest to become a more unified government," Sen. Craig Thomas said.  
   "What folks in Wyoming should understand is that our President has set out more than just a troop surge - it's a plan for success in Iraq. If the troop increase does indeed allow Iraq to establish a unity government then that is a prudent step, given that we get the Iraqi government to take equal action with their own economic and political agenda for success." 
   "One thing I will not support is the idea of sending troops just to send troops, there must be action on the part of the Iraqi leaders to get their government up and running. That includes providing their own security, and establishing their economy and political operations as well," Thomas said.
