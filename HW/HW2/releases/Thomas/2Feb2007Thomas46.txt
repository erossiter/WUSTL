SEN. THOMAS TAKES LEAD ROLE ON NEW SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Friday, Feb. 2, announced that he will play a key role, as the lead Republican, on the Senate Finance Committee's newly formed Natural Resources and Infrastructure Subcommittee. The sub-panel is expected to deal with tax issues surrounding energy and natural resources legislation.  
   "The creation of this subcommittee couldn't have come at a better time," Thomas said. "I look forward to working with Senator Jeff Bingaman to pursue tax incentives for emerging technologies involving clean coal, and turning back policies that would hamper our progress to provide alternative fuel sources. I will also work to develop America's infrastructure to ensure that people receive the energy they need." 
   "I believe that this subcommittee will have a great impact on legislation that concerns Wyoming, and I am proud to have a lead role on it," Thomas added. 
   The Wyoming Senator is also the lead Republican on the Indian Affairs Committee, another panel he has been on throughout his time in the Senate. He is also the lead Republican on the National Parks Subcommittee, which is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   Thomas also sits on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), which has jurisdiction over highway funding, endangered species, and climate change, as well as air and water concerns. 
   "My committees deal very closely with the issues that matter most in Wyoming - and the new Finance subcommittee just continues that trend," Thomas said. 
   Senator Thomas' committees: 
   * Finance 
   * Energy and Natural Resources 
   * Environment and Public Works 
   * Indian Affairs (Vice-Chairman)
