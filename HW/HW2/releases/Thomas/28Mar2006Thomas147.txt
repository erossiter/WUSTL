SEN. THOMAS: RURAL DEVELOPMENT IS OUR NATION'S BACKBONE
  In a speech this morning to rural development groups from across the nation, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) used Wyoming as an example of the right way to integrate rural programs. Thomas was addressing the National Rural Development Partnership and Partners for Rural America's 2006 Annual Rural Policy Conference.

   In an unexpected announcement, Wyoming's Mary Randolph awarded Senator Thomas the "Champion of Rural America" Award upon conclusion of the senator's address to the conference. 
   "I am certainly humbled by this recognition. I remain strongly committed to working on behalf of folks in rural areas. Next year, we have a chance to seek further equity for rural areas with the reauthorization of the Farm Bill. We need to focus on conservation and development programs and I look forward to getting started on this needed legislation," Thomas said. 
   "Rural development is the backbone of Wyoming and the nation. We need to continue to support an agenda that fosters a healthy foundation for this country - the best way to accomplish our goals is to support rural programs," Thomas said. 
   In Wyoming, the Rural Development Council has been a model of efficiency and progress, Thomas said. The rural council works with states, tribes, and private groups to generate funding for local communities. 
   "Last year, the council turned $63,000 of federal money into $1.3 million for local communities, creating eight new businesses and 17 new jobs," Thomas said. 
   The conference was hosted by the National Rural Development Partnership and Partners for Rural America. The conference was chaired by Mary Randolph, Executive Director Wyoming Rural Development Council. Del Tinsley, state director for USDA Rural Development and members of the Wyoming Rural Development Council Board, also attended the conference.
