SEN. THOMAS: TOO EARLY TO CONSIDER NATIONAL CONSERVATION AREA DESIGNATION FOR JACK MORROW HILLS
  Sen. Craig Thomas said today he is pleased the Bureau of Land Management has come forward with a Record of Decision with regard to Jack Morrow Hills and has taken into account the tremendous amount of public input, numerous protections, and safeguards as well as continued multiple-use of portions of the land.  
   During a meeting late last week with the Wyoming Wildlife Federation about the recent Record of Decision (ROD) on Jack Morrow Hills, Thomas discussed some conservation concerns and urged that the plan be given an opportunity to be reviewed by the public as it's put into place. 
   "After a 9-year public process, many protections have been put forward that I believe adhere to a multiple-use strategy for public lands," Thomas said. "However, the public needs to remain engaged and the implementation of this plan needs time to play out." 
   Last week Thomas met with Bart Koehler and Mac Blewer from the Wyoming Wildlife Federation (WWF), who asked the Wyoming senator to introduce legislation to create a National Conservation Area (NCA) in 400,000 acres of the Red Desert, which would include parts of the Jack Morrow Hills area. Jack Morrow Hills consists of roughly 622,000 acres northeast of Rock Springs. 
   Thomas said he believes the Record of Decision already includes many protections. Some of the notable provisions include: 
   * 29% (179,000 acres) of the land area is off-limits to oil & gas leasing activities 
   * 7 Wilderness Study Areas in the region amounting to 116,000 acres 
   * 5 Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, totaling 135,000 acres 
   * 70 miles of historical trails that will be protected - with substantial easement on either side 
   * 3 Special Recreation Management Areas have been established 
   * A group of stakeholders is to be established by the BLM to monitor wildlife impacts
   "These protections are the direct result of public involvement, opportunities for protection in the environmental process and provide for multiple use of a portion of those lands within Jack Morrow Hills. In may be appropriate as time goes by to provide for wildlife corridors to protect some of the open space areas, to ensure that wildlife can make the appropriate movement within the Hills," Thomas said. 
   Thomas said there may also be a possibility of a National Conservation Area designation at some point in the future, however at the time being it seems appropriate to give the public time to evaluate the plan before any changes.
