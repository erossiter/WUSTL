SEN. THOMAS: BEEF TRADE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CANADA
  Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., voted in favor of a resolution today to strike down the USDA's rule expanding Canadian beef imports.  
 Senate Joint Resolution 4 passed 52-46. 
   Thomas, an original co-sponsor, said we should not further expand Canadian beef imports until safety measures are properly addressed and our other foreign markets are reopened. 
   "The decision today is a win for American consumers and for producers who deserve to have their major markets reopened," Thomas said. 
   Thomas, the first republican on the disapproval resolution, spoke on the floor of the Senate this morning before the vote. He spoke about the effect an expanded market in Canada could have on our further trade situation with Japan and Korea. 
   "In the United States, BSE has only been found in one imported cow from Canada," Thomas said. "Before the BSE discovery, we exported $3.9 billion of beef products. Then all of our major markets closed. While some markets have reopened, our two largest, Japan and Korea have not," Wyoming's senior senator said. 
   "In addition to trade concerns, the USDA rule could compromise consumer confidence and beef demand, and in turn, could harm domestic producers," Thomas concluded.
