SEN. THOMAS SOUNDS OFF ON IRAQ RESOLUTIONS
  "It's premature to have a non-binding resolution on Iraq that will have no impact on what we're trying to achieve over there. The Senate can certainly debate the issues surrounding this mess we have on our hands. I'm sure we'll get more than enough chance to debate Iraq even further with the upcoming supplemental budget request. But just on the heels of confirming General Petraeus to get to work on our new strategy, its just pure political posturing to be sounding off on competing resolutions. Those resolutions will only serve to highlight our differences and undermine our efforts to achieve positive results for that struggling country," Thomas said.  
   "Things have not gone well. We have discounted our previous strategy and the President has agreed that mistakes were made, but he has installed new leadership and a new strategy. We need to make decisions from where we are now - this point in the fight. One thing is for sure - no new positive results will be achieved from the political posturing that we're seeing now with these resolutions."
