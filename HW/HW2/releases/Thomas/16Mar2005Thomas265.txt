SEN. THOMAS COMMENTS ON ANWR
  A statement from Senator Craig Thomas on ANWR: 
   "I believe there is tremendous potential to develop this very large oil reserve while being sensitive to the land and wildlife in these areas.  
 We need to have multiple-use in areas where that makes sense, but to me, ANWR is an expanse of land which could serve as an amazing energy source for our country," U.S. Sen. Craig Thomas said. 
   "Let's remember this potential drilling area is only a 2,000-acre site inside a 1.5 million-acre coastal plain. You can balance the needs of conservation and exploration -- they're not mutually exclusive. ANWR is one piece of our energy needs -- the larger picture involves reducing our dependency on foreign oil and enacting a comprehensive energy policy," Thomas said. 
   Thomas (R-Wyo.) was part of the majority in the Senate who voted 51-49 in favor of moving forward with ANWR development. He is a member of the Senate Energy Committee.
