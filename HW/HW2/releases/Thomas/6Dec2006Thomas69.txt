The United States Senate approved the nomination of Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of Defense, 95-2. Sen. Craig Thomas voted in favor of the nominee.  
 "Robert Gates leadership and experience will be a distinct benefit to our nation as we face continued conflict. Gates proved himself to be a straight-shooter during his confirmation hearing, offering a candid account of the current status of activity in Iraq. His proven track record in the intelligence community will help him bridge any gaps between the intelligence community and Department of Defense," Thomas said. 
 "Not only does he understand the challenges we're facing in Iraq, he has first-hand knowledge of the threats facing our nation. I'm confident that he is fully prepared to handle our nation's rapidly changing defense needs.".
