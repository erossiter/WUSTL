SEN. THOMAS SEEKS TO STRIP NON-WAR SPENDING
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today offered an amendment to the Democrat budget proposal to restore fiscal discipline back to the emergency spending process by stripping all spending unrelated to the war.  
   "Too often emergency supplemental bills are larded up with all kinds of pet projects and other spending that Members cannot pass through the regular budget process. By its very nature, emergency spending is above and beyond the approved budget," Thomas said. 
   Thomas's amendment stipulates that Congress cannot use supplemental war appropriations bills, which fund our troops in combat, to tack on pork barrel spending. 
   "We need to stop playing politics with our troops by using the war-supplemental for massive amounts of unrelated spending. It is an abuse of the process to hold our troops hostage for inappropriate spending," Thomas said. 
   "The money we spend here does not come out of thin air - it comes out of the pockets of hard-working Americans. I would caution Members not take the emergency spending process too lightly." 
   The following items are among the items designated as emergency in the most current Senate version of the FY07 emergency war supplemental: 
   * $4.1 billion in agriculture assistance. 
   * $100 million for security related to the Republican and Democrat presidential nominating conventions. 
   * $25 million for the Safe and Drug Free Schools program. 
   * $48 million for disaster reconstruction for NASA. 
   * $2 million to the University of Vermont Education Excellence Program. 
   * $13 million for mine safety research. 
   * $25 million for asbestos abatement at the Capitol Power Plant. 
   * $3.5 million for guided tours of the U.S. Capitol. 
   * $640 million for LIHEAP. 
   * $500 million for emergency wildfire suppression. 
   * $13.2 million for avian flu research and monitoring.
