SEN. THOMAS TO HOLD SOCIAL SECURITY LISTENING TOUR
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) will use the upcoming recess to hold several Social Security "Generational Voices" discussions and two other open-forum town meetings.  
   "There's been a great deal of talk about Social Security in Washington and I'm bringing the debate to Wyoming to learn more about our state's priorities. There are a number of alternatives to be explored and I want to hear Wyoming folks' ideas," Thomas said. 
   The "Generational Voices" discussion of Social Security will be a way to hear the opinions of younger workers, near-retirees, and those already receiving benefits. The stops in Evanston and Thermopolis will be open-forum town meetings. 
   Thomas, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, will play a key role in any reform that comes out of Congress this year. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over Social Security.
