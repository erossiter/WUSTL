SEN. THOMAS BILL SETS BETTER SULFUR STANDARD FOR COAL
  A bill introduced on Thursday, Feb. 15, by Sen. Craig Thomas provides more equity for western coals. The measure amends the Coal Title of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 regarding the amount of sulfur removed from coal.  
   The new alternative standard levels the playing field for companies seeking to use western coals in clean-coal power plants built as part of the Clean Coal Power Initiative. 
   "It's only reasonable to have a standard that all coal types can meet," Thomas said. "The previous standard could not be applied equally among coal with different sulfur content amounts. Our coal in the West has very little sulfur to begin with, so removing 99 percent, as required by the current standard, would be extremely difficult. My bill provides an alternative to address the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions that would ultimately come from these plants." 
   Thomas introduced his bill today to improve the Coal Title of the 2005 Energy Policy Act to reflect an achievable standard for low sulfur coals, which are predominantly found in the western United States. 
   The bill sets the standard at .04 pounds of sulfur per million British thermal units (Btu) or 99 percent. 
   Thomas's bill is co-sponsored by Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman, (D-N.M.) and the panel's lead Republican Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), as well as Sens. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Larry Craig (R-Idaho), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Robert Bennett (R-Utah), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), Ken Salazar (D-Colo.). The bill was previously introduced during the lame duck session of the 109th Congress.
