SEN. THOMAS: 'TIME TO DELIST THE GRIZZLY'
  Sen. Craig Thomas urged Interior Secretary Gale Norton today to move forward with the delisting paperwork for the Grizzly bear under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) during a phone call this morning.  
   "It's time to move forward with delisting the grizzly bear. Interior has been sitting on this proposal and Wyoming deserves to know about the timing. The bear is a good example of what's wrong with the Endangered Species Act - the grizzly's been on the list for 30 years, the population has tripled, and yet, it remains on the list. If it's recovered, then let's get a deadline set to sign the delisting rule. I told her that I understood that the Fish and Wildlife Service had put forth a very good plan, but that it seems to be stuck in the pipe," Thomas said. 
   Norton said there were still concerns at Interior. "I told her that Interior's credibility hangs on this action - this is what's wrong with ESA. This plan is a good one, has a scientific basis, and needs action," Thomas said. 
   The Grizzly bear was listed as endangered in 1975. Senator Thomas has been working with the Senate ESA Working Group to coordinate the delisting. In addition the group is working to reform the Endangered Species Act. 
   Wyoming's senior senator feels that any reform should fulfill the intent of the law - recovering species. "It's important that we have a vision for where we're going with the Endangered Species Act. I'm pushing for a requirement to have a recovery plan in place at the time a species is listed. I'm also working to ensure our state has a strong role in the listing decisions," Thomas said. 
   The senator relayed his conversation with Norton to the Wyoming Game and Fish Director Terry Cleveland this morning. "Wyoming Game and Fish has worked very hard on this, they deserve to know the timing of the proposal," he said.
