SENATE PASSES ENERGY, WATER APPROPRIATIONS 92-3
  Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi, both R-Wyo., announced the passage of H.R. 2419, the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill of 2006 by a vote of 92-3.  
   Wyoming received funds for five projects. 
   "Energy and water are two of our nation's core needs. I'm pleased this funding measure contains important projects that are in step with the comprehensive energy policy and fulfill vital needs in Wyoming," Thomas said. 
   "This bill directs money to critical Wyoming projects and needs and the impact on the state is wide-ranging," said Enzi. "Wyoming has abundant supplies of energy, while water is often times in short supply. This bill provides funding for infrastructure projects that address both resources." 
   The purpose of this bill is to provide appropriations for fiscal year 2006 for energy and water development and related purposes. 
   The bill contains $31.245 billion in spending for fiscal year 2006. This amount is $1.49 billion above both the House-passed version and the President's budget request. It is $1.4 billion above the current-year spending level.
