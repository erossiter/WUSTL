SEN. THOMAS APPLAUDS U.S. JOB GROWTH IN APRIL
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) today applauded news from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which reported that 88,000 jobs were created in April 2007. Since August 2003, more than 7.8 million new jobs have been created, with more than 1.8 million jobs created in the last year.  
   "Today's report from the BLS shows that our economy continues to grow stronger everyday," Thomas said. "Our nation's unemployment rate remains a low 4.5 percent, and Wyoming's unemployment rate continues to be one of the lowest in the nation - 2.6 percent. People's income has risen more than $3,000 since 2001, and wages are rising at a faster rate than they did during the boom of the late 1990's." 
   "This is proof that the tax cuts, passed in 2003, are working for America. I will continue to sponsor and vote for legislation that will keep people's hard earned dollars in their pockets, and not in government coffers." 
   In addition to cutting taxes on everyone who pays income taxes, the Administration has doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, and put the Federal death tax on the road to extinction. 
   As a result, in 2007: 
   * 113 million taxpayers will receive an average tax cut of $2,216; 
   * 45 million families with children will receive an average tax cut of $2,864; 
   * 27 million small business owners will receive an average tax cut of $4,711; and, 
   * Over 5 million individuals and families will see their income tax liability completely eliminated.
