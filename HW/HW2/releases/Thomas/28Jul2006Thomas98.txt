SEN. THOMAS SUPPORTS FARMER TAX BENEFITS
  Sen. Craig Thomas and Sen. Mike Enzi, both R-Wyo., are co-sponsoring legislation that would allow farmers to save money by getting the same tax benefits as construction companies.  
   Under current tax law, construction equipment depreciates on a five-year schedule, while farm equipment is penalized with a seven-year depreciation schedule. S. 1864 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow farming business machinery and equipment to be depreciated over five years instead of seven. 
   "The current system penalizes farmers who are upgrading farm equipment. The tax code definitely needs to keep pace with the life span of machinery used in agriculture. This effort encourages producers to make the investments necessary to increase production and provide themselves a better income," said Thomas, an original cosponsor of the legislation. 
   The proposed change, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, would save farmers $800 million a year. This would not only help farmers and ranchers to cover their debts but would allow for the timely replacement of equipment with newer models, according to Thomas and Enzi. 
   Depreciation is treated as a non-cash business expense that lowers reported income and increases cash on hand. The shorter the depreciation schedule, the greater savings farmers will experience sooner. 
   The bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration. Thomas is a member of the both the Senate Finance and Senate Agriculture committees.
