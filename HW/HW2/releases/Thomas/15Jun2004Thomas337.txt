ENERGY POLICY LIGHTS UP IN CONGRESS
  With oil prices hovering at historic highs, Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), and members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing today to address the oil and gas prices and reiterate the need for passage of a comprehensive energy bill. Sen. Thomas also participated in a national press conference with Senators to encourage the passage of an energy plan.  
   "Energy is our most used and important commodity. No one thinks much about it because it just seems to always be there. Whether it is the cars we drive, the air conditioning that cools our homes, or electricity which lights the night-we take energy for granted until we see either higher prices at the pump or rolling electrical blackouts, or higher heating and cooling bills. The time is certainly here for a long-term energy policy," Thomas said at the press conference. 
   Thomas pointed out today that the President, through Vice President Cheney and his Energy Task Force, came out with plan more than three years ago-during the Democratic controlled Senate. We should have acted then to help alleviate what we see now and prepare for the future, Thomas said. 
   "The real answer is that we need a long-term energy policy. This is what the President sent to us and this is what Congress tried to pass. Instead of looking for solutions, the Democrats are trying to lay blame. We must increase conservation, modernize our infrastructure, increase our energy supplies--including renewables, accelerate the protection and improvement of our environment, and increase our national security," Thomas said.
