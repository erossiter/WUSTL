WYOMING GETS NEARLY $1.8 MILLION GRANT FOR HOSPITAL RESPONSE
  The Wyoming Department of Health has been awarded a grant for nearly $1.8 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to strengthen the ability of hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to bioterror attacks, announced Sen.  
 Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.). 
   "Whether responding to an infectious disease outbreak or terrorist attack, hospitals play a crucial role in our national security preparedness. If an emergency arises, Wyoming hospitals will be prepared to respond because of this grant money," Thomas said. 
   The Wyoming Department of Health can use the HHS grant to improve the readiness of hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to emergencies involving a large number of casualties, bioterror attacks, infectious outbreaks or natural disasters. Funds can also be used to help coordinate efforts on disease reporting among hospitals and local and state health departments, and purchasing personal protective gear and communications equipment. 
   HHS is expected to distribute nearly $498 million in grant funding to the nation's hospitals this year alone.
