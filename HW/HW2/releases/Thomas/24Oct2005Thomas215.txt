SEN. THOMAS: 'UNNECESSARY DELAY HURTS PRODUCERS'
  In a second reminder since July to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Sen.  
 Craig Thomas is demanding immediate action to get payments in the hands of producers who were hurt by drought across Wyoming. 
   "This delay is unacceptable. Wyoming's producers depend on disaster assistance payments to help them make ends meet. This unnecessary delay hurts producers and makes it difficult for them to meet their financial obligations," Thomas said. 
   "The government shouldn't be using the hard working folks of my state as a guinea pig for their administrative changes. It's been more than a year - it's time to expedite these payments." 
   The Livestock Assistance Program and American Indian Livestock Feed Program were intended to provide assistance to eligible livestock producers for grazing losses suffered in either 2003 or 2004 production years as a result of drought. 
   In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns, Thomas urged him to take immediate action to alleviate the problem. Thomas also requested a six percent interest rate from June 1 until payments are made in order to offset the delay. 
   A member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Thomas is Wyoming's senior senator.
