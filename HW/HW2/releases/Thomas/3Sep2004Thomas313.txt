SENS. THOMAS, ENZI ANNOUNCE EVANSTON AIRPORT GRANT
  Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi, both R-Wyo., said the Uinta County Burns Field Airport is set to receive grant funding from the Federal Aviation Administration for local airport improvements.  
   The City of Evanston was awarded a $7.7 million grant earlier this year and will begin to receive about $2.9 million of that money to start another phase of construction on the project. This will include site grading required to relocate a runway to accommodate the aircraft at Burns Field. The enhancements are expected to improve the FAA design and safety standards associated with these aircraft operations. 
   "Helping to ensure the safety of passengers as they travel in Wyoming is a priority," the senators said. "We are pleased the Evanston airport received this funding to help improve the quality of transportation in the state." 
   For more information on this project, please contact Craig Sparks with the Department of Transportation Regional Office at 1-303-342-1254.
