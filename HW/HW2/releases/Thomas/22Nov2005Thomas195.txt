SEN. THOMAS: VISITOR CENTER RENAMED FOR TAGGART
  Sen. Craig Thomas announced today that the National Park Service (NPS) will rename the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation visitor center located in Lovell, Wyoming, in honor of Cal S. Taggart.  
   In a letter to NPS Director Fran Mainella, Thomas cited numerous life experiences and achievements of Cal Taggart in his request to rename the visitor center in honor of the distinguished Wyoming man. 
   "... Cal was integral in the planning and construction of the Bighorn Canyon Visitor Center, the National Park Service's first facility operated by solar energy. Cal worked diligently to select the Lovell location, plan the logistics and secure funding for the project. He lobbied at both local and national levels to ensure its completion, and played a key role in organizing the groundbreaking and dedication ceremonies for the center. Without Cal's efforts, the visitor center may not have become a reality," Thomas wrote in the letter to Mainella. 
   "Cal's efforts to improve the quality of life in Wyoming deserve this kind of recognition," Thomas said. "This is really about acknowledging Cal's life of public service. I'm pleased that this renaming came through so quickly for the Taggart family and those whose lives he touched in the community." 
   Thomas is the Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. A copy of the letter is attached and will be available on the Thomas Web site. This and all press releases are available at http://thomas.senate.gov.
