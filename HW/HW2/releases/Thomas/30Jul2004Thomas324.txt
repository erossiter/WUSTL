SEN. THOMAS TO CHAIR ENDANGERED SPECIES FIELD HEARING IN CASPER
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) will chair a Senate Environment and Public Works Fish Subcommittee field hearing in Casper on August 23 regarding the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA).  
 The hearing will focus on the impacts of ESA and examine ways to improve the Act. Testimony will be received from federal, state and local officials, as well as representatives from agriculture, the mining industry, and wildlife groups. 
   "I can't think of a federal policy that has had a larger impact on landowners, public land managers, communities and state governments. Over time, it has become profoundly evident that we need to revise the Endangered Species Act and how it is being implemented," Thomas said. "While we toil in lawsuits about species' habitats, we have lost sight of the real motivation of this Act-the recovery of species. Sadly, over the last 30 years of the ESA, we've only recovered 14 out of 1265 species-that record is unacceptable. This hearing will provide a great forum to hear from Wyoming people about opportunities to improve the Act." 
   Thomas noted that now, more than ever, lawsuits seem to be the driving force behind the Fish and Wildlife Service decisions. Congress needs to readdress this issue to establish sound policies so that lawsuits become the exception, not the rule. 
   The hearing will take place from 9:00 a.m. to noon on Monday, August 23 at the Wyoming Oil and Gas Commission building, 2211 King Blvd. in Casper. A list of witnesses will be available next week.
