SEN. THOMAS ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT VOTE
  The following is a statement by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) who today voted in favor of moving forward with the debate on S.J. Res. 40, the Federal Marriage Amendment.  
 The vote failed 48-50. 
   "Regrettably, the United States Senate voted against having an honest and open debate on how we best go about protecting the traditional institution of marriage. I voted for cloture because we should move forward with the debate. I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. A constitutional amendment may be the only way to protect the historical definition of marriage. If the Senate could debate this proposal properly and that argument prevailed, I would support that."
