SENATE PASSES MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDING
  Sen. Craig Thomas today lauded the Senate passage of the appropriations bill for veterans and military construction (H.R. 5385).  
   "Our fighting forces deserve our continuing support and financial backing. I'm particularly pleased to have secured the $7.6 million for the Squadron Operations Facility at the Cheyenne airport," Thomas said. "The facility will be a tremendous improvement and serve to enhance the broadening mission of our Wyoming-based military forces." 
   Wyoming projects in the Senate version the bill include: 
   Cheyenne - Construction of Squadron Operations Facility, $7.6 million 
   Cheyenne - Improvements to the Fire Crash/Rescue Station, $4.2 million 
   Camp Guernsey - Multi-Purpose Machine Gun Range, $1.796 million 
   Cheyenne - F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Dormitory Renovation, $11 million 
   The Senate passed the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations bill Tuesday evening by a voice vote. 
   The bill provides $16 billion for active and reserve military construction and $78 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, with $29 billion for the Veterans Medical Service. 
   In May of 2006, The House of Representatives passed its version of the bill 395-0. 
   The legislation now goes to a conference committee where members of the House and Senate will work out the differences between the two versions.
