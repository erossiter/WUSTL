SEN. THOMAS: WYO ECONOMY AND JOB NUMBERS IMPRESS
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) announced today that a newly released Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) report shows that Wyoming has added an impressive 6,600 jobs over the past year.  
   "Our Wyoming economy is growing leaps and bounds, and we are adding jobs at a very healthy clip," Thomas said. 
   Overall, Wyoming's workforce increased to 263,900 in November 2005, up from 257,300 in November 2004. Wyoming has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 3.9 percent. The national unemployment rate is 5.0 percent. 
   Thomas reiterated his call to focus on ways to utilize today's growth to build a foundation for future economic, education, and natural resource success. 
   "We need to continue to be forward-looking and seize the opportunity to not only be the nation's premier state for energy production, but to also use that to encourage broad success in other sectors of our local economy and way of life," Thomas said. 
   "While we have seen our share of 'boom and bust' cycles in the past, I am confident that with attention and planning we can add stability and sustainability," Thomas said. "It is our responsibility to be careful stewards now of our success to ensure it will continue well into the future. 
   The nation as a whole has seen a drop of .4 percent in the unemployment rate in the past year, and has added nearly two million jobs in the past year. Since the President signed the Jobs and Growth Act in May 2003, 4.5 million jobs have been added to the nation's workforce.
