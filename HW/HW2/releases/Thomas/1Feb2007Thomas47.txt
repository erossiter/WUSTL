SEN. THOMAS: GRAND OLD PARTY ENSURES GAIN FOR WORKERS, BUSINESSES
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Thursday, Feb. 1, said the tax relief Republicans fought to include in minimum wage legislation protects small businesses and benefits workers. H.R.2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, passed the Senate today by a vote of 94-3. 
   "Thanks to Republican efforts, the bill we passed today will benefit workers and also protect the businesses that provide their employment," Thomas said.  
   "Small businesses continue to drive job creation in our country and have helped develop a robust economy. Small businesses continue to be a key component of our strong U.S. economy." 
   "While many of our economic discussions in Wyoming involve energy - tourism remains an important driver in our state. Tourism and the related service industry often depend on small businesses. These family owned businesses are the lifeblood of many small communities across the state. While many argue for increasing the minimum wage for workers, in order for those businesses to stay prosperous under a mandated wage rate, we must give employers the financial tools to succeed," Thomas said. 
   "By providing tax relief, Republicans protected small businesses from any negative effects from a raise in the minimum wage. It also allows them to continue to grow and create jobs," Thomas said. 
   Small businesses employ half of all private sector employees and created between 60 and 80 percent of net new jobs annually over the last decade, according to the Small Business Administration. 
   However, small businesses are more vulnerable to the impact of increased costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the minimum wage increase would impose $4 billion in new costs on the private sector in 2009 and $5.7 billion in 2010, with the increased costs extending at roughly $5 billion each year. Small businesses would incur the bulk of these costs, and they could be forced to lay off workers if offsets are not provided. 
   The following tax relief provisions were included in the legislation: 
   * Expensing - A one-year extension of a provision allowing small businesses to combine as much as $112,000 in expenses into one annual tax deduction. 
   * Leasehold Improvements - An extension through March 31, 2008, of the provisions that allow property owners to more quickly deduct the cost of making improvements to a restaurant or to leased property. Also, extends the provision to apply to improvements made to owner-occupied retailer space and for the construction of new restaurants. 
   * Cash Method of Accounting - A permanent change to the tax code that will allow more businesses to simplify their bookkeeping by allowing them to use the cash method of accounting for tax purposes. 
   * S Corp Reforms - A modification to the standards that allow small businesses to qualify for or stay within the S Corp tax rules. 
   * Certified Professional Employer Organizations - Establishes a certificate program for Companies that provide and oversee employees for other corporations. The certification would require these companies to meet certain standards set by the IRS. Businesses that contract with certified professional employer organizations would be assured they would not be liable for those taxes already paid to the certified professional employer organization. 
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit - A five-year extension of the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce. Also, a modification to the work opportunity tax credit to include a tax credit for employing veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
