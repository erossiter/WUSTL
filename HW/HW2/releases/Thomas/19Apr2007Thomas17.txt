SEN. THOMAS LAUDS WYOMING BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION GRANT
  Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) on Thursday, April 19, applauded news from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation that a $13,949 health promotion grant has been awarded to the Brain Injury Association of Wyoming in Casper.  
   "This grant will go a long way in assisting folks in Wyoming living with severe spinal cord and brain injuries," Thomas said. "I'm pleased that the 'Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation' has aided in Wyoming's effort to increase the quality of life of those living with disabilities." 
   With funding provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), health promotion grants are awarded to programs that improve the physical and emotional health of those living with paralysis. 
   This grant will help fund Support Group Leader Trainings, which includes group leadership techniques, brain injury basics, resource location, and outreach methodologies. It will also underwrite travel costs for 14 support leaders to attend 4 leader training sessions.
