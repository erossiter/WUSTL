SEN. THOMAS URGES CHINA TO ELIMINATE SODA ASH REBATE
  In a letter to Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi, Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., urged the Chinese government to eliminate the 13 percent value added tax (VAT) rebate on their exported soda ash.  
   "Wyoming's soda ash must be able to compete with a country that is giving a 13 percent rebate to a competitor," Thomas said. "This creates an unfair advantage for China, and makes it more difficult for Wyoming soda ash to gain access to international markets." 
   The VAT rebate has allowed Chinese soda ash producers to consistently undercut American companies by setting artificially low prices. Eliminating the VAT rebate on Chinese exported soda ash would allow American companies to be more competitive in the global market. 
   Soda ash is the primary component for manufacturing glass. American soda ash, 90 percent of which is produced in Wyoming, is widely known as among the highest quality and most affordable in the world.
