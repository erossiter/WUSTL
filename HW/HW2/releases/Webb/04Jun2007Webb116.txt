   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 4  2007 Statement of Senator Jim Webb on Proposed Legislation to Designate the New River in Grayson County as a National Wild   Scenic River                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I am pleased to see an interest in protecting the New  River  one of Virginias finest rivers  However  the  designation of this section of the New River as part of the National Wild and  Scenic River System could severely threaten critical water infrastructure  projects  such as the Virginia Carolina Regional Water System  which is  important to Grayson County and the Town of Independence  I have been contacted by  Grayson County officials who  vigorously oppose this designation and I am particularly concerned that they  were not consulted prior to introduction of this legislation  given the effect  the designation will have on their community  I intend to work with members of  the community affected by this legislation and my colleagues in the Senate to  bring about proper resolution to this matter
