the following statement today on the Senate floor  Video of the statement is available upon request  audio can be accessed at  http   demradio senate gov actualities webb webb070216_floor_statement mp3        Mr  President  I rise in support of the vote we will take tomorrow   Last week I expressed my support for the bipartisan Levin Warner Resolution  which was denied a vote by the full Senate due to procedural motions   Ten days later  we find ourselves in a similar situation          Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have spent the last four days debating the current course of action in Iraq  and they have completed a vote on final passage today   The House found a way   It found a bill   And it took a vote   Unfortunately  the Senate has continued to engage in partisan bickering and in political gamesmanship over how to proceed         This debate is not about whether one is a Republican or Democrat   It is about the legislative branch exerting its proper constitutional oversight by deliberating on the most vital and challenging issue of our day          I would urge my colleagues to think about the vote that took place in 2002 authorizing the use of force in Iraq   That was not a party line vote   I was not a member of this body  but I do believe that it was an erroneous vote  at least in its outcome   But most importantly  the reaction of the Administration to that vote was a clear signal that the true issues dividing us  in this government  are more related to the relations between the Executive and Legislative branches than between our respective parties          The Administration has failed the country  again and again  in the conduct of this war   At the same time  it repeatedly claims that it holds the power   regardless of the input of the Congress   to continue to push our military people to the limits of their endurance  while avoiding the diplomatic options which are crucial to resolving the situation in Iraq that inevitably evolved from our invasion and occupation          I have long advocated that an integral part of our strategy in Iraq must include engagement with all of Iraq s neighbors  including Iran and Syria   As Iraq s neighbors  they are stakeholders in both the future of Iraq and the need for stability in the region   As we seek to decrease our presence in Iraq and increase our ability to fight terrorism and address strategic challenges elsewhere in the world  we must bring Iraq and Syria to the table   An overwhelming majority of those who recently testified before our hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agree with that assessment         I have heard General Petraeus s name invoked several times today as evidence of this body s support for the Administration s current policy   A vote for General Petraeus is not a vote for this Administration s strategy   or lack thereof   That vote was to support the qualifications of an individual to command troops in combat   That was a military vote  not a political vote   If the strategy were to change   as I hope it will   I have full confidence that General Petraeus is capable of overseeing that policy as well         We must see evidence of a new diplomatic effort from this Administration before we    as a Congress  not as Democrats and Republicans    ratify the expanded use of our military   And on that note  Mr  President  it should be emphasized that the Baker Hamilton group supported a temporary military surge only in consonance with a robust regional diplomatic surge which was supposed to begin more than two months ago          Many Republicans seem to be implying that we must support all of this Administration s actions  or by inference we don t support the troops   Mr  President  the issue is not whether we support the troops  it is whether we agree on the political uses to which they are being put   This effort needs clear direction from the top   It depends on the extent to which this government is capable of forging a regional consensus   a regional consensus   regarding Iraq s future   This Administration has refused to do so   It is not in the interest of our troops to continue sending them into harm s way without a clear strategy that will bring closure to this endeavor        Mr  President  I believe very strongly that our political representatives have no business claiming to speak politically for our troops   Our military is a mirror of our society  and so are its political views   Anecdotal evidence notwithstanding  poll after poll shows that our troops are just as concerned about this policy as is the public at large          I have one poll here from a year ago   a Zogby poll   that says that 72  of the people then stationed in Iraq believe that the war should have ended by the end of 2006   This includes 7 out of 10 of our regular army soldiers and a vast majority  nearly 60   of our Marines   These are people who have done their job   They know what their military job is  but have the same questions about the political policy as do the rest of Americans        Another more recent poll from December 29  2006 by the Military Times indicates that barely one third of our service members approve of the way the President is handling the war   In fact  only 41  of our military now believes that the United States should not have gone to war in the first place         I m not using these figures to advance the Democratic Party s point   I believe it is inappropriate for the other party to use our military people in a way that might insulate them from criticism over the woeful failure of this Administration s policy          The American people s confidence in the Bush Administration is at rock bottom   Many rightly believe that they were misled on the reasons for going to war   The Administration s credibility has suffered   rightfully so   also with respect to its intentions for dealing with Iran   Quite frankly  one cannot speak of our responsibility on the immediate issue without stating clearly our concerns about the entire region  and especially the Administration s position regarding its constitutional authority to use military force elsewhere          The Administration s view of its presidential authority to conduct unilateral military action against other countries  and particularly with Iran  was documented in President Bush s signing statement accompanying the original authorization for use of force in Iraq October 16  2002   I would urge my colleagues to read this language carefully   It states in part   My signing this resolution does not  constitute any change in the long standing positions of the executive branch on either the President s constitutional authority to use force to deter  prevent  or respond to aggression or other threats to U S  interests           I have raised this language with Secretary of State Rice  as well as Deputy Secretary Negroponte   My question was whether the Administration believes that it possesses the authority to conduct unilateral military activity against Iran in the absence of a direct threat and without the approval of the Congress   I have not received a clear answer from either on that point   And that is troubling         This Administration and its supporters must understand the realities that are causing us  as a Congress  to finally say enough is enough   After five years of misguided policy  ineffective leadership  and diminished U S  stature around the world  Congress must show the way to reclaiming the moral high ground and exert its proper oversight role more forcefully          For these reasons  I support the pending Iraq legislation before us and I will vote for cloture  I urge my fellow colleagues to do the same
