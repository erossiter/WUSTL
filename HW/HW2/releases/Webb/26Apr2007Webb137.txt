                                                                                                                                                                     Senator Webb s Floor Speech in Support of the Iraq Supplemental Bill Washington  DC   The following is a floor statement from Senator Jim Webb regarding the Iraq War supplemental spending bill that has been passed by both houses of Congress  Audio and video available upon request        Mr  President  there s a lot of emotion in the Congress today  as there is in the country  on this issue  There s a lot of rhetoric flying back and forth  some of it inaccurate   I think the first thing we need to say is that this is not an issue of the Congress denying anything to the people of the armed forces       We are exercising our power  our constitutional power  to appropriate   We re sending the President a  100 billion check and if he chooses not to cash that check  it is up to him to come up with the reasons why  not us         There s also a lot of rhetoric that s been going around over the past couple of days about defeatism and surrender and accusations of betraying the troops   I think we need to calm down a bit   There s no one in this Congress who wants anything more than to support those people that we put into harm s way  and I believe people should be very careful on this floor to discuss political motivations of our military  which reflects very closely the political views of the country at large   Poll after poll shows that   In respect to these accusations about defeatism and surrender  the question becomes  defeat by whom  And surrender to whom       We won this war four years ago   The question is when we end the occupation   Iraq has been in turmoil for thousands of years   It will be in turmoil in one kind or another long after we leave  The United States military is not going to change the societal makeup of Iraq  And the Malaki government is not going to bring peace among Iraq s competing factions without the strong  overt  diplomatic cooperation of other countries in this region  And despite the rhetoric to the contrary  these other countries   all of them   do have an incentive in seeing a stable Iraq         This administration claims that our deciding to withdraw from the internal problems of Iraq will embolden the enemy   And then the question becomes  after we hear this repeatedly  just which enemy   Do they mean the enemy that attacked us on 9 11   We all know that was Osama Bin Laden   He not only wasn t in Iraq but he was opposed to the continuation of Saddam Hussein s regime because it was secular government         Do they mean Saddam Hussein  whose ouster was their justification for beginning this war         Do they mean the remnants of the old regime  which was their catch phrase when the occupation began         Do they mean Al Qaeda  Or a monolithic group of defeatable guerilla forces   We keep hearing about this insurgency   Well  which one   Sunnis  Shiites  Some are operating against us  Why   Because they want us to leave as a vast majority of Iraqis say in poll after poll  Some are operating against other ethnic factions in Iraq   But to what extent is that the responsibility of the United States military to try to end ethnic rivalries that go back years   Or perhaps as defined by this administration  are we talking about the faction within the factions that are trying to kill each other just as the factions in Lebanon were trying to kill each other when we put the marines in the middle of that violence        They say our withdrawal from Iraq would create chaos in the region   I ve long advocated a withdrawal that should be accomplished under the umbrella of a strong diplomatic effort that involves regional cooperation but I must regrettably say for those of us who warned against invading Iraq and decapitating that existing government that the chaos the administration is now predicting is exactly the chaos that their invasion has brought us in the first place  Instability in the region  a loss of American prestige  a rise of the influence of Iran  an increase in terrorist activity         I would just like to say that I m very disappointed in some of the provisions in this report  I must say that candidly  At the same time  I believe very strongly that the reservations that I have pale in comparison with my disappointment in the failure of leadership in Iraq that has brought us there in the first place  a leadership that will bring us to a suitable turning point to bring us out   The Administration must understand the American people have grown tired of its disastrous one dimensional approach to a crisis which demands innovative answers and it is for that reason that I support this measure        Thank you
