   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   March 15  2007 Statement by Senator Webb on the Reid Iraq Joint Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The following is a statement from Senator Jim Webb regarding Senator Reid s Joint Resolution on the Iraq War         I supported Senator Reid s Joint Resolution on the Iraq War because it provided the right criteria for moving toward the objectives that I have repeatedly outlined as necessary for the United States to eventually withdraw from Iraq and contribute to greater stability in the region          Those objectives include robust diplomatic efforts in the region and the repositioning of our combat forces outside Iraq  These steps would allow our forces to properly address the war against international terrorism rather than becoming even more bogged down in sectarian strife         I have repeatedly said that I am against timetables in Iraq in the absence of proper diplomatic engagement with Iraq s neighbors  including Iran and Syria   I am encouraged by recent diplomatic overtures by the Bush administration  starting with the Baghdad conference last weekend and looking toward the ministerial talks that will take place next month          The supplemental appropriations bill will provide another opportunity for a full and meaningful debate on our next steps in Iraq and elsewhere in the region   I look forward to more debate on this vital issue
