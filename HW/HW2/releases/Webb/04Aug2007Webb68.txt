   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   August 4  2007 Senator Webb on Senate Passage of Measure to Amend  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Webb on Senate Passage of Measure to Amend FISA   Yesterday I supported two measures to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  These measures were considered against the backdrop of heightened concerns from our nation s intelligence community abut the threat of international terrorism  The ramifications of the two amendments before us last night were not political  Instead they related to the urgent demands of national security  I chose to heed those warnings  We now have six months to work in earnest to bring full accountability to the process     This distinction and the threats to national security were stated clearly by Admiral McConnell as well as four of the eight Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee  These members  Senators Feinstein  Mikulski  Bayh  and Bill Nelson  have extensive experience on intelligence matters and are respected champions of civil rights and liberties  They chose to give significant weight and deference to the intelligence community on FISA reform  and so did I     There is near uniform  bipartisan agreement on the need to reform FISA to reflect modern telecommunications and information technology  We must do so in a way that safeguards basic civil and constitutional rights  But we must also remember that the terrorist threat to the nation is extremely serious  I remain fully committed to bringing accountability to this process  and to protecting the privacy rights of all Americans           Floor Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein  Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee     I remember well  the day I saw the letter from Admiral McConnell  I believe the day was July 24th  Thats not a long time ago  but it was a kind of wake up call to us because what that letter says is  in essence  is that he believes the United States is vulnerable and he believes we need to move quickly to change FISA     Now  from an intelligence point of view  many of us believe that the chatter is up  It is not necessarily well defined  But that during the 9 11 period that this is clearly a period of heightened vulnerability  Therefore  what Admiral McConnell wants to do is be able to better collect foreign intelligence  I very much respect what has happened  I respect the bill thats been put together on the Democratic side and I respect the bill that was put together on the Republican side which is really the McConnell bill on that side     The Senator from Wisconsin might be interested to know that some of us just met with Admiral McConnell particularly to discuss Senator Feingolds concern and there is a different point of view and a U S  citizen in Europe  is  in fact  covered under certain specific laws  not FISA  but precisely 1233 _ which I cannot remember at the present time comes into play and that U S  citizen is subject to a warrant from the court     Now  this is a temporary bill  Its to fill a gap  The court has done something which has said that what has existed for decades with respect to the collection of foreign intelligence now cannot exist under the present law and we need to change that law  It is my intention to vote for both bills  The reason I vote for both bills is to see that some bill gets the required 60 votes to get passed tonight  We are going out of session  There is no time  I think this is unfortunate  I received the democratic bill about 20 minutes ago  went into the leaders office  tried to sit down and get briefed  Up to this point  I still dont understand it  I spent all afternoon on the McConnell bill and am just beginning to understand the subtleties in it and the others laws that come into play     So this is not going to be an easy vote  I think  for anyone  but we have to think of right now is on a temporary basis how do we best protect the people of the United States against a terrible attack  I thank the Chair  I yield the floor      Floor Statement of Senator Barbara Mikulski  Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee     Mr  President  Im a member of the intelligence Committee  and like all member  I take my oath to defend this country against all enemies  foreign and domestic  very seriously  Real threats to our country remain and as we approach the anniversary of September 11th  this is a time for more vigilance     We have two proposals tonight  The Rockefeller Levin proposal is the most desirable while the McConnell proposal is also acceptable  These proposals are consistent with the principles t at the D N I requested to improve the FISA process  It enhances Intel collection against terrorist operatives communicating overseas foreign to foreign  At the same time  it does provide legal safeguards to protect the rights of Americans consistent with law  a warrant is still required  I think its time to vote  I think its time to protect America
