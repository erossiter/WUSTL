   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 9  2007 Senator Webb s Floor Remarks on his Amendment  S  2012  to the Defense Authorization Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         July 9  2007 Thank you  Mr  President  Id like to point out that as of this point there are 29 cosponsors on this amendment  They include our Majority Leader as well as Senator Hagel as the lead Republican co sponsor  Senator Levin  the Chair of our Committee  Senators Obama  Clinton  Durbin  Tester  Byrd  McCaskill  Kennedy  Kerry  Salazar  Harkin  Feinstein  Schumer  Brown  Lincoln  Pryor  Sanders  Murray  Klobuchar  Boxer  Mikulski  Cantwell  Stabenow  Akaka  Dodd  Biden  and Landrieu       For an updated co sponsor list  please go to     This is an amendment that is focused squarely on supporting our troops who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan  It speaks directly to their welfare and to the needs of their families by establishing minimum periods between deployments for both our regular and reserve components    Mr  President  I would say that I have offered this amendment having grown up as a military family member  having watched a father deployed  As one who has served as a Marine and been deployed and as one who has had a family member deployed in this war  Also  as someone who for three years was privileged to oversee our National Guard and Reserve programs  as Assistant Secretary of Defense during which time I also spent a good bit of energy looking at mobilization issues including if we went to war   The manpower policies that are feeding the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan presently are unprecedented in our history  This not only involves the repeated use of a small pool of active Army and Marine Corps forces  It also regards the use of the National Guard and Reserves at a tempo that we never could have anticipated when we were designing the total force concept  And it also involves the use of contractors doing so called security work  performing missions that historically have been the responsibility of American military men and women    Now in the fifth year of ground operations in Iraq  this deck of cards has come crashing down on the backs of our soldiers and Marines who have been deployed again and again while the rest of the country sits back and debates Iraq as an intellectual or emotional exercise  These men and women are doing a wonderful job and they are also paying a heavy price  That price became clear in a wide variety of statistics  which I will address momentarily  as well as in the personal stories that we who have positions of authority are hearing on a daily basis    I and other supporters of this amendment believe that no matter what ones view of Americas involvement in Iraq  the time has come for the Congress to place reasonable restrictions on how Americas finest military men and women are being used   Stated simply  after more than four years of ground operations in Iraq  weve reached the point where we can no longer allow the ever changing nature of this Administrations operational policies to drive the way our troops are being deployed  In fact  the reverse is true  The availability of our troops should be the main determinant of how ground operations should be conducted  Other amendments will be debated during the days ahead relating to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq  proposed timetables  and the future course of the war  but there is one area where we all  as Democrats and Republicans  should be able to come together and this relates in some measure to what the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia was talking about a few minutes ago    Whether or not theres a report coming out in a week  whether or not theres an evaluation taking place in September  and no matter what any or us believe about the future conduct of the war or about that timetable or that timetable  we owe it to our troops and their families to establish a minimum floor for their combat deployments   If were serious about supporting our troops  theres no better place to start than to correct the current troop rotation policy by requiring a minimum time between deployments   I said in this chamber in March the motivation behind this amendment is simple  its the same motivation that impelled me more than 30 years ago when I first started working on veterans issues  How do we support our troops  What does that mean  Who speaks for the troops    Like you  I listen to what they are saying  Mr  President  Heres what a constituent in Virginia wrote to me recently  her husband is an active duty infantry officer who is presently deployed in Iraq  The wife of an Army active duty infantry captain  she wrote   As an Army wife  I braced myself with the possibility that he may be extended for a few months based on the recent troop surge  and of course  he was  This morning  on the news  I heard that President Bush is considering extending the Army troops again  Enough is enough  she wrote  Im a patriotic American and an Army wife  but even we have our limits  My husband has lost numerous soldiers  we have dozens of amputees at Walter Reed and elsewhere  and morale is dropping  These men need to come home  Please  speak out against another extension  Please bring our overextended soldiers home   After four years of combat  we must provide our troops and their families with a predictable operational tempo that has adequate dwell time between deployments  and we owe this to our active participants  but also we owe this to the participants in the National Guard and Reserves    Why is this bipartisan amendment so important  We all know the reason well enough  A small group of people is answering the call time and again  The result is that our ground forces  in particular  are being burnt out  The evidence is everywhere  We see it in following retention of experienced mid grade officers and noncommissioned officers  The increasing attrition rate among Army accompaniment grade officers is serious enough that our committee  the Senate Committee on Armed Services  included a reporting requirement on the Armys retention programs and incentives in the authorization bill that is now before us    We see it in the West Point classes  2000 and 2001  the most recent classes that finished their initial five year obligations  Were told that their attrition is five times the levels that it was before Iraq for such classes  The statistics that we have been shown indicate that 54  of the West Point class of 2000 left the Army by the end of last year  and that 46  of the class of 2001 left the Army by the end of last year    Senator Warner mentioned Admiral Mullin  who is a long time friend and Naval Academy classmate  now waiting for confirmation as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  He was recently asked what was the thing about which he was most concerned  and he said the Army  and were not talking about equipment  were talking about the Army    The Marine Corps is also seeing an upward trend in the loss of critical mid grade noncommissioned officers  We also find new evidence of troop burnout in numerous mental health issues arising from multiple combat deployments  These are statistically observable  Theres a new report by the Department of Defense that documents a higher rate of mental health issues for service members deploying multiple times or for more than six months  A survey of service members after their deployment found that 38  of our soldiers  31  of our marines  and 49  of the National Guard report psychological problems following their combat deployments    The failure of current rotation policies to protect the welfare of our troops and their families in both regular and reserve components is well documented  This is an example  Mr  President  drawn from the pages of our service members own newspaper  The Stars and Stripes  Last week  the paper described how Army Sergeant Troy Tweed  newly assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division  is slated to deploy to Iraq before a full year of dwell time at home  Sergeant Tweed returned home five months ago from his last deployment to Iraq  Hes one of many former members of his old brigade who are slated to deploy three to four months early because they got a new assignment  This will be Sergeant Tweeds fifth deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan  He says to The Stars and Stripes  it feels like the individual situation of soldiers isnt taken into account  Youre just like a number and the newspaper said it best  soldiers like Tweed fall through the cracks   Closer to home with the Virginia Army National Guard  roughly 1 400 members of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team  this is the famous Stonewall Brigade  have been mobilized  I would point out as an aside that this is a brigade with a long history that dates back to the Civil War  and in fact  one of my ancestors  Mr  President  fought in that brigade during the Civil War  was wounded in Antietam and lost his life at Chancellorsville  The brigade is presently training in Mississippi and will deploy to Iraq in September  Deploying with this Brigade are 700 members of the Third Battalion which returned only two years ago from a deployment in Afghanistan  40  of this battalion will be making its second combat deployment in less than three years as members of the National Guard    One Colonel  a brigade commander stationed in Iraq  recently described his soldiers this way  theyve spent the last four years in a continuous cycle of fighting  training  deploying  and fighting  and they see no end in sight  They have seen their closest friends killed and maimed  leaving young spouses and children  and single parent kids  They want time for themselves and time to raise families for a while  When they look forward to a 15 month deployment with 12 months in between  they see their home station time as being compressed with intensified training which means more time away from families and personal pursuits  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have heard similar stories  I would just like to point out that this cycle of the strategy driving our troops rotation must be reversed    The bipartisan amendment I introduced this afternoon takes a modest step to reverse this practice by establishing a floor for minimum periods between deployments for both units and members  It says that if a unit or a member of a regular component deploys to Iraq or Afghanistan  theyll have the same time at home  dwell time  before theyre deployed  And for Guard and Reserves  they will have three times the amounts of time that they were deployed  This isnt a grand scheme to achieve an ideal troop rotation scenario   The ideal rotation scenarios are two to one for active and five to one for the Guard and Reserve  which we put into this amendment as a goal  But what were attempting to do is to put a floor under this and state what would be optimal   I would like to point out  Mr  President  that the Adjutant General of my state of Virginia  Major General Robert Newman  told us today that its important to consider alternatives like this  like a minimum dwell time that will provide this sort of predictability  Active Army units now deploy for 15 months with a 12 month period between deployments  Many active Marine Corps units are also below this one to one rotation cycle  Individual soldiers and marines who have recently returned from deployment are also reassigned as backfills to new units marked for deployment    Dwell time is not down time  It entails frequent absences as units retain  refurbish  reequip and assimilate new members  After the first month at home  a Marine generally spends 48 days in the field away from family  training  on rifle range or on weekend duty    This amendment provides for fair and reasonable waivers  It gives the President waiver authority in the event of an operational emergency that poses a vital threat to our national security interests  This is a low threshold  It will allow the President to respond to any emergency operational requirement  including those in Iraq and Afghanistan  by certifying the need to waive the amendments on limitations  It provides military departments the authority to waive individual volunteers  in other words  if you want to go back sooner  you can   Contrary to some critics  the amendment does not micromanage the President in his role as Commander in Chief  nor does it tie the hands of our operational commanders in theater  A more predictable dwell time will be transparent to our forward deployed commanders  Military departments have long experienced managing people as individuals  We fought the Vietnam War on an individual rotational policy before the widespread use of todays information technology systems that make it far easier for us to monitor when an individual returns from deployment so that you have a date certain or when his dwell time would expire    There was some comment on Constitutional authority  The Constitutional authority of this amendment is clear  Article 1  Section 8 of the Constitution empowers the Congress to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces  As acting Secretary of the Army Geren stated during his confirmation hearing last month  Article 1 of the Constitution makes Congress and the Army full partners    There are precedents for this action  Congress has acted in a similar way in the past  The best recent example is in 1951  during the height of the Korean War when Congress intervened to ensure our service members were not sent to war before they were properly trained  The Selective Service Act was amended to provide that every person inducted into the armed forces would receive full and adequate training for a period not less than four months  The law also stipulated that no personnel during this 120 day period would be assigned for duty outside the United States  It could have been argued in the Korean War that we had manpower requirements that should have allowed the Department of Defense or the operational commanders or the President  as Commander in Chief  to send military people outside of the country before they had 120 days of training  120 days is essential for the well being of our troops  just as this amendment today says that dwell time  time back home is essential for the well being of our troops    This Chamber has a clear duty to assert our authority to prevent further damage to our military  The current strategy  the current operational policy does not justify the way that we are deploying our troops  And I would urge my colleagues to recognize this common interest and the interests that we share in addressing the welfare of our troops and their families  I have been encouraged to hear the sentiments echoed recently by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are equally interested in forging a new road to the future  including Senators Lugar  Domenici  Voinovich  Collins and even my senior colleague from Virginia  Senator Warner  Theyve studied the course of the war in Iraq  They ask the same questions that trouble us all  How can we continue to ask our troops to sacrifice indefinitely while the Iraqi government is not making progress  Many  many other questions    But the bottom line in all this is that  as we move forward responsibly to relocate our military from Iraq over a period of time  we cannot continue to do what we are doing to the troops that we are sending over and over again  We seek a conclusion at the end of this engagement that will enable us to withdraw our combat forces from Iraq  that will lead to progressively greater regional stability  that will allow us to fight international terrorism more effectively  and that will enable us to more fully address our broader strategic visions around the world   The American people expect us to do that to move our country forward in a collaborative way  but they also expect us to use our troops in a way that addresses their welfare and uses them in a way that is more properly related to the tasks at hand in Iraq and Afghanistan  So we can no longer continue to place such a disproportionately large burden on the shoulders of so few people  We need a balance  Its up to the Congress to establish that balance  and as the young army wife wrote to me recently  enough is enough  I thank my colleagues who have signed on as original cosponsors  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment
