   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 11  2007 Webb to Republicans  Our Troops Want Real Leadership Not Procedural Tactics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Floor Remarks July 11  2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Below are remarks delivered by Senator Webb on the Senate floor today with respect to his amendment to support the troops through responsible deployment cycles      First  I would like to say that I think theres a lot of misunderstanding and misrepresentation that have been made over the past couple of days with respect to this amendment I will address some of the things the Senator from South Carolina said that he is calling a political moment  I dont think there is a political moment in this issue from the perspective  among others  of someone who served three years as Assistant Secretary of Defense where I was responsible for dealing with mobilization issues and was required to learn a great deal of detail what they used to call war maps  manpower flow issues        I would like to also point out because of some of the other comments that have just been made that the Commandant of the Marine Corps when he took office said his goal was to see a 2 1 rotation cycle with respect to the deployment of Marines  I point that out because this amendment sets out a minimum floor for the use of American troops of 1 1  If youve been gone a year  you should get a year back  If youve been gone seven months  you should get seven months back  If we were arguing optimal scenarios I would understand a little bit more the push back that were getting from the other side       Were not trying to put optimal historical scenarios on the table here  We are trying to get a minimum floor that will protect the well being of our troops  We have data that has been shown  I dont need to go over it today of how this is affecting retention of high quality people and how this is affecting retention of high quality people and how it is affecting emotional difficulties people are having  We need to step forward and act responsibly       Some Republicans have questioned the constitutionality of this amendment  There is no issue here  Article One  Section 8  to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces        Some say this is meddling in the Presidents war making authority  To the contrary  the Congress has the power and the duty to place proper restraints on executive authority  particularly when it comes to the well being of our troops        In the Korean War  the Department of Defense was sending soldiers overseas before they had been fully trained  The Congress  our predecessors  stepped in and put a law into place that said you cant deploy anybody until theyve been in the military for at least 120 days  This is what were doing only on the other end of it  Were saying that after four years of ground occupation in Iraq  we have a responsibility to get some stability into the operational tempo       Yesterday my colleague from Alabama warned  wrongly  that the amendment would  in his words  alter the traditional power of the President as it relates to all future wars any war now or series of wars in the future  My friend will re read the amendment more carefully  He will find that it applies only to Iraq  Afghanistan  and certain NATO sponsored activities       Senator Sessions also stated his concerns  as he put it  another amendment trying to set another strategy  written by a group sitting in air conditioned offices  I would like to emphasize a few points here       First  this amendment does not represent a strategy  Its an amendment that protects the well being of our troops by setting a bare minimum floor on how theyre being used no matter what strategy is in place       Second  the experiences that led some of us to this conclusion did not come from sitting in air conditioned offices  I would like to point out that as far as I can determine  Senator Chuck Hagel is the only ground combat veteran on the other side of the aisle  He certainly is the only ground combat veteran from Vietnam on the other side of the aisle  And he is a lead co sponsor of this amendment  On this side of the aisle  all of the ground combat veterans are co sponsors along with 35 members of the Senate  I must say that I believe that we  collectively  understand a truth acquired the hard way  a truth that transcends politics  And we are trying  in all good faith  to do something about it       And finally  I would like to again point out that this amendment has the full support of the Military Officers Association of America  This is the largest Association of Military Officers in the country  368 000 members and these are officers who are not restrained from speaking about their opinions by having to serve inside todays political process       Vice Admiral Norbert Ryan wrote a letter supporting the necessity of this amendment  he pointed out that his organization is very concerned that steps must be taken to protect our most precious military asset  the all volunteer force  from having to bear such a disproportionate share of national wartime sacrifice       He also said  If we are not better stewards of our troops and their families in the future than we have been in the recent past  our organization believes strongly that we will be putting the all volunteer force at unacceptable risk       These officers  368 000   are joining us in a very real concern  that under current policy  many of our ground forces are actually spending more time in Iraq than they are at home  This is four years into an occupation  There is no strategic justification for this  and there is no political reason to oppose an amendment that places proper restraints on this sort of conduct by the Executive branch       This Amendment recognizes that the Congress has a duty to exercise leadership when it comes to the well being of our men and women in uniform  In the words of Admiral Ryan  it is a recognition that we have a responsibility to become better stewards of our troops and their families than we have been in the recent past       I would say to my colleagues that the American people are watching us today  and they are watching closely  with the expectation that we finally take some sort of positive action that might stabilize the operational environment in which our troops are being sent  again and again  They are tired of the posturing that is giving the Congress such a bad reputation  They are tired of the procedural strategies designed to protect politicians from accountability  and to protect this Administration from accountability  They are looking for concrete actions that will protect the well being of our men and women in uniform        The question on this amendment is not whether you support this war or whether you do not  It is not whether you want to wait until July or September to see where one particular set of bench marks or summaries might be taking us  The question is this  more than four years into ground operations in Iraq  we owe stability  and a reasonable cycle of deployment  to the men and women who are carrying our nations burden  That is the question  And that is the purpose of this Amendment
