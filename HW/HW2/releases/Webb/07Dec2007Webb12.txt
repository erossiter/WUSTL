Thursday  the Senate and the House negotiators agreed on a landmark provision to improve wartime contracting and  accountability sponsored by Senators Jim Webb  D VA  and Claire McCaskill   D MO  The measure is expected to receive final approval when both chambers of  Congress vote on final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act later  this month   The Webb McCaskill amendment  cosponsored by the  Senators seven Democratic freshman colleagues  creates an independent   bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting charged with addressing the  systemic problems associated with wartime support contracts and reconstruction  projects in Iraq and Afghanistan   I am pleased that Senator McCaskill  our freshman  colleagues and I were able to move this legislation so quickly  Weve been able  to create a commission that has teeth in it to bring accountability back into  our wartime contracting system  said Senator Webb  The waste  abuse and lack  of oversight associated with some of these federal agency contracts are hitting  the pocket book of every American  Those of us in Congress have an obligation to  the American taxpayer to be proper stewards of their tax dollars     We can do better  we must do better with war  contracting  Senator McCaskill said This commission will make a difference   It will be bipartisan  it will be substantive  and it will be meaningful  and at  the end of two years  we will have a very clear blueprint on how we move forward  with contracting at the Department of Defense and within our military and the  State Department  As Harry Truman said during World War II  the men and women  in the foxhole should never have to worry that people are profiting  inappropriately off their sacrifice  Specifically  the Webb McCaskill  provision    Establishes an  independent  bipartisan eight member Commission on Wartime Contracting to study  and investigate federal agency contracting for reconstruction  logistics  support  and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan  The Commission will have  the authority to recommend cases for legal dispensation and will make  recommendations to improve contracting processes in the future       Requires a study and  investigation into the impact of the governments growing reliance on civilian  contractors to perform wartime functions  The Commission will assess the extent  of waste  fraud  abuse  and mismanagement of wartime contracts  and the extent  to which those responsible have been held accountable       Expands the  jurisdiction of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR   and a newly created Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction   SIGAR  beyond reconstruction funds to include security contracts  executed in Iraq and  Afghanistan  It also requires the  conduct of an expanded series of audits of wartime contracts by the Inspector  General of the Department of Defense and other executive agency  IGs     Requires a review of  the appropriateness of agencies structure  policies  and processes for wartime  and contingency contracts and a determination of whether certain tasks that have  been contracted out should be considered inherently governmental and therefore  no longer outsourced    A second amendment offered by Senators Webb and  McCaskill was also retained in the conferenced report  requiring the Department  of Defense to strengthen its policies regarding private security contractors   such as Blackwater  The amendment directs the U S  Department of Defense to  develop procedures to  maintain records of private security personnel  register  and develop an identification system for vehicles operated by contractors  and  ensure that private security personnel are briefed on and understand their  obligation to comply with applicable U S   Iraqi and international laws on  the use of force   The amendment also provides for the cultural training of  security contractors and guidance on working with the U S   military and Iraqi nationals  Several provisions of this amendment were  included in the recommendations of the Secretary of States review panel that  was deployed to Iraq following a deadly shooting  incident in September 2007   To listen to the audio  of todays press conference with Senators Webb and McCaskill  visit     Video from todays  press conference is
