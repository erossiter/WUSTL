   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 9  2007 WEBB AMENDMENT SUPPORTS TROOPS THROUGH RESPONSIBLE DEPLOYMENT CYCLES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bi Partisan Legislation Calls for Adequate Dwell Time Between Overseas Deployments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington   DCSenator Jim Webb  D VA  today introduced a bi partisan  amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act requiring that active duty  troops and units have at least equal time at home as the length of their  previous tour overseas  The amendment also sets a minimum 1 to 3 year ratio for  National Guard and Reserve members and units    Thirty one members of the Senate have signed onto Webbs  amendment as original co sponsors  including Senator Chuck Hagel  the lead  Republican cosponsor     For a copy of the  amendment  complete floor speech  list of co sponsors and other materials   visit       Now in the fifth year of ground operations in Iraq   this deck of cards has come crashing down on the backs of soldiers and Marines  who have been deployed again and again  while the rest of the country sits back  and debates Iraq as an intellectual or emotional exercise  Webb said    Weve reached the point where we can no longer allow  the ever changing nature of this Administrations operational policies to drive  the way our troops are being deployed  In fact  the reverse is true  The  availability of our troops should be the main determinant of how ground  operations should be conducted    This is one area where we all as Democrats and  Republicans should be able to come together  I would urge my colleagues to  recognize this common interest and the interests that we share in addressing the  welfare of our troops and their families  continued Webb      Troops currently face extended deployments with  insufficient dwell time to rest with families and friends  retrain  and  re equip before they are redeployed  The effects have been seen in rising  mental health problems among service members serving multiple tours and falling  retention rates for mid grade officers and non commissioned  officers   The war is headed in a dangerous direction  and  Americans are united in the belief that we cannot wait until the  Administrations September report before we change course in Iraq   Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   said in a press conference today with Senator Webb  Attacks on U S   forces are up  Iraqi political leaders are frozen in a dangerous stalemate and a  change at every front is required if we are to succeed  We cannot ask our  military to continue to fight without a strategy for success  and we certainly  cannot ask them to fight before they are ready to do  so   Senator Webbs amendment sets a floor for minimum  periods between deployments for both units and members  It states that if a  unit or member of a regular component of the Armed Forces is deployed to Iraq or  Afghanistan  they will have the same time at homedwell timebefore being  redeployed  Guard and Reserve units and members will have a minimum floor of  three years dwell time prior to being redeployed    The amendment  however  states that the ideal rotation  scenarios are a 1 to 2 deployment to dwell ratio for active duty troops and five  years between subsequent deployments for the Guard and Reserve  The amendment  also states the sense of Congress that units and members of Reserve components  should not be mobilized continuously for more than one  year   Senator Webb has taken an important leadership role on  an issue that is as important to our country and to our military and their  families as any other issueand thats ensuring the readiness of our military   said Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   today on the Senator floor  It is the men and women who we ask to fight and die  for this country who must always be our highest priority  The men and women who  serve this country in uniform and their families deserve a policy worthy of  their sacrifices    We continue to ask more and more of our brave men and  women fighting in Iraq and  Afghanistan  said Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   Its time  to live up to our commitments and give them a fair and reasonable amount of time  at home between deployments to re establish family ties  and continue their  training and advanced military education  so theyre well prepared for their  next deployment    Multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a huge toll on  our troops  both physically and mentally  said Senator Jon Tester  D MT   a member of the  Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  When our men and women in uniform are  called to duty we must make sure theyre ready and equipped with the resources  they need  Rest is a critically important component of that  Senator Webb  offers common sense legislation that will truly support our  troops   Our armed forces are completely overstretched with  extended tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan  said Senator Mary Landrieu  D LA   We have been  fighting this war for four years  and its time to give our fighting men and  women a reprieve  This amendment will be a huge improvement to military  retention for our National Guard and Reserve units by allowing these units the  time they need to reunite with their families and adequately prepare for their  next mission  We simply will not have the manpower we need to meet our next  challenge  whatever it may be  unless our forces and their families receive the  support they deserve    The men and women who are serving in  Iraq and Afghanistan are carrying a heavy  burden and they all deserve our support  said Senator John Kerry  D MA   This amendment  is an important step in restoring the social contract between our Armed Forces  and the government that this administration has shattered  We keep faith with  troops when we remember the sacrifices they are making and we take steps to help  them and their families cope with these extended deployments  Its only fair  they have an opportunity to rest at home after these long deployments and I look  forward to a vote on this amendment
