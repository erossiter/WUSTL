   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 28  2007 Senator Jim Webb s Commencement Address to George Washington University s Graduate School of Political Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Dean Arterton  distinguished guests  ladies and  gentlemen  and especially the graduates of the George Washington School of  Political Management  I am grateful for the opportunity to share in this  important milestone in your lives    I understand that the New York Times has called this  school the West Point of the Political Wars   Given that West Point and the New York Times  share the same state  I can understand how that conclusion might have been  reached  As a graduate of the Naval Academy I might suggest that you  petition to call your school the Annapolis of the political wars  but Ill leave  that up to you   I would like to take a moment to especially thank the  Dean  Chris Arterton  for his two full decades of dedication to the GSPM  and  also to congratulate this years award winners for all the contributions they  have made  And I d like to recognize some distinguished guests in the audience    Id also like to express my thanks to the several  members of this class who helped out in my Senate campaign last year  and  especially to point out that Kimberly Hunter  who is a valued member of my  staff  is now even more valuable to me today with a GSPM diploma     I am particularly honored to be here given the  programs 20th Anniversary    Today is a day for families and friends  for shared  memories of good times here  at Lindys Red Lyon and Froggy Bottom Pub     and  for that feeling that comes from accomplishing something truly  special   I also want to say a special word at the outset of my  remarks about all the spouses and parents who are here with us  I m sure that  those of you who are graduating know what a very special time this is for them   They have worked long and hard  and sacrificed much to bring you to this point   When you remember this day  remember them  And I know that you will never take  their love and support for granted   Commencement speakers are often asked to wade into  these conflicting emotions and share a few lasting pearls of wisdom and advice   It is a difficult task    Winston Churchill s advice for public speakers is  particularly fitting for me today  Churchill always counseled people to Be  Clear     Be Concise     and Be Seated  Considering this is the second or third  Commencement for many of you  I will try to follow that advice  today   But at the same time  I don t want to let this day pass  without a few sincere and heartfelt pieces of  advice   Many of you came to GSPM to build onto existing careers  while others come straight out of undergraduate school  Some earned their  political stripes outside the beltway in state and local campaigns while others  havewalked the Halls of Congress either working for or lobbying our nation s  lawmakers   In your graduate studies  you ve been taught the  practical skills of politics but I hope that the true lesson that you take away  from this program is to follow your principles and fight for the issues that you  care about  Quite frankly  we live in a world where politics has too frequently  been dominated by negativism and the manipulation that inevitably comes from too  great an emphasis on process  Our country desperately needs a greater focus on  substance  It doesnt even matter to me on which side of the debate you fall   so much as how you present your arguments  and how clearly the public begins to  comprehend the choices we are now faced with as a  nation   As many of you know I have not lived the life of a  politician  In fact a little over a year ago  I had no political base  whatsoever  in either party  My opponent  who as you know was an incumbent  Senator  had just received the highest number of votes in a presidential poll  taken during the Conservative Political Action Conference  I had no money  and  on a good day I was 33 points behind in the polls   My political credentials were viewed with unease by  both sides  On the one hand I had spent four years as a Republican Committee  counsel in the House of Representatives and four years as a political appointee  in the Reagan Administration  which did not exactly warm the hearts of many  Democrats  On the other I had helped the United Mine Workers during their  landmark 1989 strike against the Pittston Coal Company and I had been an early  and vocal critic of the Bush Administration s Iraq War policy  which did endear  me to the hearts of many Republicans   What my nascent campaign staff and I did have was a  strong belief that this nation is going through a sea change in terms of party  politics  and that the old labels simply don t work anymore  That the political  cards are being reshuffled  all across this country  That good  well meaning  people have watched their government flub things up  from Iraq to  the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  That they want better leadership  and that  they want new approaches   We conveyed this message with relentless discipline  It  is a message that I believe should be a continuing part of the national debate   And if the message is successful  I believe it could and should become the core  message of a revitalized Democratic Party   And so  in the campaign I talked about deeper themes  rather than mere political issues  We never simply talked about Iraq   Instead  we spoke repeatedly  and in depth  about the need to re orient our  nation s national security posture in a way that would allow us not only to  withdraw our forces from Iraq  but also to restore a measure of stability in  that historically volatile region  to increase our ability to fight the war  against international terrorism  and to more properly address the wide range of  strategic and foreign policy issues that have been dangerously ignored over the  past five years   We also spoke about the need to restore economic  fairness in this country  In this age of globalization  the  internationalization of corporate America has created enormous  inequities in our society  and serious problems for American workers  Over the  past seven years  we have seen a dangerous re distribution of wealth that  threatens to create an America more divided by class than at  any time since the days of the Robber Barons that began in the 1880s  Corporate  profits in this country are at an all time high as a percentage of national  wealth  while wages and salaries are at all time lows  More than half of the  stocks are owned by one percent of the people  This disturbing trend must be  addressed and reversed for the good of our nation as a whole     And finally  in the wake of such seriously  under examined issues as the NSA wiretapping scandal  the failure of leadership  during and after Hurricane Katrina  and the billions of dollars wasted due to a  failure of oversight in Iraq War contracting  we talked about the need to  restore simple accountability to our government  to make sure that the federal  system works in the way our forefathers conceived it  and to ensure also that  our taxpayers get real value for their investment   In short  we offered voters context  in a time when far  too much political energy was being wasted on contrived  emotionally divisive  issues such as flag burning  gay marriage and focus group tested phrases such as  cut and run and retreat and defeat   We did something else that was a bit different  I  decided early that I would be guided by my own sense of values and political  instincts rather than polls and focus groups  and over time the voters came to  understand that I meant it  We did our best to keep our message consistent   even when this gave our political advisers serious heartburn  I spoke directly  to corporate leaders about corporate responsibility  I became the first  statewide candidate in Virginia history to walk  a union picket line during a campaign  even though Virginia is 48th in the  country in terms of union membership   A lot of commentators were saying that I was naive   Others were saying that I was a one issue candidate  Still others were saying  that my opponent made such serious errors that he was responsible for his own  defeat  Allow me to respond  first  that one issue candidates don t beat strong  incumbents   this was proven in Connecticut  And second  while it might have  been risky  it was not nave to have recognized that our voters have become  disgusted with the cynicism of modern day politics  We gambled on the likelihood  that people in this country truly desire a clear and unambiguous approach to  governing  and we won  And I am committed to doing my best to bring about that  reality   Here at the GSPM  you have classes with Democrats and  Republicans taught by Democrats and Republicans  As a Democrat who used to be a  Republican who used to be a Democrat I feel right at  home  I recognize that I am speaking to a partisan audience  today that is driven by a passion for leadership and politics  While each of you  holds his or her own political beliefs  I d like to stress to you the importance  of focusing on substance over politics in Washington and ask you to build on your  valuable experience here at GSPM in order to work toward changing the tone of  tomorrow s politics   The past two weeks the Senate has been vigorously  debating the Iraq War  For the good of the country  we in the Congress need to  find a way to come together  on both sides of the aisle  and work toward a  solution that will  as Ive said so many times before  end our combat presence  in Iraq  increase the stability of that region  increase our ability to fight  international terrorism around the world  and allow the United States to focus  on the larger strategic issues that have been neglected in large part for more  than five years   What weve seen in Washington over the past decade is the political version  of the World War One Battle of the Somme  Both  sides of the aisle continue to pound on each other  neither side yielding  with  little or no ground being gained by either side  and with little good coming to  the country despite all of the energy and frustration     In World War One  great nations lost their influence  and inevitably their place in the world because neither side knew how to do  anything except slog directly into each other  again and again  for years  This  is hardly the blood bath of World War One  but the political implications for  our country are just as severe  We are spending away our national treasure   burning up good people  losing the good will of other nations  Along the way we  have in too many cases lost the moral high ground that has always characterized  the United  States in the eyes of other nations  We in the  congress owe the country a better way  And that way begins with an honest   logical approach to the issues we face in Iraq  and our country   I know that most of you are ready to either begin or to  continue the fight  on behalf of the issues that have brought you into politics  in the first place  Whatever side of the issues you are on  I salute you for  that willingness  We have been the most creative political society on earth  because we have been blessed to be part of a structure that encourages vigorous  debate  My only request to all of you is to join in that debate honorably  to  bring your beliefs to the stage with powerful  substantive argument and to win  or lose based on the merits of your views  as finally measured by the American  people    Additionally  I personally hope that you will embrace  another value as well  In the scriptures we are told  For unto whomsoever much  is given  much shall be required  Our country  and indeed our world community   needs you to follow this simple idea now more than  ever   By your study  you have earned great advantages  But as  with all of us who have been blessed with such opportunities  it is important to  remember that with opportunity and advantage comes responsibility     In my view  there are few challenges confronting this  nation that are more serious or urgent than the themes on which I based my  campaign last year  the need to straighten out our foreign policy  the need to  redress the growing sense of unfairness that hangs over our economic affairs   and the need to bring true accountability into our  government   We can fix these issues  The generations that went  before us achieved some remarkable things  They populated a wilderness  created  a country  gave us American style democracy  won World War II  and prevailed in  the Cold War  They grew our economy until it was the world s largest  They ended  racial discrimination   Your generation s legacy   no smaller a task   should  be that you fought for new kind of politics   a principled politics  Challenge  the status quo with the principles that guide you  Don t become blinded by  partisan politics  To often decisions are made based on political calculations  while the tough work of finding solutions for the common good are  ignored   As graduates of the West Point of Politics  your  education has focused on political strategy and tactics  I ask that you apply  the lessons of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli very carefully and strive for political  leadership with a backbone and a conscience   And whatever happens in your lives  please make  yourselves a promise  that you will always find a way to give something back    through service to your families  to your community  and to your  country   I appreciate having been able to share this special day  with you  and I wish all of you the very best in what I know will be an exciting  future for each of you individually and for our  country   Thank you  And God bless you  all
