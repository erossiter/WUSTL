Regarding the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mr  President  I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague Senator Warner which will authorize a one time capital grant by the National Archives to establish a Presidential library to honor the life of Woodrow Wilson  Virginia is fortunate to have eight native sons that went on to become President of the United   States  This is a distinction that has led our fair Commonwealth to be known as the Mother of Presidents  The bipartisan bill we introduce today honors the most recent of the eight and a native of Staunton  Virginia  Woodrow Wilson    Woodrow Wilson was one of the most influential statesmen  scholars  and Presidents in American history  His impact on domestic and international affairs is undeniable  Only now  nearly one hundred years after his presidency  are we able to fully appreciate the contributions President Wilson made to the United States and to the world     As a professor and President of Princeton University  WilsonWilson revolutionized the roles of teachers and students and quickly made Princeton one of the most renowned universities in the world  created a more accountable system for higher education  Through curriculum reform     As a scholar  Wilson wrote numerous books and became an accomplished essayist  Highly regarded for his work in political science  Wilsons dissertation  entitled Congressional Government  is still g  He did this notwithstanding the fact that he could not read until he was ten years old and may have suffered from a learning disability such as dyslexia     As a statesman and President  Wilson compiled a record of domestic legislation that set the groundwork for modern America and reflected his belief in the ideal that  Liberty does not consist       in mere general declarations of the rights of man  It consists in the translation of those declarations into definite action  He spearheaded groundbreaking reform in finance  trade  industry and labor  including anti trust and child labor laws and womens suffrage  During his two terms in office  he oversaw the birth of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Trade Commission    In spite of Wilsons significant contributions to American history and his instrumental role in shaping the framework of the modern international landscape  there exists no authorized Presidential library dedicated to his achievements     For the last seventy years  the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Foundation in Staunton  Virginia has admirably served as caretaker of Wilsons papers and artifacts  dedicating itself to the preservation of Wilsons legacy  But it has done so without the resources afforded to other Presidential libraries in the Federal system  Over time  the Foundation has outgrown its current space and facilities  Now  with each day that passes  the prevailing physical infrastructure severely limits educational capabilities and opportunities to share the profound legacy of President Wilson  Indeed  the Foundation has even become reluctant to take on many new major new Wilson collections because its current controlled archival system is filled to capacity and cannot protect additional collections in the absence of the new facility     Accordingly  the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Authorization Act authorizes a one time capital grant from the National Archives for the establishment of an independent Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library  This Library will serve as the center for education and study of Woodrow Wilsons life and legacies  and will enable people from this country and abroad to learn more about the life and work of our nations 28th President  To be clear  this bill would establish the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library as an independent  privately run institution operating outside the existing Presidential Library System    The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Foundation will use the federal funds to offset costs associated with the construction of a 29 000 square foot Presidential Library honoring President Wilson  As planned  the Library would include a research library  archives  lecture hall  reception hall  orientation theater  ceremonial space  and exhibit hall  These funds authorized under this legislation represent the full federal share of the project  Significantly  the bill does not authorize ongoing operating subsidies on any other ongoing expenses  This is a one time authorization    The Foundations endeavor to construct the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library will create the only site in the country dedicated to the exploration of the full life and legacies of the 28th President  at his birthplace in Staunton   Virginia  A new Library will alleviate stress on existing Foundation facilities and to allow for increased educational outreach to the benefit of students in Virginia and across the United States  Construction of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library would achieve the following objectives     Make possible collaboration with the National Archives and other presidential libraries  thereby fostering increased awareness and study of American history and the institution of the Presidency     Integrate cutting edge digital archive development    Promote tourism to Staunton and the Commonwealth  of Virginia to the benefit of all local economies    Sensitive to the budgetary constraints faced by the National Archives  let me reiterate we have crafted this legislation to minimize and cap the financial burden on the federal government posed by this project  First  the bill ensures the existence of a strong public private sponsorship by mandating that any federal dollars are matched two for one by the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Foundation and only after the nonfederal funds are certified to be in possession of the nonprofit entity  an arrangement that Congress has used in the past     This legislation states that the Federal government shall have no role or responsibility for the operation of the library and guarantees that the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library will operate outside the existing Presidential Library System  This is not an effort by the nonprofit Foundation to secure annual operating subsidies along the lines of what Congress provides all Presidential Libraries in the existing system    Mr  President  this legislation enjoys broad  bipartisan  bicameral support in Congress and broad support among individuals  organizations and officials across the country  This bill is identical to legislation approved by the House of Representatives by voice vote in the 109th Congress on September 28  2006  and which the entire Virginia House delegation has reintroduced in the 110th Congress  I would note that the Governor of Virginia has written Senator Warner and me to endorse the project  So too have other regional officials  historians  and representatives of other Presidential sites throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia  including Monticello  Poplar Forest  Montpelier  Ash Lawn  and Mount Vernon     This project has the potential to benefit not only the greater Staunton region  but Virginia and the Nation as a whole  both from a historical educational sense and by strengthening an important cultural asset in Virginias Shenandoah Valley  We are advised that a new building will be an open  welcoming forum for the hundreds of thousands of American and foreign visitors who will visit each year to learn about Woodrow Wilson and his democratic legacies  The project sponsors believe that the country s best museum designers will work with historians to turn the story of Woodrow Wilson into an unforgettable experience that is fun  educational  and permanently memorable    Mr  President  in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the life  principles and accomplishments of the 28th President of the United States  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure that Wilsons legacy is more accessible and available for a wider audience for years to come  I am hopeful that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will consider this legislation favorably and that we can enact it during the remainder of this Congressional session  With the 100th anniversary of his election just five years away  this is the time for Congress to accept its responsibility to help preserve President Woodrow Wilsons legacy and to improve its accessibility for generations    I ask that my full statement be printed in the Record where the bill appears  I yield the floor
