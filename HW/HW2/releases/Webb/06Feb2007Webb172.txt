through Leadership that is Equal to the Sacrifices We Are Asking Them to Make                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Jim Webb delivered the following statement today on the Senate floor  Tuesday  February 6  2007                                                      Mr  President  I wish to emphasize my support for the Levin Warner Resolution that was painstakingly put together by a number of senior Senators from both sides of the aisle  only to be denied a full debate and open vote through the procedural motions yesterday evening   Winston Churchill once wrote about watching good ideas getting nibbled to death by ducks   Last night  we saw that phenomenon in action   We had before us a measure that would allow this Congress to speak clearly of its concerns regarding the woeful lack of leadership by the President on an issue that affects our nation and our military people like no other   And the other side   including some Senators who had helped to draft the resolution  and had put their names on it   punted the ball down field  rather than giving the people of this country the debate they not only need  but are calling for in every public opinion poll                             Quite simply  there is no way  other than through a strong resolution or restrictive language in an appropriations bill  for this body to communicate to this Administration that its so called new  strategy  is lacking in the most crucial elements that might actually lead to a solution in Iraq   This is not a strategy   It is a one dimensional tactical adjustment that avoids the elements of a true over arching national strategy   It relies too heavily on our military  while ignoring the overwhelming advice of those with long experience in this region that we must pursue robust diplomacy in order to bring this misguided effort to a conclusion                           There have been allegations by those on the other side that we who take this position are not supporting the troops   I would submit that the best way to support the troops is for this Administration to outline  and pursue  a comprehensive strategy that includes the diplomatic measures that will be essential to ending our involvement   Mr  President a reminder    during the Vietnam War our military killed more than a million enemy soldiers   enemy soldiers   by the official count of the present Hanoi government   Actually  the count is 1 4 million   Soldiers   But without a clear strategy and adept diplomacy  this was not enough   And from the very beginning in Iraq  this Administration has consciously neglected its proper diplomatic duties   It has attempted to frame the debate over Iraq s future as one of military action on the one hand  and a set of vague guidelines to the Iraqi government on the other  as if the rest of the region were somehow not crucial to the eventual outcome   This is in and of itself a recipe for continued violence  and for American failure in Iraq                                                 It is widely known that the Iraqi government lacks the power to control the myriad of factions that are causing chaos   The latest National Intelligence Estimate not only confirms this  it indicates that these factions have been breaking into so many different components that it isn t even fair to call this problem one of sectarian violence any longer   The Administration knows this   Most of the Administration s strongest supporters know this   Their reaction has been to increase the pressure on an impotent government  and to go to the well again and again  asking for even greater sacrifices from our military  while ignoring their most basic responsibility  which is to put together a clear diplomatic effort that will bring full context to the issues that face us and in short order end our involvement               This is not supporting the troops             This is misusing the troops                         And with respect to the troops  I would caution any political leader who claims to speak on behalf of the political views of our men and women in uniform   Our military people are largely a mirror of our society  particularly in the ranks  and their political views are as diverse as our own   As one example  last year a survey of those in Iraq indicated that more than 70  believed the U S  should exit Iraq within a year   As I have said before  it is inverted logic to claim that we should continue to fight this war on behalf of the troops   The fact is that they are fighting this war on behalf of the political process   They deserve political leadership that is knowledgeable  and that proceeds from an assumption that our national goals are equal to the sacrifices we are asking them to make                        For the last five years   from before the invasion   this Administration and its supporters have refused to admit the most fundamental truth of the entire war   It is a truth that was echoed over and over again last month by expert witnesses during more than a dozen hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee  both of which I am privileged to serve on   It is a truth that this Administration and the architects of the war too often refuse to recognize  perhaps because they fear it might  potentially  embarrass them in the eyes of history                                The unavoidable truth is that this war will never be brought to a proper conclusion without the active participation of the other countries in the region   All of them                               We hear stories of the Saudis helping the Sunni insurgency   We are told by this Administration that Iran is equipping and training portions of the Shia militias   We hear that Turkey and Iran are quietly co operating to limit the regional influence of the Kurds   We hear that Syria is the favorite starting point for many Al Qaeda guerrillas who infiltrate into Al Anbar Province    We know that the entire region is being flooded with refugees from the violence in Iraq  including  especially  Jordan and Syria                 None of this is surprising   Indeed  all of it was predictable   and predicted  even before the invasion of Iraq   What is truly surprising   and unsettling   is this Administration s lack of overt diplomatic effort to bring order out of this the chaos  in a way that might allow us to dramatically decrease our presence in Iraq and at the same time increase the stability of the region  increase our ability to fight terrorism  and allow us to address strategic challenges elsewhere in the world   These countries have historic  political and cultural ties to Iraq   They are going to be involved in Iraq s affairs in the future  long after the United States departs the region   It is in our national interest and  as a great nation  our obligation  to take the lead in causing each of these countries to deal responsibly with Iraq s chaos and with its future   We did exactly this in 2001  after the invasion of Afghanistan  bringing the major players to the table  including India  Pakistan and Iran   We should do so now                             Such an approach will have additional benefits beyond Iraq  Mr  President   It will begin to loosen the unnatural alliance between Iran and Syria  which could in turn increase the potential for greater stability in Lebanon  Israel  and the surrounding territories   It will begin to bring countries such as Iran to a proper role inside the international community                           And on this point  Mr  President  I would cite an important historical referent   In 1971  China  like Iran today  was considered a rogue nation   China in those days was already a nuclear power   It had an American war on its borders  in Vietnam  a war that it was actively assisting   We  the United States  took the initiative  aggressively opening China through diplomatic energy  and over time helped to bring China into the international community   We should not be afraid of taking similar actions with Iran  and also with Syria               The bottom line of all of this is that this Administration and its supporters must understand the realities that are causing us  as a Congress  to finally say enough is enough   That the time has come for a new approach   That the answer in Iraq  and to our fight against international terrorism  and to our diminished posture around the world  is for us to show not only our prowess on the battlefield but also our leadership in the diplomatic arena   That indeed we have an obligation to the men and women who have served so selflessly on our behalf  to match their proficiency and their loyalties with the kind of thoughtful leadership that will bring this effort to a proper conclusion                               If there are other ways to convince this Administration to change its ineffective  one dimensional approach to the situation in Iraq  I would welcome them   But after five years of political disarray I do not believe this is so   So I support the Levin Warner resolution  as a first step in reclaiming America s strategic purpose and international reputation   And I urge my fellow Senators to do the same
