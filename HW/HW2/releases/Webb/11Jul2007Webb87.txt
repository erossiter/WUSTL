   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 11  2007 Transcript  Democratic Members of the Senate Hold a News Conference on Troop Rotations

knows  we just had our vote on  the amendment that I had proposed with respect to dwell time   I regret that we did not reach the 60 vote margin that would have   caused this amendment to prevail It was offered in the spirit of  bipartisanship  It was offered with the intention to protect the  wellbeing of our troops  We had two days to debate it There were a lot of  representations on the other side that were not particularly true and   unfortunately  this ended up breaking down  for political reasons   into  for the most part  a resistance by the Republicans on an issue  that we just shouldn t have had political implications  At the same time  we got a strong majority of the United States  Senate to agree that this issue is vital to the wellbeing of the  people who are being sent into harm s way and we re going to continue  to focus on this issue and others in the future  I have a number of my colleagues who have joined me today I  would like to make time so that they can speak Senator Durbin was  going to be here I m not sure he s here Senator Biden is here and  Senator Hagel  who was our lead cosponsor on the Republican side And  I m not quite sure how protocol works  but I m going to turn this over  right now to Senator Murray  MURRAY On behalf of 56 members of the United States Senate  I  want to thank Senator Webb for his tremendous leadership on an issue  that is impacting thousands of families across our country  Every one of us who goes home and watches our men and women go  off to war has watched them over the last 4 5 years grow more  exhausted and more tired and  importantly  their families  the stress  and strain on their children  on their parents  on them as they just  try to do what this country s asked them to do and serve our country  The amendment that Senator Webb put before the Senate today said  that we  as representatives here in the United States Senate  are  going to make sure that our troops are cared for 24 7 they are  fighting overseas When they come home  they ought to be given 24 7  by all of us They haven t done that yet  This administration has put a tremendous tax on our servicemen  and women on top of asking them to go overseas and that is taking them  away from their families and their training and the support they need  here at home  This is an incredibly important issue All of us who supported  this amendment are going to keep working  because certainly we owe the  men and women who serve us a lot more than lip service We owe them  not standing behind procedural moves and motions in the United States  Senate and we owe them a country that backs them and we are going to  keep fighting  We do have a number of members of the Senate here Joining me in  the leadership is Senator Durbin I want to turn it over to him and  then to other members of our caucus who would like to speak  Following Senator Durbin  we will have Senator    OK  Chuck  why don t you speak and then Senator Durbin  HAGEL I m part of the endangered species here Well  nice to  be with you Thank you  I ve always had a high regard for Barbara Mikulski Thank you  for allowing me an opportunity to say something about this amendment   I  too  add my thanks to Jim Webb for his leadership  I don t know of an issue more important to a free society that we  pay more attention to than the preciousness of our people When we  ask our men and women to serve this country and particularly those who  wear the uniform of this nation to carry all the burden  make all the  sacrifices  and then we do not respond in a responsible way to their  needs  that s wrong  And I was part of the debate on this  listened carefully to all  the points of view  and I was struck by the fact that somehow the  Congress does not have a role to play on matters of war and peace   Constitutionally  of course  that s incorrect  But I don t know of a higher priority or responsibility that the  Congress has than the welfare of those we represent and it is not a  mutually exclusive responsibility We all have a responsibility We  have responsibility for the policy that we help develop and that  policy should always be as good as the sacrifices of the men and women  and their families It should be worthy of those sacrifices  But this was not about policy This was about the right thing to  do in regard to our men and women who we ask to defend this country   And if we can t get that right  then I don t know what we can get  right And if we can t do this in an honest  direct way  then we re  going to have to go back and reevaluate everything  So I think that not only was this a correct and responsible  course of action and I was very pleased that I had a number of my  Republican colleagues join me on this  but we will be back and I will  be introducing later today  with a number of the people up here and  with Republican colleagues  another similar amendment that Jim Webb  and I introduced a couple of months ago  So to the colleagues with me here and my Republican colleagues  who put an appropriate focus on our people  I thank them I think the  American people do  And the last point I would make  when you have veteran  organizations  military institutions like the U S  Officers  Association  strongly in support of this  this tells you something   This is not about politics  ladies and gentlemen This is about doing  the right thing for the men and women that we ask to serve our  country  Thank you very much  DURBIN I want to thank Jim Webb and Chuck Hagel Jim called me  six weeks ago and said that he had been working on this amendment and  wanted to offer it and the leadership felt that this was the most  important amendment to offer first in this debate on the defense  authorization bill  What just happened on the floor of the Senate is wrong It was  wrong that the Webb Hagel amendment did not pass It was wrong that  we didn t come to the aid of our warriors who are fatigued and  exhausted by the redeployment after redeployment  It was wrong that we didn t stand by the military families who  sit at home in anticipation  prayerful anticipation of the next phone  call  the next e mail It was wrong that so many members of the  Senate who boast about supporting our troops wouldn t stand for our  troops when the Webb Hagel amendment gave us a chance  But it was also wrong that the Republican leadership decided to  put a procedural hurdle in our way For the last two years  we have  not had a single amendment offered on the defense authorization bill  related to the defense authorization bill that has required a 60 vote  margin  But Senator McConnell yesterday decided it would be a 60 vote  threshold  making it more difficult to pass any amendment  let alone  one that might be controversial The only exception in the last two  years was an amendment related to minimum wage on the defense  authorization bill  an unrelated issue  where  by unanimous consent   we agreed to 60 votes  For those who are trying to follow all this arcane procedural  description  let me make it simple Mitch McConnell realized  yesterday he couldn t win an up or down vote on the Webb Hagel  amendment and so he used his advantage under the Senate rules to  require this majority of 60  which we couldn t reach We had 56 I  think we can reach 60  I hope those who care for the military families and members of  those military families will reach out to the Senators who did not  support us  ask us to remember their heroes  their warriors who should  be home resting and retraining and preparing for their next round of  battle  We re going to have another chance I hope that it s during the  debate on this bill And I thank Senators Webb and Hagel for their  leadership  STABENOW Today  a little bit earlier  Senator Reid and I joined  a group of military families and veterans  a mom who lost her son in  the war from Baltimore They all asked us to join together to support  this amendment and the majority of the Senate heard that today  56  members  This is not about whether or not this amendment can pass or did  pass under the normal rules of the Senate It s about whether or not  the Senate Republican leadership is going to continue to use the rules  to block what is the will of the majority of Americans and today  on  this amendment  the majority of the Senators  Tonight there ll be 1 644 members of the Michigan National Guard  in Iraq  going to bed after a very long  hard day Many of them have  been deployed two times  three times  and too many for a fourth time  now And each one of them has a family at home worrying about what s  going to happen  asking us to act  This is about readiness It s about giving them the downtime  they need It s about families It s about putting our troops first  who have given us the most in this war and we re going to continue  until our troops and the American people are finally heard about what  is happening  MIKULSKI I never thought that there would be a day in the  United States Senate where I would be muzzled from speaking out and  being able to vote on support for our troops  I never thought there would be a day in the United States Senate  where a vote to support our troops would be bogged down in  parliamentary entanglements  I never thought there would be a day when partisan politics would  be so intense and prickly that the other party threw sand in the gears  so that we could vote for a sensible amendment dealing with troop  rotation offered by two combat veterans  Chuck Hagel and Jim Webb   Two combat veterans who know the stresses of war offered a sensible  one for troop rotation  dealing with troop exhaustion and family  fatigue  This is what this amendment was about    the opportunity to  provide a rotation schedule that would enable our troops to come back  home  to rest  to refresh and to retrain to answer the call of duty  But  oh  no  we ve got to play politics We ve got to talk about  micromanagement We have to get bogged down in constitutional  debates  Every day I check the temperature in Baghdad It was 115 degrees  yesterday Every day I check it because I try to envision what our  troops are up against In all of that heat  with 100 pounds of body  armor  patrolling the streets of Baghdad and being in Afghanistan and  various other provinces  and I think about them and I think about the  stresses they re under  being shot at  facing IEDs  And I think of their spouses  I think of their mothers who are  trying to cope with all that family stress  who are in acute traumatic  stress And I think about their children who  every time the news  goes on and there s a bomb that goes off  they wonder if it s daddy or  mommy  But  oh  no  we have to have 60 votes to come up with dealing  with that Well  I say to our people if they think the temperature s  hot in Baghdad  the temperature is rising here on the United States  Senate floor  Our men and women are fighting for majority rule Why don t we  give it to the Senate so that we can move ahead with dealing with this  defense authorization Let s deal with troop exhaustion Let s deal  with family fatigue and let s deal with the fact that people really  want to support our troops  This is the ultimate support our troop amendment  BOXER Barbara  I think you spoke so eloquently that all I  have is a one minute line to add here  Let s talk turkey about what just happened on the Senate floor   Except for a handful of Republicans  except for a handful  the  Republicans in the United States Senate are desperately clinging to  the status quo and this time they have gone too far  This bipartisan amendment  which said to America  We stand by  our troops  we love our troops  we re going to make sure that they re  rested and ready  was brought down because of politics  because of an  administration that gave the orders to the loyal followers  The American people want some independent thinking here in the  United States Senate  I want to thank Senators Webb and Hagel for their patriotism and  for their leadership  LINCOLN Well  I  too  want to add my thanks to Senator Webb  and Senator Hagel The courageous devotion of our men and women in  uniform is something that we all here  I think  think of every day  I think Senator Mikulski did a tremendous job in trying to  portray to you and to our constituents how we feel Would you send  your children to a playground with faulty equipment Wouldn t you do  everything you could to prepare them for the test that they had before  them  We are here to say that  yes  we re going to fight hard for all  of what government can do  the needs that they have  the financial  needs  whether it s health care needs  mental health care needs   equipment and everything But what we want to say is these troops  deserve the nurturing of their families  the rest and relaxation that  only comes from being able to come home and to cry on the shoulder of  a mother or a wife or a father  And we ve heard it from  again  as Senator Mikulski said  two  veterans  Senator Webb and Senator Hagel  who know from their own  experiences This was a no brainer and it was an insult    an insult  for this to have been played in the political way that it was played  I hope we ll come back at it again and I hope that the American  people will help us make sure that those men and women who are in  uniform and giving so courageously  that we can do all that we can to  bring them home and not just that their American family can embrace  them  but they can come home and be nurtured by their families and  with the time that they need to rebuild and to refresh and retrain  So I appreciate what they ve done and the leadership of everyone  here  LAUTENBERG  I want to salute Jim Webb and Chuck Hagel for their  comprehensiveness and their understanding of what it s like to be in  the military and what it s like to be away from home  what it s like  to be in harm s way  And there was a film on TV the other night describing the  equipment shortages and how things are wearing out and how they  indicated our troops are wearing out They re fatigued They need  rejuvenation They need family reunification And it is a humane way  to treat our troops  to show them that we really do care about them   other than politic speak  And so this is going to keep coming back and the result today was  very interesting to me Seven of our Republican friends voted with us  and the rest were left squirming  BROWN This is the most disappointing vote in my first six  months in the United States Senate The president and almost three   fourths of Republican Senators have again betrayed our soldiers and  our Marines and our veterans  It started back in 2003 when Senator Menendez were in the House  voting against the war  but were in the House fighting for body armor  for our troops The administration and Republican leaders didn t get  proper body armor to our troops then They re not taking care of  returning soldiers and Marines now They ve not taken care of  veterans in our hospitals  in veterans health care in our communities  We re all going to keep fighting We all appreciate the  leadership of Senator Webb and Senator Hagel This has just begun   We re going to change this policy  MENENDEZ Let me just say since I arrived here in the Senate  about a year and a half ago  I have heard the refrain time and time  again  Support our troops Don t undermine them Support our  troops  And the essence of the vote today was a vote to support our  troops That was what the vote was all about And to preserve the  very essence of our security  And today a Republican minority stopped the will of a majority of  the United States Senate and  by virtue of that  a majority of the  people of the United States who are living through the process through  their families and neighbors of understanding the enormous wear and  tear on the lives of the individuals who we call upon to protect the  nation  Never have so few been asked to do so much And Senator Webb and  Senator Hagel s amendment  two combat decorated veterans who  understand fully the full atmosphere and conditions of war and  understand the wear and tear on our men and women  and  in Senator  Webb s case  on his son  who has served valiantly and continues to  serve  understands fully that this is about the very essence of being  able to preserve our security  of being able to continue to enlist  people in the service of their country and to not grind this military  into the ground  So at a time in which we hear so much about support our troops   this was the opportunity to do so and it should have been more We  appreciate the  I believe  seven or so Republican votes that were  cast  but it should have been more than those seven members of the  Senate on the Republican side  who happen to be running for  reelection It should have been an overwhelming majority  far beyond  the 60 votes even needed to end the filibuster  should have joined in  support of the troops  You know  supporting the troops is more than marching on Memorial  Day or going to a Veterans  Day observance It s how we take care of  them in their health care It s how we take care of them in their  disabilities  how we take care of their families  for those who commit  the ultimate sacrifice  and for the enlisted personnel serving across  the globe  it is about how we take care of them in their ability to be  able to perform on behalf of the nation and how we ll be able to  sustain their families  That s what Senator Webb s amendment was all about and to have  used the procedural vote to stop that opportunity  to stand up for the  troops  I think is the height of hypocrisy  And I want to salute Senator Webb I believe that if Americans  speak out overwhelmingly  we will have another opportunity to bring  this amendment back up again and that hopefully some will see the  light as they get the heat back at home across the landscape of the  country  TESTER First of all  Jim  thank you very much I can just  tell you I ve been here for a little over six months This is an  outrage  The fact that 56 Senators voted for this bill  voted for this  amendment and the fact that it gets hung up in procedure is not why  there s 100 Senators in the U S  Senate doing the work that they need  to do And  quite honestly  it seems like when we come to important  issues  where a majority of the Senators  and there s probably no more  important issue than the Iraq war right now and troop readiness in  that regard  and we get hung up with procedure because they want to  delay the process  The truth is    and I don t want to put words in Senator Webb s  mouth or Chuck Hagel s mouth  but the president s mismanaged this war  from the beginning and this amendment wouldn t have been here if troop  readiness would have been considered from the commander in chief of  this country  As I said before  this is an outrage It s ridiculous It s  common sense It should have been allowed to pass  which is what the  majority of the people in the Senate wanted to have happen  Thanks  Jim  WEBB Appreciate all of those comments And just as a quick  recap  and I ll take your questions  this was  on one level  a humane  issue  an issue of military families  which has been well addressed by  a number of people  It s also a leadership issue in terms of how the senior  leadership would be willing to step up  senior military leadership  would be willing to step up and defend the wellbeing of their troops  in an environment where this occupation has gone on for so long  and  it s also a practical issue in terms of how the military is being  used  As I said on the floor  I spent three years as an assistant  secretary of defense working on these manpower issues  working on  mobilization  and we ve reached the point where we just can t keep  doing this  And if we were simply wanting to be obstructionist or  mischievous  we would have gone for the ideal  which is a two to one  rotational cycle  in which the commandant of the Marine Corps himself  said earlier this year he would like to see  We were trying to create a minimum floor that would address the  wellbeing of our troops while  at the same time  we are sorting out  the missions that they re performing  With that  I ll take your questions  QUESTION  OFF MIKE  WEBB The surge is one of a whole series of operational  scenarios that have been attempted during this four year occupation   You know  clearly  if we want to be precise  in traditional terms   this war ended four years ago and we have had a very difficult  occupation  as a number of people  including myself  have been  attempting to get a diplomatic solution in place so we can remove our  troops  So to focus on the surge is not to focus on the reality of what s  been happening in Iraq and what I ve said again and again  and I ve  said it to the secretary of the Army and the deputy secretary of  defense and others  is that we have reached a point after four years  where the operational policies in Iraq have to take into account the  availability of the troops You can t keep doing this the other way  around  QUESTION  OFF MIKE  MURRAY I can t speak to what action will happen in the House   but I can tell you  here in the Senate  we have really focused on  troops and support for troops in terms of making sure that they have  the equipment  supplies  everything they need to do what s been asked  of them  whether or not we supported this war to begin with  And the Webb amendment today was part of a very long term effort  to make sure that the men and women who serve us are adequately  prepared  trained and supported when they come home  Later this afternoon  we will likely take up another amendment on  this bill  the wounded warriors amendment  that is a result of our VA  Committee and our Armed Services Committee coming together to deal  with the gaps that our soldiers between when they are in the service  and separated and going to the VA in terms of not having systems that  talk to each other  too many people being left in medical hold  and  really addressing strongly that troop support and veteran support  issue that we have  This is not going to stop us from continuing our work to make  sure that we take care of the men and women who serve us But it is  deeply disappointing that the Senate Republicans today hid behind a  procedural move that would have allowed us to make sure those men and  women are supported  QUESTION  OFF MIKE  MURRAY Look  I think where the pressure is in this country is  from the thousands of families across this country who daily face the  issue of their spouse or their father or one of their kids who are off  at war and who are here and seeing personally the impact on them and  their families  And we are going to continue  every one of us who go home every  weekend  as I do  to see those families and the tears in their eyes  and asking us to please be there to truly support them  and I think  that national pressure is going to continue to stay on the Senate and  hopefully be able to lead us to a 60 vote margin on this amendment and  on others  QUESTION  OFF MIKE  WEBB Senator Hagel and I introduced a broader amendment during  the supplemental appropriations bill that took into account actual  troop rotation cycles and these sorts of things  Just to emphasize  what I attempted to do in this amendment today  was to strip things down to the most crucial issue for troop  wellbeing  to try to get a vote on one clear issue that really is  standing out  It s almost unheard of for an amendment like this to get the  overt support of groups like the Military Officers of America  368 000  military officers of all different services stepping forward and  saying  We need to do this as an issue of stewardship or the  leadership of the United States government towards the people  So this issue  the one that was before us today  should not have  been dealt with politically at all You could address this issue  without even having to get into the right or the wrong of the Iraq war  or whether we want to be there for seven more weeks or seven more  years  It s simply how do you take care of your troops in rotational  cycles that have now been going on for four years  I can take one more question and then we have to wrap this up   Yes  sir  QUESTION  OFF MIKE  WEBB As I understand  he was talking about a gut instinct and I  would hope that someone who s a director of homeland security would  have something else to offer us if he s going to be talking like that  Thank you very much  END
