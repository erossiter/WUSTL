   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 10  2007 WEBB FAULTS REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTER OF AMENDMENT TO SUPPORT TROOPS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mr  President  I first express my thanks to the Senator from Delaware for his service and also for his comments on this amendment  I come to the floor because I heard that the other side of the aisle may be deciding to filibuster this amendment  I would  first of all  like to express my vice that this filibuster might occur which  as the chair knows  would increase the requirement of the vote to 60 votes in order for the amendment to proceed  This is a very simple and a very fair amendment  I would like to express my opinions about some of the comments that have been made just as I was outside listening to different people from the media telling me what some of the reservations from the other side have been on this amendment  They are not accurate    There are people saying this amendment is unconstitutional in the sense that only the Commander in Chief should be able to make decisions regarding the deployments of troops during war  First of all  Article one  Section 8 is very clear on this points of our Constitution  It states that the congress has the power to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces  This is well within the Constitution  In fact  there is much precedent when people who are opposed to this amendment discuss that it might be tying the Presidents hands unnecessarily  we can go back to the dark days of the Korean War where  because of the national emergency that was caused from the invasion of Sought Korea by the north we didnt have enough troops available and the administration at the time started sending soldiers into Korea who had not been fully trained and the congress acted within its constitutional purview  It passed a law that said no individual who is brought into the United States Military can be sent overseas unless they have been in the military for 120 days  The reason that the congress acted was to protect the well being of those who served    Thats exactly what we are proposing to do today  We are saying that whatever your beliefs are about this war  whether you want it to end in five weeks or whether you want it to go on for the next ten years   we have to come to some common agreement among the leadership of the United States that we are going to protect the well being of our troops  of the people who step forward to serve in these times   The minimum we can do is set a floor that basically says however long you are deployed you can have that much time back at home  Or if you are in the National Guard and Reserve if youve been deployed  you deserve to have three times that much time at home  The standard  the historical standard is if youve been deployed overseas or if youve been deployed on a deployment you should have twice as much time at home  The commandant of the marine corps  early this year when he undertook the duties of being commandant  said his goal was to bring in a two to one rotational cycle  given the requirements of Iraq   We are now one to one with a good portion of that time at home being spent in work ups to go back for these units and for these individuals  The army  as a result of this surge  now has a policy where they are saying  you go to Iraq for 15 months and well guarantee you 12 months at home  That is not even one to one  Our amendment establishes a floor it is reasonable  It doesnt have anything to do with political objectives of the war downstream  That can be sorted out later   We are simply saying  if youve been gone for a year you deserve to be back for a year  If youve been gone fore seven months  you deserve to be back for seven months  Unless you want to go back  If you want to go back  fine  you can volunteer to go back  Our amendment doesnt stop that    Or if theres a national emergency  an operational emergency where the president certifies that as a requirement  then the president can waive this  Were trying to set a policy of stability so that military families can predict what their cycle is going to be and have enough time to truly become involved with our families again  have some downtime  and then refurbish and retrain and go back    I would suggest to the other side that if they really believe that this is an amendment that is incompatible with military service they might want to consider a letter that I received today from the Military Officers Association of America  This is the largest and most influential association of Military officers in the country  It is composed of 368 000 members from every branch of the military    They wrote me today  Ill read portions of this letter  On behalf of the 368 000 members of the Military Officers Association  I am writing to express our support for your amendment  The MOAA is very concerned that steps must be taken to protect the most precious military asset  all volunteer force  for having to bear such a disproportionate share of wartime sacrifice  If we are not better stewards of our troops  this is the president of the MOAA  Vice Admiral Ryan  United States Navy Retired  saying this if we are not better stewards of our troops and their families in the future than we have been in the recent past  we believe strongly we will be putting the all volunteer force at unacceptable risk  I would submit to the President and this body that this is not the kind of a statement that would be made from a group of 368 000 military officers unless they believed in the constitutionality and the propriety of what we are attempting to do   I would like to say to my colleagues and particularly to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I am very disappointed in the notion that an amendment with this simplicity that goes to the well being of our troops might even be considered as a filibuster  I would like to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the American people are watching us today and theyre watching closely with the expectation that we finally can take some sort of positive action that might stabilize the operational environment in which our troops are being sent again and again   The American people are tired of the posturing that is giving the Congress such a bad reputation  Theyre tired of the procedural strategies designed to protect politicians from accountability and to protect this administration from judgment     The question on this amendment is not whether one supports the war or whether they do not  Its not whether someone wants to wait until mid July or September to see whether one particular set of benchmarks or summary might be taking us  The question is simply this  More than four years into the ground operations in Iraq  we owe stability and a reasonable cycle of deployment to the men and women who are carrying our nations burdens  Thats the question    Senator Durbin asks Sen  Webb to yield   The senator gladly yields to the Majority Whip    Senator Durbin asks question   First  I would say to the Senator from Illinois that just for factual clarification  Senator Hagel and I are the only two ground combat veterans from Vietnam in the Senate  but I certainly would not want to in any way reduce my respect for the distinguished senator from Hawaii  who won the Congressional Medal of Honor during World War II  But the question you pose is correct  What this basically says is if you have been gone for a year  you deserve to have a minimum of a year back  And a lot of people misunderstand what dwell time is  Dwell time is not down time  Theres a work up cycle for these units before they go back which is considerable  So even if were giving them a one to one ratio here  this is not an equal time down as compared to an equal time deployed  Thats why the traditional goal is two for one    Durbin asks question again   I would say first to the Senator that I had the privilege of being the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs for three years  where we had oversight of the National Guard and Reserve programs during a very critical time when we were transitioning into what we call the total force concept  The present use of the Guard and Reserve is certainly something we were not contemplating in the 1980s  This amendment sets a floor for the Guard and Reserve of a three to one ration with a written goal in the amendment of a five to one ratio  which is the traditional standard
