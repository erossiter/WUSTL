   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   May 5  2007 ADDRESS OF SENATOR JIM WEBB  2007 RADFORD UNIVERSITY COMMENCEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Below is the address delivered by Senator Jim Webb to graduates at Radford University s commencement on Saturday  May 5th        I am grateful for the opportunity to share in this important milestone in your lives        I got my first call about being your commencement speaker late last year from Mary Ann Hovis  who is a member of your Board of Visitors   Mary Ann and her husband Bob are good friends  and huge boosters of Radford University   And if there is one thing I have learned over the past year or so  it s that Mary Ann always knows the right place for me to be   So thank you Mary Ann   And here I am          Today is a day for families and friends  for shared memories of good times here on campus and for that feeling that comes from accomplishing something truly special        Today  you are all winners  and I congratulate you        There is another winner in our midst as well   Earlier this year  Dr  Donna Boyd  a professor of anthropology here at Radford University was named United States Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation s Council for the Advancement of Teaching   This is a great distinction not only for Donna Boyd  but also for the entire Radford University community   In the 26 year history of this prestigious award  this is only the fourth time a Virginian has been recognized        If Dr  Boyd would please stand  I hope you ll all join me in congratulating her for this honor         I also want to say a special word at the outset of my remarks about all the parents who are here with us   I m sure that those of you who are graduating know what a very special time this is for your parents   They have worked long and hard  and sacrificed much to bring you to this point   When you remember this day  remember them   And I know that you will never take their love and support for granted        It s also a time for grandparents   Do we have grandparents here   I was very close to my grandmother   I was also her first grandchild to finish college   She was from east Arkansas but at that time was living in California near one of my aunts   My Dad flew her out this way for the graduation   It was the first time she had ever been inside an airplane   She talked about it the whole time she was here   And then after I graduated  she decided to take the bus back  all the way to California                           Graduation ceremonies are conducted amid a sea of deep emotions   Many of you are sad to be leaving and apprehensive about the future   That s natural   Others have your cars already packed and loaded  and can t wait to get home  or off to your future endeavors   Some parents are excited   Some others are probably sobered by the notion that the sweet  energetic kid they sent away to Radford four years ago is now a young man or woman filled with ideas  independence and attitude   who is moving back home  into what they thought was an empty nest        Commencement speakers are asked to wade into these conflicting emotions and share a few lasting pearls of wisdom and advice   It is a difficult task   Winston Churchill s advice for public speakers is particularly fitting for me today   Churchill always counseled people to  Be Clear     Be Concise     and Be Seated    I will try to follow that advice today        But at the same time  I don t want to let this day pass without a few sincere and heartfelt pieces of advice        Most important perhaps  I hope you ll never forget this special corner of Virginia  As Highlanders you have no doubt come to appreciate the mountains and the valleys   and also the people   of Southwest Virginia          This is perhaps the most pristine and beautiful part of the Commonwealth   What is less obvious to many on the outside is the rich culture and deep values that characterize Southwest Virginia and her people        My family roots are deep and wide in Southwest Virginia  and I have spent a good bit of time down here over the course of my life   Before I ever decided even to run for the Senate  I wrote about this region and its importance to our American heritage in my book Born Fighting   I am very gratified to say that the writer Tom Wolfe called this book the most important ethnography in recent American history        The dominant culture among the pioneers who settled these mountains were the Scots Irish  who had made their way down the Great Wagon Trail that stretched from Lancaster Pennsylvania to northern Georgia and Alabama   They were fiercely independent people who brought with them  along with their strong religious tradition  their bags of seed  their rifles  and perhaps a cow or two  the basic principles that resulted in the creation of what we now call American style populist democracy   For more than 270 years they have fought our nation s wars  grown its food  hauled its goods in wagons and then in trucks  worked its factories   And wherever they have gone  they have brought with them a dislike of elitism and aristocracy  and a deep respect for the law         These values survive today in Southwest Virginia        Three weeks ago  when the eyes of the world were drawn to the horrible events at Virginia Tech  they were on full display        We saw them in the courage and humanity of the first responders   We saw them in the way the people of Blacksburg  and Montgomery County comforted students     housed strangers     and cared for the grieving        And we saw these Southwest Virginia values right here on the campus of Radford University in the way you reached out to Virginia Tech        President Kyle  on behalf of our entire state  I want to thank you  and this university community for all you did to help Virginia Tech and its students during last month s tragedy         As you leave this campus today and for some of you  the region you ve called home for at least four years   I m fully confident that you will bring with you  wherever you may go  the real values that have always characterized Southwest Virginia  love of country  an abiding faith  a sense of service  and a determination to work hard        And I personally hope that you will embrace another value as well   In the scriptures we are told   For unto whomsoever much is given  much shall be required    Our country  and indeed our world community  needs you to follow this simple idea now more than ever        All of you are fortunate to be graduating from a fine state university  in the greatest nation on earth   It is an opportunity that only a handful of people really have   Never forget that        With the degrees you have earned today  you will have the flexibility to enter a wide range of exciting careers   And if statistics are any guide  you will probably earn a whole lot more money over your lifetime than those who are your exact same age who don t earn a degree        By your study  you have earned these potential advantages   But as with all of us who have been blessed with such opportunities  it is important to remember that with opportunity and advantage comes responsibility   Whatever happens in your lives  please make yourselves a promise   that you will always find a way to give something back   through service to your families  to your community  and to your country                          Finally  I can t leave this podium without raising an issue that was a principal theme in my campaign last year  and will continue to be a strong focus of my time in the Senate   And that issue is economic fairness         There are few challenges confronting this nation that are more serious or urgent than the growing sense of unfairness that hangs over our economic affairs   When one looks at the health of our economy  it s almost as if we are living in two different countries         When I graduated college  the average corporate CEO made 20 times what the average worker did   Today  that CEO makes nearly 400 times what the average worker makes   That s not right  ladies and gentlemen   It goes against the notion of who we are as a people       We all want our economy to prosper   But we also want everyone to share in that prosperity   Right now the stock market is at an all time high   Corporate profits continue to soar  and are at the highest percentage of our national wealth in recorded history   But at the same time  wages and salaries for our workers are at all time lows as a percentage of national wealth  even though the productivity of those workers is the highest in the world        Medical costs have skyrocketed  and more and more of our people  particularly in American rural communities live in sub standard housing        Our manufacturing base  once the backbone of communities in places like Radford  Martinsville and Pulaski Counties is in many cases being dismantled and shipped overseas   All over the nation  the story is the same        In the early days of our republic  President Andrew Jackson   the first President of Scots Irish descent   established an important principle of American style democracy   that we should measure the health of our society not at its apex  but at its base   Not with the numbers that come out of Wall Street  but with the living conditions that exist on Main Street        As members of the Radford University Class of 2007 find their own unique place in the world  and discover their own way to serve  I would urge you to do everything in your power to recapture the spirit of Andrew Jackson s words        We can reverse this trend   We need to develop alternative economies to take the place of industries that have slowed or dried up in the age of globalization   We need to ensure that our trade laws are fair and that they safeguard the interests of American workers  And we also need tax incentives that bring our jobs back home and keep other good jobs from going overseas        The generations that went before us achieved some remarkable things   They populated a wilderness  created a country  gave us American style democracy  won World War II  and prevailed in the Cold War   They grew our economy until it was the world s largest   They ended racial discrimination        Your generation s legacy   no smaller a task   should be that you restored basic fairness to the economic affairs of our nation that you fought against the emergence of a class system in our precious democracy and that you rejected the greed that today is all to common in the boardrooms of America s corporations         I appreciate having been able to share this special day with you  and I wish all of you the very best in what I know will be an exciting future  for each of you individually and for our country          Thank you   And God bless you all
