VA   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Robert Byrd  D WV  and  Evan Bayh  D IN  today called for a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing  to focus on Department of Defense planning for the redeployment of  U S  forces from Iraq   The hearing would require Administration officials to testify on the status of  this planning and solicit the views of outside experts who have experience in  the redeployment of large numbers of troops  If necessary  portions of the  hearing could be held in closed session    The joint request to Senator Carl Levin  the chairman of  the Senate Committee on Armed Services  was sparked by a resoponse from Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman to Senator Clintons request to the  Secretary of Defense for a briefing on withdrawal planning to appropriate  congressional oversight committees  In his reply on behalf of Secretary Robert  M  Gates  Edelman asserted that premature and public discussion of the  withdrawal of U S  forces  from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda      Senator Webb noted that  contrary to Edelmans  assertion  there have been bipartisan calls for the Department of Defense to  begin redeployment planning and to brief Congress on its status  The importance  of holding this hearing was underscored this month when Senators Warner and  Lugar introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling  for the Administration to present its redeployment plan to Congress by October  16  2007  Webb said   In their letter to Chairman Levin  the senators wrote   The need for the Committee to know the status of Department of Defense  redeployment planning is clear  yet past efforts by individual members to obtain  this information were rebuffed   They went on to say     the roots of the many problems  facing our men and women serving in Iraq were planted by the failure of  this Administration to develop sound  realistic plans  We cannot afford to  repeat the same mistake when our forces redeploy  Congressional oversight will  help to ensure that redeployment plans properly address the numerous challenges  that our troops will face  including the resources and the diplomatic support  required to ensure that any redeployment is safe and  orderly   Senator Clintons May letter to Secretary Gates  the  response from Under Secretary Edelman  and the resulting letter to

Committee on Armed Services United  States Senate R228 Washington  D C  20510  Dear Chairman Levin   We write to request that the Senate Committee on Armed  Services hold a hearing on Department of Defense contingency planning for the  redeployment of United States  military forces from Iraq  Such a hearing could solicit  the views of outside experts who have experience in the redeployment of large  numbers of troops as well as administration witnesses  If necessary  portions  of the hearing could be held in closed session   The importance of holding this hearing was underscored  this month when Senators Warner and Lugar introduced an amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act calling for the Administration to present its  redeployment plan to Congress by October 16  2007  As they noted  the safety  and security of our military forces  as well as our nations credibility in the  region  require that any military withdrawal or redeployment from Iraq be  carefully planned and executed  A poorly planned withdrawal would compound the  risks to our forces  coalition partners  and the government of Iraq   The need for the Committee to know the status of  Department of Defense redeployment planning is clear  yet past efforts by  individual members to obtain this information were rebuffed  Following reports  that the Pentagon was not engaging in detailed planning while the Iraqi Defense  Ministry was preparing its own plans in the event that the United States and its  forces departed Iraq quickly  the Secretary of Defense was requested in May to  provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress with briefings on the  current status of contingency planning for the withdrawal of U S   forces   Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman  responded to this request on Secretary Gates behalf on July 16  A copy of his  letter and other correspondence relating to this matter are enclosed for your  reference  As you will see  Under Secretary Edelman raised spurious arguments  to avoid discussing contingency planning and claimed that premature discussion  of the withdrawal of U S   forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda   His assertion that necessary congressional oversight emboldens our enemies is  outrageous   As you are aware  the roots of the many problems facing  our men and women serving in Iraq were planted by the failure of  this Administration to develop sound  realistic plans  We cannot afford to  repeat the same mistake when our forces redeploy  Congressional oversight will  help to ensure that redeployment plans properly address the numerous challenges  that our troops will face  including the resources and the diplomatic support  required to ensure that any redeployment is safe and  orderly   Thank you for considering this  request   Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton   Robert C  Byrd Evan Bayh  Jim Webb  CC   The Honorable John McCain Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services
