                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Jim Webb  D VA  today chaired a Joint Economic Committee  JEC  hearing  to explore the steep increase in the U S  prison population and the social  and economic consequences of incarceration A solution needs to be  reached that is both responsive to our needs for law and order  and fairer to  those ensnared by this system  said Webb  who requested the hearing of both  House and Senate members    The hearing entitled Mass Incarceration in the United States  At What  Cost  hosted a number of experts in the field who discussed the  reasons behind this growth in the prison population  whether it correlates with  decreases in crime  the economic costs of maintaining the prison system  the  long term labor market and social costs of mass incarceration  and policy  solutions that can alleviate this crisis while maintaining public  safety   The United States has the highest  reported incarceration rate in the world  The United  States has five percent of the worlds population   though it holds twenty five percent of the  worlds prison population  Although crime rates have decreased since 1991  the rate of  imprisonment has increased by more than 50  since that  time   Americas incarceration rate raises  several serious questions  said Senator Webb  The steep increase of people in  prison is driven  according to most experts  by changes in drug policy and  tougher sentencing  and not necessarily an increase in crime  I believe that  these disparities in the prison system today call for an examination of how  these policies affect our society as a whole   Growth in the prison population is due to changing  policy  not increased crime  the composition of prison admissions has  increasingly shifted toward less serious offenses  In 2005  four out of five  drug arrests were for possession while one out of five were for drug sales  The  crime history for three quarters of drug offenders in state prisons involved  non violent or drug offenses   Webb continues  We want to keep bad people off our  streets  We want to break the back of gangs  and we want to cut down on violent  behavior  But theres something else going on when were locking up such a high  percentage of our people  marking them at an early age and in many cases  eliminating their chances for a productive life as full citizens  It will take  years of energy to address these problems But  I am committed to continuing a  national dialogue on this issue and working toward meaningful and workable  solutions    Incarceration is now being use in  the United States on an  unprecedented scale  said Dr  Glenn Loury at  Economics and Social Sciences Professor  Brown University  one of the testifying witnesses  This  high level of imprisonment is not any longer  if ever it was  a rational  response to high levels of crime  Rather  our mass incarceration policy is an  historical inheritance  bequeathed to us by wave after wave of crime fighting at  the state and federal levels over the past 35 years  This policy response  I  firmly believe  has now become counterproductive   The United  States faces enormous problems of offender  reentry and recidivism  The number of ex offenders reentering their communities  from state and federal prisons increased fourfold in the past two  decades  On average   two out of three released prisoners will be  arrested and one in two will return to  prison within three years of  release   It is my opinion that funding for  re entry programs as well as job placement  case management and follow up should  be made available in order to help prevent recidivism  strengthen families  and  promote healthy communities through the concept of investing in our human  infrastructure  said Alphonso Albert  Executive  Director of Second Chances program sponsored by the city of Norfolk    These effects of incarceration on  individual economic status are not new  but they are now playing out on a novel  scale  said Dr  Bruce Western  Director Inequality  and Social Policy Program at Harvard University  Because returning prisoners  are highly concentrated in poor urban neighborhoods  the economic penalties of  incarceration now permeate the most economically vulnerable families and  communities    In 2006  states spent an estimated  2 billion on prison  construction  three times the amount they were spending fifteen years earlier   The combined expenditures of local governments  state governments  and the  federal government for law enforcement and corrections total over  200 billion  annually  The nations incarceration rate has significant  costs associated with the productivity of both prisoners and ex offenders  The  economic output of prisoners is mostly lost to society while they are  imprisoned  Negative productivity effects continue after release  This wage  penalty grows with time  as previous imprisonment can reduce the wage growth of  young men by some 30 percent     Hundreds of thousands of people  leave prison annually with no right to vote  no access to public housing  hugely  limited abilities to find employment and high levels of drug use and mental  illness  said Michael Jacobson  Executive Director  of the Vera Institute for Justice  These unintended consequences of  incarceration ripple through families and communities as those returning home  are overwhelmed by seemingly intractable obstacles  Not surprisingly  many  people wind up returning to prison in astounding numbers  further draining  scarce resource that could be made available to deal with some of these  obstacles themselves   As a state legislator I made the mistake of thinking  that locking people up made our communities safer  said Pat Nolan  Vice  President of the Prison Fellowship program in Reston  Virginia  Only when I was in prison did I  realize that most inmates will be released someday  and locking so many of our  people in prison while doing nothing to prepare them for their release is very  dangerous    ADDITIONAL  RESOURCES  To read Senator  Webbs opening statement  visit      To hear the audio  of todays full JEC hearing  visit      For a fact sheet  on the prison system in the
