   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 14  2007 Statement by Senator Webb on Warner s Outer Continental Shelf Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Warners amendment would have authorized  exploration and geologic tests on the Outer Continental Shelf to determine if it  is appropriate for natural gas development  The Warner amendment represented a  first step only in a two step process  Before any drilling could occur under  Senator Warners amendment  the Virginia General Assembly  the Governor  and the  United  States Secretary of the Interior would have to  concur that drilling is indeed in the state and national interest  and that our  coastal resources can be adequately protected  The amendment also included a  provision to ensure that exploration and extraction activities do not interfere  with military activities that occur off of Virginias coast that are critical to our  nations defense  I believe these safeguards are  appropriate   It is noteworthy that in 2007  the Virginia General  Assembly passed  and the Governor signed  legislation that signals the  Commonwealths clear willingness to participate in a program for OCS  development  Their action shows that Virginia recognizes the potential for  responsible OCS development off our coasts  The amendment that the Senate voted  on today is entirely consistent with the earlier action by the General  Assembly   Given high gas prices and the nations continuing  dependence on foreign sources of energy  it is imperative that we explore  domestic sources of energy and combine those efforts with strong conservation  and environmental protection measures  This is what Senator Warners amendment  attempted to do  Its no longer responsible to talk about energy independence  while saying NO to even the most preliminary steps toward exploration and  development of our domestic energy sources
