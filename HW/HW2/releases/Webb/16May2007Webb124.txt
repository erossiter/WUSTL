the following letter to the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Aviation Operations  Safety and Security expressing his concerns over amendments to the  Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2007  that could be harmful to Reagan National Airport        May 16  2007      Senator Jay Rockefeller  Chairman  Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee   on Aviation Operations  Safety and Security  SD 508  Washington DC  20510      Dear Chairman Rockefeller       It is my understanding that tomorrow the Senate Commerce Committee will meet to consider S  1300  the  Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2007    I am deeply troubled by several potential amendments that could harm Reagan National and Dulles International Airports and want to share with you my thoughts this on very important issue       In 1987  Congress created the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  MWAA  to run Reagan National and Washington Dulles International Airports   The creation of MWAA established a professional organization to operate the airports efficiently and represented a commitment to the surrounding communities regarding aircraft noise and traffic   Those commitments were codified by the Congress in the perimeter and high density  slot  rules   Any change to these rules threatens to seriously degrade service to the airports and breaks the promises made to the surrounding communities         In February  2007  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  updated its report on Reagan National and concluded that the airport could accommodate additional flights   It is my understanding from the reservations expressed by MWAA that this report was severely flawed   It failed to appreciate the impact on ground side services  such as parking  gate availability and counter space   underestimated the current use of the primary runway and overestimated the number of flights that can land during periods of poor weather       Nearly ten years ago  MWAA rebuilt much of Reagan National and transformed the airport into one of the most efficient airports in the nation as the facilities constructed were matched to the number of flights established by law   Any increase in the number of flights will overburden critical airport facilities and infrastructure causing serious disruptions   As you are undoubtedly aware  passenger parking at the airport has become a significant problem   On most days of the week some or all of the garages are at capacity   New flights will create more demand for parking where none is available   At the same time  gate access is an issue as airlines are currently sharing gates in some areas   More flights will result in airplanes being held on the field while waiting for gates   Not only does this trap passengers but it increases the potential for runway incursions involving loaded aircraft   These are significant issues that the Committee must consider in reviewing changes to the perimeter and slot rules       Importantly  the slot rules in place have created an airport in balance with the neighborhoods   Because Reagan National is convenient to many  it is appreciated and well used   But this convenience comes at a heavy price for many airport neighbors in the form of aircraft noise and airport related traffic in Arlington  Alexandria and southern Fairfax   Adding flights beyond what was agreed to in the legislation creating MWAA breaks the bond that was created with the neighbors of the airport and unfairly burdens them for the sake of the convenience of others       With regard to the perimeter rule  its value is evident in the development taking place at Dulles International Airport today   Because Dulles is better situated to handle the demands of long haul flying  the Congress wisely established the perimeter rule to move long haul traffic there where the space exists to handle the necessary parking and expansion   The multi billion dollar Dulles Development program  and the investments in rail to Dulles  are all predicated upon the Congress keeping its word on the perimeter rule   Eliminating the perimeter rule will not only overburden capacity at Reagan National by overwhelming the facilities but would significantly change the infrastructure improvements needed at Dulles   many of which are already under construction       Finally  eliminating the perimeter rule will result in tremendous economic pressure to abandon service to cities inside the perimeter for higher revenue service flights   Indeed  cities such as Richmond and Norfolk  which are currently within the perimeter  could lose their service or have it reduced if the perimeter rule is eliminated       For the forgoing reasons  I urge you to reject any changes to the high density and perimeter rules at Reagan National Airport       Thank you and best wishes                                                                           Sincerely
