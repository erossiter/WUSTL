   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   April 30  2007 Senator Jim Webb s Floor Speech on the 32nd Anniversary of the fall of Saigon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Today is a day for Vietnamese around the world as significant as the distinctions that we often make between B C  and A D  32 years ago today  the communist forces from North Vietnam finished their conquest of the South  and South Vietnam ceased to exist   Ho Chi Minh liked to say that the motivation for pursuing this war was what he called doc lap va tu do  which meant independence and freedom  If we were to discuss independence in the sense of removing foreign involvement at that moment they were  arguably  correct  But if we were to discuss true issues of freedom  the aspirations for freedom for millions of people in Vietnam ceased on that day         Some like to call the conquest of South Vietnam  liberation   but for millions of Vietnamese it was a loss of everything  including their country   A million people were sent into re education camps  240 000 of them stayed in those camps for longer than four years  Some as long as 18 years  56 000 died in those re education camps   An estimated one million people jumped into the sea during this period  some with more than a 50  chance of dying  And many of them ended up in this country   We currently have  today  in this country  two million people of Vietnam descent        I do not want  at this moment  to re fight the Vietnam War  Nor do I want to dwell to much on the differences between the Vietnam War and the present war  But I ve seen people on both sides talk about the Iraq War as if there were some correlation to Vietnam   And I would like to say that  for those who worry about how we withdrew from Vietnam  there s not a parallel   For those who worry  quite frankly  about how we went into Vietnam  there s not really a parallel  These were different continents  different government systems  different issues with respect to our national objectives        In Vietnam  we assisted an existing government that had been created by international agreement  We fought side by side  with an army that  itself  lost 245 000 soldiers on the battlefield  We fought for a very long time with the support of the American people  a reality that is sometimes missed today as we look back on the tragic way that the Vietnam War ended         A 1972 Harris poll showed that even eight years after we began our involvement in Vietnam  the American people agreed by a margin of 74  to 11   that it was important that South Vietnam not fall into the hands of the communists  We rarely hear those statistics today  we rarely hear that viewpoint   I stand here  as someone who still  today  supports our national objectives in Vietnam but who also was an early warning voice with respect to the strategic inadvisability of going into Iraq        So  on this special day of remembrance for so many Vietnamese around the world  I would like to give a salute first of all to our Vietnam veterans who fought with such great honor and whose sacrifices are rarely remembered in an affirmative sense   We saw 58 000 Americans die on the battlefields of Vietnam  more than 300 000 wounded  three million people served   I would also like to thank the veterans of the South Vietnamese Army  who also are so frequently mis portrayed in history that fought alongside us  Many of them fought very well  As I mentioned earlier  245 000 of them died on the battlefield   Many  many more went through struggles after the War that are very difficult for Americans to digest   Imagine being in a re education camp for 13    years where you are allowed to see your family for 15 minutes a year  Imagine not having veterans  status in either Vietnam or the United States after having gone through  in some cases  12 years on a battlefield         I would like to thank those Vietnamese  the truly forgotten warriors who stood alongside us on the battlefield  I also would like to express my pride and appreciation for the Vietnamese who came here to this country and showed us the strength of their culture  showed us what could have happened if South Vietnam had remained free  We now have two million Vietnamese Americans living in this country   They have done enormously well         With respect to the Hanoi government  I have been dealing with the Hanoi government since 1991 when I first returned to Vietnam   I ve made many  many trips back to Vietnam  in many different capacities   They have made significant strides since those early days when they were  essentially  a Stalinist system  There s a lot to be proud of in terms of the transformations that have been going on in Vietnam   Vietnam is growing  It is growing economically  We have much work to do   We have much work to do in terms of encouraging that political system to open up  to allow religious freedom  and to allow greater political freedom        We are on a pathway where with the right kind of dialogue  I believe that is going to occur  And I believe that the best legacy for us to have  when we look back at that era is to see the Vietnam of today as a strategic and economic partner but also as a vibrant  open society  whose government reflects the strength of the culture itself  a strength that has been demonstrated over and over again by the Vietnamese who have come to this country and who  I am proud to say  are now Americans        Madam President  I yield the floor
