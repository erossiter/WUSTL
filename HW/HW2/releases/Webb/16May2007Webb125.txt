   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   May 16  2007 Webb Calls for Realistic Alternatives  Responsible Troop Withdrawal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Below are remarks delivered by Senator Webb on the Senate floor today with respect to his votes on Iraq related amendments       This is a very difficult time for those of us who have long known that the war in Iraq was a strategic error of monumental proportions  but who also understand the practical realities of disengagement   A majority of this country believes that we need to readjust our Iraq policy and to get our combat forces off the streets of Iraq s cities   A majority of our military believes that this Administration s approach is not working   A majority of the Congress believes that we need a new approach       There are sound  realistic alternatives that could be pursued toward the eventual goal of removing our troops from Iraq  increasing the political stability of that war torn region  increasing our capability to defeat the forces of international terrorism  and allowing our country to focus on larger strategic priorities that now have gone untended for too many years   Unfortunately  few of these alternatives seem to make it to the House or Senate floor  in the form that would truly impact policy       With respect to the approaches that have been taken recently  let me first say that I am cynical about the stack of benchmarks that have appeared in recent bills  laying down a series of requirements to the Iraqi government   The reality is that the Iraqi government is a weak government   Like the Lebanese government twenty years ago  it has very little power  and it is surrounded by a multiplicity of armed factions which have overwhelming power in their concentrated areas of activity   Too often  the benchmarks that we  in our splendid isolation  decide to impose  are little more than feel good measures  giving us the illusion that we are doing something meaningful   And just to make them more illusory  the language we send over on benchmarks and other policies such as unit readiness and length of deployment are couched with waivers  so that the President can simply ignore the language anyway   What does this do   How can we continue these actions and then claim to the American people that we re really solving the most troubling issue of our era   Some of these discussions remind me of what Mark Twain once wrote  saying that the government in Washington is like two thousand ants floating down the river on a log  each one thinking they re driving it       Secondly  let me say that I admire the intentions in the bill that my colleague Senator Feingold introduced earlier today   However  I could not vote for that bill  because an arbitrary cutoff date for funding military operations in Iraq might actually work against the country s best interests in an environment where we have  finally seen some diplomatic efforts from this administration   Recent initiatives from Secretary of State Rice  Ambassador Crocker  and Admiral Fallon  the new commander of the Central Command  hold out the hope  if not the promise  that we might actually start to turn this thing around   Admiral Fallon has publicly stated that we must deal with Iran and Syria   Ambassador Crocker at this moment is arranging a diplomatic exchange with Iran   Secretary of State Rice has cooperated at the ministerial level in an environment where her Iranian counterpart was also at the table   And importantly  Admiral Fallon mentioned during his recent confirmation hearing that it is not the number of troops in Iraq that is important  but the uses to which they would be put   There is room for movement here  as long as the movement occurs in a timely fashion  An arbitrary cutoff date would  at this point  take away an important negotiating tool   Let s just hope that they use the tools we are providing them in an effective manner       There is  however  one issue that demands our immediate attention  and which should not be delayed       As we look at our options here in the Congress  I continue to firmly believe that we have a duty in an area that is not being properly addressed by this Administration  and which is in the proper purview of the Congress   When the supplemental Appropriations bill is returned to the President  it should contain language prohibiting this Administration from deploying Army units for longer than 12 months  and Marine Corps units for longer than 210 days   It should also prohibit sending any military individual overseas unless he or she has been home from a previous tour for at least as long as they were deployed   In other words  if you ve been gone a year  you should be home a year before you re sent back       This Administration has gone back to the well again and again  extending the length of military tours  and shortening the time that our soldiers and Marines are allowed to be at home before being sent  again and again and again  into Iraq and Afghanistan   Absent the gravest national emergency  there is no strategy in Iraq or elsewhere that justifies what has been happening with the deployment cycles of the men and women we are sending into harm s way   It has reached the point that the goodwill and dedication of our military people are being abused  by policy makers obsessed with various experimental strategies that are being conducted at their expense   These people have put their lives literally into the hands of our national leadership   There are limits to human endurance  and there are limits to what military families can be expected to tolerate  in the name of the national good       For that reason  I urge our conferees to include language that will limit this policy in the bill that will be returned to the President
