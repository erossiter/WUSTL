                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Below are remarks delivered by  Senator Webb on the Senate floor today with respect to his amendment  to the comprehensive  immigration reform bill   For  audio of Senator Webbs remarks  please go to    Mr  President  I would like to just take a few minutes  this morning  I would like to address the motivations that I have behind the  amendment Ive introduced and express my hopes that our colleagues will support  this amendment  I have offered this amendment in the hopes of helping to save  the vote on this bill  I am well aware that there are a number of people in this  body who would like to see this bill go down the tubes  I do not share that  sentiment    There is a lot of good in this bill  We were given a  briefing card yesterday which outlines the positive aspects in this piece of  legislation  It will go a long way toward toughening border security  It will in  a measurable way toughen employer sanctions  It will create a program that  in  my view  is a proper way to deal with the guest worker issue     The difficulty that I have in the present legislation   and the reason that I have introduced my amendment  is that the issue of  legalization goes to the notion of fairness in terms of how the laws of the  United  States are applied  The second problem I have  with this bill is the issue of practicality when you look at what are called the  touch back provisions    We do have  by all estimates  between 12 and 20 million  people who are here without papers  We need to be able to say  openly and  honestly  that the situation that these people are in is a result of the fact  that they are here in contradiction to American Law  The average American  believes very strongly in the notion of fairness when it comes to how we enforce  our laws  Of those 12 million to 20 million people  as I have said for more than  a year  there is a significant number who have during a period of lax  immigration laws  come to this country  become part of their community  put down  roots  and deserve a path toward citizenship  toward legalizing their status and  toward citizenship  But to draw the line arbitrarily at the end of last year to  include every single person  with a few exceptions  who was here in this country  as of the end of last year  I think violates the notion of fairness among a lot  of people in this country  and its one of the reasons why we have had such a  strong surge of resentment toward the legislation as it now exists     Under my proposal  those who have lived in the  United  States for at least four years prior to the  enactment of the bill can apply to legalize their status  And I would like to  point out that a year ago  people in this body were agreeing to a five year  residency requirement  This bill is more generous than the legislation that a  lot of people in this body and also immigrants rights groups were supporting a  year ago  We then would move into objective measurable criteria which would  demonstrate that the people who were applying have actually put roots down in  their community  through work history  through payment of federal and state  income taxes  knowledge of English  and immediate family members in the United  States  These are not all inclusive  They are the sorts of criteria which would  help to advance the legalization process    I believe this is fair  I believe that people in this  country who traditionally would be supporting fair immigration policies but who  are worried about the legalization process in this bill would come forward and  support this  and we need that support in this country  if we actually are going  to resolve this problem and move forward    The second part of this amendment goes to the  practicality of the present legislation  It strikes the bills unrealistic  touch back requirement  For those who meet the test of having roots in their  community and move forward  it removes the requirement that they have to go back  to their country of origin in order to apply for legal status  We know the  difficulty that a lot of families would have if their principal breadwinner had  to leave his or her employment  go back to Manila or wherever  file papers  leave the  family here  and interrupt their job  Thats simply impractical  In many ways it  is a totally unnecessary obstacle    So this bill would reduce the scope of people who were  allowed legalization to those who have put down roots in their communities in a  very fair way that I think Americans will understand  but also will remove the  unnecessary impediment of requiring people to go back to their country of  origin  Ive heard loud and clear from not only Virginians but across this  country when Ive talked to people about this issue over the past couple of  years that this congress should find a fair system that on the one hand   protects American workers and also respects the rule of law  This amendment is  the fairest method I know to do so  and to do so realistically  in order to  truly reform our broken immigration system   I am hopeful that this amendment will get support  If  this amendment succeeds  I am happy to support the final legislation  As I said   there are many  many good provisions in the legislation  but under the present  circumstances  I think there are many people in this body who have a very  difficult time on the notions of fairness with the widely embracing notion of  all the people who are involved  I reserve the balance of my time  Mr   President
