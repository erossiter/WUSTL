   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   February 5  2007 Statement by Senator Webb on Release of President Bush   s FY 2008 Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The following is a statement from Senator Jim Webb of Virginia in response to the FY 2008 budget released today by President Bush           For the first time since he instituted his tax cuts  the President has proposed a plan that purports to achieve a balanced budget   Unfortunately  this will not occur until 2012  four years after the President has left office  if at all   In other words  it will be up to another President     and future Congresses     to make the difficult choices necessary to balance the budget   This is the type of gamesmanship that breeds cynicism among the American people         In the coming weeks  I intend to scrutinize the President   s budget carefully  Congress must ensure that the enormous costs of the Iraq War are accounted for properly and that our citizens receive a true picture of the war   s size and scope   I have repeatedly opposed the financing of the Iraq War through supplemental appropriations that don   t allow for adequate oversight and accountability         Additionally  I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to ensure that the budget promotes economic fairness  and ensures that the burdens and obligations of our nation are shared equitably
