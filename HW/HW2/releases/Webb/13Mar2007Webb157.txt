Virginia s LIHEAP Funding by Half

Webb  D VA  and a bipartisan coalition of Senators this week sent a letter to the Senate Budget Committee requesting  5 1 billion for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in the fiscal year 2008 budget  More than 373 000 low income workers  disabled individuals and senior citizens in the Commonwealth are eligible for heating assistance  yet  only 110 000 received heating assistance funding last year         LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  Under the President s FY 08 Budget request  Virginia would only receive  28 million in LIHEAP funds  compared to  75 million in FY 2006         We need to reshape our priorities when there are three times as many Virginians eligible for home energy assistance than those who receive it   said Senator Webb   And this year  the President has offered us a budget that cuts Virginia s share by more than half           For thousands of low income families across Virginia  home energy costs have increased beyond their ability to keep up   said Webb   We must ensure that the funding meets the demand         Many states use LIHEAP funding to augment state programs during the winter months alone  though Virginia benefits from LIHEAP funds during both the summer and winter seasons         The full text of the letter follows         March 9  2007         The Honorable Kent Conrad                                                    The Honorable Judd Gregg             Chairman                                                                                  Ranking Member      Committee on the Budget                                                          Committee on the Budget      United States Senate                                                                 United States Senate      Washington  DC 20510                                                            Washington  DC 20510        Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg        The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation s low income households   LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South   We are writing to request that the budget provide  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2008  the full amount authorized  and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2009          Our request to fund LIHEAP at its full funding level is consistent with the  5 1 billion LIHEAP allocation included in the Senate passed fiscal 2007 budget resolution  S  Con  Res  83    Funding LIHEAP at this level in regular funding and advance appropriations can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability                      For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans   spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills   Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil  propane  and electricity prices continue to increase                       In addition  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden   Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year                      Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing  and food   In 2005  the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills   The survey found that in the last five years        44  skipped paying or paid less than their entire home energy bill in the past year    Households with children or households with income below 50  of the poverty level were more likely to do so      47  went without medical or dental care due to unaffordable energy bills in the past five years    32  did not fill their prescriptions or took less than their full dose of a prescribed medicine due to energy bills in the past five years    16  became ill in the past five years because their home was too cold                        We also request  5 1 billion in advance funding for LIHEAP in fiscal 2009   Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer as well as plan for a summer cooling program   Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited federal resources    It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait                            Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to make sure that working families  seniors  and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs            Sincerely
