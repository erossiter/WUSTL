                                                                                                                                                                      I am committed to working on a solution that is both responsive to our needs for law and order  and fairer to those ensnared by this system  Washington  DC  Senator Jim Webb conducted a Joint Economic Committee  JEC  hearing to explore the steep increase in the U S  prison population and the economic and social costs of mass incarceration  His opening statement follows    I would like to thank Chairman Schumer for agreeing to hold this important hearing and allowing me the opportunity to chair it  I would also like to thank our witnesses for appearing today  Following my remarks  I would ask Vice Chair Maloney and Senator Brownback to make their opening statements    Over the course of the period from the mid 1970s until today  the United States has embarked on one of the largest public policy experiments in our history  yet this experiment remains shockingly absent from public debate  the United States now imprisons a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country in the world    In the name of getting tough on crime  there are now 2 1 million Americans in federal  state  and local prisons and jails    more people than the populations of New Mexico  West Virginia  or several other states  Compared to our democratic  advanced market economy counterparts  the United States has more people in prison by several orders of magnitude    All tolled  more than 7 million Americans are under some form of correction supervision  including probation and parole   Americas incarceration rate raises several serious questions  These include  the correlation between mass imprisonment and crime rates  the impact of incarceration on minority communities and women  the economic costs of the prison system  criminal justice policy  and transitioning ex offenders back into their communities and into productive employment  Equally important  the prison system today calls into question the effects on our society more broadly    As Winston Churchill noted in 1910  The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilization of any country  With the worlds largest prison population  our prisons test the limits of our democracy and push the boundaries of our moral identity   The growth in the prison population is only nominally related to crime rates  Just last week in the Washington Post  the deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that the growth  in the incarceration rate  wasnt really about increase ed  crime but how we chose to respond to crime    The steep increase in the number of people in prison is driven  according to most experts  by changes in drug policy and tougher sentencing  and not necessarily an increase in crime  Also  the composition of prison admissions has shifted toward less serious offenses  parole violations and drug offenses  Nearly 6 in 10 persons in state prison for a drug offense have no history of violence or significant selling activity  In 2005  four out of five drug arrests were for possession and only one out of five were for sales    Is incarcerating low level drug offenders working  particularly given recidivism rates   The racial composition of Americas prisons is alarming  Although African Americans constitute 14 percent of regular drug users  they are 37 percent of those arrested for drug offenses  and 56 percent of persons in state prisons for drug crimes  African Americans serve nearly as much time in federal prisons for drug offenses as whites do for violent crimes    A black male who does not finish high school now has a 60 percent chance of going to jail  One who has finished high school has a 30 percent chance  We have reached a point where the principal nexus between young African American men and our society is increasingly the criminal justice system    Moreover  we are spending enormous amounts of money to maintain the prison system  The combined expenditures of local  state  and federal governments for law enforcement and corrections personnel total over  200 billion  Prison construction and operation has become sought after  if uncertain  tools of economic growth for rural communities    Are there ways to spend less money  enhance public safety  and make a fairer prison system    Having such a large prison population also has significant employment and productivity implications  The economic output of prisoners is mostly lost to society while they are imprisoned  These negative productivity effects continue after release  As weve gotten tough on crime  weve given up on rehabilitating offenders  And weve created additional barriers to reentry with invisible punishments  These include ineligibility for certain government benefits  such as housing  public assistance  or student loans  It is no longer possible to pay your debt to society    We want to keep bad people off our streets  We want to break the back of gangs  and we want to cut down on violent behavior  But theres something else going on when were locking up such a high percentage of our people  marking them at an early age and in many cases eliminating their chances for a productive life as full citizens  It will take years of energy to address these problems  But I am committed to working on a solution that is both responsive to our needs for law and order  and fairer to those ensnared by this system   I welcome the thoughts of our witnesses today regarding these important topics  and a continuing national dialogue to address these enormous policy issues     I would like to introduce todays witnesses
