Jim Webb  D VA  today sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman  raising serious concerns about the Department of Energys  DOE  decision to  designate large portions of Virginias Shenandoah Valley and Piedmont regions as  part of the Mid Atlantic National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor   NIETC   The federal government s designation allows utility companies to  bypass thestate process for locatingelectrictransmission lines   insteadgiving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  the power to make  the decision  This designation  according to Sen  Webb  couldlead topower  lines being located inplaces inconsistent withthe best interests of  Virginians   Senator Webb joins with Governor Tim Kaine  Attorney  General Bob McDonnell  Congressman Frank Wolf  and Congressman Tom Davis in  expressing concerns about DOEs decision to include Virginia in the  Mid Atlantic NIETC  On October  2  2007  the Department of Energy designated the following Virginia counties as part of the Mid Atlantic Area NIETC   Arlington  Clarke  Culpeper  Fairfax  Fauquier  Frederick  Loudoun  Madison   Page  Prince William  Rappahannock  Rockingham  Shenandoah  Stafford  and  Warren  The  designation also includes the following Virginia cities  Alexandria  Harrisonburg   Fairfax  Falls  Church  Manassas  Manassas Park  and Winchester  A map of  the full Mid Atlantic Area NIETC can be viewed at the following link   A copy of the letter  follows   November 6   2007     The Honorable Samuel Bodman Secretary  United States Department of  Energy Washington  DC 20585  Dear Secretary Bodman    I am writing to express my concerns about  the Department of Energys  DOE  decision to designate large portions of  Virginias Shenandoah Valley and Piedmont regions as part of the Mid Atlantic National  Interest Electric Transmission Corridor  NIETC   Specifically  I am concerned  that  1  the DOE failed to hold a robust public comment process necessary to  safeguard the public trust during the rulemaking process  2  the Commonwealth of  Virginia was not consulted during the study of transmission congestion   and 3  the DOE included Virginia in the Mid Atlantic corridor despite Virginias  record of appropriate use of its transmission siting authority     I have serious reservations about your  Departments implementation of the rulemaking authority vested with you under  section 216 of the Federal Power Act as authorized in the Energy Policy Act   EPAct  of 2005  I look forward to your prompt responses to these  concerns   I  A Fair and Open Public  Comment Process   First  as previously addressed in a letter  sent to you on May 15  2007  44 Members of the United States House of  Representatives and the United States Senate expressed our shared concerns about  the severe shortage of public input opportunities during the official comment  period of the NIETC rulemaking process  The DOEs decision to hold a total of  just seven public meetings within the two corridor areas is disconcerting  Even  more troubling is the Departments decision to schedule the public meetings with  only two weeks notice  Given the magnitude of the decision you were considering  and the enormity of the affected numbers of constituents and their communities   clearly more time for public comment should have been made available     The Mid Atlantic Corridor alone is home to  almost 50 million people  covering 116 627 000 square miles  Your decision to  add four more public meetings after the initial three were noticed in the  Federal Register was a positive step  however  I disagree with your assertion  that ample time and opportunities were made available for affected parties both  to learn about and comment on the NIETC designations  A  federal back stop to traditional  State transmission siting authority  with the potential use of eminent domain   is a solemn undertaking that requires every available effort to encourage public  comment and protect the public  trust   In addition  the public meetings were held  in the middle of the work week and predominantly during the middle of the day  1  p m   7 p m   when most working men and women are unable to participate  While  I appreciate DOEs efforts to reach a greater share of the affected public via  webcasts and audio availability  I believe this effort falls far short of  faithfully encouraging a healthy public comment period on such an important  matter  Many hardworking people do not have access  or the ability while at  work  to participate in or view a webcast  In some instances  concerned  citizens would have to travel up to six hours one way just to participate in the  public meetings  Many working families simply do not have the ability to take  this time away from their jobs and families to be heard on such an important  matter    II  Designation Without Due  Care and Consideration of Virginias Interests and Authority     Second  I take issue in your response letter  to me dated June 28  2007  in which you imply that the Department is going to  great lengths to consult with the affected States of the NIETC designation   That reassurance does not appear to be the experience of the Commonwealth of  Virginia  As stated in  their letter to you dated July 6  2007  in their official comments for the  public record  Governor Timothy Kaine and Attorney General Robert McDonnell  affirm that neither they nor their designees were consulted during a critical  phase of the National Corridor designation process as required by EPAct  In  that letter  the Governor and Attorney General  write        After consultations  with the Office of the Governor and the Attorney General  it appears that there  were ample opportunities for DOE to consult with affected States in conducting a study of  electric transmission congestion as required under EPAct  I know that  as an  affected State  Virginia would have appreciated direct  consultation on this matter given the significance and potential implications of  the study  Governor Kaine noted in his letter to you dated October 10  2006  in  reference to DOEs congestion study activities  that  such designations should  only take place in consultation with affected States  as the Energy Policy Act  of 2005 provides  The Commonwealth  from very early on  sought consultation  with DOE in conducting the congestion studies  Those requests appear to have  been ignored  I can find no evidence that  as an affected State  Virginia was directly  contacted in this matter   See Federal  Register  May 7  2007  Volume 72  Number  87  page 25850   I do not share your conclusion that  consultation with groups such as the Southern States Energy Board  SSEB  or the  National Conference of State  Legislatures  NCSL  constitutes a satisfaction of the statutory consultation  requirements    Consequently  I am requesting that you  provide me in writing the days  times  and names of involved parties and  locations at which the DOE consulted directly with the Commonwealth of Virginia  on the congestion study matter of the NIETC process and complied with  1221 a   of EPAct  Given your assurance in your letter of June 28 to me that you are   actively consulting with affected States    this should be a reasonable  request with which to comply   III  Virginia Should Not Be  Included in the Mid Atlantic NIETC   Third  it is important to note that the  Commonwealth of  Virginias preexisting  laws  policies  regulations and protocols demonstrate an understanding of the  need for reliable energy infrastructure  As such  I question why Virginia was included in  the Mid Atlantic NIETC at all  The Commonwealth has the ability to use  and has  used in previous instances  its authority to site transmission facilities via  the State Corporation Commission  SCC  to meet the energy needs of consumers and  businesses  In fact  during the last 10 years  I am aware of only one instance  in which Virginia took longer than one year to complete  the transmission facility approval process  And in that one instance  it  appears that the federal government was primarily responsible for the delays     Virginias  government already possesses a knowledge and appreciation of the need for an  efficient  dependable  economically viable and sufficient energy system  This  fact was most recently reinforced with the September 2007 release of Virginias comprehensive 10 year energy plan  which was  mandated by Virginia law in 2006  The plan has been widely praised for its broad approach in  addressing energy production and consumption  The energy plan also calls for  dramatic improvements in increasing energy efficiency and  conservation    Furthermore  Virginia recently  approved legislation that seeks to foster energy conservation and measures to  improve efficiencies within the electric sector  The re regulation law  supports the build out of generating and transmission capacities  This law  further reinforces Virginias recognition of the need for  reliability in both generating and transporting energy and conforms to the  underlying goals of EPAct    I share your goal of keeping reliable  sources of electricity flowing to American consumers and businesses  However  I  take very seriously the potential application of a federal backstop and the  potential use of federal authority in the siting of transmission  infrastructure  Our nations system of federalism has served us well and our  country has a long history of States working together to meet their collective  energy needs  I am concerned about the possible misuse of this federal backstop  authority and its potential to preempt State authority in these matters  This  concern is particularly acute given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions  ability to exercise siting authority if  in essence  a State fails to act on an  application to construct a new transmission facility within one year of the  filing of an application    Given the opposition of the NIETC  designation of significant portions of Virginia  in the Mid Atlantic Area by the Governor  Virginias Attorney General  numerous affected  cities and counties within the corridor and the countless citizens who voiced  their opposition  I believe Senate hearings into this matter may be justified   And  if appropriate  Congress may have to adjust EPAct through legislative  remedy    I thank you for your attention to these  concerns and I look forward to hearing from you on this  matter     Sincerely
