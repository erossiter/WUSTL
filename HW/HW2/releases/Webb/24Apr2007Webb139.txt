Issue Report on Long Term Financing Challenges WASHINGTON  DC  Senators Jim Webb  D VA   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Representatives John Tanner  D TN  and Mike Castle  R DE  reintroduced legislation in the Senate and House today to create a Comprehensive Entitlement Reform Commission   The purpose of the commission is to review Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid and make recommendations to Congress that would sustain the solvency and stability of these three programs for future generations          The Social Security Board of Trustees released its annual report Monday afternoon  warning of long term financing challenges facing Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid            For decades  hard working Americans have counted on Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid as a safety net to protect their basic needs   said Senator Webb   The intentions of these programs are unquestionable  They foster a level of fairness and government responsibility that Americans deserve  But with nearly 80 million baby boomers retiring in the next few years and the costs of medical care continually rising  we need to take the responsible steps to ensure the solvency of these programs in the years ahead         For too long  Congressional debate on these programs has been mired in partisan politics  As the latest trustees  report makes all too clear  we need leadership to ensure the long term financial health of these programs  That s why it is time for a neutral commission to recommend solutions to Congress within one year of the bill s passage   continued Webb         Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid have played a vital role for millions of Americans to cope with the financial burdens of retirement and health care costs   However  over the next 75 years these three programs represent a  47 trillion unfunded commitment and are on a trajectory that cannot be sustained   The Commission will review America s three major entitlement programs and make comprehensive recommendations to sustain the solvency and stability of these programs for future generations   Confronting the financial challenges that exist with these entitlement programs now means facing less dramatic and difficult choices down the road   Senator Hagel said         Millions of Americans depend on Medicare  Social Security and Medicaid everyday  but the programs are not financially sustainable over time if we do not take a comprehensive look at potential reforms  We have a responsibility to strengthen these programs for the Baby Boomers who are retiring now and also for future generations who deserve the assistance they have helped support for those before them   Representative Tanner said        Senator Hagel and Representative Tanner introduced the legislation in the last Congress         With the Trustees Report yesterday reconfirming for all of us  the urgent need to overhaul Medicare and Social Security sooner rather than later  this Commission can play a vital role in making specific recommendations on how to do so   With these three entitlement programs comprising such a large chunk of our federal budget every year  there is no question that in order to be fiscally responsible we can no longer wait to make changes   Facing the tough choices now  will ensure a healthier economy in the long run   Representative Castle said        The bipartisan Commission would be comprised of eight members appointed by bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate   Its work would fall under the Federal Advisory Committee Act  which requires Government Accountability Office oversight and full public access   The Commission would be required to submit a final report to the President and Congress one year after the appointment of all Commission members and staff  and Congress would be required to hold committee hearings to review the Commission s recommendations                  Below is a fact sheet detailing the proposed
