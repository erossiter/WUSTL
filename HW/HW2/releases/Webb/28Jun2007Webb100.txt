   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 28  2007 Senator Webb   Governor Sebelius Call for Increased Support of Military  National Guard Units Serving Overseas Deployments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Jim Webb  D VA  and Governor Kathleen Sebelius   D KS  today said that supporting our troops means establishing more  sustainable deployment lengths and adequate dwell time between deployments for  our nations military units serving in Iraq and Afghanistan    Both Webb and Sebelius have seen the  extent to which erratic deployment rotations push service members  to the limits of their endurance and cause significant strains at home    After the July  4th recess  Senator Webb will introduce an amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act  requiring that active duty troops have at least the  same time at home as the length of their previous tour of duty  overseas   We are burning out  our ground forces  said Webb  We are seeing it in falling retention of  experienced combat veterans and an increase in mental health issues arising from  multiple deployments to Iraq  and Afghanistan without adequate recovery  time  We are speaking directly to the welfare of our troops here  If were  honest about wanting to support our troops  theres no better place to start  than to correct our troop rotation policy   Governor Sebelius  experienced the strain of extended troop deployments first hand when tornadoes  wiped out the small town of Greensburg   Kansas  in  May  Roughly 60 percent of the Kansas National Guards equipment had been  shipped overseas  compromising the states long term ability to respond  adequately to natural disasters of this magnitude    Im proud of the  men and women of the Kansas National Guard who are serving us honorably  overseas  said Governor Sebelius  But I have also felt the impact of that  service  both in terms of Guard members being away from homes and businesses for  long periods of time  and the shortage of National Guard equipment my state is  facing    My hope is that  Congress and the President will address this situation sooner rather than later   because the shortage is putting people at risk here at home  This isnt a  political issue  its a matter of national security  continued  Sebelius   Currently  active  duty Army soldiers serve up to 15 months in Iraq or Afghanistan  yet only  receive 12 months at home  a less than a 1 1 ratio  Many Marine Corps units  experience less than a 1 1 deployment ratio  And  National Guard and Reserve  units are severely strained  as well    Troops need adequate  time to rest  readjust from combat  and reacquaint themselves with family and  friends  The majority of a service members dwell time is spent retraining   refurbishing  and reequipping prior to being re deployed  After more than four  years of combat  members of the Armed Forces and their families require a more  predictable deployment schedule with adequate time at home between  tours
