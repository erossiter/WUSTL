   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   May 22  2007 Webb Co Sponsors Bill to Revitalize Metrorail System  Ease Traffic Congestion in Northern Virginia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Legislation Provides  1 5 Billion in Federal Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Jim Webb today co sponsored legislation to provide the Washington area Metrorail system with  1 5 billion in funding over a 10 year period  The federal funds will require an equal match from Maryland  the District of Columbia and Virginia   The bill was introduced by Maryland Senators Benjamin L  Cardin and Barbara A  Mikulski and fellow Virginia Senator John Warner is a co sponsor        In 2006  the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  WMATA  celebrated its 30th anniversary of passenger service on the Metro system  Since service first began in 1976  the Metro system has grown from 4 6 miles and five stations to the nation s second busiest rapid transit system   Today  the Metro system consists of 106 3 miles and 86 stations  carrying more than 100 million passengers a year          Traffic in the region is an impediment to economic growth  quality of life and the ability of Northern Virginians to spend time with their families after work   said Senator Webb    A good Metro system  backed by a solid source of federal funding  is a vital first step toward easing traffic in the region            With area roadways becoming increasingly congested  the Metro system is critical to the region s economic vitality   In order for Metro to meet the demands of a growing ridership and aging infrastructure  it is essential that it has a dedicated source of funding   continued Webb         This funding will help Metrorail serve federal employees  especially in a national emergency  and will further mitigate congestion in one of America s busiest regions   said Senator Warner          The majority of all rush hour Metro riders are federal employees   said Senator Cardin    The government needs the Metro to get workers to their jobs  and  now after 30 years of use  the Metro needs the federal government to step in and help revitalize an aging system           This bill will mean great news for commuters and visitors to the National Capitol Region   It authorizes much needed funding for the Washington Metro system   America s metro   said Senator Mikulski    Metro means more than just transportation   it means residents and visitors to our nation s capital can live  work  worship and play throughout the metro area without ever getting in their cars           The Metrorail system provides a unified and coordinated transportation system for the region  enhancing mobility for millions off residents  visitors and federal workers   Today  more than 40  of Metro s riders are federal employees  In 2005  a report sponsored by the Metropolitan Council of Governments  the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the Federal City Council found that WMATA faces an average annual operating and capital shortfall of approximately  300 million between FY 2006 and FY 2015         The National Capital Transportation Amendments Act also will require all state and local governments provide for a dedicated funding source for Metro   Virginia and the District have passed such legislation  Maryland s transportation trust fund is already a dedicated source of revenue  according to Maryland Gov  Martin O Malley   The legislation also establishes an Office of Inspector General of the Transit Authority and expands the WMATA Board of Directors        A similar bill has passed the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee earlier this year        Following is a copy of Senator Webb s statement on the importance of Metro Transit Funding                      Statement of Senator James Webb      Regarding the Importance of Funding for the Washington Metro Transit System      May 22  2007      Mr  President  I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Mikulski  Cardin and Warner to introduce legislation that will reaffirm the federal government s continuing responsibility for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  WMATA    Our legislation  in cooperation with state and local governments of the National Capital Region  will aid in the preservation and maintenance of our regional transportation system        Our predecessors in Congress had a clear vision for rapid rail and bus service that would not only transport federal employees  residents and visitors around the National Capital Region  but that would also alleviate traffic congestion  spur growth and development  improve the economic welfare and vitality of all parts of the region and ensure that all area residents have sufficient mobility options        The Washington Metro transit system has fulfilled that vision and more  providing critical support to the federal government and the region during emergencies  helping to protect the environment and improve air quality in our nation s capital and attracting visitors from around the country and the world to ride the system     now a monument of its own        With the federal government s commitment to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil and to increase national security  federal support of the Washington Metro system is more important now than ever before  Congress has a fundamental interest in the transit system and we must join our long standing regional partners to help meet the demand of Metro s growing ridership and aging infrastructure        Since the Washington Metro transit system began operating its first 4 6 miles of the Red Line between Rhode Island Avenue and Farragut North in 1976  the Metrorail system has added over 100 miles and extended operations to a total of 86 stations throughout the District of Columbia  Maryland and Virginia  Almost half of all Metrorail stations today serve federal facilities and 42 percent of Metro s peak period commuters are federal employees        Metrorail and Metrobus ridership continue to grow as more than a million riders on average per weekday choose Metro as their preferred mode of transit for traveling around the National Capital Region  Metrorail ridership has grown steadily at an average annual growth of four percent  according to the Progress Report on the National Capital Region s Six Year Transportation Capital Funding Needs  2007 2012  by the Metropolitan Washington Transportation Planning Board  TPB   The report predicts that transit ridership demand will exceed system capacity by the year 2010  New funding authorized in this legislation would provide the necessary resources to increase bus and rail capacity and meet forecasted ridership demands  before the system and region become totally mired in congestion        The Washington Metro transit system has proven critical to the federal government  not only in moving its employees and serving federal facilities but also in providing significant support during emergencies  Immediately following the September 11  2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon  Metro continued operations and helped safely evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the downtown core of the District of Columbia  For a 30 day period after September 11  Metro opened Metrorail service half an hour early to support the Department of Defense as it heightened security actions and encountered major traffic congestion accessing the Pentagon        Metro is a key component in emergency transportation and Continuity of Operations Plans for the entire region  including the civilian and military federal workforce  Without the use of the Metro system  gridlock would ensue on the region s roadways to a degree that would make all emergency transportation evacuation plans inoperable  With enactment of the legislation we propose today  Congress will assist the Washington Metro transit system to continue to provide its vital service and bolster security measures throughout the system        Additional funding will also enable the transit system to continue to provide the invaluable service of helping to reduce traffic congestion throughout the region  With area roadways becoming increasingly congested  the Washington Metro transit system is critical to the region s infrastructure        According to the 2005 Urban Mobility Report by the Texas Transportation Institute  TTI   the Washington Metropolitan area has the third worst traffic congestion in the United States  Washington area commuters sat in traffic for 145 5 million hours in 2003  costing drivers an estimated  2 46 billion and wasting more than 87 million gallons of fuel  The report shows that the Washington area would have the worst congestion in the nation if not for its public transportation system   Moreover  the report concludes that Washington Metro transit improvements are necessary to help further relieve congested corridors and serve major activity centers        Currently  Metrorail and Metrobus services result in 580 000 cars being removed from the region s highways each weekday and eliminate the need for 1 400 additional highway lane miles  A reliable and safe public transportation system is essential to encouraging more commuters to utilize alternative modes of transportation  especially as congestion on regional roadways is projected to increase  along with strong job and population growth in the National Capital Region        The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments  MWCOG  estimates the area s population will grow 36 percent by 2030  Already struggling to meet its current ridership demands  the Washington Metro transit system desperately needs increased support from the federal government and state and local governments in the National Capital Region to keep up with the region s current and future economic progress        Metro is an unparalleled asset to the region  not only reducing traffic congestion and air pollutants  but also helping to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil  Public transportation is an inherently energy efficient travel mode  with each transit user consuming an average of one half the oil consumed by the typical automobile user  according to the American Public Transportation Association  APTA          Current public transportation usage reduces U S  gasoline consumption by 1 4 billion gallons each year  In concrete terms  that means 108 million fewer cars are filling up with gas per year  or almost 300 000 per day   34 fewer supertankers are leaving the Middle East per year and over 140 000 fewer tanker trucks are making deliveries to service stations        Locally  the Washington Metro transit system saves the region from using 75 million gallons of gasoline each year   As gas prices continue to rise  many Washington area residents will continue to seize upon the opportunity to save money on fuel consumption by taking public transportation  Additional federal funding will allow Metro to purchase 340 new rail cars and 275 new buses  which are necessary to accommodate more riders and help further reduce oil consumption throughout the Washington region        Public transportation not only helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil  but it also helps reduce toxic emissions and air pollution caused by the large number of cars sitting in bumper to bumper traffic on area roadways  The Washington Metro transit system eliminates more than 10 000 tons of pollutants from the air each year  Much of the Metrobus fleet is comprised of eco friendly buses that run on ultra low sulfur diesel fuel  compressed natural gas  diesel electric hybrid and advanced technology fuels  Investing in Metro is one of the most significant contributions the federal government can make to help protect the environment in the Washington Metropolitan area         Reliable Metrorail and Metrobus service is an attractive alternative to sitting in traffic  but if Metro does not receive additional funding  reliability will diminish along with the public s confidence in the transit system  Already  Metro is struggling to accommodate more riders and modernize its existing assets  Additional dedicated sources of funding are needed if Metro is to continue to serve the federal workforce and thousands of other area residents and visitors        For the past thirty years  the Washington Metro transit system has been a bedrock for the National Capital Region  providing reliable transportation  facilitating day to day operations of the federal government  spurring economic growth and sensible development  reducing sprawl and traffic congestion  and improving the quality of life for the region s citizens and visitors to the nation s capital        The future of Metro and its continued success relies upon consistent support from the federal government and the regional localities it serves  Now is the time for the federal government to commit itself to providing more long term federal funding for the Washington Metro system  Together  along with our jurisdictional partners  we must continue to invest in the transit system that has brought so many rewards not only to the region  but also to the federal government and the entire nation   I urge my colleagues to support this bill as it moves through the Senate        Mr  President  I ask that my statement be printed in full in the Congressional Record to accompany the text of this bill
