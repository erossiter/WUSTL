from Under Secretary of Defense

sent to Under Secretary of Defense David Chu today  Senator Jim Webb reiterated his concerns that the Defense Department has a systemic problem with the way service members are returned to military service or transitioned to care with the Department on Veterans Affairs         In my view  we have a clear breakdown at the point of transition   said Webb   If the data that we re seeing from the Department of Defense is accurate  it suggests that fewer soldiers are being retired on disability today   while the country is at war   than were so retired five years ago during peace time   This strikes me as inexplicable         Many of the problems associated with the military s disability determination process are well documented in a Government Accountability Office report issued in March 2006  In his letter to Under Secretary Chu  Senator Webb questions why the total number of Army disability evaluations has not changed appreciably and why the classification of permanent disability retirements has declined so significantly in the five years the United States has been at war        The Senator s serves as a follow up to the Under Secretary s testimony before the Armed Services Committee hearing yesterday   The letter follows                    March 7  2007       The Honorable David S  Chu      Undersecretary of Defense         Personnel and Readiness       4000 Defense Pentagon  Washington  DC 20301 4000       Dear Dr  Chu        I listened with interest to your testimony of March 6 before the Senate Armed Services Committee  especially with regard to some of the overarching issues associated with the Department of Defense disability system   In my view  conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center are part of a systemic problem with the way service members  and particularly the wounded  are returned to military service or transitioned to care with the Veterans Administration   There was a clear breakdown at the point of transition at Walter Reed attributable to a lack of priorities and military leadership   I am confident that you will make an important contribution to the eventual resolution of the problems we find today        The process and policies for disability determinations clearly warrant close review given the disturbing revelations of recent weeks   A Government Accountability Office report  GAO 06 362  issued in 2006 found that the number of active service members evaluated by the Army for a disability determination in 2001 totaled 6 378   In 2005  the Army reported a total of 6  465 active members were evaluated  During the same period  the Army s number of permanent disability retirements declined from 642 to 209          With thousands of soldiers wounded in action since 2001  and others injured in operational accidents  I do not understand why the total number of Army disability evaluations has not changed appreciably   or why Army separations without disability retirements are up while permanent disability retirements are down so significantly   over a five year span  These data  if accurate  suggest that fewer soldiers are being retired on disability today   while the country is at war   than were so retired five years ago during peace time   This strikes me as inexplicable        As I mentioned yesterday  it is possible that the data is merely flawed  If so  I would appreciate seeing the actual data  If it is not  I am curious to know if delays in medical evaluation and processing are so long that service members throw their hands up in frustration and accept a cash severance  It is possible that soldiers are not being counseled properly  as our system requires  or availing themselves of their right to appeal the ruling of their Physical Evaluation Board   Some critics also maintain there is a conscious effort to interpret the Schedule for Rating Disabilities more narrowly to hold down the costs of permanent disability retirements   There may well be fundamental shortcomings with the Army s personnel reporting system         I would appreciate your looking into the matter   If the Army data is accurate  what accounts for the trends   and do similar problems exist with the other branches of the armed forces                                                                                Sincerely
