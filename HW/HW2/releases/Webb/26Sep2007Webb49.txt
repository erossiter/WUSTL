Webb on the Webb McCaskill Amendment to Establish a Commission on Wartime Contracting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington   DCSenator Jim Webb  D VA  delivered the following floor remarks  urging support  for the Webb McCaskill amendment that would establish a independent  bipartisan  Commission on Wartime Contracting to seek out waste  fraud  and abuse and  address systemic problems in contracting procedures     Mr  President  I would like to add to the comments that  were made by my colleague from Missouri about the Truman Commission amendment  that we have jointly introduced along with the other freshman members on the  Democratic side  the Independent side and with a total of 27 cosponsors as of  this morning  I dont think that there is a more important or more volatile  issue right now in terms of government accountability than the issue of the  expenditures that have gone into Iraq and Afghanistan and the accountability of  not only the contractors but of the quasi military forces that have been  operating there    Weve put a great deal of effort into designing a  Wartime Commission that was inspired by the Truman Commission in World War II  but has its own uniqueness given the issues of today  Im very proud to be one  of the original sponsors on this legislation  I would hope that members on both  sides of the aisle can support it  We are attempting in a fair way  with experts  in the field not simply a group of Senators forming a panel but with bringing in  experts in competence from the areas that they would be looking at in a short  period of time  two years  to examine the amounts of money that have been spent   where this money has gone  to try to bring some accountability into the system  and to make their reports in some cases with legal accountability and then to  wrap it up and go home    This is not one of these attempts to create a permanent  standing organization but  rather  one that can come in with the right people   take a look at what went wrong  make a report to the American people and in some  cases give them their money back  since all of these now nearly  1 trillion have  been spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  without a lot of accountability    thats taxpayer money  To try and find out how it was spent  in most cases   its been spent properly but in those cases where it hasnt been spent properly  to get people their money back and get accountability to the people who did not  spend it right    This is about improved transparency  It would be  forward looking in terms of looking at these systemic problems and attempting to  address them  But its more than that  This amendment is supported  as Senator  McCaskill indicated  by nearly every major taxpayer watchdog group     We are now with the present state of the Department of  Defense and of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  outsourcing war in ways  that we have never seen in our history  Hundreds of billions of dollars have  been allocated for reconstruction and for wartime support  creating a strong  potential for fraud  waste  and abuse  This commission will ensure financial  accountability in those areas where there has been fraud  waste  and abuse with  provisions that allow for legal accountability  in cases of wrongdoing  It also  will look at such organizations as Blackwater  which has recently been in the  news for the alleged series of wrongful killings of Iraqis and excessive force     This is an area that has slid past us as a  representative government  which is a cause for great concern for anyone who has  been involved in national security affairs over the years  We now have in  Iraq  180 000 contractors working in  a war where there are 160 000 troops  They are doing a whole panorama of chores  that traditionally have been done by military people  all the way from operating  the mess halls to providing security for even on some occasions General Petraeus  himself  Theres no accountability  none  in terms of legal accountability for  actions that have been take that result in inappropriate use of force and in  some cases wrongful deaths of people in that area  This Commission would help  address that    Were also looking at basic contractor accountability   As one example  not long ago the Special Inspector General for Iraq  Reconstruction reported that of the  32 billion at that time that had been spent  on reconstruction and relief funds  this is State Department programs    9  billion was unaccounted for   9 billion out of  32 billion was unaccounted for   We need desperately to have an independent  fair  objective analysis of what has  happened  what is happening  not only for accountability but also to help us  design a structure for the future    Again  were not trying to create a new bureaucracy  The  Commission would rely on the Inspectors General in agencies that already exist  for most of the analysis and we are sunsetting this provision at two years  We  are very comfortable with SIGIRs excellent performance in uncovering waste   fraud  and abuse in Iraq reconstruction projects  We  think that is proof of the ability to do this on a more comprehensive and  thorough level and thats what we need    Mr  President  I am strongly urging our colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to lay aside political differences and come together  with the reality that all of us have an obligation to put accountability into  this system to the American people and in some cases to give people back the  money that they spend in tax dollars for programs that were wrongfully carried  out or in some cases not carried out at all
