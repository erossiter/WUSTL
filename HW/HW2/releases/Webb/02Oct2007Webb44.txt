   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   October 2  2007 Remarks of Senator Jim Webb to the Tahirih Justice Center 10th Anniversary Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It is a pleasure to be here to celebrate Tahirih Justice Centers 10th anniversary    I wanted to point out two members of my staff who have been very involved with your organization  One is Jennifer Park  who Congressman Moran mentioned  who has had a good deal to do with the appropriations process over the years  And the other is my legislative director Mike Sozan  who actually was a member of your board of directors at one time and has provided pro bono representation  So if they would like to stand up very briefly to be recognized  I appreciate everything they have done   This is a room filled with people who care  people who want to do some good  There are times when I leave the Senate at night and wonder if weve done any good  We try  Politics is a game of inches  trying to push things down the road a little bit everyday  But I think people that are affiliated with your group never have to worry about that  whether or not at the end of everyday  if you have done some good  Its a pleasure for me to be able to be with you tonight to celebrate your ten successful years providing women and children with a voice against violence and persecution and access to justice here in the United States   The accomplishments of the Tahirih Justice Center are pretty astounding  6 400 women and children have been helped  Last year alone  the Center litigated 250 cases including 487 matters  which directly affected the lives of 402 individuals  The Center maintains a 99 percent success rate  which continually has been mentioned  And the Center has established an incredible pro bono attorney network  which includes over 440 attorneys from major Washington D C  law firms    I watched tonight with a little bit of nostalgia as Covington  Burling was awarded Pro Bono Law Firm of the Year  When I left the Marine Corps many years ago after I had been wounded in Vietnam there was one of the founding partners of Covington  Burling  a man named Howard Westwood who had given me some great advice in terms of sorting out what I was going to do with my life  Howard Westwood was one of the pioneers in terms of creating legal assistance programs and clinical programs and Im very gratified to see how strong that tradition remains at Covington and Burling today    I was told about how this organization was founded when Layli Miller Muro won a landmark human rights case while she was still in law school and how she has dedicated herself to continuing this effort  And as serendipity would have it  recently my Richmond office received a phone call from a distressed woman  who for obvious legal considerations Im not going to name  But she and her physician husband had moved to Virginia from India  He was on an H1B visa  she was on an H4 dependents visa and according to her conversation with our staff member she had been in an abusive relationship  was then abandoned  with her husband moving to another state  According to her conversation  he was going to divorce her  which would cause her to be deported back to India and her infant son would not be able to go with her since he is now a United States citizen  And so  just as I said  as serendipity would have it  we recently began working on this case and we referred it from my office to the Tahirih Justice Center so that we can fully examine the facts and give her the help that she needs  There can be no clearer example of how important the work you are doing is than that   We  as a country  pride ourselves in the fact that we are a leader in the protection and promotion of womens rights and especially the right to flee from violence  We have demonstrated that leadership through a number of pieces of legislation  Congressman Moran mentioned one  the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  and the Violence Against Women Act  Gender based violence and exploitation  as the video showed and comments reflect  are a daily reality for millions of women across the world    In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee we have a chance to move the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women  in order to help ensure that girls and women receive the same access as boys and men to education  basic health care and that they also have basic legal recourse against violations and abuses of human rights  We are going to work to see if we can move that treaty this year    The World Health Organization estimates that globally  1 woman in 5 will be the victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime  In Africa its estimated that 1 in 3 will be raped in their lifetime  We  in this country  as the most advanced country in the world have a moral obligation to promote justice and fairness and to give a voice to those who are oppressed  exploited and debased    I have not worked directly in this area in my life  but I have spent thousands of hours doing pro bono work in two other areas and I identify with the emotions and passions that those of you who are working in this area feel  The first is in veterans law from the time I came back from Vietnam  trying to help particularly Vietnam veterans as well as veterans of all eras    The second relates to the Vietnamese community  Many of you know that my wife escaped from Vietnam on a boat when she was seven years old when the communists took over South Vietnam  a million people jumped into the sea  many thousands of them died  Those who remained behind were subjected to incredible abuse if they had any relationship at all with the government that preceded them    My wifes story is a great American success story  she came here not knowing a word of English  and she worked in a shrimp factory when she was in her teens  She got a scholarship to the University of Michigan  the Chinese studies program  and then she worked her way through law school as an interpreter in court cases and graduated from Cornell Law School  It doesnt get much better than that   But the first time I went back to Vietnam in 1991  I was confronted emotionally and intellectually with what had happened when we left behind so many people who had literally bet their lives on our relationship with them  And nowhere was that truer than in the area of the Amer Asian children  the children of American servicemen who remained in Vietnam were called the children of dust  They had no access to government services  no access to schooling because their mothers had clearly affiliated with the other side  Many of them lived on the street  and there was no advocate for them  there was no one who could take care of them at that time    I can remember in 1991 walking the streets of Saigon  and there were maybe a half a dozen Americans in the entire city of 6 million people  so we really stood out  I was walking down the street one day and a young man  probably in his late teens went by on a bicycle  He was half African American  when he saw me  he cut across the square in front of about 35 people and he stopped his bike and he jumped out in front of me and he just started screaming  He said  look at me  look at me  I am not Vietnamese  He started talking about how his father died at Ku Chi  He had nothing he said  I have nothing  I need medicine  I cant get out  I cant read  What am I going to do   That stayed with me  and its one of the reasons that from 1991 forward I worked so hard and I still work today to continue to bridge the gap between the Vietnamese government  the communist government and the people who were with us who lost so much  That has been one of my great passions    I understand your passions  I share many of those concerns  The work of this center has given desperate women and children hope where otherwise there was no hope  And tonight were celebrating that and ten ground breaking years and looking into the future  Being able to hear your stories  these personal stories  I want to give you my profound thanks  We all can celebrate this collective commitment to advancing the cause of justice and to doing work  pro bono work  work for the public good in order to make this world a better place    Thank you very much for inviting me tonight  Its a pleasure to be with you
