   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   May 9  2007 Senator Jim Webb s Opening Remarks Regarding His G I  Education Legislation before Committee on Veterans  Affairs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I am pleased that this Committee is considering so many pieces of worthwhile legislation  Among those bills  I would like to discuss the Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007        As a veteran who hails from a family with a long history of military service  I am proud to have offered this bill as my first piece of legislation in the United States Senate on January 4 of this year        This bill has ten cosponsors and is supported by the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS   the Veterans of Foreign Wars  VFW   the Vietnam Veterans of America  VVA   and the Air Force Sergeants Association  Moreover  the written testimony of many of today s witnesses indicates further broad support for this bill        The Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 is designed to expand the educational benefits that our nation offers to the brave men and women who have served us so honorably since the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001        Most of us know that our country has a tradition   since World War II   of offering educational assistance to returning veterans   In the 1940s  the first  G I  bill  helped transform notions of equality in American society   The G I  bill program was designed to help veterans readjust to civilian life  avoid high levels of unemployment  and give veterans the opportunity to receive the education and training that they missed while bravely serving in the military        The post World War II G I  bill paid for veterans  tuition  books  fees  and other training costs  and also gave a monthly stipend   After World War II  7 8 million veterans used the benefits given under the original G I  bill in some form  out of a wartime veteran population of 15 million        Let me briefly summarize some of the reforms that are contained in the bill I am introducing today        First  these increased educational benefits will be available to those members of the military who have served on active duty since September 11  2001   In general  to qualify  veterans must have served at least two years of active duty  with at least some period of active duty time served beginning on or after September 11  2001        This legislation also includes those who have served in the Reserve and National Guard  Those who have an aggregate total of 24 months active duty since 9 11 will be eligible for month for month education benefits  Those in the Reserve and National Guard who have been on active duty for 36 months or more will be eligible for the whole benefit        Next  the bill provides for educational benefits to be paid for a duration of time that is linked to time served in the military   Generally  veterans will not receive assistance for more than a total of 36 months  which equals four academic years        Third  as I mentioned a moment ago  my bill would allow veterans pursuing an approved program of education to receive payments covering the established charges of their program  room and board  and a monthly stipend of  1 000   Moreover  the bill would allow additional payments for tutorial assistance  as well as licensure and certification tests        Fourth  veterans would have up to fifteen years to use their educational assistance entitlement   But veterans would be barred from receiving concurrent assistance from this program and another similar program  such as the Montgomery G I  bill program        Finally  under this bill  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would administer the program  promulgate rules to carry out the new law  and pay for the program from funds made available to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the payment of readjustment benefits        Again  I note that the benefits I have outlined today essentially mirror the benefits allowed under the G I  bill enacted after World War II   That bill helped spark economic growth and expansion for a whole generation of Americans   The bill I introduce today likely will have similar beneficial effects   As the post World War II experience so clearly indicated  better educated veterans have higher income levels  which in the long run will increase tax revenues        Moreover  a strong G I  bill will have a positive effect on military recruitment  broadening the socio economic makeup of the military and reducing the direct costs of recruitment        Perhaps more importantly  better educated veterans have a more positive readjustment experience   This experience lowers the costs of treating post traumatic stress disorder and other readjustment related difficulties        The United States has never erred when it has made sustained new investments in higher education and job training   Enacting the Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 is not only the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform  but it also is a strong tonic for an economy plagued by growing disparities in wealth  stagnant wages  and the outsourcing of American jobs        I am a proud veteran who is honored to serve this great nation   As long as I represent Virginians in the United States Senate  I will make it a priority to help protect our brave men and women in uniform
