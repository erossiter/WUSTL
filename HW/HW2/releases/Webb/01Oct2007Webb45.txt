                                                                                                                                                                         Amendments for Wartime Contracting Accountability and Responsible Deployment Cycles Take Center Stage WASHINGTON  DC  The U S  Senate Monday  approved the National Defense Authorization Act  H R  1585  for fiscal year  2008  which includes several key provisions by Senator Jim Webb to support the  troops  veterans and American taxpayers    On the campaign trail last year  I made a commitment to  take the necessary steps to restore basic accountability to our government   said Webb  I talked about reinstituting a World War II era Truman Committee  to investigate waste  fraud and abuse in the Iraq  reconstruction effort  Im proud to say that with an amendment I sponsored along  with Senator McCaskill and my freshman colleagues  we accomplished that goal   This bill is a win for the American taxpayers who deserve real value for their  investment and proper stewardship of their tax  dollars   Webb also fought to provide a safety net for men and  women in uniform by requiring that active duty troops and units have at least as  much time at home as the length of their previous tour in Iraq or Afghanistan   Fifty six Senators voted for Webbs dwell time amendment  which was four votes  short of the 60 needed to break a Republican  filibuster   Webb continued  I regret that my amendment to protect  the well being of our troops through fair rotation cycles  which received a  clear majority of 56 votes in the Senate  did not reach the number of votes to  break a Republican filibuster  I will continue the fight to ensure that the  leadership we provide our men and women in uniform is equal to the standards  that we constantly set for them   The following  measures  sponsored by Senator Webb  were included in the National Defense  Authorization Act     Creation of a Commission on Wartime  Contracting  Senators Webb and Claire McCaskill  D MO   introduced a landmark provision  on behalf of their Senate Democratic freshman  colleagues  to establish an independent  bipartisan Commission to investigate  U S  wartime contracting in  Iraq and Afghanistan     The Commission on Wartime Contracting   inspired by the World War II Truman Committee  will work in partnership with  the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR   The legislation  expands the oversight of the SIGIR to include investigations of wartime  contracting in Iraq and  Afghanistan  not just  Iraq reconstruction  This expansion  is a response to recent reports of contractor abuses  including the latest  federal investigation of Blackwater which has the largest contracts for private  security contractors in Iraq    Greater Oversight of Security  Contractors  Senators Webb and McCaskill filed a second war  contracting amendment that requires the Department of Defense to strengthen its  policies regarding private security contractors  such as Blackwater  The  amendment directs the U S Department of Defense to develop procedures to  maintain records of private security personnel  register vehicles operated by  contractors and report and review and report all incidents where persons are  killed or injured     Preservation of the Tomb of the  Unknown Soldier  Senators Webb and Daniel Akaka  D HI   sponsored an amendment to postpone the replacement of the Tomb of the Unknown  Soldier until an assessment of the current efforts to maintain and preserve the  monument are performed and reported to Congress      Extension of the Electromagnetic  Pulse Commission  Senators Webb and  John Warner sponsored an amendment to extend the work of a commission which  assesses the vulnerability of the U S  military and civilian systems to  an electromagnetic pulse attack  The Commissions final report will be provided to Congress by November  30  2008  This allows the commissions technical research and analysis to be  conducted for another year at the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Dahlgren Division  Va    The bill includes a measure  co sponsored by Senator  Webb  to restore full benefits to surviving spouses of military retirees  by  eliminating the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation offset to the Survivor  Benefit Plan  The bill also prohibits DOD from increasing health care fees   under TRICARE  for active duty and retired military  servicemembers Additionally  the bill authorizes concurrent receipt to  restore full retired pay to disabled veterans  whose pay is currently reduced by  the amount of disability compensation
