   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   March 22  2007 Senator Webb s Address to the National Press Club                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 REMARKS AS PREPARED      It is a great honor for me to join you here at the National Press Club for your Newsmakers Luncheon   This is the second time I have done this   The last time  19 years ago when I was Secretary of the Navy  I got into a little bit of trouble   I had decided to talk about the future of our foreign policy and the force structure issues of all of the military services  which a few people in the White House and the State Department thought was above my pay grade as someone who was responsible only for the Navy   So I ll try to stay out of trouble today        I have been fortunate to have a varied career   But let me start by saying that  of all the professional experiences that shape my approach to government  two stand out   The first is having commanded infantry Marines in combat   Nothing else I ve ever done can match the sobering sense of responsibility that comes from making daily decisions that directly affect the lives of others  including Marines on the one hand  and the civilian noncombatants who populated much of our battlefield on the other         The second has been the many years I have spent as a writer   There is another type of accountability in play when one writes   It is the accountability of having to marshal facts  to make judgments  and then to put one s name behind the words that go onto the written page   Writing is a tough business   The self discipline it requires brings to mind the many years I spent as a boxer   the regimen is solitary  and only you know how hard you re really pushing yourself   And you have a personal accountability for your product  on which you can be judged for the rest of your life         Suffice to say that one of the titles that I am proudest of is that of journalist   The work that I did for the News Hour  and the reporting I ve done for various newspapers and magazines   and I d especially mention Parade  for whom I ve written from such places as Japan  the Philippines  Thailand  Vietnam and Afghanistan   is some of the most important work of my career   I have a lot of friends and colleagues in this club  and I am proud of   most    of them       In the last few weeks  Americans have been reminded of the extraordinary importance of a free press to the success of democratic government   The reporting that Dana Priest and Ann Hull have done on the outpatient care at Walter Reed has made this government more accountable  and in the process  they ll help ensure better care for the nation s wounded veterans        I know that the most interesting part of these lunches is usually the question and answer period  and I want to leave plenty of time for that   But I d like to share with you a few thoughts on these first months of the 110th Congress and my role in it       To do that  let me start not with the actions thus far in the Senate  but with the beginning of my campaign last year  A year ago today I had literally no money   I had no political base whatsoever  in either party   My opponent had just received the highest number of votes in a presidential poll taken during the Conservative Political Action Conference   I was 33 points behind in the polls   My political credentials were viewed with unease by both sides   On the one hand I had spent four years as a Republican Committee counsel in the House of Representatives and four years in the Reagan Administration  which did not exactly warm the hearts of many Democrats   On the other I had helped the United Mine Workers during their landmark 1989 strike against the Pittston Coal Company and I had been an early and vocal critic of the Bush Administration s Iraq War policy  which did endear me to the hearts of many Republicans         What we did have was a strong belief that it was time for the Reagan Democrats to return to their Jacksonian roots  and a message that I care deeply about  which we conveyed with relentless discipline   It is a message that I believe should be a continuing part of the national debate  and in fact should become the core message of a revitalized Democratic Party   I ve said many times that this nation is going through a sea change in terms of party politics  and that the old labels simply don t work anymore   The political cards are being reshuffled  all across this country   Good  well meaning people have watched their government flub things up  from Iraq to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina   They want better leadership  and they want new approaches       And so  in the campaign I talked about deeper themes rather than mere political issues    We never simply talked about Iraq   Instead  we spoke repeatedly  and in depth  about the need to re orient our nation s national security posture in a way that would allow us not only to withdraw our forces from Iraq  but also to restore a measure of stability in that historically volatile region  to increase our ability to fight the war against international terrorism  and to more properly address the wide range of strategic and foreign policy issues that have been dangerously ignored over the past five years          We didn t simply dwell on this bill or that regarding unemployment  lack of medical insurance  and the need to increase the minimum wage   We talked about the larger need for economic fairness and social justice  in an era where far too much power and money has gravitated to the very top  in both economic and governmental terms   I took great pains to outline the dangers in what I have come to call the  three America s    a breakdown of our country along class lines  the likes of which we have not seen for more than a hundred years   What are those three Americas   In the past twenty years we have seen a huge migration of wealth to the very top of our society  at the same time we have calcified at the bottom into what could soon become a permanent underclass  and at the same time the large group in the middle are receiving less than their fair share of the fruits of their labor         And finally  in the wake of such seriously under examined issues as the NSA wiretapping scandal  the failure of leadership during and after Hurricane Katrina  and the billions of dollars we have wasted in reconstructing Iraq  we talked about the need to restore simple accountability to our government  to make sure that the federal system works in the way our forefathers conceived it  and to ensure also that our taxpayers get real value for their investment       In short  we offered voters context  in a time when far too much political energy was being wasted on contrived  emotionally divisive issues such as flag burning  gay marriage and focus group tested phrases such as  cut and run         We did something else that was a bit different   I was guided by my own sense of values and political instincts rather than polls and focus groups  and I think the voters understood that   We did our best to keep our message consistent  even when this gave our political advisers serious heartburn   I spoke directly about corporate responsibility to corporate leaders   I became the first statewide candidate in Virginia history to walk a union picket line during a campaign  even though Virginia is 48th in the country in terms of union membership   I spoke openly on the Tim Russert show and during televised debates about my views that affirmative action was originally intended to help African Americans remove the badges of slavery  and that many of its present policies tend to hurt not only poor blacks but poor whites as well          A lot of commentators were saying that I was naive   Others were saying that I was a one issue candidate   Still others were saying that my opponent made such serious errors that he was responsible for his own defeat   Allow me to respond  first  that one issue candidates don t beat strong incumbents   this was proven in Connecticut   And second  while it might have been risky  it was not na  ve to have recognized that our voters have become disgusted with the cynicism of modern day politics   We gambled on the likelihood that people in this country truly desire a clear and unambiguous approach to governing  and we won   And I am committed to doing my best to bring about that reality         Iraq and Iran      I ve had a very busy two and a half months since taking office  particularly given my assignments on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees   We have held an exhaustive series of hearings to examine the way forward on Iraq and in the region writ large   Nearly all the expert testimony concluded that a sustained  meaningful diplomatic engagement was necessary to solve the crisis   I have been advocating this approach for three years  since well before I decided to run for the Senate   I believe the weight of this testimony  plus the reality of a Congress now controlled by the Democratic Party  has been a prime reason that the Administration is now beginning to pursue stronger diplomacy in the region rather than continuing its one dimensional military approach       I have long believed that an integral part of our strategy in Iraq must include engagement with all of Iraq s neighbors  including Iran and Syria  As Iraq s neighbors  they are stakeholders in both the future of Iraq and the need for stability in the region  We began to see this approach come to fruition earlier this month in Baghdad  and the minister level meeting scheduled for next month is a hopeful sign that I and others will be watching closely        On another note  I do not believe one can speak of our responsibility on these immediate issues without stating clearly our concerns about the entire region  and especially the administration s position regarding its constitutional authority to use military force outside of Iraq        I ve authored a bill in the Senate which would prohibit the use of funds for commencing a wider war against Iran without congressional authorization  This legislation is carefully drawn  with exceptions that will allow our military to defend itself against attacks based in Iran  including directly pre empting those kinds of attacks  and including hot pursuit into Iranian territory if our military is attacked by forces that might withdraw into Iran   It takes no options off the table with respect to our long held positions regarding Iran s nuclear program or our demand that Iran recognize Israel   Its major function is to prevent this Administration from commencing a broad range of unprovoked military activities without the approval of the Congress   And for the good of our federal system  I believe this legislation should be passed       We have other tools available   Sanctions are clearly already working to isolate Iran s present leadership from the outside world and from its own people   And unilateral military activity should only be undertaken as a true last resort   the unfortunate situation in Iraq is clear testimony to the consequences of careless aggression   Properly balanced  robust diplomacy will enable us to bring greater stability to the region  to remove the American military from Iraq  to increase our ability to defeat the forces of international terrorism  and  finally  to focus on the true strategic challenges that face us around the world       Accountability      With the Democratic majorities in Congress  we ve also seen a renewal of the kind of healthy oversight that is critical to accountability in government   Americans are yearning for a government that inspires confidence and achieves results   They deserve oversight and accountability on a wide host of issues  from the exorbitant cost of this war  including billions of dollars worth of no bid contracts  the evolution of a quasi military Praetorian guard filled with 100 000 civilian contractors who are accountable to no one  to the arrogance of this administration on such issues as NSA wiretapping and selective dismissals of US attorneys  and finally to the lamentable inattention given to those who are still waiting for the Gulf coast to be revitalized in the wake of Hurricane Katrina       I have already mentioned my concerns about the care our veterans receive  and a story first broken not through congressional oversight but through the media   I have no doubt that aggressive oversight by the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs  committees will hasten the kind of corrective measures we need to take in the coming months   As someone who has spent most of his adult life working with and helping our veterans  I m also hoping that the congress will pass a meaningful GI Bill for those who have served since 9 11   The first piece of legislation I introduced in the Senate  S 22  is a GI Bill that will give our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans the same educational benefits as those who returned home from World War II   I believe they have earned it       Economic Fairness      Finally  a word about fundamental fairness  and the anxiety that many Americans feel about their economic future        Last month  I spent three days traveling in the far southwestern part of my state   It was my first visit back to Southwest Virginia since the campaign   What struck me during that visit was how the worries of families in these small towns seems to have actually deepened since last fall       We visited with union coal miners  defense industry workers  high technology workers  and retirees throughout the region   People in many parts of my state are seeing an economy in which more and more manufacturing jobs are moving overseas     where the purchasing power of families has declined or stated flat     where heating and electric bills have suddenly skyrocketed    and where more and more of our people lack health insurance       Even an area like Hampton Roads  which has traditionally been strong because of defense industries  last year saw the decision to close a major Ford truck plant in Norfolk  with thousands of good  high paying jobs now heading overseas       These fears have caused many Americans to question the basic fairness of our economic system   Many of you are familiar with the warning signs I have spoken about  but they are worthy of repeating here       Top 1  now takes in an astounding 16  of national income  up from 8  in 1980       Corporate profits in this country are at an all time high as a percentage of national wealth  while wages and salaries are at all time lows       Today s CEOs make 400 times more than the average worker   compared to 20 times the average when I graduated form college       47 million Americans lack health insurance       Fewer and fewer of our people own stocks  and of those that do  their holdings are smaller than they were a generation ago       Almost equally important  many leaders are seemingly indifferent to these trends   Some even maintain that this growth in income inequality is a form of economic Darwinism  and that it should not be a source of governmental concern       Our nation shows other serious strains as well    I ve long been concerned about the staggering prison incarceration rates in the United States  which are higher than any other nation in the world   Speaking of reporting  23 years ago I was the first American journalist allowed inside the Japanese prison system   Even then I wrote of my concern that the incarceration rate in this country was the highest in what we then called the  free world    with nearly 700 000 people in prison   Today our country has more than two million people in prison  and more than 7 million under some form of correction supervision when one includes probation and parole   A black male who does not finish high school now has a 60 percent chance of going to jail   One who has finished high school has a 30 percent chance       We want to keep bad people off our streets   We want to break the backs of gangs  and we want to cut down on violent behavior   But there s something else going on when we re locking up such a high percentage of our people  marking them at an early age and in many cases eliminating their chances for a productive life as full citizens   This is what I call a  trajectory  issue   It will take years of energy to sort it out   But I am committed to working an a solution that is both responsive to our needs for law and order  and fairer to those who become entangled in this system       It is a matter of self interest for all Americans   including the so called elites    to recognize the dangers of our present course   It s simply not healthy for a democracy like ours to have such a wide gulf between the rich  the poor  and the vast majority of hard working  productive people in between       As many commentators have pointed out  if left unchecked the division of our society along class lines threatens to usher in an era of protectionism and political unrest   I am determined to do everything I can to advance a progressive agenda that addresses the issues surrounding economic fairness and social justice   I believe we can work toward solutions that keep the United States economy strong and engaged in the rest of the world  but which also safeguard the rights of workers and the environment     Passage of legislation to increase the minimum wage is a good first step  but we clearly will have even more opportunities  as for instance during the consideration of tax and trade legislation     the budget     and educational reform   And finally  let me just say that I firmly believe we have just assembled the finest staff in the United States Senate    a word about the staff    We stand ready to serve the interests of the country  to take care of the needs of our constituents in Virginia  and to respond  as best we can  to the inquiries of the Fourth Estate   without which  as I well know from having worked on your side of the podium  we would not be able to function properly as a free society  in the open air of free debate       Thank you
