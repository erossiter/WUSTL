Republican Protection of Big Oil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC Senator Jim Webb today said that last nights passage of the Energy  Independence and Security Act will stimulate our domestic economy  increase  national security by making the United States more energy  self reliant  and improve environmental standards  The bill now goes to the  House for final passage and then onto the President to sign into  law   The bill also included provisions from two research  bills  S  731 and S  962  that Senator Webb co sponsored to increase investment  in carbon capture and storage technologies    Generations of Virginians know the value of coals role  as a domestic energy source  said Senator Webb  Sequestration holds potential  for Virginias  vast coal reserves to be used in an efficient and environmentally sound manner  well into the future  I am pleased to see that the measures on carbon capture  and storage were successfully retained in the Energy  Bill   Although there were additional proposals that I would  have liked to see in the bill  I believe this legislation  in the end  will  improve national security and stimulate our economy through the development of  renewable fuels produced here at home  continued Webb     My biggest disappointment was that the Republicans in  the Senate voted to strip language from the bill that would have closed  13  billion in tax loopholes for the oil companies  said Webb  At a time when oil  company profits are at an all time high and gas is over  3 a gallon  Im having  a hard time understanding their logic    The bill calls for an increase in the use of ethanol   escalating production from 8 5 billion gallons of ethanol next year to 36  billion gallons by 2022  21 billion gallons of this new renewable fuel  requirement must come from advanced biofuels  such as switchgrass  It also  contains key provisions to diversify our nations renewable energy resources    Diversification of our sources of ethanol is essential to lowering the high  price of corn  which is adversely affecting key sectors of Virginias agriculture  community and consumers   The major  provisions in the National Energy and Environmental Security Act of 2007  supported by Senator Webb include     Carbon Capture and Storage Research  and Development  The bill authorizes  a nationwide assessment of geological formations capable  of sequestering carbon dioxide underground  and expands research and development  by authorizing no less than seven large volume sequestration tests in a variety  of different geological formations  It would establish a program to demonstrate  technologies for the large scale capture of carbon dioxide from industrial  sources  Senator Salazar sponsored S  731 which requires the national  assessment  and was a co sponsor of S  962  which expands carbon capture and  storage research  development and demonstration  programs    Cellulosic Biofuel  Research and Development  The bill ensures that  biofuels  facilities built after the date of enactment achieve at  least a 20 percent reduction in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions  It also  creates grants for 10 eligible entities for the research and development of  cellulosic ethanol and biofuels  In addition  this legislation creates  provisions for cellulosic and other feedstock that promote sustainable use of  resources and to facilitate local and on farm use of these materials  Also  this  bill establishes a program for biorefineries that use corn based ethanol to be  retrofitted to accept a range of feedstock  Senator Salazar was a co sponsor of  S  987 that led to these increased biofuel requirements and directs the DOE to  study the state of technology and availability of advanced biofuels  and the  feasibility of increasing nationwide consumption of  ethanol    Renewable Fuel  Standard  RFS   Under the bill  the expanded  renewable fuels  standard  RFS  requires 9 billion gallons of renewable  fuels in 2008 and progressively increases to a 36 billion gallon requirement for  cars and trucks by 2022  After 2010  an increasing proportion of the RFS will be  met from cellulosic sources that will diversify energy crops and use non food  crops  such as switchgrass  It also includes environmental safeguards to reduce  carbon emissions  This plan also includes incentives to boost the production of  biofuels and the number of Flex Fuel and other alternative fuel vehicles      Increased CAFE  Standards  Increases fuel economy to 35 miles per  gallon by  2020 and include passenger cars and light trucks in the  fleet average  the first time the fuel economy standards have been increased  since 1975  After 2020  fuel economy must improve at the maximum feasible rate  each year until 2030  It is estimated that by 2025  the fuel economy increases  for cars and light duty trucks could  Save 2 million barrels of oil saved per  day  or nearly the amount of oil imported by the United States today from the  Persian Gulf  Reduce emissions from motor vehicles by 17 percent below projected  levels  or the equivalent of taking 28 million of todays vehicles off the road  in one year  and save American families  700    1000 per year at the pump   depending on driving habits   based on a  3 00 gas price   By 2025  the  standards are estimated to save consumers  53 billion in net consumer savings in  that year alone  a savings that will continue to increase in subsequent  years
