   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   May 24  2007 Statement of Senator Webb on Passage of the Iraq Supplemental Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   The following is a statement from Senator Jim Webb regarding the Iraq War supplemental spending bill that has been passed by both houses of Congress         I worked very hard to try to persuade the Democratic leadership to include clear  restrictive language in this Supplemental   I did not succeed  and was disappointed in many of the provisions that remained   However  we are working under the reality that  on the issue of Iraq  this Senate does not have a Democratic majority   From the outset  we are a minority of 49  given Senator Lieberman s position on the war   This reality dictates our conduct   On the one hand  I find myself unable to vote against a measure that is necessary to fund our troops who are now in harm s way   On the other  I will not relent from my continuing efforts to bring this occupation to an end         I will continue to press for a strategy of strong diplomatic engagement  which will enable us to end the occupation of Iraq  to increase regional stability  to fight international terrorism more effectively  and to address our broad strategic interests around the world         My efforts will continue with the Defense Authorization Bill  which will soon be debated on the Senate floor   This week  I introduced a restrictive amendment during the Armed Services Committee s mark up of that bill   I withdrew the amendment during the mark up process due to a technical objection  but I intend to offer this amendment on the floor of the Senate when the Defense Authorization bill comes up for debate in the coming weeks
