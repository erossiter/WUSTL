   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   September 27  2007 WEBB MCCASKILL AMENDMENT WINS APPROVAL FOR LANDMARK WARTIME CONTRACTING ACCOUNTABILITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Freshman Class  legislation will crack down on defense contracting abuses WASHINGTON  D C   A landmark provision sponsored by U S   Senators Jim Webb  D VA   Claire McCaskill  D MO  and their seven Senate  Democratic freshman colleagues won unanimous approval in the Senate today  The  provision  to establish an independent  bipartisan Commission to investigate  U S  wartime contracting in  Iraq and Afghanistan  was debated during  consideration of the Defense Authorization Act  which authorizes funding for the  U S  Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008   This is an historic moment  said Webb  On the  campaign trail last year  we talked about the need to restore basic  accountability to our government  We talked about the need to ensure that the  federal government works in an honest and efficient mannerand that American  taxpayers get real value for their investment  Today  were one step closer to  that goal    Senator Webb continued  Our colleagues sent an  unequivocal signal that its high time we rein in the waste  fraud and abuse in  wartime contracts in Iraq and  Afghanistan   Never before in U S   history have we seen such waste  fraud  and abuse  costing the American people  billions of dollars  This amendment is not about politics  its about reform   It is about looking forward and finding a way to contract that is fiscally  responsible while still protecting the strength of our military  said Senator  McCaskill   The American taxpayer is footing the bill for the wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan and we have an obligation  to ensure that their money is spent only for what is necessary to equip our  troops or rebuild local infrastructure  I am deeply concerned by reports of  fraud  abuse and waste  and I want to establish a mechanism    isolated from the  political process  that will ensure U S  dollars are spent as intended  said  Senator Benjamin L  Cardin   The evidence is clear that taxpayers are being ripped  off for billions of dollars in no bid contracts awarded to Halliburton and other  firms  Senator Bernie Sanders said  Astonishingly  we know that  9 billion  spent on private contractors in Iraq is missing  We owe it to  taxpayers to take a long  hard look at the conduct of  contractors   Tens of billions of taxpayer dollars have gone to  private contractors who operate outside the rules  The result has been chaos   projects never completed  dollars never accounted for  and benchmarks never met   We have wasted too much money on private contractors  and if they cant be  trusted with our dollars  then they shouldnt be doing business with this  country  said Senator Sherrod Brown   As a former Pennsylvania Auditor General  I know  firsthand the need to aggressively root out waste in government  said Senator  Bob Casey  But it is especially egregious for companies doing business in  Iraq to profit from fraud and abuse  for taxpayer dollars to be lost as our troops are in harms  way   This proposal is long overdue  said Senator Amy  Klobuchar  Again and again we have seen contractors wastefully spend  hard working American taxpayer dollars while this Administration sat idly by   enough is enough  When I was a county attorney  we always said  follow the  money and youll find the bad guys  This Commission will follow the money and  it will make sure people are held accountable for waste  fraud  and  abuse   Iraq  is a target rich environment for corruption  and monitoring the expenditure of  U S  resources requires vigilance   said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  This Commission will ensure that the billions  of dollars provided for reconstruction in Iraq are accounted for  so the hard earned money  U S  taxpayers provide will serve the  purposes we intend  for the benefit of both the American and the Iraqi  people   For too long weve heard horror stories of waste  fraud  and abuse by government contractors  Montana taxpayers work too hard to subsidize  this kind of greed  said Senator Jon Tester  The wars we fight and shed blood  for are not for profit  This legislation brings long overdue accountability and  real change to the way American contractors do business in Iraq and Afghanistan   The commission created by this amendment will  significantly increase transparency and accountability  and address  longstanding  systemic problems with defense contracting by studying and  investigating the impact of the governments growing reliance on civilian  contractors to perform wartime functions  Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan now outnumber U S   troops   Inspired by the legacy of Harry Truman  who established  a committee to fight wartime contracting abuse when he was a freshman in the  U S  Senate  the Senators legislation creates a Commission on Wartime  Contracting that will assess the extent of waste  fraud  abuse  and  mismanagement of wartime contracts  and the extent to which those responsible  have been held accountable  The Truman Committee conducted hundreds of  hearings and investigations into government waste  saving American taxpayers  more than  15 billion  1943 dollars    The modern Commission on Wartime Contracting would work  in partnership with the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction   SIGIR   The legislation expands the oversight of the SIGIR to include  investigations of wartime contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan  not just Iraq  reconstruction  This expansion is in response to recent reports of contractor  abuses  including the latest federal investigation of Blackwater which had the  largest contracts for private security contractors in Iraq     Congressmen John Tierney  D MA  introduced language  similar to the Webb McCaskill amendment in the House of Representatives today as  a stand alone bill  The bipartisan  bicameral measure has also attracted the  support of taxpayer watchdog groups including  the Project on Government  Oversight  Taxpayers for Common Sense  the Government Accountability Project   OMBWatch  Common Cause  U S  PIRG and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America    Specifically  the  amendment    Establishes an  independent  bipartisan eight member Commission on Wartime Contracting to study  and investigate federal agency contracting for   1  the reconstruction of  Iraq and Afghanistan   2  the logistical  support of coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom  and  3  the performance of security and intelligence functions in  Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom       Expands the Special  Inspector General for Iraq Reconstructions  SIGIRs  jurisdiction beyond Iraq  Reconstruction and Relief Funds to other wartime contracts executed in support  of either Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom  In  consultation with the Commission  the newly expanded SIGIR will conduct audits  of wartime support contracts for logistics and security functions in  Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as reconstruction contracts  in Afghanistan  The collaborative  effort between the Commission  SIGIR  and the inspectors general of other  federal agencies is designed to lead to specific findings and recommendations to  improve inter agency wartime contracting  among other things       Requires a study and  investigation into the impact of the governments growing reliance on civilian  contractors to perform wartime functions  The commission will assess the extent  of waste  fraud  abuse  and mismanagement of wartime contracts  and the extent  to which those responsible have been held accountable  The number of contractors   180 000  now exceeds the number of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan  156 247
