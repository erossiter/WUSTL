   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   August 1  2007 Floor Speech of Senator Jim Webb on Amendment to the Children s Health Insurance Program Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mr  President  I strongly support this  bill  As an initial matter  Id like to express my thanks to Senators Baucus and  Grassley for their hard work on this bipartisan bill  which will help provide  health insurance to millions of children nationwide and hundreds of thousands of  children in my home state of Virginia   For too long in this country  low income  families have been unable to afford health insurance for their children   Reauthorizing this program helps meet this urgent need  Unfortunately  this  bill does so by singling out one form of conduct  tobacco smoking  and then  taxing many of the very same people that the program is intended to  assist   Not only are lower income workers more  likely to smoke  they spend a greater percentage of their income on tobacco when  they do  Because an estimatedhalf  of American smokers come from the same income groups as thosefamilies that are  eligible for this program  in my view  Mr  President  this amounts to robbing  Peter to pay Paul   Additionally  the  very form of conduct that we are supposedly attempting to discourage has become  the same form of conduct that we are implicitly hoping will continue in order to  finance this program  I find this logic odd  Mr  President  At some level I  find it counter productive to the very goals of the legislation that is before  us  And heres another problem  This is a targeted tax on commercial  transactions that are disproportionately engaged in by people with lower  incomes   At the same time   our country is experiencing a vast accumulation of wealth amongst our highest  income earners  Income disparities are at levels that we have not seen for at  least 70 years  Moreover  corporate profits are at an all time high as a  percentage of our national wealth  while wages and salaries on our working  people are at an all time low  There is  in my view  a better way  a fairer way  to pay for this program   That is why I have  introduced this amendment  Under the federal tax code  American corporations are allowed to  defer payment of American taxes on the profits earned by their overseas  subsidiaries  Under current law  taxes on the business income of foreign  subsidiaries are not payable until the profits are repatriated back to the  American parent corporation  In reality  this means they are not going to be  paid at all   Companies can defer  ever paying taxes in the United States by keeping their income  overseas and making money from it indefinitely  The tax code  in other words   creates an incentive to move jobs overseas  to not to invest in  U S  operations  and also provides a  method to shelter overseas profits from fair  taxation   One recent example  recently reported by the New York Times  a major biotech corporation with  offshore subsidiaries used U S  tax laws to escape hundreds of  millions in taxes that should have gone into the American Treasury  Although  this corporation reported that 80  of its billions of dollars of sales occurred  in the United  States  it paid only 22 percent of American  taxes on its profits  This corporation got away with this specifically because  of American tax policies  like many other corporations do  today   My amendment would  eliminate this deferral provision in the tax code  This critical reform would  discourage these companies from moving American investments and jobs to foreign  tax havens and raise the revenue necessary to expand the Childrens Health  Insurance Program  This reform also would protect American workers by reversing  the consistent flow of American jobs that corporations are outsourcing  abroad    I have been unable at this point to receive  an official estimate of the revenues that this amendment would raise  but I have  consulted multiple credible sources  and have no doubt this would raise the new  funds needed under the new policy which are approximately  7 billion per year   These sources include    The Joint Committee on Taxation which  estimated last year would raise  6 4 billion in 2008 and rise to  7 5 billion by  2010  It also includes the Presidents own budget proposal for fiscal 2008 which  estimates that tax expenditures for the deferral of income of this sort would be   12 8 billion in 2008 and rise to  16 7 billion in 2012      Opponents say deferral is needed to double  taxation but that is a disingenuous argument  American corporations investing  overseas currently receive a federal tax credit for their payment of foreign  taxes up to 35 percent  My amendment does not affect the availability of this  credit  and therefore would not result in double taxation  Nor does my  amendment affect in any way the current provisions regarding allocation of  corporate expenses  which are related but separate   Some opponents  might contend this is a new tax  But this is not a new tax  This is a  way to reclaim monies that already should have been paid into the National  Treasury by companies earning skyrocketing profits  This amendment closes a  loophole   Mr  President  the Childrens Health  Insurance Program is probably the greatest achievement of our congress in terms  of health coverage in the past decade  It has provided cost effective health  coverage to more than 137 000 children in Virginia in 2006 and millions of children  across the country  reducing the number of uninsured children by one third  We  must  however  further strengthen our investment in childrens health coverage   Millions of children remain uninsured   That is why I support this legislation  I  urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to help children from Americas low income families  But I  respectfully argue that we need to do so not with a regressive tax on  people who have little ability to pay  but instead  by eliminating a corporate  tax provision that will be one small step toward restoring the fairness in our  society  in reinforcing the proper notions of how our government should operate   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment  I yield the floor
