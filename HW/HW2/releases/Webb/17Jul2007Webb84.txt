   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   July 17  2007 Floor Remarks on Levin Reed Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As Prepared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Before I speak about Iraq  I believe it is  important to mention another issue at play here tonight  What does it mean to  have majority rule in a democracy    Harry Reid and Dick Durbin are right   There is no justifiable reason for us to be denied an up or down majority vote  on this and other issues  Why should it take more than 60 percent of the  members of the Senate to decide a matter of policy   If it took 60 votes to be in the Senate   most of us wouldnt be talking tonight   I support this amendment  I have  reservations about certain parts of it  and I want to make them clear  But I do  intend to vote for it and I suggest to my colleagues that they do  likewise    The strength of this amendment  is that it mandates a turn around in our current operational policy  It would  be wrong to call the surge a strategy  It is not a strategy in traditional  terms  It is simply one more in a long line of operational experiments that  have kept our military forces in the middle of a problem that  in the end  will  only be resolved by the Iraqis themselves     The concerns I have about this  amendment are twofold  First  it does not explicitly state that this transition  of missions is only an intermediate step toward an eventual  and necessary   American withdrawal from Iraq  As such  it could be interpreted as a  ratification of the idea that we should keep long term bases in Iraq       Second  the amendment does not  really specify the nature of this transition of missions  except in the broadest  terms  As a result  this Administration could conceivably choose a very minimal  withdrawal and then claim that it is within the intent of the  amendment    And there is another  vital point that  needs to be raised tonight  For the good of the country  we in the congress  need to find a way to come together  on both sides of the aisle  and work toward  a solution that will end our presence in Iraq  increase the stability of that  region  increase our ability to fight international terrorism around the world   and allow the United States to focus on the larger strategic issues that have  been neglected in large part for more than five years   This is the political version of the World  War One Battle of the Somme  Both sides of the aisle continue to pound on each  other  neither side yielding  with little or no ground being gained by either  side  and little good coming to the country despite all of the energy and  frustration      In World War One  great nations lost  their influence and inevitably their place in the world because neither side  knew how to do anything except slog directly into each other  again and again   for years  This is hardly the blood bath of World War One  but the implications  for our country are just as severe  We are spending away our national treasure   burning up good people  losing the good will of other nations  and have in many  ways lost the moral high ground that has always characterized the United States  in the eyes of other nations  We in the congress owe the country a better way   And that way begins with an honest  logical approach to the issues we face in  Iraq   Heres what we do know    1  The invasion of Iraq was a  strategic blunder of historic proportions    2  Nothing that has happened  since the invasion has been particularly surprising  In fact most of it was  both predictable  and predicted    3  International terrorism  has increased  not decreased  as the result of our invasion and occupation of  Iraq  The presence of the United States military in Iraq is now the number one  recruitment tool for Al Queda    4  It is not to the advantage  of our nation or of our military to continue down the road of repetitive  military operations without strong  regionally based diplomacy that might  capitalize on our military effort  This has been the major failing of this  Administration from the very first days of the Iraq invasion  It is wrong  and  unjust  to claim that success or failure in Iraq is largely the province of our  military    5  This is not a classic  counter insurgency effort  as many on the other side have portrayed it  A  counter insurgency requires a defined and understandable insurgency that can be  countered  In Iraq we are facing a many headed sectarian and intra sectarian  confrontation  made even more complex by the presence of outside terrorist  forces who have come to Iraq purely because the United States invaded and  occupied the country  How does one build a counter insurgency doctrine to  handle that  particularly when there is no real central government that would  provide a safe haven toward which citizens should move  It wont happen  any  more than it happened in Lebanon in the 1980s under similar  circumstances    6  Its no accident that this  complex situation has resulted in more than 4 million Iraqi refugees since our  invasion  Half of those have left their homes and are internal refugees inside  their own country  The other half are flooding adjacent countries  particularly  Jordan  straining national resources in those countries and threatening their  ability to maintain local order   Theres another reality  which despite all  of the flag waving rhetoric we tend to ignore when it comes to our military   Weve watched as the finest maneuver force in the world has been put into  situations again and again  in circumstances where they are on the defensive  or  are sitting ducks for IEDs as they drive their convoys through territory that is  easily penetrated by guerrilla forces  Weve deployed them again and again   taking advantage of their professionalism and good will until now we have  reached the absurd reality that many of our soldiers and Marines are spending  more time in Iraq than they are at home  This is breaking our military force   threatening retention  and could affect our ability to act elsewhere in the  world   And heres what else we know  this vital  region is in deep trouble  partly because of our invasion and occupation  and  partly because this Administration has failed miserably on the diplomatic front  even as our military has given us every ounce of its courage  dedication and  proficiency    Iran  Turkey  Saudi Arabia  Jordan  The American navy in the  Persian Gulf  Israel   Palestine  Hezbollah  Syria  Al Queda  the most recent  National Intelligence Estimate  Only under the steady hand of strong   creative diplomacy  with our military as our safety net rather than our  principal instrument of policy  can we begin to resolve these many crises  This  is what history teaches us  and history has been too often ignored     It can be done  as in our recent approach  to the situation in Korea   It needs to be done  And the passage of  this amendment will help it get done   Mr  President  I yield the  floor
