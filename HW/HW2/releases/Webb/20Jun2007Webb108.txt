   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 20  2007 Webb Calls for Sufficient Funding to Address Threatened Employment Commission Office Closings Across Virginia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Secretary of Labor Dept  recognizes   funding has been inadequate  Washington   DC  Senator Webb today sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting an additional  300 million in funding for the administration of the nations unemployment insurance  UI  system to remedy the Bush Administrations failure to adequately fund the program  The request increases the Administrations proposed budget for the UI system from  2 6 billion to  2 9 billion   The lack of federal funding has deeply impacted the ability of the Virginia government to provide services to the unemployed  forcing the Virginia Employment Commission to consider closing offices in economically depressed areas   The proposed funding for administering the unemployment insurance program is inadequate  and it stands to hit economically depressed areas of Virginia disproportionately  said Senator Webb  When the Secretary of Labor herself says that states like Virginia have a strong case that funding has been inadequate  Id think we could collectively work to rectify the problem   According to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies  the umbrella for all state agencies that administer unemployment insurance programs  appropriations for state unemployment insurance operations have not been adjusted for inflation since 1995    A copy of the letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee follows    June 19  2007   The Honorable Robert C  Byrd    Chairman  Senate Appropriations Committee S 131 Capitol Building  Washington   DC 20510     The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member   Senate Appropriations Committee    S 146A Capitol Building Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran   I am writing to urge that you include adequate provision in FY 2008 appropriations for funding the administration of the unemployment insurance  UI  system  While the Commonwealth of Virginia has been fortunate to have an overall unemployment rate of approximately 3 2 percent  many rural areas in Virginia have significantly higher unemployment rates  Due to a lack of adequate federal funding  the Virginia Employment Commission plans to close field offices  including in economically depressed areas most in need of assistance  I recommend that you increase this years allocation for the administration of the UI system by  300 million   Funds for administering UI at the state level no longer account adequately for the cost of program operations  I am concerned that President Bushs FY 2008 budget request of  2 561 200 000 for grants to the states for administration of their UI programs  and for national activities necessary to support the administration of the federal state UI system  are insufficient  President Bushs budget request includes a nominal increase from FY 2007 of 2 1 percent   53 500 000  that is outpaced by inflation alone over the past 12 months  Further  even under the Presidents own assumption of 134 7 million weeks of benefits claimed in FY 2008  the Presidents request would be the second smallest per claim allotment since 1986  only surpassed by FY 2007s appropriation    This proposal comes despite mounting evidence that the States have a strong case that administrative funding has been inadequate  as recognized by Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  The evidence that the federal government has been under funding state administration of unemployment insurance is persuasive  Historically  Congress appropriated amounts requested by the Labor Department that reflected state needs fairly accurately  but beginning in the mid 1990s  federal policy changed from reflecting true state costs to limiting annual cost increases  According to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies  appropriations for UI operations have essentially not been adjusted for inflation since 1995    Several years ago  the states and the Department of Labor jointly developed a Resource Justification Model  RJM  that approximates and accounts for estimated state administrative costs for base unemployment insurance program operations  Yet  since use of the RJM in 2002  the President has consistently requested less than the RJM amount and Congress ultimately appropriates an amount similar to the President s request   510 million and  283 million less than needed in FY 2006 and FY 2007  respectively  Despite decreased staffing levels and increased automation with the use of call centers  staff compensation and other program costs have continued to increase  States have indeed increased efficiency where possible  but now face substantial funding shortfalls  Without corrective action  hundreds and perhaps thousands of my constituents in rural Virginia face the distinct possibility of losing access to the Virginia Employment Commission when they need it the most  This will hurt our unemployed workers and their families and impede their efforts to find new jobs   Given these historical shortfalls in funding for the administration of the UI system  I strongly recommend an increase of  300 million in this years allocation  I appreciate your consideration of my request and make my staff available to answer any questions you might have and work with you to adequately fund state administration of UI    Sincerely     United States Senator Jim Webb
