   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 29  2007 Senator Webb s Floor Remarks on his Amendment to the Defense Authorization Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mr  President  when we return were going to be looking  at the Defense Authorization Bill and Im going to be introducing an amendment  when this bill comes up that  in my view  speaks directly to the welfare of our  troops and their families  After four years of combat operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan we still have not  developed the type of operational policy that looks to the welfare of the people  who are having to serve again and again  We have allowed the strategy  such as  it is  which is all over the place  to define the use of our troops and weve  reached the point as we work to resolve our situation in Iraq  and dramatically reduce our presence  I hope    We still are reaching the point where were burning out  our troops  The evidence is everywhere  We have a small group of people who have  been carrying the load for this country again and again  We are violating the  normal rotational policies that we took care to put in place over long years of  experience  Traditionally in the United States military on the active side   theres a two for one ratio  If youre gone for a year  youre back for two  years  If you deploy at sea for six months  youre back for a year and thats not  down time  thats dwell time    When I say its not down time  that means theyre not  sitting around doing nothing when theyre back  When people return from  deployment theyve got to reacquaint themselves with their families  theyve got  to take care of all those sorts of these  They also have to gear their units  back up  get the equipment  train  lock on  go to different training areas  so  the two for one is generally split   a third gone  a third recuperating  and a third getting ready to go    But what we have today in the ground forces  the active  military is not even a one for one  People are returning and immediately  getting ready to go back  We are seeing the wear and tear of this on our armed  forces  The West Point classes of 2000 and 2001 are the most recent canaries in  the coalmine if you want to look at what is happening to the active duty  military because of these continuous deployments and the time that has not been  made available to do other things when they return  West Point classes have a five year obligation before an individual can  leave the military  The West Point classes of 2000 and 2001  which are the two  most recent classes  have an attrition rate that is five times as high as the  attrition rates before the Iraq war  The  class of 2000    West Point class of 2000  had lost 54  of its  members from active duty by the end of last year  I dont know what the number  is for today  The class of 2001  whose active obligation ended as of last June   only last June  by the end of last year within 6 months had lost 46  of its  class   Youre seeing the same in the staff NCO ranks  Were  starting to see it in a way I cant recall since probably the 1970s when  the bottom fell out  particularly the United States Navy due to operational  tempo  In the Guard and Reserve  the normal rotational cycle is five to one  What  were seeing now in the units is less than three to  one   So Im going to introduce a bill  Its basically going  to say that one  the active side  however long an individual has been deployed   they have to be allowed to stay home at least that long before you send them  back  If youre Guard and Reserve  however long youve been deployed  you have  to be able to have been at home at least three times that length before youre  sent back  because of the nature of the Guard and Reserve  In my view  this  amendment is an absolute floor  Its our absolute duty as the fiduciaries of the  wellbeing of the people who serve that we dont let it go beyond that     And just as a point of reference again  Mr  President   in the army right now  they have gone to 15 month tours with only 12 months at  home  when historically if you are gone for 15 months you should have 30 months  at home  This needs to be fixed  I hope that the Senate will overwhelmingly  support us on this    There are 2 questions about this policy that have come  up in my discussions on the Armed Services Committee Hearings  The first from  some is that Is it within the constitution for the Congress to tell the  Commander in Chief what a rotational cycle should look like  My answer to that  is clearly it is in the Constitution where Congress has the power to set these  kinds of regulations  In fact there is precedent  If you look at the situation  in the Korean War  where  because of the emergency of the attack from  North Korea  we were sending  soldiers into Korea who were not trained  There  were soldiers going into Korea who had never fired a weapon  before because they had to fill the billets going over there and the Congress  stepped in and they said you cannot send any military person overseas until  they have been in the military for 120 days  That was the Congress properly  exercising its constitutional prerogative in order to protect our troops and  this is what we are going to do    The second issue that has come up is whether this is  micromanagement and quite frankly when the leadership of the United States military is not stepping up and defending its own people  we have a duty to slow  this thing down  This war has been going on for more than 4 years  Weve got a lot  of issues were going to be discussing in this authorization bill designed to  get a better policy that will reduce our footprint  that will enable us to fight  international terrorism around the world  that will increase the stability of  the region with proper diplomatic efforts and will allow us to address our  strategic interests elsewhere   But  until that happens  weve got to take care  of the troops and this is the bottom line  its a floor   This isnt some grand  scheme of trying to push an ideal troop rotational scenario  This is the bottom  line that we owe to people who have been sent into harms way    I may be one of the few people in this body who has had  a father deploy  who has deployed  and who has had a son deployed  I think that  there are a lot of people out in the country who are that way  who right now are  looking at their loved ones being sent into harms way and are looking for  somebody to put some logic into how their loved ones are being used  and thats  on us  Mr  President  And with that  I yield the  floor
