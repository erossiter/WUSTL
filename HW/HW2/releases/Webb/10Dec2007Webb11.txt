   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   December 10  2007 Webb  Supreme Court Sentencing Decisions Represent Step Forward in Re Examining U S  Criminal Justice System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senator Jim Webb  D VA  issued  the following statement in response to todays U S  Supreme  Court rulings on sentencing guidelines    Todays decisions by the U S  Supreme Court in  Kimbrough v  United  States  and Gall v  United States  represent a positive  and in my view long overdue  development  in this nations system of criminal justice sentencing  Both cases tested the  ability of our federal judges to look beyond strict requirements of federal  sentencing guidelines in drug cases in order to reduce an offenders prison term  when a reduction is plainly justified by the facts  common sense  and  fundamental principles of fairness    There is growing  almost universal agreement that the  disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine is grossly unfair and  has a disproportionately heavy impact on African Americans     This disparity helps explain this nations highest in  the world prison incarceration ratean issue that I attempted to draw to the  forefront in the hearing that I chaired before the Joint Economic Committee  earlier this year    I am hopeful that these decisions represent a first  step at all levels of government to re examine our criminal justice system   Tomorrow  the U S  Sentencing Commission has the opportunity to strike another  blow for fairness when it decides whether the cocaine sentencing disparities can  be safely remedied for some prisoners retroactively  With appropriate  safeguards that would allow non violent offenders a chance at early release  I  urge the Commission to embrace this reform
