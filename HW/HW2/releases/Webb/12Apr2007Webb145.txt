   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   April 12  2007 Webb   There are limits to human endurance and there are limits to what families can put up with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Opening Statement of Senator Webb at Joint Hearing of the Committees on Armed Services and Veterans Affairs I would like to associate myself with the comments that the Senior Senator from Virginia made with respect to this new policy of extending all Army tours in Iraq and Afghanistan to 15 months that was announced yesterday   It has my utmost concern   I m stunned   Quite frankly  I think it s one thing to say that we re putting predictability into systems  and it s another when that predictability is uniformly negative        In my view the strategy does not justify this continuing abuse of people who have put their lives literally in the hands of our leadership  I think there are limits to human endurance and there are limits to what families can put up with        Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England made a comment about retention numbers   We re going to be watching those very closely   Retention numbers that I saw just two days ago with respect to West Point graduates are pretty disturbing   The West Point class of 2000  54  percent of that class have left the military already   The class of  01   46  percent left as soon as their obligation was over   We ve not seen that slide since the mid 70s   I can t remember a slide like this since the Naval Academy class of 1966 whose time expired right in the middle of Cambodia and Kent State  during the Vietnam War        So I think there are  on the one hand  serious concerns about how these policies are affecting the willingness of very fine people to stay in   On the other  I don t see the strategy justifying it   I think that 15 months for a 12 month turnaround here is a bad trade         Senator Hagel and I have put in a bill to adjust that and I hope my colleagues will look at that bill         With respect to the issues on the table here  as many people here know  having personally grown up and served in the military  but I also spent five years in the Pentagon  one year as a Marine  and four years of my life as a staff counsel on the Veterans  Committee dealing with these issues everyday  They are enormously complex issues  and I think and hope that my colleagues and other people will understand that         There is a quadrant here when we re talking about how disability systems go into place   First is the military itself basically looks at who is fit for duty and who is not          Second  the VA system is not designed simply to do that  The VA system is designed to examine people who were injured at some level of disability on active duty  and to track disability as they go through the rest of there lives   So they are not something that you can just meld together   And there are other systems such as PTSD  post traumatic stress syndrome  and TBI  traumatic brain injury  which may not manifest themselves during active duty         I think it s interesting that you mentioned in your comments that you wanted to focus on the wounded and I hope you mean on the wounded and injured  Because somebody who rolls over in a jeep is not technically wounded but they have an immediate injury that should require attention        The other statistic that blew me away was that 89 percent of those being evaluated for disability by the military are those transitioning into retirement according to your number   From my understanding  this wasn t the original intention of this system  that so many people who move to retirement on longevity should be a part of this medical disability system   The assumption was that normal wear and tear wasn t going to go into the disability system         I want to address this to Secretary Cooper  Under Secretary of Benefits  Department of Veterans Affairs    It goes back to the testimony that you gave to the Veterans  Committee the last time that we were together there  We discussed this when we were talking about the need for an analytical matrix to actually solve these problems          I contacted the Department of Veterans Affairs and I asked how many claims adjudicators were actually on the ground   The number came back that there are 5 409 claims adjudicators actually on the ground  and that they are put on the ground on an assumption that they can turn out 109 claims a year   Now  if we do the math on that with a backlog that has been estimated from 400 000 to 600 000 depending on who we re listening to  they can do about 600 000 claims a year   But we know that this is not a static situation   As you know we ve got claims coming in all the time   So my question is what would you need in terms of manpower so that we could actually turn around this backlog
