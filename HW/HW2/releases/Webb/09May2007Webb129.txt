Webb  argued strongly for passage of his proposed G I  Bill for post 9 11 veterans in  the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs hearing today  Introduced on his first  day in office  the legislation seeks to  provide veterans of the 9 11 era with educational benefits similar to those  provided to service members at the end of World War II    Under the legislation  returning service members could  earn up to 36 months of benefits which would include payment of tuition  room  and board  fees and educational costs plus a  1 000 a month stipend while  enrolled in full time training  The Committee is considering a revised version  of S 22  which adds a key provision capping tuition benefits at the highest  in state public university that should significantly lower the cost of the  bill    The Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of  2007 is designed to expand the educational benefits that our nation offers to  the men and women who have served us so honorably since the terrorist attacks of  September 11  2001  said Senator Webb in his opening remarks to the Senate  Veterans Affairs Committee   The United States has never erred when it  has made sustained new investments in higher education and job training  continued Webb  Enacting the Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of  2007 is not only the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform  but it  also is a strong tonic for an economy plagued by growing disparities in wealth   stagnant wages  and the outsourcing of American jobs     To read the full text of Senator Webbs remarks  submitted in the Congressional record  please go to    For audio of the Senators remarks from the hearing   please go to    The legislation is expected for a mark up within the  next month  Senators Bingaman  Boxer  Brown  Durbin  Kerry  McCaskill  Mikulski   Sanders  Stabenow  Tester  and Wyden are co sponsors of the legislation      In written testimony to the Veterans Affairs  Committee   The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United  States said  This legislation enhances military strength  while providing a service members education benefit to aid in transition  assistance and equips a generation of veterans to face the challenges of  tomorrow  We have long advocated a GI Bill in the spirit of the original WW II  bill  which would cover tuition  housing  fees  books  and provide a  cost of living stipend  This legislation accomplishes these goals and moreThe  VFW enthusiastically supports this bill   The Paralyzed Veterans of  America said   PVA supports this bill that would  enhance the current educational benefits for the men and women who have served  on active duty since September 11  2001The bill allows the veteran up to 15  years to take advantage of these benefits  This is an important addition since  many returning veterans may not be emotionally ready right away to start  school  This educational package offers the veteran many incentives to  encourage them to enroll in school or continue with their educational  program   The American Legion said  The American Legion applauds S   22 in that it allows for members of the armed services to receive enhanced  educational benefitsmore in line with today s needs Enactment of this law  will greatly increase the recruitment and retention ability of the branches of  the armed services   NOTE  Senator  Webbs bill has been officially endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars   Vietnam Veterans of America  the Air Force Sergeants Association  and the  Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United  States    See
