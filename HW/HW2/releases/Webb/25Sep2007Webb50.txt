   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   September 25  2007 Floor Statement of Senator Jim Webb on the Kyl Lieberman Iran Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DCSenator Jim Webb  D VA  delivered the following floor remarks today  expressing strong concern for the Kyl Lieberman amendment on Iran offered to the Defense Authorization bill   Audio and video of Senator Webbs remarks are available  Excerpts can be retrieved below    I would like to express my concern about the amendment number 3017  the Kyl Lieberman amendment which  among other things  most troubling would designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act  I think we all have a great deal of concern about the activities of Iran  We have as a nation stood strongly and will continue to speak strongly about those activities and we have taken no options off the table  I fully support all of those precepts    At the same time  I do not believe that any serious student of foreign policy could support this amendment as it now exists  We know there are problems in Iraq  Were trying to decipher the extent of those problems as they relate to Iranian weapons systems and the allegations of covert involvement  We also know that in Iraq  other nations are playing covertly  Saudis  for instance  are said to have the plurality of the foreign insurgents operating in Iraq and a majority of the suicide bombers in Iraq  We also know that there is potential for volatility in the Kurdish area of Iraq with respect to the relation with Turkey    We are addressing these problems  In fact  the whereas clauses in this amendment speaks clearly to how our troops on the ground are addressing these problems  I fought in Vietnam  We had similar problems throughout the Vietnam War because of the location of Vietnam  the propinquity of China    I think it can fairly be said that in virtually every engagement that I was involved in in Vietnam  we were being shot at with weapons that were made either in China or in Eastern Europe  There was a reality to these kinds of wars  and we are addressing those realities  But they need to be addressed in a proper way  Probably the best historical parallel comes from the situation with China during the Vietnam War  China as a rogue state had nuclear weapons  spouted a lot of rhetoric about the United States and had an American war on its border  We created the conditions in which we engaged China aggressively through diplomatic and economic and other means  and we have arguably succeed along with the rest of the world community in bringing China into a proper place in that world community    That is not really what this amendment is about  The first concern that I have when were talking about making the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization is who actually defines a terrorist organization  The Congress  to my knowledge  has never defined a terrorist organization  The State Department defines terrorist organizations  At last count  from the information that I have received  there are 42 such organizations that have been identified by the Sate Department in accordance with the laws of the Congress past    And I would as unanimous consent that this list be inserted in the record as part of my remarks  The second concern that I have is that we as a government have never identified an organization that is part of a nation state as a terrorist organization  From the Senator from Connecticuts statement yesterday  there are potentially as many as 180 000 people in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who are part of a military force of an existing state  By categorizing this organization as a terrorist organization this isnt our present policy of keeping the military option on the table  It is for all practical purposes mandating the military option  Mandating it  It could be read as tantamount to a declaration of war    What do we do with terrorists organizations if they are involved against us  We attack them  What is a terrorist organization as a nongovernmental entity that operates along the creases of international law and does harm to internationally protected people  By the way  its kind of interesting to note that last weekend the Iraqi government claimed that Blackwater is a terrorist organization for the way that it has operated inside Iraq  I am not making that allegation  I am giving an example of how people categorize these groups  The Revolutionary Guards are part of the Iranian government  If they are attacking us  theyre not a terrorist organization  Theyre an attacking army  But are they  Well  Im not really sure about that  If they were  we would be hearing some pretty strong expressions of support    Last weekend  we had Admiral Fallon  who is General Petraeus operational commander  responsible for all of the nations in that region  not simply Iraq  saying that I expect there will be no war  Thats what we ought to be working for  We should find ways through which we can bring countries to work together for the benefit of all  This constant drumbeat of conflict is what strikes me  says Admiral Fallon  Its not helpful  not useful  I expect there will be no war   We have General Petraeus  whose comments are widely quote in the whereas clauses when he was testifying in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee  in his official testimony  he did mention that Iran was using the Quds Force to turn Shiite militias into a Hezbollah like force to fight a proxy war  et cetera  When asked a question about it  he said  the Quds force  we believe by and large that those individuals have been pulled out of the country as had been Lebanese Hezbollah trainers used for that activity  We have the statement of Prime Minister Maliki in todays Washington Post  He says Irans role in fomenting violence diverges from the Administrations opinion  His government has a gun in the dialogue with Iran and Syria  has explained to them that their activities are unhelpful  Our relations with these countries have improved  he said to  the point that theyre not interfering with our internal affairs  Asked about the Revolutionary Guards Forces which the military charges its arming  etc   Maliki said there used to be support through borders fro these militias  but it has ceased to exist    Im not saying all of this is factually 100  right  Im not saying the other side is right  Heres what Im saying we havent had one hearing on this and Im on the Foreign Relations Committee  Im on the Armed Services Committee  We are about to vote on something that may fundamentally change the way that the United States views the Iranian military  and we havent had one hearing  This is not the way to make foreign policy  Its not the way to declare war  although this cleverly worded sense of the Congress could be interpreted that way    Those who regret their vote five years ago to authorize military action in Iraq should think hard before supporting this approach  because in my view  it has the same potential to do harm where many are seeking to do good  The constant turmoil that these sorts of proposals and actions are bringing to the region is counterproductive  They are regrettable substitute for a failure of diplomacy by this Administration  This kind of rhetoric will only encourage the Iranian people to rally around bad leadership because of the fear of foreign invasion  Fear of the outside is the main glue that authoritarian regimes use historically when they face trouble on the inside    Admiral Fallon agrees with this view  the Baker Hamilton report agrees  If you go back to the beginning of the Iraq War in the fall of 2002  five years ago  oil was  24 a barrel  Its  82 a barrel today  The price of gold was below  300  yesterday it was  740  The value of our currency is at an all time low against the Euro and at parity for the first time in 30 years with the Canadian dollar  This proposal is Dick Cheneys fondest pipe dream  Its not a prescription for success  At best  its a deliberate attempt to divert attention from a failed diplomatic policy  At worst  it could be read as a back door method of gaining congressional validation for action without one hearing or without serious debate    I believe that that amendment should be withdrawn so that we can hold sensible hearings and fulfill our duty to truly examine these far reaching issues  If it is not withdrawn  I regrettably intend to vote against it  For an mp4 of excerpted remarks  please visit    For a Flash file of excerpted remarks  please visit
