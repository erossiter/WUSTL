   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 6  2007 Sen  Jim Webb Speech on Legalization Amendment to Immigration Reform Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington   DC  Below are remarks delivered by Senator Webb on his amendment to the immigration reform bill and submitted into the Congressional Record  Audio is available upon request   I rise today to discuss an amendment that I will offer to the immigration reform bill  which will address what I believe are two crucial flaws in this legislation  The first flaw relates to what some people may call amnesty  wherein the bill legalizes almost everyone who entered this country by the beginning of this year  The second flaw relates to an unworkable set of procedures applicable to those who are properly offered legal status  It is important to the health and practicality of our system that these two flaws be addressed   My amendment would achieve three critically important goals  it creates a fair and workable path to legalization for those who have truly put down roots in America  it protects the legitimate interests of all working Americans  and it accords honor and dignity to the concept of true American justice    If one accepts the premises of these three goals  then I strongly believe that this amendment is the best way forward   As a general matter  I agree with my colleagues that the time has come for fair and balanced reform of our broken immigration system  When I say fairness  I mean a system of laws that is fair to everyone here in the United States  and especially our wage earners   I strongly support the provisions in this immigration bill that strengthen our nations borders  Our porous borders are a threat to our national security  and we have waited far too long to fix this problem    I also support the sections of the bill that create tough civil and criminal penalties for employers who unfairly hire illegal immigrants  creating both a second class population and undercutting American workers  The bills employment verification system will help ensure that illegal workers cannot get employment in the United States  and would therefore face little choice but to return to their homelands   As a point of reference  I do not support this bills creation of a massive new temporary worker program  Two weeks ago  I voted to support Senator Dorgans two amendments to strike and sunset that program  and I find it regrettable that the Senate did not adopt those amendments   Weve seen a good bit of analysis on the Senate Floor in recent days to the effect that the temporary worker program will be largely unworkable  To the extent that it would work  it would create a wage based underclass and a bureaucratic nightmare  Furthermore  as I stated on the Floor two weeks ago  I believe that guest worker programs  aside from purely temporary  seasonal work  drive down the wages of hard working Americans  and of those who came here by following the law                 With those points in mind  I now turn to my amendment  which regards the other major component of this bill  the legalization program   My amendment reflects a proposal that I have been discussing with Virginians ever since I began my campaign for the Senate  I have always supported tough border security and cracking down on large employers who hire illegal workers  I also have always supported a path to legalization for those who came here during a time of extremely lax immigration laws  but who have laid down strong roots in their communities  I do not  however  favor this path to citizenship for all undocumented persons   Under the provisions of the immigration bill we are debating  virtually all undocumented persons currently living in the United  States would be eligible to legalize their status and ultimately become U S  citizens  Estimates are that this number totals 12 million to 20 million people  This is legislative over kill  It is one of the reasons that this bill has aroused the passions of ordinary Americans who have no opposition to reasonable immigration policies  but who see this as an issue that goes against the grain of basic fairness  which is the very foundation of our society   By contrast  my amendment would allow a smaller percentage of undocumented persons to remain in the United   States and legalize their status  based on the depth of a persons roots in their community   Under my proposal  undocumented persons who have lived in the United States at least four years prior to enactment of the bill could apply to legalize their status  I note that this four year period is even more generous than the five year threshold that was contained in several bills in the past few Congresses  bills that were supported by senators from both parties and by immigrants rights groups   After receiving the application  the Department of Homeland Security would evaluate a list of objective  measurable criteria to determine whether the applicant should receive a Z visa  and thus be allowed to get on the path to citizenship   The statutory criteria to be considered would be    Work history   Payment of federal or state income taxes   Property ownership and business ownership in the United States   Knowledge of English   Attendance at U S  schools   Immediate family members in the United States   Whether the applicant has a criminal record  And  Whether the applicant wants to become a U S  citizen   Like the underlying bill  applicants would be given probationary status while the DHS considers their Z visa application  and could lawfully work during this probationary status period   I believe these provisions are fair to our immigrant population  and also that they will help us avoid the mistakes this Congress made in 1986 with the Simpson Mazzoli amnesty bill  which resulted in a tidal wave of illegal immigration    My amendment would also make the underlying bill more practical    It strikes the bills unrealistic touchback requirement  Few immigrants would have the money or the ability to return to their home countries on other continents  Most of these persons would lose their U S  jobs  leaving their families in turmoil and placing further strain on our communities  Basic fairness dictates that these persons be allowed to apply for a green card from within the United States   I believe that my amendment sets forth an equitable system that not only recognizes the contributions of immigrants to our society  but also introduces practical measures that will help us avoid the same mistakes our country made in 1986 with the Simpson Mazzoli amnesty bill                I have heard loud and clear from Virginians  and I have talked with people on all sides of this issue  What I hear over and over again is that Congress should find a fair system that both protects American workers and respects the rule of law  This amendment represents the fairest method I know to do so  and to do so realistically    I ask you all to support this amendment when it comes for a vote in the Senate   With that  I yield the Floor
