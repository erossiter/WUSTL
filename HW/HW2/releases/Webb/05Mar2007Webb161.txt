   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   March 5  2007 Senator Jim Webb Introduces Bill Prohibiting Use of Funds for Military Operations in Iran                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senator Jim Webb delivered the following statement today on the Senate floor  introducing legislation prohibiting the use of funds for military operations in Iran without congressional authorization   The text of the bill and audio and video of the statement are available upon request      Mr  President  I rise today to introduce legislation that will prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without congressional authorization   The purpose of this legislation is to restore a proper balance between the executive and legislative branches when it comes to the commencement of military activities           I have taken great care in the preparation of this bill to ensure that it will not in any way prevent our military forces from carrying out their tactical responsibilities in places such as Iraq and in the international waters off Iran s coast   The legislation allows American forces to directly respond to attacks or possible attacks that might be initiated from Iran  as well as those that might be begun elsewhere and then carry over into Iranian territory   I have also excluded operations related to intelligence gathering           The major function of this legislation is to prevent this Administration from commencing unprovoked military activities against Iran without the approval of the Congress   The legislation accomplishes this goal through the proper constitutional process of prohibiting all funding for such an endeavor   Unlike the current situation in Iraq  where cutting off funds might impede or interrupt ongoing operations  this legislation denies funding that would be necessary to begin such operations against Iran in the first place             Mr  President  in the past two weeks we have seen a fresh willingness on the part of this Administration to pursue new approaches for a regional settlement that will eventually allow the United States to withdraw our forces from Iraq  and also increase stability in the Middle East   I would like to commend Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Gates for their efforts in bringing about what seems to be the beginning of a clear  and much needed  course correction   It is particularly significant that Iran and Syria have been invited to participate  and that the United States will join  in the upcoming regional meetings regarding Iraq            These upcoming meetings will offer many different countries the opportunity to address legitimate concerns and to emphasize mutual interests   I am hopeful that it will open up the door for a different kind of dialogue with Iran   Despite its new found level of influence in Iraq  it is not in Iran s best interest to see Iraq disintegrate into anarchy   Iran also has its challenges with its own sectarian groups  not the least of which are the Kurds   Al Qaeda represents a threat to Iran as well  and it is not in Iran s interest to see this terrorist movement gain even more power   Free and open access to the Strait of Hormuz also is vital to Iran s economy given its overwhelming reliance on oil exports         As this regional conference approaches  the rhetoric with respect to possible Iranian activities inside Iraq continues  and the increases to our naval and missile defense presence in the Gulf  remain   The Administration s past failure to engage with Iran diplomatically in a meaningful way  coupled with what Iran could perceive as preparations for a military strike  create a potent brew that easily could lead to miscalculation on both sides           The 1988 incident with the USS Vincennes comes to mind  when an overly aggressive commanding officer  operating inside Iranian territorial waters according to a subsequent admission by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral William Crowe  shot down commercial passenger aircraft Iran Air Flight 655         These circumstances   the stated desire of many connected to this Administration to invade Iran  the saber rattling rhetoric  the strategic miscalculations in Iraq   call for this Congress to formalize an historical mandate that in recent years has been lost to the public s understanding    Quite simply  it is the constitutional obligation of the Administration to obtain congressional approval in order to commence military action against another country  except under very limited circumstances   This is the very process that our founding fathers envisioned           In fact  the records from the Constitutional Convention in August  1787 make this abundantly clear   There was much debate during this Convention regarding how much authority should be in the hands of the president with respect to actually initiating military action   The Convention s participants carefully decided that the president should not be given the power to decide with whom this nation should go to war  or to undertake aggressive actions without the consent of the Congress   The president s powers to initiate military action were to be for the purpose of repelling sudden attacks   which is the language I have included in this legislation          As Constitutional Convention delegate James Wilson explained to the Pennsylvania ratifying convention     This system will not hurry us into war  it is calculated to guard against it   It will not be in the power of a single man  or a single body of men  to involve us in such distress            To state the obvious  Mr  President  Iran is not Iraq   And the President has no authority to begin unilateral military operations against Iran   In this regard  I would strongly urge my colleagues to consider that the issue before us is not the politics of Iran  but the proper procedures with respect to how we  as a government  lead the United States          As such  it is far less a matter of possible differences between Republicans and Democrats than it is our mutual concern for protecting the rightful place of the legislative branch in determining the interests of the country and the possible consequences of further military action   In this regard  I would like to point out that the principal sponsor of similar legislation in the other body is Congressman Walter Jones  a Republican from North Carolina           On the one hand  the Administration assures us that it has no intention of launching military operations against Iran   On the other  the Administration tells us that all options remain on the table  at a time when our military buildup in the region continues to grow rapidly   And while we see encouraging new diplomatic initiatives with respect to Iraq  it is important that we clarify  formally  the perimeter of our immediate military interests in the Middle East           It is time  Mr  President  that we move forward to end our military involvement in Iraq  and the path to doing so is not to widen the war into Iran   Proper  robust diplomacy will enable us to bring greater stability to the region  to remove the American military from Iraq  to increase our ability to defeat the forces of international terrorism  and  finally  to focus on the true strategic challenges that face us around the world         I believe the American people will welcome this legislation   This Administration has used force recklessly  choosing the military option again and again while never matching the quality of our military s performance with robust  creative diplomacy   Furthermore  the President s  signing statement  accompanying the 2002 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq indicates that this Administration believes it possesses the broadest imaginable authority to commence military action without the consent of the Congress         In signing the 2002 Iraq resolution  the President denied that the Congress has the power to affect his decisions when it comes to the use of our military   He shrugged off this resolution  stating that on the question of the threat posed by Iraq  his views and those of the Congress merely happened to be the same   He characterized the resolution as simply a gesture of additional support  rather than as having any legitimate authority   He stated   my signing this resolution does not constitute any change in     the President s constitutional authority to use force to deter  prevent  or respond to aggression or other threats to U S  interests              This is a sweeping assertion of powers that leaves out virtually nothing   It is a far different matter than repelling an immediate attack  or conducting a war that has been authorized by the Congress   Let s just match up a couple of these words   The President is saying  for instance  that he possesses the authority to use force to  deter     threats to U S  interests    How do you use force to  deter  a threat  rather than preventing or responding to it   And what kind of  U S  interest  is worthy of the use of force   And  most importantly  how do these vague terms fit into the historically accepted notions of a Commander in Chief s power to repel attacks  or to conduct military operations once they have been approved by the Congress         Mr  President  during our recent hearings on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  I asked both the Secretary of State and the Deputy Secretary of State for clarification of this paragraph in the President s signing statement   My question was whether this Administration believes it has the authority to conduct unilateral military operations against Iran in the absence of a direct attack or a compelling  immediate threat without the consent of the Congress   Both wrote me lengthy letters in reply  but neither could give me a clear responses   The situation that we now face is that the Administration repeatedly states that it seeks no war with Iran  at the same time it claims the authority to begin one  and at the same time it continues a military buildup in the region         The legislation I introduce today is intended to clarify this ambiguity   In so doing  the Congress will be properly restating its constitutional relationship with the executive branch   The Congress will be reinstituting its historical role as it relates to the conduct of foreign policy   And the Congress will be reassuring the American people that there will be no more shooting from the hip when it comes to the gravely serious question of when we send our military people into harm s way         Mr  President I would like to emphasize that this bill will not take any military options off of the table   Nor will it tie the hands of the Administration if our military forces are actually attacked from Iranian soil or territorial waters  or by forces that retreat into Iranian territory   Nor does this legislation let Iran off the hook in terms of our insistence that Iran become a more responsible nation  including our positions regarding Iran s nuclear program and Iran s recognition of Israel s right to exist           I was one of the early voices warning that in terms of national security  Iran was a far greater threat than Iraq   This was one of the reasons I opposed the invasion of Iraq in the first place   Again  all of the options regarding Iran remain on the table   The question is in what context these options should be debated  alongside other options designed to eventually open up Iran and bring it responsibly into the world community   In my view  and in terms of the constitutional process  absent a direct attack or a clearly imminent threat  the place for that debate is here in the open forum of the Congress  not in some closed door meeting at the White House          Mr  President  it is my hope that we can take up this necessary legislation either in the format in which I have introduced it today  or as an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill  which we will consider in the next few weeks   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and welcome their support           Thank you   I yield back the balance of my time
