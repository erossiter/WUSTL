                                                                                                                                                                    Requests Detailed Report from

                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Jim Webb today called on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to improve its enforcement of anti competitive practices within the petroleum industry and report steps it is taking to reverse the spiraling increases in the price of gasoline         In a letter dated Friday  May 25 to FTC Chairman Deborah Majoras  Senator Webb writes   I am concerned that the very situation the FTC is charged with preventing  less competition resulting in higher prices for consumers  now characterizes the petroleum industry          Webb s letter comes on the heels of a Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Wednesday  exploring whether market concentration in the U S  petroleum industry is harming consumers          We have not experienced a Memorial Day weekend since 1981 that has hit our wallets harder in terms of gas prices  While the industry enjoys record profits with the consolidation of the nation s top five oil companies  families are experiencing skyrocketing gas prices   said Webb           These five oil companies have made  375 billion in profits since 2001  and made  120 billion in profits in 2006 alone   ExxonMobil s revenue of  377 6 billion last year surpassed the gross domestic product of all but 25 countries   continued Webb    We need to aggressively monitor the anti competitive practices at play here  And  the FTC should show us how it intends to curb these spiraling gas costs         A copy of the letter follows        May 25  2007       The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras      Chairman      Federal Trade Commission      Room H 135  Annex B         600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20580       Dear Chairman Majoras                    I am writing to express my concern regarding the Federal Trade Commission s  FTC  enforcement of U S  antitrust laws   On Wednesday of this week the U S  Senate Joint Economic Committee held a hearing concerning consolidation in the petroleum industry  during which the FTC presented its views   The issues raised during our hearing Wednesday require far more analysis and explanation given the record high gas prices now facing American families and business                    As the FTC itself notes  your agency s mission includes the duty to challenge mergers that would likely lead to higher prices   You are also charged with the obligation to promote competition in industries where the consumer impact is high  such as the petroleum industry          The petroleum industry  however  has consolidated into five major companies  with the approval of the FTC   Working families are experiencing this consolidation in the form of skyrocketing gas prices while the industry enjoys record profits   These five oil companies have made  375 billion in profits since 2001  and made  120 billion in profits in 2006 alone   ExxonMobil s revenue of  377 6 billion last year surpassed the gross domestic product of all but 25 countries            Meanwhile  American families are paying approximately  1 000 more for gas per year than they did five years ago   This figure will only increase   I am concerned that the very situation the FTC is charged with preventing  less competition resulting in higher prices for consumers  now characterizes the petroleum industry         My concerns are borne out by testimony from the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO    The GAO reported that mergers in the U S  petroleum industry contributed to increased market concentration in U S  refining and marketing portions of the industry   The GAO s analysis demonstrated that industry mergers resulted in higher wholesale gasoline prices         Given the crisis working families face as a result of rising gasoline prices  I urge the FTC to more aggressively review proposed petroleum mergers and to undertake an investigation into anticompetitive practices by the petroleum industry   I would appreciate an explanation of any actions that your agency has taken   or expects to take   to reverse these spiraling increases in the price of gasoline                                                                    Sincerely                                                                     Senator Jim Webb
