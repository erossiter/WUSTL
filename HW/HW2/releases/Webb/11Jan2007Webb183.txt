   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   January 11  2007 Move Forward Responsibly  Statement of Senator Webb to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The following is the opening statement of Senator Jim Webb before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing     The Administration   s Plan for Iraq      Audio and video of the statement are available upon request  I raised early warnings regarding this administration   s decision to invade Iraq   Like many people with strong national security backgrounds  I believed this action following 9 11 ran counter to our nation   s long term security interests and the stability of the region  Very little has happened since 2003 that was not both predictable and predicted      The Committee   s series of hearings provides a critical opportunity to forge a new strategic direction for Iraq and the entire region   This change in direction is long overdue  I hope all Americans will eventually be able to rally behind a new plan for Iraq if the President honors his earlier commitment to accommodate improvements recommended by the Congress      The President   s plan for a new course in Iraq runs contrary to the well established recommendations of the nation   s top military leaders  The plan continues a pattern of seeking to resolve Iraq   s security primarily from the inside out rather than from the outside in  By that I mean the United States must create a regional diplomatic umbrella before we can guarantee the long term security and stability of Iraq  The President   s plan falls well short of what is needed to achieve the necessary international diplomatic outcome   Its primary emphasis is tactical     I recognize that Iraq faces severe and growing economic hardship as the result of its increasing spiral of violence  but I believe that providing an additional  1 billion in U S  funding for reconstruction projects would only worsen the rampant waste and corruption as a result of the lack of effective oversight and control of similar billions in funding over the past four years   The administration   s intention to increase economic aid to Iraq is especially troublesome when we still have victims in critical need of assistance more than a year after Hurricane Katrina   s devastation along our Gulf Coast      We went to war in Iraq recklessly  we must move forward responsibly  The war   s costs to our nation have been staggering   These costs encompass what we hold to be most precious   the blood of our citizens  including many hundreds of service members from the Commonwealth of Virginia who have been killed or wounded   The costs also extend to the many thousands more Iraqi people killed and wounded as their country slides into the chaos of sectarian violence and civil war  We have incurred extraordinary financial costs   expenses totaling more than  380 billion and now estimated at  8 billion a month      The war also has diverted our nation   s focus from fighting international terrorism  and deflected our attention to the many additional threats to our national security abroad and national greatness at home   costs difficult to measure  perhaps  but very real all the same        The Iraqi government and the Iraqi people must understand that the United States does not intend to maintain its current presence in their country forever  They must make the difficult but essential decisions to end today   s sectarian violence and to provide for their own security  The American people are not alone in seeking that day  indeed  the overwhelming majority of Iraqi citizens also does not want our forces present in their country for any longer than is absolutely necessary     The key questions of the moment are how long the United States should be expected to keep our forces in Iraq as its government seeks to assume its own burdens  How and when will we begin to draw down our combat presence and conclude our mission in a way that does not leave even greater chaos behind  What is the administration   s strategic vision and  as it relates to our presence in Iraq  its eventual endpoint     This administration has never clearly affirmed that the answers to these questions are not to be found in Iraq alone  Achieving our goals in this war requires a coherent strategy encompassing the entire region   The need for an overarching diplomatic solution is now  more than ever  an imperative if we are to end the war     I have said for many months that the United States should not singly focus on a military solution to end the war in Iraq   We must seek a diplomatic solution immediately   one that engages all nations in the region with historic and cultural ties to Iraq   Because they are part of today   s problem  Syria and Iran also must be party to tomorrow   s solution  Strong diplomatic pressure on such regimes is always preferable to policies that give them leverage as outsiders to the process  I believe that this overarching diplomatic solution  one supportive of a coherent strategy  will lead to four outcomes  First  it will enable us to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq over time  Second  it will lead to progressively greater regional stability   Third  it will allow us to fight international terrorism more effectively  Lastly  it will enable us to address our broad strategic interests around the world with renewed vigor      During an earlier era in our nation   s history  we were faced with an unpopular war that had gone on too long   The then recently retired General Dwight David Eisenhower spoke out against the conduct of the Korean War in the summer of 1952      Where do we go from here     he asked     when comes the end        Today  the members of this committee   indeed all Americans   still await answers to these same questions   Where do we go from here   When comes the end
