   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   March 28  2007 Floor Speech  Webb Discusses Hagel Webb Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Focus on Troop Readiness and Redeployments Mr  President  I would like to first express my profound appreciation for our majority leader s words today   Senator Reid likes to say that he is not a speaker of eloquence  but I have rarely heard such eloquent words on this particular issue   They were from the heart   They touched me deeply  and also they were humbling         But  most importantly  having the Majority Leader stand here and bring words to the floor today  as my colleague  Senator Hagel  and I are attempting to do  is an attempt to inject a reality  a responsible reality to this debate that in many cases has been lacking is greatly gratifying to me   And I also would like to thank and congratulate my good friend and colleague  the Senator from Nebraska   I greatly respect his service to our country   I greatly admire his courage and his willingness to speak out on this issue over the past several years  and I d like to point out that he and I began our government service many years ago as people who had come back from a different war and decided that we would devote a good portion of our lives to trying to take care of those who had served   And the motivation behind the amendment that he and I have worked so assiduously on over the last couple of weeks is that same motivation that began nearly 30 years ago         I ve seen a lot of comment over the past three months  some of it accusatory  with respect to the focus on our situation in the Middle East  saying that the people who were doing that were somehow hurting the troops   And the question really becomes  who s really speaking for the troops   We have a good many members of this body  and I respect them all  who have come back from multiple trips to Iraq   They have sat down with the people  the leaders  and the military leaders who are charged with the responsibility of carrying out our policies   They heard in many cases optimistic predictions   And in too many cases they have come back and basically said that if you want to do something different  you re affecting the options of the commander in chief and you re being disloyal to the troops   But who is really listening to the troops         On the one hand  the people who have been serving in this war are justifiably proud of their military service   On the other  they are carrying out the policies of our political process   And if we look at polls  our best way of trying to figure out how the average military person feels about this war  we will see that they share the same concerns in the aggregate as everyone else in this country   A year ago  just a little more than a year ago when I announced for the United States Senate  there was a poll of our active duty people actually serving in Iraq   72  of those people believe that the United States should withdraw from Iraq by the end of last year   And this included 70  of the regular army and 58  of the regular Marine Corps   So  our motivation today is to try to put a formula together that will respect the policies of the United States and truly show the best way to take care of the troops         I note with some irony that the bill before us is called an emergency supplemental appropriation   An emergency supplemental appropriation   Beginning the fifth year in this war  we are now calling an emergency that we need to bring more money to the table   Why       There are a lot of different possibilities on that  but let s start with this  This has been a war that has been fought without a strategy  You do not have a strategy unless you can clearly articulate the end point of your military operations  I ve been saying this for more than four years   But what we ve had instead of a strategy is the plan of the week   We ve had a lot of flailing around from the political leadership that has spilled over into the military leadership   Let s try this  let s try that   Let s extend our troops   Let s deploy our troops early   Let s send them back before they have had the chance to rest  recuperate  and refurbish         We re seeing now  as my good friend from Nebraska mentioned  the military costs of that kind of policy   We re also seeing a human cost   Who pays for this kind of lack of clarity   The troops pay   They re sacrificing   They re proud to serve their country  and they can t plan their lives   They ve got kids being born   They ve got weddings to go to   They got people to visit   They got holidays to enjoy that were all a part of the plan when they were deployed         This amendment goes to that point  the proper utilization of our military   The first thing that it does  as Senator Hagel and I and others have been saying for a long time that the policy of the United States objective in Iraq should be a political solution that can be obtained through increased concerted regional international diplomacy   We ve seen the seeds of that over the past couple of months   We are stating that this should be recognized as our primary goal         The second point is that we are putting in  as the Senator from Nebraska mentioned  legally binding restrictions calling for the certification of any unit in the United States military that is going to be deployed that it be fully mission capable   And we have a reality check in this provision   We understand that in terms of heavy equipment  that many units deploy fall on to equipment inside the theater of operations   We are no requiring that they have that equipment with them when they first deploy   We also have presidential waivers in terms of possible national emergencies that might occur  But other than that  we should have unit ready deployments         The third portion of this amendment goes to extending deployments   We re basically saying that Army units that deploy for a year should come back in 365 days   Marine Units that are deployed for seven months should come back at the end of 210 consecutive days with certain  again  realistic exclusions         The fourth provision goes to the minimum period between deployments   You re not going to deploy our military units until they have been home at least the amount of time that they previously were deployed   This goes for individuals as well as units   It s quite possible that in today s military for an individual to come back after deployment and after a short period of time be back filed into another unit that s going   Technically  the unit may have been back here for a year or seven months but the individual has not   That s got to stop   We re also saying in terms of the guard and reserve that they need a one for five   They need to be able to be home for five times the length of time that they are have deployed   And  Mr  President  I would say on this one to one cycle for active forces  the military itself  the Commandant of the Marine Corps has said that they would like to have a two for one cycle here for ever year you ve been gone  two years home  In my entire experience in the Pentagon as Assistant Secretary of Defense  as the Secretary of the Navy  we looked at a two for one ratio for our ships  for our troops   A period of time deployed  a period of time to come back  get reacquainted with your family  get some time down and then an equal period of time to get refurbished and get going again        All we re asking for here is a one for one   If you look at what s happened in the conduct of this war  this has not been operational demands that have created the situation for our troops   It s been a lack of proper leadership   And there s nothing in Iraq  nothing going in Iraq that would require this sort of chaotic planning   There s no emergency right now that can justify the unpredictability that we have built into these deployments   At the right time  when the Senator from Nebraska is able to negotiate this with the leadership and I m going to pursue this as well  we want a vote   We re looking to get a vote and I would urge all of my colleagues to support this        Mr  President  I yield the floor
