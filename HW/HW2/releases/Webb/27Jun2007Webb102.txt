   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   June 27  2007 Senator Webb on Amendment to Immigration Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  The following is a statement issued by Senator Jim  Webb following the vote on his amendment to the immigration  bill  which would have narrowed the scope of the bills legalization program and  eliminated the touchback requirement   My amendment sought a workable middle ground on which  to unite the extremes in this highly emotional immigration debate  It was  important for me to leave a clear marker in terms of why the immigration bill   as it is currently drafted  holds significant flaws     There is no question that our immigration policy  desperately needs a fix  But I will have difficulty supporting the final passage  of this bill unless it satisfies the criteria of creating a fair and workable  path to legalization for those who have put down roots in this country   protecting the legitimate interests of all working Americans  and honoring the  rule of law
