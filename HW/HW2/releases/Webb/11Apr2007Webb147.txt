   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   April 11  2007 Senator Webb   This Administration is Breaking Our Army                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The following is a statement from Senator Jim Webb regarding Defense Secretary Robert Gates  announcement that U S  Army deployments will be extended from 12 to 15 months        Today s announcement by the Secretary of Defense is further indication that the administration s failed strategic policies are breaking our military   The  new policy  simply formalizes an extension to 15 month deployment tours for Army soldiers   ensuring that the disproportionate sacrifice that they and their families are being asked to bear will only grow more disproportionate in the years ahead         These extensions will place new strains on an already overburdened Army   a force that is being broken progressively as the result of a mismanaged strategy in Iraq  As one commentator observed recently  there are simply too many missions for too few soldiers  Many soldiers are already serving on their third and fourth deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan   These extensions may well affect morale as they are asked yet again to accept the consequences of a misdirected war         Today s announcement only heightens the need for more forceful congressional oversight of administration war policy and the adoption of legislation that Senator Hagel and I developed  requiring that U S  military units be fully combat ready when they are deployed  that the length of deployments be restricted  and that minimum time periods be maintained between deployments
