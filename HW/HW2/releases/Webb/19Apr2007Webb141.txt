   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   April 19  2007 Statement of Senator Jim Webb Regarding the Importance of the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mr  President  I rise today to discuss an issue that has held a special place in my life for many years  the preservation of our nation s civil war battlefields   Our historic battlefields  outdoor classrooms where visitors may walk in the very footsteps of heroes from past generations  are under threat   More than 200 000 acres of historically significant battlefield land remain unprotected and are threatened by development pressures   That is why I urge my colleagues to fully fund the Civil War Battlefield Protection Program  This arm of the National Park Service is an invaluable tool to preserve our nation s history         In 1990  Congress established the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission  a blue  ribbon panel empowered to investigate the status of America s remaining Civil War battlefields   Congress also tasked the Commission with the mission of prioritizing these battlefields according to their historic importance and the threats to their survival   The Commission ultimately looked at the 10 000 plus battles and skirmishes of the Civil War and determined that 384 priority sites should be preserved   The results of the report were released in 1993 and they were not encouraging        The 1993 Commission report recommended that Congress create a  10 million a year emergency program to save threatened Civil War battlefield land   The result was the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program   To date  the Preservation Program  working with its partners  has saved 14 100 acres of land in 15 states        The key to the success of the Preservation Program is that it achieves battlefield preservation through collaborative partnerships between state and local governments  the private sector and non profit organizations  such as the Civil War Preservation Trust   Matching grants provided by the program protect lands outside of the National Park Service boundaries and do not add to the Park Service s maintenance costs          But for the Preservation Program and their partners with the Civil War Preservation Trust  we would have lost key sites from such national shrines at Antietem   Chancellorsville   Fredericksburg   Manassas   Harpers Ferry   Bentonville   Mansfield  Champion Hill   Their names still haunt us to this day  Had the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program not intervened  the sites would have been lost forever to commercial and residential development   Now they have been protected for future generations to enjoy and learn about our nation s history   They are islands of green space in a seemingly endless sea of commercial sprawl        The need to protect our nation s battlefields is far too great for any one well intentioned federal program   That s why the partnership with the Civil War Preservation Trust is so critical   This visionary preservation group is able to work with other foundations  state and local governments and their membership to match federal funds by 100    How often can we tout such an achievement with other federal programs   The Trust receives no financial gain from the Preservation Program and  working with their non Federal partners  has raised more than  30 million to secure key battlefield sites in 15 states   They are in this fight for all the right reasons   This partnership truly serves as a model in bringing all stakeholders to the table to tackle pressing national issues          For me  these hallowed grounds  these living memorials to the 620 000 Americans who sacrificed their lives to fight in the Civil War  have special  personal significance  Ancestors of mine fought on both sides during the war  including William Jewell  who was wounded in the Battle of Cedar Mountain in Culpeper County  Virginia  wounded again at Antietam and was finally killed in action at Chancellorsville on May 3  1863   It s not everyday you can visit these battlefields sites and have an immediate  direct connection with your ancestors   We must preserve these sites so that future generations might see and touch the very places where so many sacrifices were made  by soldiers and civilians alike  to settle the unresolved issues from the American Revolution of slavery and sovereignty   We are a stronger  more diverse and genuinely free nation because of these sacrifices
