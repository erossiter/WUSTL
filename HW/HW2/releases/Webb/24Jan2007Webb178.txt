   Senator Jim Webb   Virginia                                                                                        Press Releases                   January 24  2007 SEN  WEBB ON MSNBC S  COUNTDOWN  WITH KEITH OLBERMANN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JANUARY 24  2007      OLBERMANN   In the wake of the vote by the Foreign Relations Committee  we re joined by one of its members  Senator James Webb of Virginia  who  of course  gave the Democratic response to the  president s State of the Union last night   Senator  great thanks for some of your time today       WEBB   Yes  I appreciate your inviting me       OLBERMANN   Are you gratified  encouraged  amazed  what would the word be  that a Republican senator such as Mr  Hagel is willing to go to such lengths to try to get his colleagues to take a stand similar to your own on this war       WEBB   Oh  I ve known Senator Hagel for almost 30 years   We came up together through the veterans programs after we both came back from  Vietnam   And he s always been an individual with a tremendous amount of integrity   And actually  he and I were talking about this war before it even began   I used to come over and see him a couple of times a year to discuss foreign policy   So I m not surprised   I think the bigger surprise  and it s a gratifying one  actually   is that Senator John Warner  my compatriot from Virginia  has stepped forward and expressed his concerns  because he s known as  you know   far more close to    being close to the administration       OLBERMANN   The phrasing on the nonbinding resolution about President Bush s troop  increase   to use the kinder term rather than   escalation   in Iraq is  quote   not in the national interest    If the committee Democrats  if Mr  Hagel  if  to some degree  Mr  Warner  feel this way  does it follow that literally stopping the escalation is in the national interest  does not the Senate and the House now  have an obligation to do that by any means that don t endanger the troops already in the theater       WEBB   Well  I think that if you look at how the Senate works  it s the reality of our government  it works through consensus   And there was a lot of care given in the drafting of this resolution  and in voting down certain amendments  so that we could have something that we could get a majority of the Senate to vote on   And it s not the be all  end all   What I ve been saying pretty  consistently through this is that we need to take some leadership here   We ve not seen leadership from the administration   The Congress needs to stand up   And this is a nonbinding resolution   But at the same time  I think it s for the first time taking a head count of how the people in the Congress actually feel about this   And I think the evidence of that to the American people is going to be pretty strong   And from there  maybe we can proceed further  and do some other types of legislation       OLBERMANN   So is it fair to say  sir  that you see this as kind of the attention getter for the president and the administration  that other action may follow  if attention is not paid       WEBB   I think that is fair to say  yes   I mean  I don t think that in terms of the surge itself   You know  one thing that I ve said all along  since the announcement of the surge  is that this really is not a new strategy   It represents something of a new political strategy   But in terms of how the troop levels have oscillated from   03   04  where this is not out of the bounds of constitutional discretion for the president   What we have to be able to say here is that it s time to do something different   And this is a first step to get a sense of the Congress  so that we really can start doing something different       OLBERMANN   The vice president         WEBB   This is a first step  in my opinion       OLBERMANN   I m sorry  sir   The vice president today conceded that Congress could  can cut  off the funding for the escalation  but he called the idea that there were mistakes about Iraq hogwash   How    do you have a sense yet about how this is all going to turn out   Is the president going to get his escalation  and is it going to be rolled back  or is it not going to happen   What do you think is going to happen here       WEBB   Well  I m trying to take a longer view on this   I mean  what I ve said from  02 forward  even before we went into Iraq is that there is no clearly enunciated strategy from this administration at all   If you have a clearly enunciated strategy  you can tell the American people clearly what the end point of that strategy is   And that s one thing I attempted to do on the Armed Services Committee day before yesterday  when we had General Petraeus in front of us  is to ask him clearly  What is your end point   What    if you want to put down these benchmarks and these measurements for success  to what is it leading   My view is  it s leading to a place where there will be no more American combat troops on the streets of Iraq   That s an end point to  a strategy   And as far as what the vice president has said about    his hogwash comment  there are a lot of us who were saying even before this war began  that if we invaded and occupied Iraq  you would have the empowerment of Iran  you would have a worsening situation in the war against international terrorism  you would have a diminution of American prestige around the world  all of which has happened   And now they warn us that a withdrawal would create these conditions   And they use this straw man of a precipitous withdrawal  rather than the right way that we should be doing this  which is to get regional diplomacy to the table  as the Baker commission  recommended  among others  and create the right kind of diplomatic ownership in the region  so that we can get our people out   They re not doing that       OLBERMANN   Senator Jim Webb of Virginia  thank you kindly for your time again  sir       WEBB   Thank you   Good to see you
