                                     Collins cosponsored legislation designating May 11    Endangered Species Day    May 11  2006 WASHINGTON  D C Senator Susan Collins today applauded the individuals and groups who are working to protect Americas endangered species  Senator Collins recently cosponsored legislation  passed unanimously by the U S  Senate  declaring May 11 as Endangered Species Day    Today  on May 11  we celebrate Endangered Species Day to encourage greater awareness about the threats to endangered species and to promote species conservation worldwide  said Senator Collins  It is also an appropriate time to reiterate my concern with the Administrations 2007 budget which proposes to cut funding for the U S  Fish and Wildlife Services endangered species program by approximately 10 percent and call for an increase in this funding    Last month  Senator Collins joined several Senate colleagues who sent a letter to Senators Conrad Burns  R MT  and Byron Dorgan  D ND   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior  urging them to support a  20 million increase for the federal endangered species program    Following is the full text of the letter   April 11  2006  Dear Chairman Bums and Ranking Member Dorgan   As members who share your commitment to the conservation of our nation s wildlife  fish  plants and their habitats  we are writing to urge needed increases for the US Fish and Wildlife Service s  USFWS  endangered species program   When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973  it recognized that America has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable species of wildlife  fish and plants and to ensure a rich conservation legacy for our children and grandchildren  Unfortunately  we are falling short of that commitment  There are many issues that Congress can address to improve our efforts such as increasing the roles of states in conservation work  putting a greater emphasis on recovery and providing incentives for private landowners  While Congress tries to find consensus on how to strengthen the Act  we can address one issue by providing needed funding to protect and adequately recover endangered and threatened plants and animals  The Administration s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget includes a  7 7 million or 10 4 percent cut to the recovery budget  further exacerbating the existing shortfall   Failure to provide adequate levels of funding for endangered species operations will only ensure that species slide closer to extinction  decreasing chances for recovery while increasing the costs for both the government and private stakeholders  More than 280 species continue to languish on the candidate list  awaiting protection under the Act  Many have been candidates for years  Fish and Wildlife Service biologists have previously estimated that more than 200 already listed species are on the verge of extinction primarily because too little attention and funding is available for recovery activities  In addition  the number of projects reviewed under the Consultation program has increased from 40 000 in 1999 to approximately 77 000 in 2005 and further increases are expected  Finally  the development and implementation of Habitat Conservation Plans  HCP5   which allow activities to proceed while still protecting species  continues to grow  with funding critically needed to help ensure timely and effective development and monitoring of 500 existing and nearly 300 new HCPs that together will cover about 72 million acres when complete   In addition  it is critical to provide adequate funding for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and two USFWS incentive programs   the Private Stewardship Grant Program and the Landowner Incentive Program   that provide resources to states and private landowners to conserve endangered plants and animals on non federal lands  Demand for these programs far exceeds current funding  For example  although the Private Stewardship Program is funded at only  7 million  the current demand is  31 million   While we understand the existing budget constraints placed on the Subcommittee  we urge you make every effort to provide a total increase of at least  20 million over the FY2006 level for USFWS endangered species operating accounts   4 million for Listing   7 million for Recovery   7 million for Consultation  and  2 million for Candidate Conservation  We further ask for increases of  5 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund   7 million for the Landowner Incentive Program and  3 million for Private Stewardship Grants   Thank you for your kind consideration                                                                              Browse by
