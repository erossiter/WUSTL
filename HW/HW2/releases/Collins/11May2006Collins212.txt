                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Collins says bill is    fundamentally flawed    May 11  2006 WASHINGTON  D C Senator Susan Collins today released the following statement explaining her concerns with S  1955the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act introduced by Senator Michael Enzi  R WY  which is currently being debated in the Senate     MR  PRESIDENT  the Senate has spent much of this week debating S  1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2006  I commend my good friend and colleague from Wyoming for all of his hard work on this legislation  which is intended to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses by allowing them to join together to purchase association based Small Business Health Plans  Despite my support for the goal of this bill  I think its approach is fundamentally flawed  Let me explain my concerns     One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to affordable health care for all Americans  There are still far too many Americans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate coverage  As many as 46 million Americans are uninsured  and millions more are underinsured     Since most Americans get their health insurance through the workplace  it is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed  The fact is  however  that as many as 83 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family with a worker      Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small businesses  In fact some 63 percent of uninsured workers either work for a small firm or are self employed  Taking a look at the problems faced by small businesses is  therefore  a good place to start as we attempt to reduce the numbers of uninsured     Small businesses want to provide quality health insurance for their employees  but the cost is often just too high  So I am totally in agreement with the underlying goal of this legislation  which is to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees  To that end  I have introduced bipartisan legislation to help employers cope with rising costs by creating new tax credits for small businesses to make health insurance more affordable and by providing grants to States to assist with the development and operation of small employer purchasing cooperatives to increase the clout of small businesses in their negotiations with insurers     I do  however  have a number of very real concerns about S  1955  as it was reported out of the Senate HELP Committee   First  the legislation pre empts the States traditional authority to regulate insurance and allows not just Small Business Health Plans  but all health insurers to exclude important benefits like cancer screenings  mental health coverage  and diabetes care that currently are guaranteed under many State laws      States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance since the 1940s  And  based on my experience in overseeing the Maine Bureau of Insurance for five years  I believe that states have generally done a good job of responding to the needs and concerns of their citizens     As the founder and co chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus  I also am all too aware of the tremendous emotional and economic toll that this devastating disease takes on an estimated 21 million Americans and their families  I am particularly concerned that the bill would pre empt as many as 46 state laws guaranteeing coverage for the medications  equipment  services and supplies that people with diabetes need to manage their disease and prevent costly and potentially deadly complications    This simply is penny wise and pound foolish  Diabetes currently costs our nation more than  132 billion annually  Eighty percent of those costs are due to the complications associated with diabetes  complications that  absent a cure  can only be prevented through prevention and proper management of the disease  If cloture is invoked  I will be offering an amendment with Senators Bingaman and Domenici to preserve State laws requiring coverage for comprehensive diabetes care  Both the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation have endorsed our amendment      I am also concerned that the bill would pre empt state rating rules and establish a new national standard  Proponents of the legislation contend that the application of this new national standard may not cause much disruption in many states  In Maine  however  which uses modified community rating  it could alter the market substantially      In fact  the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates that one quarter of all small businesses will actually pay higher premiums if this bill is passed  It is therefore likely that many small employers in Maine    particularly those with an older workforce  will wind up paying more  and  in some cases  substantially more under this bill     This bill is no panacea  even for those small employers who will see savings  The CBO estimates that health care premiums will only average about two to three percent lower if S  1955 is passed  Many small business owners have been told that the bill will cut their costs by from 12 to 20 percent  Even those employers who do see savings are likely to be disappointed that they are not as great as they had been led to believe     And finally  I am concerned that the bill  as reported by the Committee  could allow health plans to exclude a class of health care providers  solely on the basis of their license or certification  restricting patients access to qualified health professionals  This is a particularly important issue in rural areas like Maine  where there may not be a sufficient supply of physicians to provide the care that the health plan has promised to cover     For example  virtually all health plans cover medically necessary primary care services  Many rural Americans use a physician assistant or nurse practitioner as their primary care provider  because there simply isnt an adequate supply of physicians where they live  In these areas  if a plan only covers primary care services offered by a physician  patients will either have to drive great distances to receive the care they need or pay out of pocket for services that are supposed to be covered benefits      If cloture is invoked  I will be offering an amendment to maintain the application of all existing State laws prohibiting health insurers from discriminating against health providers who are acting within their scope of practice under State law  solely on the basis of their license or certification      Mr  President  I do plan to vote for cloture  Congress should be taking action to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses  and I believe that this debate should go forward      I do not  however  believe that we need to pre empt the good work that States have done in the area of patients rights and protections in order to help our small businesses  I would  therefore  oppose the current bill on final passage unless it is substantially changed                                                                               Browse by
