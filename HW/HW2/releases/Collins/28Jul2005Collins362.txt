                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 28  2005  Chairman Thomas  Ranking Member Akaka  and members of the subcommittee  I would like to thank you for holding this hearing today on the Acadia National Park Improvement Act of 2005   This legislation takes important steps to ensure the long term health of one of America  s most beloved national parks   It would increase the land acquisition ceiling at Acadia by  10 million  facilitate an off site intermodal transportation center for the Island Explorer bus system  and extend the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission       In 1986  Congress enacted legislation designating the boundary of Acadia National Park   However  many private lands were contained within the permanent authorized boundary   Congress authorized the Park to spend  9 1 million to acquire those lands from willing sellers only   While all of that money has now been spent  rising land prices have prevented the money from going as far as Congress originally intended        There are over 100 private tracts left within the official park boundary   Nearly 20 of these tracts are currently available from willing sellers  but the Park does not have the funds to purchase them   My legislation would authorize an additional  10 million to help acquire these lands   Since these lands already fall within the congressionally authorized boundary  this effort would  fill in the holes  at Acadia  rather than enlarging the park       My legislation will also facilitate the development of an intermodal transportation center as part of the Island Explorer bus system   The Island Explorer has been extremely successful over its first five years   These low emission propane powered vehicles have carried more than 1 5 million riders since 1999  In doing so  they removed 424 000 vehicles from the park and reduced pollution by 24 tons         Unfortunately  the system lacks a central parking and bus boarding area   As a result  day use visitors do not have ready access to the Island Explorer  My legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance in the planning  construction  and operation of an intermodal transportation center in Trenton  Maine   This center will include parking for day users  a visitor orientation facility highlighting park and regional points of interest  a bus boarding area  and a bus maintenance garage   This center  which will be built in partnership with the Federal Highway Administration  U S  Department of Transportation  Maine Department of Transportation  and other partners  will reduce traffic congestion  preserve park resources  and help ensure a vibrant tourist economy       Finally  my legislation would extend the 16 member Acadia National Park Advisory Commission for an additional 20 year period   This commission was created by Congress in 1986 and is currently due to expire in 2006   That would be a mistake   The commission consists of three federal representatives  three state representatives  four representatives from local towns on Mount Desert Island  three from adjacent mainland communities  and three from adjacent offshore islands   These representatives have provided invaluable advice relating to the management and development of the Park   The Commission has proven its worth many times over and deserves to be extended for an additional 20 years         Acadia National Park is a true gem of the Maine coastline   The Park is one of Maine  s most popular tourist destinations  with nearly three million visitors every year   While unsurpassed in beauty  the Park  s ecosystem is also very fragile   Unless we are careful  we risk substantial harm to the very place that Mainers and Americans hold so dear          In 11 years  Acadia will be 100 years old   Age has brought both increasing popularity and greater pressures   By providing an extra  10 million to protect sensitive lands  expanding the highly successful Island Explorer transportation system  and extending the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission  this legislation will help make the Park stronger and healthier than ever on the occasion of its centennial anniversary        I would again like to extend my appreciation to Chairman Thomas and Ranking Member Akaka   I know our national parks are very important to them  and I look forward to working with them on this legislation                                                                                     Browse by
