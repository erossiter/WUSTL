                                     Senate Environment Committee to Consider Senator Collins    Mercury Monitoring Legislation Senator Collins testifies before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in support of her legislation to create a nationwide mercury monitoring network May 16  2007 Washington  DC       Senator Susan Collins today testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the health and environmental dangers of mercury and about legislation she has introduced to improve the scientific measurement of mercury in the U S  Senator Collins has authored and introduced the Mercury Monitoring Act with Senators Joseph Lieberman  D CT  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  that would establish mercury monitoring sites across the nation in order to measure mercury levels in the air  rain  soil  lakes and streams  plants  and animals   In the wrong form  mercury is an acutely dangerous toxin that can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm  especially to children and pregnant women  said Senator Collins  To see just how toxic mercury is  one does not have to look any farther than my home state of Maine  Every freshwater lake  river  and stream in my state is subject to a mercury advisory warning pregnant women and young children to limit consumption of fish caught in these waters  This advisory is especially difficult for indigenous peoples  like those of the Penobscot Indian Nation  for whom subsistence fishing is an historically important part of their culture   Senator Collins legislation would authorize  18 million in fiscal year 2008  and additional funding through 2013  for the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   United States Geological Survey  United States Fish and Wildlife Service  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to perform scientific mercury measurements  These agencies would measure long term changes in mercury levels in the air and watersheds  including mercury levels in plants and animals  at multiple monitoring sites in different ecosystems across the country  The bill would create a Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee to advise the EPA Administrator in choosing the monitoring sites   Mercury is dangerous not only to people  but also to wildlife  said Senator Collins  The Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham  Maine  found that mercury concentrations in loon eggs in Maine were dangerously high  nearly four times higher than those found in Alaska   Senator Collins also testified today that when the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule in 2005  it was not based on sound science  Senators Collins and Lieberman met with the EPA Administrator in 2005 in order to express concern over the rule  The extent of the flaws in the EPA data became apparent earlier this year with the publication of several new studies by David Evers and Wing Goodale of the Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham  Maine  and other researchers   These new studies demonstrate the existence of mercury hotspots in the northeastern United States and attribute much of the cause of the hotspots where mercury is concentrated to emissions from power plants  said Senator Collins  The studies conflict markedly with EPAs computer modeling data which was used to justify the EPA mercury rule  For example  the studies showed that mercury deposition is five times higher than previously estimated near a coal plant in southern New Hampshire  These studies demonstrate the need for real world mercury measurements  not just computer models    I believe our legislation would provide the scientific measurements we need in order to more accurately assess the extent of the mercury problem in this country  and to provide better information on how to address this serious problem   Senator Collins has long led efforts in the Senate to help reduce dangerous mercury emissions  She is an original cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Tom Carper  D DE   titled the Clean Air Planning Act  that would reduce mercury emissions at power plants by 90 percent by 2015  The legislation would also address the pollutants that cause smog  acid rain  and climate change         Click
