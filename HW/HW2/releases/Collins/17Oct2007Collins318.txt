                                     Send letter Urging Fisheries Disaster Assistance October 17  2007 Washington  DC        U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe and Susan M  Collins today announced that  11 million in federal funding for environment and fishery restoration projects in Maine has been included in the fiscal year  FY  2008 Commerce  Justice  and Science spending bill that passed the Senate last night   We are pleased to announce this essential funding that is critical to preserving our environment and sustaining our fishing industry  said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement  These projects are a vital component of securing the future of our fishing and lobster industry  protecting our valued Maine Atlantic Salmon  and helping our country respond to and be proactive in the fight against global climate change    Senators Snowe and Collins announced that the Commerce  Justice  and Science Appropriations bill includes funding for the following Maine projects    10 million for the Maine Atlantic Salmon  Penobscot River Restoration Project   The Penobscot River Restoration Project is a  50 million project to restore the natural flow of Maines largest watershed  This project is a partnership of the State of Maine  the U S  Departments of Interior and Energy  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA   the National Park Service  the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  the Bureau of Indian Affairs  the Penobscot Indian Nation  the Atlantic Salmon Federation  PPL Inc   the Natural Resources Council of Maine  and other environmental groups     The Penobscot Restoration project is composed of two phases  The first phase of the project is the purchase of three dams on the Penobscot River  the Great Works  Veazie  and Howland Dams  The second phase consists of the removal of the Great Works and Veazie dams  as well as the construction of a fish by pass at the Howland Dam  The  10 million in federal funding in the CJS bill will be applied toward the purchase of these three dams by the Penobscot River Restoration Trust  In addition to this years funding  Senators Snowe and Collins have worked hard to secure nearly  5 4 million in previous appropriations bills  State and local partners have also raised nearly  10 million in a private funding raising campaign  This combined funding will help fulfill necessary requirements for the purchase of the dams and complete the first phase of the project     The Penobscot River Restoration is at a critical moment and this significant funding is essential in moving the project towards fruition  As we just recently saw last fall with the first fishing season in more than a decade for Atlantic salmon  the Penobscot River can be a tremendous boon to the local economy  We are extremely pleased that the scale of private funding and this federal investment will allow the Penobscot Trust to move forward with the first phase of the project  The restoration will provide dividends to generations of Mainers and we are thrilled that the Senate has provided this critical funding    500 000 for the University of Maines Abrupt Climate Change Research    This funding will support research at the University of Maine to examine issues related to the range  magnitude  forcing  and predictability of abrupt climate change events  The University of Maine is working to establish a new NOAA initiative that will focus on the recovery  analysis and interpretation of paleoclimate archives  glacial deposits and ice cores  that describe the role of the atmosphere in abrupt climate change      500  000 for the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation  Groundline Exchange Program   The Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation is a non profit research organization founded by members of the lobster industry  The funding will help coordinate a Maine groundline exchange program providing financial assistance to lobstermen by enabling them to purchase whale safe rope in exchange for their existing groundline    Senator Snowe and Collins announced that the CJS Appropriations Bill includes the following funding for national programs that will greatly benefit the state of Maine    7 8 Million for the Right Whale Protection   The National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS  has implemented a rule to reduce interactions between Atlantic large whales  especially the Northern right whale  and the lobster and gillnet fisheries in New England  Research indicates there are currently between 300 and 350 North Atlantic right whales remaining  With such low numbers  any loss can have significant impact on the population as whole     This funding will help research and investigate foraging and diving behavior in whales that will help determine where the animals engage in these activities that most often lead to gear interactions and ship strikes  This research will facilitate an increase in the survival of right whale adults and calves and contribute to the overall growth and stabilization of the species     850 000 for Bluefin Tuna Data Collection   This funding will help the Bluefin Tuna Data Collection project that helps develop and collect data on the North Atlantic bluefin tuna  The bluefin tuna is a highly migratory species coveted by U S  commercial and recreational fishermen  The population is currently estimated to be less than 20 percent of that existing in the early 1970s     This funding will allow the research program to deploy state of the art pop up archival tags in New England and Canadian waters  In order to improve our understanding of the migration routes  potential spawning areas and environmental associations of bluefin tuna  several hundred more tags should be deployed  The New England Aquarium will also develop and conduct fishery independent population assessments of North Atlantic bluefin tuna utilizing aerial transect surveys and remote sensing technologies     204 000 in National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS  funding for Atlantic Herring and Mackerel   MaineDepartment ofMarine Resourcesmaintains primary responsibility for monitoring the east coast Atlantic herring fishery  and since 1960  has processed all of the biological samples collected from the Atlantic herring fishery  In addition to processing biological samples  responsibilities include compiling catch data  monitoring area quotas  entering and compiling data from dealer reports  and providing data for stock assessments  This appropriation would provide continued support for our current East coast herring sampling program and the bycatch survey of the herring fishery initiated as a pilot study in 2003  Additionally  sampling would also be conducted in the Atlantic mackerel and Atlantic halibut fisheries   Also included in the bill is an amendment that is intended to help cope with coastal fisheries disasters  The amendment  introduced by Senator John Sununu  R NH  and cosponsored by Senator Snowe  Ranking Member of the Subcommittee onOceans  Atmosphere  Fisheries  and Coast Guard and Senators Susan Collins and Judd Gregg  R NH  that would is intended to set aside  15M in funding for regional coastal fisheries disaster assistance under the Magnuson Stevens Act  Section 315 of the MSA allows the Secretary of Commerce to provide disaster relief to communities and industries affected by a fisheries disaster  Senators Sununu  Snowe  Collins  and Gregg recently sent a letter to the Secretary of Commerce requesting the  15 million in disaster relief     Included is text of the letter    The Honorable Carlos M  Gutierrez  Secretary Department of Commerce  1401 Constitution Avenue Washington  DC 20230  Dear Secretary Gutierrez     As you are aware  the New England multispecies groundfish industry is currently in the throes of an economic crisis due to increasingly restrictive regulations that have continually reduced the amount of days our fishermen can work  The impacts of these regulations reach shoreside industries as well  such as fish processors and marine suppliers whose business depends on a healthy fishery  Several New England Governors have made this point to you along with pleas to declare a Federal fisheries disaster in the region  On April 20  2007  Maines Governor John E  Baldacci formally requested that you declare a fisheries failure for the Northeast multispecies groundfishery in the state of Maine under section 312 a  1  B  of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  and New Hampshire Governor John Lynch sent a similar letter to you just last week    Yesterday  the Senate passed the Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  2008  H R  3093   This bill  in Massachusetts  Additionally  the bill makes  15 million available to to carry out activities under section 315 of the Magnuson Stevens Act  In light of these developments  we respectfully call for you to declare a fisheries failure in the states of Maine and New Hampshire  under the process established by law in the most recent amendments to the Magnuson Stevens Act  and ask that you provide  15 million in disaster relief assistance to Maines and New Hampshires groundfishing industry and its related fishery infrastructure     Since passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996  the National Marine Fisheries Service and the New England Fishery Management Council  Council  have instituted numerous fishery management plans  amendments  and framework adjustments in an attempt to rebuild dwindling fish stocks  However  the regions groundfish species have not responded as the fishing industry or the regulators expected  leading to ever tighter restrictions on the days at sea allowed to fishermen  the gear types they can use  and access to certain fishing areas    The Councils regulatory actions have devastated the groundfish industries in our states  For instance  as a result of the actions taken by the Council through Amendments 5  7  9  13  and additional framework adjustments to the multispecies management plan  the groundfishing fleet in Maine has been cut in half over the past thirteen years  from more than 220 boats in 1994 to just 110 today  Shoreside industries have suffered similar losses  From 2000 to 2004  Maine jobs in fish processing and wholesaling dropped over forty percent from 2 953 to 1 755  according to the National Marine Fisheries Service  Industries that support groundfishermen  including suppliers  processors  and marinas have also felt the impact of this precipitous decline  The vessel owners that remain have been forced to spend increasing percentages of their decreasing profits to acquire permits allowing them to catch enough fish to pay their bills  Some also have been forced to save money by cutting corners on vessel maintenance and safety standardsadding risk to what is already the most dangerous profession in America    We understand the concerns of our colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation who are attempting to protect this industry which is suffering in their home state as well  However  to mitigate the regulations impact on Maine and New Hampshire  we hope that rather than relying on a Congressional earmark  you will use the process established by Congress in section 112 of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006  P L  109 479   This change to the underlying law allows the Secretary of Commerce to make reparations to states or fishing communities for a commercial fishery failure caused by  among other things  regulatory restrictions  The challenges these men and women face today as they attempt to retain their livelihood in an industry that has been integral to the New England coast for centuries are a direct result of the regulations described above  and comprise exactly the scenario envisioned by Congress when we amended the Magnuson Stevens Act last year  Rather than attempting to acquire Federal aid for our fishermen through a legislative fix  we would prefer to see this matter handled through the executive branch as intended by law    It was the abundance of cod and other groundfish that lured some of the first European settlers across the Atlantic centuries ago  But this resource has dwindled now to the point that it cannot support more than a handful of fishing vessels from our home states  Though we are committed to rebuilding these traditional fish stocks and rejuvenating Maines and New Hampshires groundfishing industry  we cannot help but conclude that the regulatory regime established to protect our Nations fish stocks  has pushed this industry to the brink of extinction in our states  We request that you officially declare this fisheries failure so that our fishermen may receive the assistance they so desperately require to remain afloat until our regulations can do their job and allow the fish to come back    Sincerely
