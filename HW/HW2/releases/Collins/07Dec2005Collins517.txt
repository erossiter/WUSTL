                                      December 7  2005 Washington  D C     DELEGATION URGES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO WAIVE PATIENT CAP FOR  MAINE  DOCTORS WHO TREAT OPIATE ADDICTIONS        WASHINGTON  D C Maine Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J  Snowe and Congressmen Tom Allen and Mike Michaud have written a letter to Charles G  Curie  Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  In it  they urge Mr  Curie to exercise the Departments authority to exempt  Maine s buprenorphine waivered physicians from the 30 patient cap imposed under current law on individuals who prescribe these drugs in their offices to treat opiate addictions          Maine  has one of the highest rates of opioid addiction in the nation and among the highest number of physicians per capita approved for prescribing buprenorphine  However   Maine s methadone treatment programs are at capacity  as are the buprenorphine waivered physicians         Following is text of the letter         We are writing to request that the Department of Health and Human Services  DHHS  exercise its authority to exempt  Maine s buprenorphine waivered physicians from the 30 patient cap imposed under current law on individual physicians who prescribe Subutex  buprenorphine  and Suboxone  buprenorphine naloxone  in their offices to treat opiate addictions  While the Congress recently enacted Public Law 109 56 to expand access to treatment options for patients addicted to opiates  the measure does not reach far enough to alleviate the ongoing crisis in our state         Current law allows certified physicians to prescribe buprenorphine and buprenorphine naloxone  but limits the number of patients treated to 30 per individual physician  While the new Public Law 109 56 eliminated a provision which applied the 30 patient limitation to group practices  it preserved the 30 patient limitation on individual physicians  It is our understanding that no other medication is so limited  In fact  we understand that the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  continues to approve potent new opioid analgesics without placing any limits on prescribers         Research and considerable clinical experience throughout the  U S   and the world have proven that buprenorphine is a uniquely safe and effective treatment for opiate addiction  It is our understanding that there has not been a single documented overdose death in the  U S   since the drugs introduction  It can be prescribed by office based physicians  and we are told that it is perfectly suited to expanding access to addiction care  particularly in large rural states  like  Maine           Maine  has one of the highest rates of opioid addiction in the nation  Our States methadone treatment programs are at capacity  as are the buprenorphine waivered physicians  The Director of Maines Office of Substance Abuse estimates that there are over 20 000 untreated opiate addicts in  Maine   Residents in large areas of our state  including most of the Mid Coast and Downeast regions  are without access to care  Only one hospital program in the Southern Maine region  the   Mercy Recovery Center    provides comprehensive inpatient and outpatient treatment of opioid dependence         Unfortunately  the   Mercy Recovery Center   is forced to turn away at least 10 patients a week who call seeking help for their addiction  While   Mercy Hospital   has attempted to increase access to care by sponsoring buprenorphine training programs for community physicians  there is an urgent need to increase access to this very effective and life saving treatment now  If an exemption is not provided  under current law  Maine  would have to import 667 new certified licensed trained physicians to be able to prescribe enough Suboxone to meet the existing need of untreated addicts in our State         The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 gave the Secretary of HHS the authority to grant exemptions to the 30 patient limit to waivered physicians  We urge you to consider lifting the 30 patient cap for certified addiction medicine specialists in  Maine   By so doing  HHS will expand access to needed care for a very desperate population                For more information  contact  Antonia Ferrier  Snowe   202 224 1304  Jen Burita  Collins
