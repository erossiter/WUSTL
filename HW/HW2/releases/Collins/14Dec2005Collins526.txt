                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Collins speaks on Senate floor in support of additional  2 9 billion December 14  2005 Washington  D C      WASHINGTON  D C   In another effort to provide Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  assistance to low income Americans  Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Jack Reed  D RI  sponsored a motion to instruct conferees to the Deficit Reduction Bill to include an additional  2 9 billion in LIHEAP funding  This request is in addition to the  2 2 billion already included in the Departments of Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006  bringing the total appropriated amount to  5 1 billion     Speaking on the Senate floor  Senator Collins said  this funding is absolutely critical to help our nations citizens keep warm this winter  Just yesterday  I was in Northern Maine  in   Aroostook County     and the high temperature for the day was just 12 degrees in weather like that people simply have no choice but to devote a very large part of their budget to keeping warm  Unfortunately  with the escalating costs of home heating oil  many people simply cannot afford to do so      Senator Collins  co chair of the Northeast Midwest coalition  has long been committed to seeing LIHEAP assistance funded at an adequate level         Each year  4 5 million low income families rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes  LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs        Following is the text of Senator Collins floor statement     I rise today to join my colleague from  Rhode Island  to offer a motion to instruct the conferees to include  2 9 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program in the budget reconciliation bill  This funding is critical to help our nations low income citizens keep warm this winter        I believe we simply need more LIHEAP funding this year  Let me describe the situation that we are facing in my home state  I was meeting with constituents yesterday in  Aroostook County    which is the northern most county in  Maine  and where I grew up  The high was just twelve degrees  In weather like this  people have no choice but to devote significant household resources to heat their homes  Unfortunately  many people cannot afford to do so         more           In  Maine   78  of households use home heating oil to heat their homes  Currently  the cost of home heating oil is roughly  2 34 per gallon   0 38 above last year s already inflated prices  These high prices greatly increase the need for assistance  and at least 3000 additional Mainers are expected to apply for LIHEAP funding this year  With more people in need of assistance  the benefit is expected to fall by roughly 10   to  440 per qualifying household         Unfortunately  at today s high prices   440 is only enough to purchase 188 gallons of oil    far below last year s equivalent benefit of 251 gallons and not nearly enough to get through even a small portion of a  Maine  winter  With rising prices and falling benefits  we have a problem  Just to purchase the same amount of oil this year as last year   Maine  would need an additional  10 million in LIHEAP funds         Just a few months ago the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005  This law  which passed the Senate overwhelmingly  authorizes  5 1 billion for the LIHEAP program for FY 2006  Unfortunately  even though Chairman Specter worked very hard to increase funding in the Labor HHS bill  that bill only provides  2 2 billion in LIHEAP funding   2 2 billion is not nearly enough         Our nation was struck by three extremely powerful hurricanes  While these hurricanes were devastating to the people of Florida and the   Gulf Coast     they have also had a major impact on the rest of the nation  Just as the nation should be building oil supplies for the winter heating season  these hurricanes have disrupted our already strained supplies and sent both heating oil and gasoline prices to painfully high levels         While high energy prices have been challenging for many Americans  they impose an especially difficult burden on low income families and on the elderly living on limited incomes  Low income families spend a greater percentage of their incomes on energy and have fewer options available when energy prices soar  High energy prices can even cause families to choose between keeping the heat on  putting food on the table  or paying for much needed prescription medicine  Mr  President  these are choices that no American family should ever have to make         With winter upon us and energy prices soaring  home heating bills are set to pound family budgets mercilessly  For low income families  LIHEAP funds can be the factor that prevents families from having to choose between turning off the heat or putting food on the table  I call on my colleagues to support this motion to instruct the conferees to include this assistance in the budget reconciliation bill
