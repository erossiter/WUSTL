                                     Advanced Appropriations For DD X  Program More Realistic  Rational  Way Of Procuring Ships April 18  2005  Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins  R ME  is pressing Senate Budget Committee leaders to change budget rules in order to use advanced appropriations for shipbuilding in the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution   Senator Collins is requesting the cost of shipbuilding projects to be divided among current and future years that it takes to complete the projects  rather than the current budget practice of appropriating the entire cost in a single year at the beginning of the projects   Senator Collins has pointed out that defense ships take years to produce and can cost billions of dollars  so if a large ship is scheduled to be funded in a particular year  it is nearly impossible for the Navy to allocate funding for the other ships that it requires            Current budget rules severely distort the shipbuilding accounts  and do not allow the Navy to budget in the most efficient way possible     said Senator Collins      The use of advanced appropriations would help to better manage the ship construction budget  by creating a more realistic  rational  way of procuring ships   It will help the Navy and our nation   s shipbuilders to better plan  and thus minimize the unnecessary costs that come from the erratic fluctuations in our ship procurement rate   In doing so  it will also let us maximize the number of ships that we can procure             Senator Collins has stressed that it is crucial for the Navy not only to have the most capable ships  but also a sufficient numbers of ships to meet national security requirements   The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review  prepared by the Department of Defense  stated that the Navy required a surface fleet of at least 310 ships to meet our national security requirements   Today  the fleet is below 300 ships   She has also pointed out that the Navy has admitted that it needs more DD X  destroyers than what is currently included in the Administration   s current budget request          As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Collins has spoken with a number of Navy officials about this issue  and they have agreed with her that the current manner of funding ships is flawed   Secretary of the Navy Gordon England recently told Senator Collins during a hearing that the use of alternative funding mechanisms  like advance appropriations  for shipbuilding would    allow us to buy them better and on a better schedule and better for the industrial phase      Ten other federal departments and agencies are expected to use advanced appropriations in the FY 2006 budget            The following is the text of a letter that Senator Collins wrote to the Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg  R NH  and Ranking Member Kent Conrad  D ND          Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Conrad         The U S  naval shipbuilding industrial base faces crisis   Increasingly  the Navy approaches requirements with budget targets as the primary consideration  rather than first determining national security needs followed by resource considerations   The best example of budget constraints driving military requirements can be found in the reduction in the number of DD X  destroyers from twelve to five in the last fiscal year   This is particularly troubling because the Chief of Naval Operations  Admiral Clark  has testified that the military requirements have not changed the need for twelve DD X s         As quantities of new ships decline  the industrial base will be hard pressed to remain viable   The highly skilled craftspeople who build modern warships take years to develop their expertise  and they do not return once they leave the shipbuilding industry   The result is a situation in which the size of the fleet continues to decline  our industrial base shrinks to dangerous lows  and our national security is increasingly at risk           The current funding policy is driving turbulence and inefficiencies into a shipbuilding program struggling to provide new capabilities to meet emerging threats   Navy shipbuilding is best managed fiscally like other U S  government capital investment programs by adopting advance appropriations for our Navy shipbuilding program         There are ten federal departments or agencies that use advanced appropriations in the FY 2006 budget   This full funding mechanism would add to the stability of the shipbuilding program and reduce program risk   As recently as this week  the Chief of Naval Operations told the Senate Armed Services Committee that    the bottom line is you can  t have the Navy of your dreams with the  funding  mechanisms that we  re using and have used for the last 15 years and something     has to be done   If this isn  t the perfect answer  I  m willing to look at any other option  and I  ve put forward split funding  I  ve put forward advanced appropriations and incremental appropriations in the OR program            Therefore  I respectfully request advanced appropriations for shipbuilding be included in the FY 2006 Budget Resolution   I look forward to continue working with you on this important issue                                                                                   Browse by
