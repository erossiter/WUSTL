June 19  2007  U S  Senator Susan Collinsrecently chaired a hearing to examine the impact that juvenile diabetes has had on children and their families  the economic costs of caring for people with diabetes  and the promising breakthroughs in juvenile diabetes research that could lead to better treatments or a cure for the disease  13 year old Caitlin Crawford of Yarmouth  Maine testified at todays hearing as a Childrens Congress Delegate representing the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation  JDRF   More than 100 children  ages 4 to 17  representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia are participating in this years Childrens Congress  Caitlin was one of five delegates chosen to testify at todays hearing  In addition  actress Mary Tyler Moore  NBA player Adam Morrison of the Charlotte Bobcats  and Dr  Griffin Rodgers  Director  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  National Institutes of Health testified at todays hearing     As the founder and Co Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus  I have learned a lot about this disease and the difficulties and heartbreak that it causes for so many American families as they await a cure  Diabetes is a life long condition that affects people of every age  race and nationality  It is the leading cause of kidney failure  blindness in adults  and amputations not related to injury  Moreover  it is estimated that diabetes accounts for more than  132 billion of our nations annual health care costs  and that health spending for people with diabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have diabetes  said Senator Collins  These statistics are truly overwhelming  But what really motivates me to devote so much energy to this issue was meeting more and more people  like our delegates today and their families  whose lives have been forever changed by diabetes  That is why it is so important that you have all traveled to Washington today to tell your stories  You put human faces on all of the statistics  You will help us to focus on what Congress can do to help us better understand and ultimately conquer this terrible disease     Actress Mary Tyler Moore has lived with diabetes for 40 years and is the international spokesperson for JDRF  She is an advocate for increased federal funding for research and today she described how critical the cooperation between JDRF and the government is to eventually finding a cure  Ms  Moore called the JDRF Childrens Congress delegates a determined bunch  and said we are here to remind the government of the urgency of efforts to increase research dollars and are willing to do our part to help in the effort     Maine delegate Caitlin Crawford added  When I learned I had diabetes  my life changed forever      I would do anything to go back to living a normal life   I always feel different  My family has been very supportive and I realize all they have had to give up because of my disease  Caitlin is an avid skier and compared that to the way she deals with the disease saying she knows she must plan ahead and realizes that challenges are in front of her  But  unlike a race that has a beginning and an end  she says  at this point  diabetes does not have an end    This is the fourth Childrens Congress hearing that Senator Collins has chaired  As the founder and Co Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus  Senator Collins is a leading Senate champion for the 16 million Americans with diabetes  Since Senator Collins founded the caucus  funding for diabetes research at the National Institutes for Health has more than tripled from  319 million in 1997 to more than a billion dollars last year  She has also introduced a number of important bills that were signed into law  which resulted in increased funding for diabetes research and to promote better health care for people with diabetes  Last month  64 Senators joined Senator Collins in sending a letter to the Senate Leadership urging increased funding for Type 1 diabetes     Senator Collins is a recipient of both the JDRFs Congressional Leadership Award and the American Diabetes Associations National Public Leadership Award           Click picture to
