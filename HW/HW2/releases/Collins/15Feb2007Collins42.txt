                                     Collins urges Defense Secretary to ensure troops are adequately protected February 15  2007 was        In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates today  Senator Susan Collins and several of her Senate colleagues  expressed grave concerns about recent reports that U S  troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan still might not have adequate supplies of body armor and force protection equipment     Senator Collins  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  has long been concerned that U S  troops who are performing very difficult and dangerous missions might not have adequate supplies of protective equipment  Most recently  on February 1st  Senator Collins questioned General George Casey during his confirmation hearing to become Army Chief of Staff  Collins  referring to a recent report from the Department of Defense Inspector General  said  The findings of this audit trouble me greatly  The inspector general performed the audit to determine whether units deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were equipped in accordance with mission requirements  The I G  s Office received responses from approximately 1 100 service members  so this was a significant sample  And its report states that these individuals  quote  experienced shortages of force protection equipment  such as up armored vehicles  electronic countermeasure devices  crew served weapons  and communications equipment  As a result  servicemembers were not always equipped to effectively complete their missions  This troubles me terribly  I think it is simply wrong for us to send troops into harm s way without fully equipping them  without giving them up armored vehicles    Following is the full text of the Senators letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates    Dear Mr  Secretary   We are writing to express our grave concerns about recent reports of inadequate supplies of body armor and force protection equipment for troops being deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom   According to a report by the Department of Defense in late 2005  many of the fatalities caused by upper body injuries in Iraq could be prevented if all body armor issued to our troops included side armor plates  In response to this report  many of us in the Senate asked then Secretary Rumsfeld to ensure that the best available body armor be delivered to our soldiers in harm s way as quickly as possible  We were assured that the Department of Defense would promptly begin procurement and delivery of an additional 230 000 sets of side armor plates   A January 25  2007 report from the Inspector General  however  found continued shortages in force protection equipment for our soldiers  The report found shortages in body armor  up armored vehicles  communications equipment  and electronic countermeasure devices  We have also heard first hand accounts that many service members being issued body armor are still not receiving side armor plates  It seems reasonable to surmise that if a service member requires body armor for their job  the side armor plates would provide extra protection    These accounts alone are troubling  but the Presidents plan to send more than 20 000 additional troops to Baghdad raises further questions about our ability to properly equip and protect our men and women in uniform  When asked by The Washington Post about the Presidents surge proposal  Lt  Gen  Stephen Speakes  the Army s deputy chief of staff for force development  said  We don t have the  armor  kits  and we don t have the trucks  This statement raises grave concerns about our ability to equip and protect not just the soldiers that are currently fighting  but also the new soldiers that the President is planning to send to Baghdad    In light of these concerns  we respectfully ask that you provide us an update of how many troops currently in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been issued body armor with side armor plates  In addition  we would like to know what percentage of troops currently being mobilized in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are not being issued complete sets of body armor that include side armor plates  We would also like to know the number and proportion of troops in each of the services  including figures for both the National Guard and the Reserve  receiving this essential protective equipment  Finally  we would like to know what steps the Department of Defense is taking to implement the recommendations made by the Inspector General in its January 25 report on force protection equipment shortages among deployed units   We are sure you agree that our men and women in uniform deserve nothing less than the best protective equipment  If there are indeed shortages of complete body armor sets  or shortages of other force protection equipment  among our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan  we urge you to take immediate action to correct this grave problem  You can be certain that we stand ready with our colleagues to assist you overcome any shortfall that you identify in the most expeditious way possible   Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this urgent matter          Click picture
