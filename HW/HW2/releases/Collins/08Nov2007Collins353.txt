                                     Bill provides for more competition  less sole source contracting  and stronger management of federal contracts November 8  2007 Washington  DC        The U S  Senate has unanimously approved the bipartisan Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007  authored by Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and Joe Lieberman  ID CT   The bill will strengthen competition in federal contracting  add transparency to the process  and help curtail waste  fraud  and abuse of taxpayers money  Additional cosponsors include Norm Coleman  R MN   Tom Carper  D DE   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Daniel Akaka  D HI    Senator Collins said  The federal governments prodigious purchasing can create abundant opportunities for waste  fraud  and abuse  Whether the problem is purchases of unusable trailers for hurricane victims  shoddy construction of schools and clinics in Iraq  or abuse of purchase cards by government employees  we must do a better job of protecting taxpayer dollars and delivering better acquisition outcomes    Federal contract purchases now exceed  400 billion a year  and the amount of waste that has been uncovered through our committees investigations is alarming  It is clear that our federal contracting process is in need of comprehensive reforms  Federal agencies are awarding too many no bid contracts  This bill will strengthen competition in federal contracting  said Senator Collins  Senator Collins also added that this bill also focuses on the governments acquisition workforce  which has been long neglected  By increasing the competencies and skills and numbers of our acquisition workforce  we will also ensure that the amount of waste and abuse will be reduced and the taxpayers dollars better spent    Senator Lieberman said  Government spending on contracts has exploded  while the trained workforce that oversees them has shrunk  This has already contributed to infuriating examples of waste  and the problem will only worsen in the years ahead if we don t act together  A successful system for buying goods and services requires careful planning and negotiation before the contract is signed  followed by rigorous oversight through the life of the contract  With billions and billions of taxpayers  dollars at stake  both the government and contractors have a responsibility to do a better job than they are now  The Accountability in Government Contracting Act will go a long way toward making sure the taxpayers are getting their money s worth     MORE       CONTRACTING REFORM  2      The dollar amount of federal contracts has nearly doubled since the year 2000  but the number of contracts that were awarded following a full and open competition has fallen below 50 percent  The Collins Lieberman legislation would require more federal contracts to be competitively bid    The bill also increases competition by mandating competition for all government task or delivery orders over  100 000  The legislation promotes more informed and effective competition for orders over  5 million by requiring more information in a contracts statement of work  To increase the quality of competitive bids and improve transparency of the federal acquisition process  the bill mandates post award debriefings for task or delivery orders valued over  5 million    A summary of the Accountability in Government Contracting Act follows   Help federal agencies recruit  retain  and develop an adequate acquisition workforce by creating an acquisition internship program  promoting contracting careers  requiring human capital succession plans by chief acquisition officers  and creating a new senior executive level position in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  OFPP  to manage this initiative      Create a Contingency Contracting Corps  a group of highly trained and experienced federal contracting professionals available to respond to emergency and contingency situations      Strengthen effective oversight and transparency when sole source contracting is appropriate by requiring publication of notices at the FedBizOpps website of all sole source task or delivery orders above the simplified acquisition threshold within ten business days after the award      Rein in the practice of awarding contracts missing key terms  such as price  scope  or schedule  and then failing to supply those terms until the contractor delivers the good or service  by requiring contracting officers to unilaterally determine all missing terms  if not mutually agreed upon  within 180 days or before a certain percentage of the work is performed      Reinforce the governments preference for making multiple awards when competing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity  IDIQ  contracts by limiting the award of an IDIQ contract for services valued over  100 million to a single vendor      Ensure that interagency contracting is producing value by requiring OFPP to collect and make publicly available data on the numbers  scope  users  and rationales for these contracts  and to approve all proposed multi agency IDIQ contracts before they are awarded      Target wasteful use of government purchase cards by seeking better analysis of purchase card use to identify fraud  identify potential savings  negotiate discounts  collect and disseminate best practices  and address small business concerns in micro purchases      Address the de facto outsourcing of program management responsibility when a large contractor becomes the lead systems integrator for a multi part project by requiring OFPP to provide guidance to agencies on the appropriate use of lead systems integrators      Place a limit on the length of contracts awarded non competitively under urgent and compelling circumstances                                                                         Browse by
