                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May 16  2005  Washington  D C      U S  Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Russ Feingold  D WI  have urged Senate Appropriators to include at least  10 million in the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor HHS Appropriations bill to strengthen the dental workforce in our nation   s rural and underserved communities   The Senators are asking that funding be allocated for the Collins Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act which authorizes funding for grants to help States develop innovative dental workforce development programs specific to their individual needs          Far too many Americans today do not have access to dental care  including adults and children in rural areas of Maine that are currently facing a serious shortage of dentists   This should not be happening in a country where we have the medical expertise to treat and prevent dental health problems     Senator Collins said      By allocating funds to this critical grant program  Maine and other states will have the ability to make oral health care services more accessible to patients in rural and underserved communities              I continue to hear about the negative impact that the lack of dental care is having on the health of families in Wisconsin  particularly in Milwaukee and our rural communities     Feingold said      That is why this legislation is essential in getting badly needed resources to the states so they can help residents in rural and underserved areas gain access to good dental care          The text of the letter is as follows       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin       The Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2002 included the Collins Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act  which is intended to improve access to oral health care by strengthening the dental workforce in our nation   s rural and underserved communities  The legislation authorizes  50 million through FY 2006 for grants to States to help them develop innovative dental workforce development programs specific to their individual needs  and we are writing to request that you include at least  10 million for this program in the FY 2006 Labor HHS Appropriations bill       While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last 50 years  these improvements have not occurred evenly across all sectors of our population  particularly among low income individuals and families  Too many Americans today lack access to dental care  While there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delay the progression of dental health problems  an estimated 25 million Americans live in areas lacking adequate dental services  As a consequence  these effective treatment and prevention programs are not being implemented in many of our communities  Astoundingly  as many as eleven percent of our nation   s rural population has never been to the dentist       This situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce is graying  More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will retire in the next ten years and the number of dental graduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees  As a consequence  many states are facing a serious shortage of dentists  particularly in rural areas       The Dental Health Improvement Act authorized a new State grant program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services that is designed to improve access to oral health services in rural and underserved areas  States could use these grants to fund a wide variety of programs  For example  they could use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment programs for dentists practicing in underserved areas  They could also use the grant funds to establish or expand community or school based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental clinics  To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts  States could use the funds for placement and support of dental students  residents  and advanced dentistry trainees  Or  they could use the grant funds for continuing dental education  through distance based education  and practice support through teledentistry       The FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriation bill included approximately  10 million worth of earmarks for dental projects in nine states that could have been eligible for funding through this grant program had it been funded  There clearly is a need to make oral health care services more accessible in our nation   s rural and underserved communities  and we therefore urge you to provide at least  10 million for this critically important grant program in the FY 2006 Labor HHS Appropriations bill        Thank you for your consideration of our request  and we look forward to working with you       Sincerely                                                                                      Browse by
