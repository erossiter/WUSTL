                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               February 8  2006  Washington  DC     U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Susan Collins  R Maine  and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  today introduced bipartisan legislation to prevent Medicare prescription drug plans from ending coverage of drugs that were available when seniors enrolled in the plan     Cosponsors included Senators Byron Dorgan  D N D    Jeff Bingaman  D N M    Lincoln Chafee  R R I    Hillary Rodham Clinton  D N Y    Charles Schumer  D N Y    Patty Murray  D Wash    and Barbara Boxer  D Calif          Seniors deserve the peace of mind to know that access to their prescription drugs will not be abruptly canceled during the course of their annual enrollment     Senator Feinstein said     There currently is no guarantee that the drug a senior urgently needs will be covered all year  even after the senior has taken time to choose a plan at an affordable price   Seniors can   t and shouldn   t have to wait a year to obtain lifesaving and life sustaining drugs they thought would be covered all year by their drug plan        Specifically  the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act would guarantee seniors that the prescription drugs covered by their plan will continue to be covered the remainder of the calendar year in which they enrolled  For example  seniors who enrolled in a plan in January would be guaranteed access to specific prescription drugs would remain consistent until the following year  Likewise  seniors who become eligible to enroll for the benefit later in the year   say in July or September   would be guaranteed that their prescription drug coverage would be the same until January  Seniors would then have the option of changing plans the next year if the company stopped covering a drug they need        Under current law  prescription drug plans can change which drugs they cover as many times as they want throughout the year  so long as they give advance notice to their enrollees  However  seniors have no recourse other than going through an appeals process which may or may not result in them getting their medicines if their drug plan suddenly drops their medicines   Seniors are required to wait until the next open enrollment period which may be as much as nine months away            Seniors are encouraged to choose their drug plan on the basis of the drugs that are covered     Senator Collins said     This legislation will help protect them from a potential    bait and switch     and will ensure that the prescription drugs that they need will continue to be covered by that plan               The way the drug benefit is set up is weighted against seniors     insurers are able to make changes in coverage throughout the year  but seniors are only allowed to change plans during the annual open enrollment period     Senator Snowe said      It is unreasonable to ask seniors to accept unexpected changes to their plans after they have spent so much time and effort choosing one that suits their needs   The drug benefit should work for seniors  and our bill will ensure that they have coverage for the drugs they need throughout the year           This legislation is really a move toward common sense     Senator Dorgan said     It is difficult enough for seniors to navigate the confusion and complexity built into the Medicare prescription drug benefit  They ought to be able to do so at least secure in the knowledge that once they   ve done that  the plan they   ve chosen isn   t going to change midstream and drop medicines they need and depend upon  Seniors need the protection and certainty this legislation extends to them           Medicare beneficiaries deserve an assurance that the critical medicines they need  and chose their new drug plan based on  remain accessible to them     Senator Clinton said      Drug plans should not be able to alter their list of covered drugs  while seniors and the disabled remain locked in  forced to pay more or change medications   We will fix this critical flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program      Summary    What the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act does         If a senior signs up for a plan in January  the drugs covered by the plan will continue to be covered the rest of that year         If a senior become eligible for Medicare during the year  for instance he or she turns 65 in May  and signs up for a plan  the drugs covered by the plan when at the time of enrollment will continue to be covered the rest of that year  and          If at the end of the year during the open enrollment period  a prescription drug plan wants to change its formulary  it can do that   The plan must then notify its enrollees of the formulary changes and seniors can then decide whether to stick with that plan or switch to a different plan     Exceptions when a plan can change its formulary during the year         A generic alternative is introduced in the market        A brand name drug loses its patent protection        The FDA Commissioner removes the drug from the market or imposes a restriction on the use of the drug  or      The drug is deemed to be ineffective     In each of these instances  the plan must notify the Health and Human Services Secretary  affected enrollees  physicians  and pharmacies of the change
