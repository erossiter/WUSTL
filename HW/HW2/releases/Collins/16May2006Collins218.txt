                                      May 16  2006 WASHINGTON  D C Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  and Susan Collins  R ME  are requesting  5 1 billion to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2007  In a letter to the Senate Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations  Senators Snowe and Collins  along with 41 of their colleagues  expressed their support for this important program and urged subcommittee leaders to provide advanced appropriations for the LIHEAP program for FY 2008 in order for states to plan more efficiently    Each year  4 5 million low income families  including about 46 450 households in Maine  rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes  LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs    The following is the full text of the Senators letter   The Honorable Arlen Specter  Chairman The Honorable Tom Harkin  Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Senate Committee on Appropriations   May 15  2006  Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin   We would like to express our strong support for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   and respectfully request an appropriation of  5 1 billion to fund the program in fiscal year 2007  We appreciate your strong and consistent leadership on this critical program to help low income households address high energy burdens   Earlier this year  during consideration of the Senate budget resolution  S  Con  Res  83   the Senate adopted an amendment by a vote of 51 49 to increase the funds available to carry out the LIHEAP program to  5 1 billion  the level authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005  P L  109 58   Providing  5 1 billion for the regular program will help states reach a greater percentage of the approximately 34 million eligible households  and as a result  create an effective and broad safety net for those people least able to pay their utility bills   In 2005  nearly five million low income households  persons with disabilities  and seniors on fixed incomes across the country received LIHEAP assistance  Unfortunately  largely due to funding limitations  an estimated 28 million low income households  or 84 percent of those eligible  did not receive any assistance at all  Without LIHEAP assistance  too many households face the impossible choice between paying home energy bills and affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing  and food  Unaffordable home energy can lead to homelessness and housing abandonment  health and safety problems  and lack of educational attainment for children   We also request that you provide advanced appropriations for the program for fiscal year 2008  Advanced funding allows states to plan more efficiently  and therefore  more economically  State LIHEAP directors begin planning in spring and early summer for the upcoming year  Without advanced funding  state directors are unable to plan program outreach or leverage resources as effectively  Advanced funding also ensures that states have the necessary funding to open their programs at the beginning of the fiscal year in order to provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait   LIHEAP also protects public health and safety by keeping families warm in winter and cool in summer  LIHEAP helps low income families weatherize their homes  helping to lower their energy bill  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year  With so many American households still desperately in need of the assistance provided by LIHEAP  and with an expected rise in home energy prices  increased funding for the program must be a top priority in the fiscal year 2007 appropriations process   Thank you for your consideration of our request                                                                              Browse by
