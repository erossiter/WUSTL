                                     Maine Senators join more than 40 colleagues in bipartisan effort to outline concerns over children   s health insurance guidelines September 11  2007 Washington  DC       In a letter to the President  U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe and Susan Collins have joined 42 of their colleagues expressing opposition to recent requirements laid out by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services  CMS  to limit the ability of states to provide health insurance to uninsured children  Recently  CMS notified state health officials across the country of new rules for states covering children under the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   Two requirements in the letter were highlighted as particularly onerous  one that would require children with family income greater than 250 percent of the poverty level family   51 625  for a family of four  to be uninsured for at least one year prior to being eligible for coverage through SCHIP  and a second requiring that states demonstrate that at least 95 percent of children from families earning less than 200 percent of the poverty level   41 300  are enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid prior to expanding coverage to children with higher family incomes    Over the past decade  SCHIP has helped the nation move closer to the goal of quality health care for all children  said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement  The program has proven remarkably effective for parents who cannot afford health insurance  yet make too much money to qualify for Medicaid  We are concerned that the new requirements set forth by the Administration will force states  like Maine  to meet unattainable goals and could result in the loss of coverage for families who rely on this assistance   Following is the full text of the letter   Dear Mr  President      We are writing today to express our strong opposition to the recent requirements laid out by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services  CMS  regarding the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   The letter sent from CMS to State Health Officials on August 17 included new requirements for states that wish to continue covering or those seeking to extend coverage to children in families with incomes above 250 percent of the federal poverty level    We oppose these new requirements as they will result in the loss of coverage for tens of thousands of children and could block efforts underway by other states working to insure more kids  SCHIP provides health insurance to low income children whose parents work  Unfortunately  for most  their parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid  yet cannot afford private coverage  Therefore  SCHIP has served as a vital safety net filling the void and protecting against increased numbers of uninsured children  Thus  as access to private insurance has grown farther and farther out of reach of the working poor  many states have shown leadership by utilizing SCHIP to expand coverage  Unfortunately  the new restrictions outlined in the CMS letter impose unnecessary and insurmountable roadblocks to a states ability to help additional uninsured children      Further  the policy  as outlined in the August 17 letter  represents a dramatic change in Administration policy  At least one third of states now cover children above 250 percent of the federal poverty level  nearly all of which were approved during your tenure  with additional states working to implement plans to cover children at or above this level  More troubling  this policy was released just weeks after the Senate passed a bipartisan bill reauthorizing SCHIP that allows states to continue covering children under their current approved plan and to expand coverage to children with family incomes up to 300 percent of poverty  While the Administration has expressed opposition to this bill  it passed with support from more than two thirds of the Senate  reflecting the immense support for this program and the policies designed to reach uninsured children      We agree that all states should be making an effort to identify and enroll low income children in Medicaid and SCHIP  That is why the Senate passed bill provides incentives and establishes outreach and enrollment goals to cover low income children should states wish to expand their programs  Your proposed rule  however  requires states to meet unattainable enrollment levels and will only result in the loss of coverage  Furthermore  the rule would require that children remain uninsured for 12 months  This not only places our nations young people in harms way  it could serve to drive up health care costs due to over utilization of Emergency Rooms  Not only is this bad public policy  but it could actually harm America s children      In conclusion  we urge you to withdraw CMS new requirements  At the very least  we urge you to more appropriately propose this policy as a formal rule under the normal procedure with a notification and comment period  Failure to do so could harm tens of thousands of our nations children and they deserve a chance to be heard      We look forward to working with you in a bipartisan manner to ensure that Americas children do not lose the health coverage they so desperately need                                                                               Browse by
