                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Collins Floor Statement Attached May 11  2006 WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Susan Collins will vote in support of legislation that will prevent increases on taxes on capital gains and dividends for American individuals and families  It also includes Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  relief and a provision to benefit small businesses    Without the AMT relief provided in this bill  the number of middle income taxpayers subject to AMT would increase to 20 million in 2006  up from just 3 million in 2004     The tax reconciliation legislation  which is expected to be considered by the Senate later today  includes a two year extension from 2008 to 2010 of capital gains and dividends tax relief  It also provides for a one year extension of AMT relief    The American economy is back on a strong  growing track  partly because of tax relief provisions that benefit individuals and families  American families and the American economy do not need a tax increase  But without congressional approval  when current law expires  the result will be an increase of taxes on dividends  capital gains  and the AMT    Senator Collins pointed out that according to the Congressional Budget Office  capital gains revenue jumped from  49 billion prior to the 2003 tax relief legislation to almost  80 billion last year  This is despite the fact that some had predicted a loss of  3 billion resulting from the tax relief provision     In addition  since the 2003 tax relief bill  the economy has grown at nearly 4 percent per year  more than 5 million jobs have been created  and the unemployment rate has dropped to 4 7 percent  beneath the average of the past three years   According to the IRS  in Maine  it is estimated that over 100 000 families benefit from capital gains tax relief  over 140 000 families benefit from dividends relief  and nearly 26 500 benefit from AMT relief     FACTS ON THIS TAX RELIEF LEGISLATION    Protects 20 million Americans from being subjected to the Alternative Minimum Tax     500 000 Maine taxpayers benefit from the 2003 tax relief legislation     An estimated 135 000 Maine businesses benefit from the business specific provisions of the bill     100 000 Maine taxpayers benefit from the reduction in capital gains and dividends     Maintains the 15 percent reduction in dividend and capital gains taxes enacted in 2003  An estimated 28 million taxpayers will receive an average benefit of  989 from the 15 percent dividend and capital gains tax rate  including 8 5 million elderly taxpayers  who will receive an estimated  1 144 per person in relief from these provisions     All information provided above was compiled by the U S  Department of Treasury or the Congressional Research Service  Except where otherwise stated  benefits reflect the cumulative effect of all tax relief provisions enacted since 2001  portions of which are extended in this tax reconciliation package   Following is Senator Collins floor statement on the tax bill    Mr  President  the Senate is now considering H R  4297  the Tax Reconciliation conference report  This bill contains several important tax relief provisions  including relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax  extended expensing provisions for small businesses  and a two year extension of the 15  tax rate on dividends and capital gains  I will be voting for this bill in order to block tax increases that would be harmful to our economy and to our citizens    According to the latest data that I have seen  more than 100 million American taxpayers benefit from the various tax reductions that we have passed since 2001  In Maine  100 000 taxpayers have benefited from the lower Capital Gains and Dividends tax rate  and about 25 500 Maine taxpayers have benefited from AMT relief     The five year cost of this reconciliation package is just under  70 billion  Of this amount  nearly half     33 4 billion  will go to provide an additional year of relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax    The AMT was originally enacted to ensure that all taxpayers  especially high income taxpayers  paid at least a minimum amount of federal taxes  But the AMT is not indexed for inflation  and because of this flaw  each year a larger number of middle income Americans find themselves subject to this stealth tax  In fact  without the relief provided in this bill  the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT will increase to 20 million in 2006  up from just 3 million in 2004    I believe it is essential to protect middle income families from the AMT stealth tax  I also believe that the 15  capital gains and dividends tax rates have proven their effectiveness  and ought to be extended    When I voted to support lower capital gains and dividends taxes in 2003  my hope was that this tax policy would help lift our economy out of recession  and restore the healthy growth we need to create good jobs and opportunity for Americans  Since that tax relief became law  our economy has grown at nearly 4  per year  and over 5 million new jobs have been created  The unemployment rate has dropped to 4 7     beneath the average of the past three decades     I am aware of the ongoing debate among economists over whether  and to what extent  tax cuts can pay for themselves  Whatever one thinks of that debate  I cannot help but note how far off the estimated cost of this tax relief was  The year before this tax relief became law  the federal government received  49 billion in revenues through the capital gains tax    at the 20  rate  The Joint Tax Committee predicted that reducing the rate to 15  would reduce revenues by  3 billion from 2003 to 2005  But  in fact  capital gains tax revenues jumped instead    to  71 billion in 2004  and  80 billion last year    all paid at the lower 15  rate     To me  the vote on this bill is not about settling a debate among economists  My focus is on finding the right tax policy to help keep our economy healthy  and growing  It is only with strong economic growth that our nation will be able to meet the needs we currently face  needs that will only become more urgent as our society ages    Many in this chamber  and many of my constituents  are concerned about our growing national debt  I share this concern  That is why I have been a consistent supporter of the pay go rules throughout my tenure in the Senate  But I continue to be struck by the difference that even a small change in our economys growth rate can make to the deficit  and to the revenues we need to support critical social programs  According to the Congressional Budget Office  a change of just 1 10th of 1  in the GDP growth rate over a 10 year period would change revenues by  224 billion  and spending by  48 billion  for a total net impact of  272 billion on the deficit       The actual growth rate we have experienced since 2003 has been higher by at least two tenths of 1  than CBO predicted before the 15  tax rate was enacted  In light of the fact that CBO estimates that a 0 1  change can have a net impact of  272 billion on the deficit  it is so important to maintain policies that maintain a healthy growth rate       For all of these reasons  I will be supporting the tax reconciliation bill                                                                              Browse by
