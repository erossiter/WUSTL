                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                April 27  2007  Maine is beginning to clean up following a powerful spring Noreaster that recently hit our state with heavy rain and high winds  This terrible storm  the worst natural disaster to strike Maine since the Ice Storm of 1998  caused massive storm surges  astronomical high tides  and inland and coastal flooding that left behind a trail of destruction from York to Washington County  According to the Maine Emergency Management Agency  at one point during the storm  more than 285 000 homes were without electricity     The state estimates that it will cost at least  25 million to repair all of the damage  Along with our entire states delegation  I have requested that the Administration rapidly approve the Governors request for federal disaster assistance on behalf of the 13 counties severely impacted by the storm  As Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  I was pleased that David Paulison  the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   accepted my invitation to come to Maine and see some of the damage first hand and determine how the federal government can assist  We were also grateful that Roger Garland  Director of Programs and Policies in Disaster Assistance at the Small Business Administration  was also able to accompany us  at Senator Snowes request  and get a personal sense of how that agency can better assist small business owners in their recovery efforts     We began the day on the Portland waterfront where local city  fire  and emergency management officials updated us on the damage  We heard stories of roads that were damaged and even completely washed out  Tens of thousands of families in Cumberland  Sagadahoc  and up and down the coast  were left without electricity for several days and many were forced to leave their homes and find refuge in local shelters that were established  Piers along the Portland waterfront  and the waterfront walking trail  also sustained severe damage    Our next stop brought us to Camp Ellis and Ferry Beach in Saco two locations that often bear the brunt of coastal storms and this storm was no exception  Here  we were joined by Colonel Curtis Thalken  District Engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers  During the height of the storm  several seasonal homes along the oceanfront were devastated  In addition  many homeowners in the area are still dealing with flooded basements  I have long been concerned with the safety and well being of the people of Camp Ellis and the severe erosion being caused by a jetty  built by the Army Corps  more than 100 years ago  Earlier this year  Senator Snowe and I introduced the Camp Ellis Beach Restoration Act to ensure that the Army Corps has the resources and direction necessary to fully protect Camp Ellis in the future  I am pleased that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently voted to authorize  20 million to help fund this restoration project  I believe that it is critical that Administrator Paulison  and Colonel Thalken  saw this damage with their own eyes and that they will help us as we continue our efforts to address this problem     In Kennebunk  we toured the area along Beach Avenue  one of the hardest hit areas of town  The sea wall along Goochs Beach was destroyed and the road it used to protect remains closed to traffic  The damage is incredible  We also heard from residents who live along the Mousam River and heard the stories of business owners who have to endure severe floods for the second time in less than a year  It is a terrible hardship    In Alfred  we met with local emergency management officials who worked literally around the clock  not only to prepare for the storm but to assess the damage in the hours and days following  I personally thanked members of the York County Emergency Management Agency  Maine Game Warden Service  Maine Forest Service  Maine Marine Patrol  U S  Coast Guard  American Red Cross  and many volunteers  for all their efforts  We owe a debt of gratitude to these folks who give so much of their time to do all they can to try and protect us during and after storms such as this     As the Ice Storm of 1998 brought out the best in Maine people  so did this recent storm  I was impressed with the level of readiness of our town and city officials and our local emergency management agencies  Without the incredible amount of preparation that they put into planning for events such as this  the amount of damage could have been even worse  All along our tour of the damaged area  I heard stories of neighbors helping each other during their time of need  Local fire departments went door to door to check on residents and make sure our elderly neighbors were warm and safe  More than 200 members of our National Guard  from all around Maine  left the safety and comfort of their own homes and families to stand guard and direct traffic away from unsafe roads and free up police and firefighters so they could focus on other important duties  These heartwarming stories of people doing what they can to help others characterize Maine people  As we proved during the Ice Storm  and we are proving yet again  Mother Nature might deliver us a tough blow    but we Mainers will recover and we will be better than ever    UPDATE  Senator Collins recently applauded a Presidential Disaster Declaration for six Maine counties affected by the Patriot s Day storm  Those counties eligible for public assistance include Androscoggin  Cumberland  Kennebec  Knox  Oxford  and York  This declaration is a necessary step in securing federal funds and makes local  county  and state government eligible for assistance  In addition  FEMA determined that all Maine counties are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program               Click picture to view video     Senator Collins invited FEMA Administrator David Paulison to Maine to view some of the
