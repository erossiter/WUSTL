Reduction Plan  ALTWRP      U S  Senator Susan Collins issued this statement    I am disappointed that NMFS did not carefully consider the full economic impact on Maines fishing industry in calculating the exemption line or the implementation date  While I appreciate that NMFS did incorporate some of the recommendations I made with regard to moving the exemption line further offshore as proposed by the Maine Department of Marine Resources  it is discouraging that Maines lobster industry will be forced to comply with a rule that did not sufficiently analyze how Maines lobster industry will be affected  Supporting efforts to protect our endangered whale populations is critical  but in doing so  we must make sure federal regulations are effective  balanced  and fair  Unfortunately  the rule published by NMFS fails to strike this balance     Last month  Senator Collins sent comments to the Assistant Administrator of NOAA Fisheries  Bill Hogarth  on proposed regulations drafted by NMFS that would require Maines lobster industry to comply with gear modifications intended to protect North American whale populations  The gear modifications mandate that floating groundlines  which connect one trap to another  be replaced with sinking groundlines  With the exception of certain exempted areas  the final rule bans floating groundlines from Maine to Florida  Inside the exemption areas  Maines lobstermen will be allowed to continue to use floating groundlines  which are critical to prevent lobster gear from becoming entangled on Maines rocky underwater habitat     Senator Collins urged NMFS to consider the best available science to place the exemption line and to consider the delaying the implementation date to account for the difficulty of converting fishing gear mid season and to give rope manufacturers time to supply the market     The following is the full text of the letter   September 24  2007  Dr  Bill Hogarth Assistant Administrator for Fisheries NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service 1315 East West Highway Silver Spring  MD 20910    Dear Dr  Hogarth    I am writing to comment on the Final Environmental Impact Statement  FEIS  for amending the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan  ALTWRP   The fishing industry is an important component of Maines economy  and changes to the ALTWRP will affect many lobstermen throughout my state  I am concerned that the preferred alternative proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS  does not fully account for the economic hardship such a rule will have on Maines fishing communities    I appreciate that NOAA Fisheries Service in working with the State of Maine has developed an exemption line that excludes some of Maines rock bottom habitat  Such an exemption line is supported by 35 years of sound science collected by the Northeast Fisheries Service Center  These data  which tracks whale sightings and monitors right whale feeding habits  are the right measure for determining the appropriate balance of protecting whales and minimizing impacts on the lobster industry  An accurately positioned exemption line is critical for the protection of large whales  but is also critical to ensure the economic viability of lobstermen who rely on floating groundline to avoid catching on rocky bottom areas  As more precise data become available  I believe the exemption line should be positioned accordingly    I am also concerned the proposed implementation date for the sinking groundline provision ignores certain practical realities that accompany such profound industry wide change  First  rope manufacturers have reported to the Maine Department of Marine Resources  DMR  and the Maine Lobstermens Association that they are unable to supply the quantity of sinking groundline to meet the demand by Maines fixed gear fishing industry  Second  mandating that the sinking groundline rule be implemented by October of 2008 poses a significant impediment to Maines lobstermen who would be required to convert their gear mid season  Alternatively  an implementation date at the end of the fishing season would facilitate a more realistic transition from floating to sinking groundline  To provide more time to produce sinking  or low profile  rope  and to implement a rule that better aligns with the natural fishing cycle  I urge you to move the implementation date from October 2008  to June of 2010  as proposed by the State of Maine   While the NMFS preferred alternative notes that the cost to comply with the proposed regulation is approximately  14 million annually  I am concerned that the adverse economic impact on small  family owned vessels could be far more extensive  The Government Accountability Office conducted a report to determine the extent to which NMFS assessed the costs to the fishing industry in developing revisions to ALWTRP  The report  released in July  concluded that NMFSs economic assessment did not reflect significant uncertainties that remain in order to better understand the impact gear modifications will have on fishing communities    While I certainly support the overall goal of the ALWTRP to protect the right whale  I believe that any changes to these regulations must fully consider the economic impact those changes will have on Maines lobster industry  I believe that further analysis of the regulatory cost of this rule is required and suggest that reasonable alternatives be considered that would achieve the goal of protecting the right whale while reducing the burden on our lobstermen   The Maine lobster industry is an environmentally responsive fishery that   has worked hard to protect endangered whales  To avoid imposing an undue burden on this industry  I would urge NMFS to take into account my comments  as well as those from the Maine DMR and the Maine Lobstermens Association  and adopt the recommendations outlined in GAOs report before implementing revisions to the ALWTRP
