                                      Senator Collins examines a saltmarsh sharp tailed sparrow with Dr  David Evers  executive director of BioDiversity Research Institute   A new study found elevated mercury in these insect eating sparrows along with evidence that fewer chicks survive in birds with higher mercury levels  August 28  2007 Wells  Maine    In an event with US Senator Susan Collins  the BioDiversity Research Institute  BRI  and the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service this week released new findings on mercury in a songbird that inhabits New Englands estuaries and national wildlife refuges  The songbird  the saltmarsh sharp tailed sparrow  is listed by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service as a bird of conservation concern  BRI scientists found elevated mercury in these insect eating sparrows along with evidence that fewer chicks survive in birds with higher mercury levels   The new findings demonstrate that mercury contamination is not limited to freshwater lakes or to species that eat fish  Ms  Oksana Lane is a biologist with the BioDiversity Research Institute and a lead author of the study  She noted  We were surprised to find such elevated mercury in the sparrows we sampled in national wildlife refuges set aside to protect birds and other sensitive animals    The saltmarsh sharp tailed sparrow is an important indicator species for examining the impacts of mercury because approximately 95 percent of the global population breeds in the Northeast  Therefore contamination issues in New England breeding grounds could pose a serious threat to the long term health of the sparrows population  Dr  David Evers  executive director of BRI and a co author of the study commented on the implications of the new research  These findings raise concerns about the long term health of birds with limited ranges that accumulate mercury in their bloodstreams while breeding in New England  To my mind  the findings prompt the question of whether setting aside land as refuges goes far enough to protect sensitive wildlife given that pollution doesnt respect boundary lines   In response to the new scientific study  Senator Collins called for the U S  Congress to stop stalling and to pass the National Mercury Monitoring Establishment Act  which she introduced last March together with Senators Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Joseph Lieberman  I D CT     According to Senator Collins  These new findings of dangerous mercury levels in New Englands saltmarsh sharp tailed sparrows add to the compelling evidence that we need a comprehensive mercury monitoring network Each new scientific study seems to find higher levels of mercury in more ecosystems and in more species than we had previously thought  We must have more comprehensive information and we must have it soon  otherwise we risk implementing misguided policies    Senator Collins expressed her renewed commitment to tracking mercury pollution  These research findings make clear to me that we must provide better data to protect the people and environment of Maine  she said   These new results were published in a BRI and U S  Fish and Wildlife Service report entitled  Methylmercury Availability in New England Estuaries as Indicated by Saltmarsh Sharp tailed Sparrow  2004 2006  To conduct the study the BRI team captured over 220 individual birds from 11 sites across four states  including four national wildlife refuges  NWR   the Rachel Carson NWR in Kennebunk  Maine  the Parker River NWR on Plum Island  Massachusetts  the Stewart B  McKinney NWR in Westport  Connecticut  and the Ningret Chafee NWR in Narragansett  Rhode Island    The researchers drew a small amount of blood from each bird and then tested it for mercury  Nearly all of the birds tested had elevated mercury levels with some as high as 3 2 parts per million    well above the concentration believed to cause adverse effects in songbirds and the levels typically measured in common loons and bald eagles  In general  mercury concentrations were highest at the Parker River NWR  which is in proximity to several major pollution sources  However  even sparrows from the Rachel Carson National NWR  which is furthest from active mercury pollution sources  had elevated mercury levels   At this week s event Dr  Evers said  If she were among us today  my guess is that Rachel Carson would be shocked at the continued contamination of our environment  and of the refuge that bears her name  Not only are large amounts of toxic mercury still released into our ecosystems  but the federal government has yet to put a system in place that will track where the mercury pollution is going  what impact its having  and what difference public policies are making  Regardless of politics in this state and elsewhere  this gap must be addressed   The event was held at The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve in Wells  Maine which encompasses part of the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge where some of the research was conducted  The research was funded by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and Maine Department of Environmental Protection   BioDiversity Research Institute is a nonprofit ecological research group in Gorham  Maine  dedicated to progressive environmental study and education that furthers global sustainability and conservation policies  Established in 1998  BRI conducts projects in 21 states and provinces throughout the U S  and Canada  and in Mexico and Belize                                                                       Browse by
