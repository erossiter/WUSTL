                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 6  2005  I will talk to you today about criterion five     a criterion that was thoroughly disregarded when the decision was made to place Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on the base closure list   Criterion five requires DoD to consider    the extent and timing of potential costs and savings    when selecting military installations for closure or realignment     It stands to reason that cost is an important factor  and indeed it falls just after the four military value criteria   For if a base closure or realignment is not going to save money  why put a community through the pain and upheaval that it would cause   DoD developed a model known as    COBRA    to estimate the costs and savings associated with a proposed base closure   According to its user manual  COBRA is designed  and I quote     to provide a consistent and auditable method of evaluating and comparing different courses of action      In the case of Portsmouth  however  the only consistency was that the COBRA results were consistently disregarded   When the Industrial Joint Cross Service Group met on January 13  2005  it had COBRA runs before it that actually showed a cost     not a savings     from closing Portsmouth   As the slide shows  the COBRA run for Portsmouth reported a  1 8 million net present value cost over twenty years from closing the facility   In contrast  the COBRA run for Pearl Harbor reported a  584 million net present value savings over twenty years from closing the facility     Yet even though the COBRA runs calculated no net present value savings to the Department from closing Portsmouth until the year 2026  the Industrial Group made the decision to recommend closure of Portsmouth   And that recommendation never changed   DoD has told us that  as the Industrial Group   s recommendation made its way up the chain to the Secretary of Defense  and I quote     COBRA runs for all of the scenarios were periodically updated with the latest data      The slide you now see shows what DoD has told us were its final COBRA runs comparing closure of Pearl and Portsmouth   As you can see  although the numbers have changed  the basic result is the same   The COBRA model reports that closing Pearl would achieve  1 3 billion in net present value savings over twenty years      760 million more in savings than closing Portsmouth would achieve   Again  we see the numbers from DoD   s own economic model ignored   And there is another flaw with DoD   s consideration of criterion five   The COBRA runs underestimated the costs of closing the Portsmouth shipyard because they ignored Portsmouth   s superior efficiency as compared to the other three shipyards     Indeed  it is undeniable that Portsmouth is the most efficient shipyard for depot level maintenance of submarines as compared to its sister yards of Pearl  Norfolk  and Puget   Efficiency is at the core of our shipyards    contribution to national security  the faster and better our submarines are repaired and upgraded  the sooner they will return to the fleet and the more effective they will be     DoD even admitted during its BRAC decision making process that Portsmouth   s efficiency is superior   In its critical January 13th meeting  the Industrial Group assessed the pros and cons of closing Portsmouth versus Pearl   As you can see  the Industrial Group   s own briefing slide states that retaining Portsmouth     quote        preserves  the  best performing SSN depot      Nevertheless  at that meeting  this committee decided to close Portsmouth       Why didn   t DoD factor Portsmouth   s superior efficiency into the COBRA runs for Portsmouth   s closure   Because DoD found it too difficult to create a metric for measuring Portsmouth   s efficiency for purposes of the COBRA analysis     The minutes of the Industrial Group reflect that this committee struggled with how to account for Portsmouth   s superior efficiency   Indeed  in our recent interviews with Defense Department officials  the Navy   s special assistant for BRAC literally used the same word     struggled        Of course  determining how to account for efficiency across the shipyards is not a simple task   But the Industrial Group did not start wrestling with this issue seriously until very late in the BRAC decision making process     On November 10  2004  the Industrial Group requested assistance from the Comptroller in determining how to account for efficiency   The Comptroller responded in late December  recommending use of a    cost per unit of production effort or simply cost per direct labor hour      Either measure would have helped capture Portsmouth   s efficiency   The Industrial Group  however  failed to reach a consensus on the Comptroller   s recommendation    On January 6  2005  the Industrial Group discussed this problem   As the slide shows  one of the participants said explicitly  and I quote     Presently  there isn   t a good metric available to capture or measure effectiveness      The committee decided to defer the issue and to establish a working group     On January 13th  despite the fact that the working group had not yet reported its recommendations  the Industrial Group met and decided to close the Portsmouth shipyard     On February 25th  the OSD level Infrastructure Steering Group approved the Industrial Group   s recommendation to close Portsmouth   Yet on March 3rd  one week after that meeting  the Industrial Group once again discussed     without success     its proposed methodology for incorporating efficiency into the COBRA runs      By then it was too late   Portsmouth never got credit for its efficiency in the COBRA runs analyzing its potential closure because the Department never established a methodology to do so      As a result  the COBRA analysis ignored the savings that have been documented   Portsmouth delivers Engineered Refueling Overhauls for  82 million cheaper and 6 months earlier than the other shipyards    average   Over the last five years  Portsmouth has delivered submarines a total of 60 weeks early   During that time  the other shipyards have been a total of 124 weeks late   But these savings were excluded from the COBRA analysis      DoD   s failure to devise a metric for crediting Portsmouth for its proven superior efficiency is all the more surprising given that DoD was willing to use an arbitrary figure of 30 percent to credit the other shipyards for efficiency savings in administrative personnel relocated from Portsmouth     In sum  Portsmouth did not receive credit in the COBRA model for its proven efficiency because the Industrial Group struggled but ultimately decided that Portsmouth   s efficiency was too difficult to account for   As a result  the Industrial Group substantially deviated from criterion five concerning the true savings and costs of closing Portsmouth
