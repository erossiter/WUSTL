                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Calls on National Association for Home Care   Hospice Members to Press Congresspersons for Support of Home Care and Hospice  No Cuts  Letters  Bills to Kill Case Mix Changes October 10  2007 Washington  DC      National Association for Home Care  Hospice  NAHC  members were visited by one of their staunchest allies this week at the 26th Annual Meeting in Denver as Sen  Susan Collins  R Maine  received the associations highest honor  NAHCs Mother Theresa Lifetime Achievement Award  named for the now beatified nun who dedicated her life to serving the poor and the sick in Calcutta  India  is given in recognition of exemplary and continuous service in the cause of caring for others    We have with us the strongest advocate for home care in the United States Senate  said NAHC President Val J  Halamanderis  You all know her    youve seen her before at NAHC meetings and youve watched her advocate for you year after year  He praised Collins efforts in the Senate to protect the elderly and infirm  adding that her work there is defined by her compassion and integrity    Shes someone that has lived her life with the idea of helping the American public as much as she humanly can  said Halamandaris  welcoming Collins to the stage  We are so pleased that she has adopted as her number one issue home care and hospice    Collins had kind words for the NAHC staff and members  commending their continued efforts to educate members of Congress on home care and hospice providers needs and ensure access to home care services  Issues affecting home care and hospice have been at the top of my priority list since I first came to the Senate  Collins said  and its been my pleasure to work closely with this great organization on a variety of initiatives to modernize and promote fairness in the Medicare home health benefit    The highly skilled services  the compassionate care that you provide each and every day  has helped to keep families together and enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older persons to avoid hospitals  emergency rooms  and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be    in the comfort  the privacy  and the security of their own homes  said Collins  She also noted that home care providers are of critical financial importance to the Medicare program  saving significant amounts of money by helping patients avoid care in costlier settings    I dont know why the people in Washington dont understand that this is true  Collins said  adding  It is so unfair that the Medicare home health benefit is once again under attack  She pointed out that a version of the House of Representatives recent bill to reauthorize the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  or SCHIP  included billions in cuts to home health  Im worried that this issue has not died  and that both the House and the Senate could soon be considering home health cuts  she said    Meanwhile  making matters worse  the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services  CMS  has made administrative changes to address so called case mix creep under the home health prospective payment system that are soon to take effect and will significantly reduce reimbursements  This would be a double whammy for home care  Collins contended    These cuts would be devastating  she continued  and  my friends  they are simply not right  This is certainly not in the interests of our nations seniors  who rely on home care to keep them out of hospitals  nursing homes  and other institutions  Nor are such changes in the common sense interests of the budget  according to Collins  We see a direct correlation  when home health care is cut  emergency room visits go up  she said  That is costly  not to mention the human cost    Collins noted she will introduce legislation  the Home Care Access Protection Act of 2007  to prevent CMSs changes to case mix adjustment  It will be matched in the House with a sister bill from Claude Pepper Award winner Rep  James McGovern  D Mass    She called on NAHC members to help garner cosponsors of the legislation    Collins contended that CMS has based its changes to the case mix methodology on a flawed assertion  The assertion is that home health agencies have intentionally gamed the system by claiming that their patients have conditions of higher clinical severity than they actually have in order to receive higher Medicare payments  she stated  CMS found the changes necessary because its data showed that the average clinical assessment score of home health patients had increased  Collins noted    However  the increase can be explained by legitimate clinical and policy reasons  the senator contended  Lets look at the facts  Collins said  For example  hospital reimbursement methodologies have led to the discharge of ever sicker patients  she pointed out  receiving a healthy round of applause from the audience  Also  advancements in technology and medical practice have allowed home health agencies to provide care for patients with more severe and complicated conditions  often at a reduced cost compared with other care settings  she said    It is so frustrating that there is no evidence of intentional gaming that would warrant such a severe financial penalty  Collins said  characterizing the CMS action as misguided  This unfair policy is being accessed across the board  even for home health agencies that have shown a decrease in their clinical assessment scores  Now  if an individual home health agency truly is gaming the system  CMS should target that agency  Collins contended  again interrupted by a burst of applause    Home health as a share of Medicare spending has dropped from 8 7 percent in 1997 to 3 2 percent today  Collins pointed out  I think it ought to be going the other way  She described the many strains and weak links in the health care system  and said home health care is the future    Home health care has consistently proven to be a compassionate  cost effective alternative to institutional care  Collins said  Additional cuts would be counter productive to our efforts to control overall health care spending    In addition to helping gather support for the case mix fix legislation  Collins said attendees should continue urging their members of Congress to sign on to letters calling for no further cuts to home health and hospice and to preserve their full market basket updates                                                                              Browse by
