                                     Sens  Collins and Inouye  Reps  Ruppersberger and Brown Lead Effort to Improve America   s Port Security and Keep Commerce Flowing March 18  2005  WASHINGTON  D C      Senator Susan M  Collins  R Maine   Senator Daniel K  Inouye  D Hawaii   Congressman C A  Dutch Ruppersberger  D Maryland   and Congressman Henry Brown  R South Carolina  will head the Congressional Port Security Caucus for the 109th Congress  The legislators will work with Caucus Members to ensure that port and maritime security remain top priorities on the Congressional Agenda       With 361 sea and river ports that receive and distribute 95  of the nation   s cargo  the United States economic strength is dependent upon vigilant port security efforts  The mission of the Caucus is to identify port security concerns and make legislative recommendations while ensuring that government partners with private industry to keep commerce flowing       Senator Susan Collins  R Maine  represents the state of Maine that has numerous ports along 3 500 miles of continuous coastline  including the Port of Portland  which is the largest throughport in New England in terms of tonnage          Port security has not received the attention it deserves nor the funding that is needed     said Senator Collins     The Port Security caucus is committed to ensuring that the Coast Guard and port authorities from coast to coast have the resources they need to keep our communities  local businesses  shipping infrastructure  fishermen  and recreational boaters safe  We will continue to advocate in Congress for increased port security funding  We will also fight to preserve a competitive grant program dedicated to port security          Senator Daniel K  Inouye  D Hawaii  is the co chairman of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee  which has jurisdiction over transportation security and maritime commerce  As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and the Merchant Marine  Inouye played a critical  leadership role in the creation and enactment of the landmark Maritime Transportation Security Act  Representing the island state of Hawaii since 1963  Inouye is the third most senior member of the Senate          Hawaii   s fate and good fortune depend on the flow of maritime commerce and superior port security     said Senator Inouye     There is still so much that needs to be done to ensure that our port system is as secure as possible  and I   m confident that the Port Security Caucus will play a pivotal role in raising public awareness on this issue  Through the Caucus  we can also help educate our Congressional colleagues about the dramatic vulnerabilities that still remain and what we must do together to address them          Congressman C A  Dutch Ruppersberger  D MD  represents Maryland   s 2nd Congressional District that includes the Port of Baltimore  The Port of Baltimore directly employs 16 000 workers  indirectly employs an additional 17 000 people  and generates  1 5 billion in revenue annually         The Port of Baltimore is one of Maryland   s biggest economic engines  To ensure that the Port of Baltimore and other Ports across the country are successful in the future  I believe we must bring together government and the private sector to balance the needs of security with the needs of business  The Port Security Caucus gives Congress a forum to work through these important issues     said Congressman Ruppersberger       Congressman Henry Brown  R SC  represents South Carolina   s 1st Congressional District that includes the Port of Georgetown and the Port of Charleston  the fourth largest container port in the country and site of DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff   s first field visit on March 14th          The Port of Charleston is a model for the successful integration of security measures that have minimal negative impact on commercial shipping operations     said Congressman Brown     Charleston is the home of Project Seahawk  the nation   s first port security command and control center  I look forward to using the Port Security Caucus as a forum to present the lessons learned as this state of the art technology is developed          The Port Security Caucus was founded in 2003 to provide a bi cameral  bi partisan Congressional effort to address security concerns at our nation   s ports after the September 11th terrorist attacks       The Port Security Caucus will post a schedule of Caucus events  articles  and other relevant information on the
