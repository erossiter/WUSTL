                                     Senator Joined by Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff  Maine Law Enforcement Officials Senator Collins recently held a press conference announcing the introduction of legislation designed to prevent domestic terrorist bombings     Senator Collins was joined by Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and leadership of Maine police departments  November 1  2007 Earlier today  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff joined Senator Susan Collins and members of Maines law enforcement community to unveil legislation authored by Senators Collins and Joe Lieberman  ID CT  that will help make our nation better prepared for the threat of Improvised Explosive Device  IED  attacks  The bipartisan National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 will enhance DHSs ability to better prepare State and local government officials  emergency response providers  and the private sector to deter  detect  prevent  protect against  and respond to terrorist explosive attacks  During a recent hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  of which Senator Collins is Ranking Member  Secretary Chertoff listed IED attacks as a major threat to the U S  In addition  the National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  identified IEDs as a significant homeland security threat     Joining Secretary Chertoff and Senator Collins today were members of Maines law enforcement communityBangor Police Department Chief Ron Gastia  Portland Police Department Deputy Chief Joseph Loughlin  and Col  Pat Fleming  head of the Maine State Police     Senator Collins said  The most likely terror threat around the world and here in the U S  is that of IEDs  We are also painfully aware that IEDs are the cause of much death and destruction in Iraq  The FBI and DHS tell us that the threat from these devices is not only real  but growing  That is why Senator Lieberman and I are introducing the bipartisan National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007  which aims to improve our defenses against this deadly weapon     Secretary Chertoff said  The weapon of choice for terrorists is bombs  He explained that everything that DHS must do should focus on our ability to disrupt and detect explosive devises  He commended Senators Collins and Lieberman for their leadership on this issue     Senator Lieberman said  An IED is relatively easy and inexpensive to make and can cause mass casualties  even to armored military personnel  They are a global threat  and the American public  here at home  is not immune  If the Department of Homeland Security is to plan effectively for future attacks here at home  it must have a cohesive and robust defense against the most likely threat of IEDs     The National Bombing Prevention Act has three primary purposes  First  the bill strengthens the Departments Office of Bombing Prevention  OBP   It authorizes enough funding 10 million for FY 2008   25 million for each of FY 2009 and FY 2010to help the office fulfill its important mission Among other things  the Act designates OBP as the Departments lead agent for combating terrorist explosive attacks and directs it to promote counter IED security planning  information sharing  and training programs     The new resources provided under this bill will enhance OBPs coordination  outreach  and training programs for state and local law enforcement  improving tactics  providing up to date threat analysis  and identifying and eliminating weaknesses in our nations defenses against IEDs  These resources will also help fund OBPs Tripwire programa secure  online information sharing network for law enforcement  bomb squads  and other first responders to learn about current terrorist bombing tactics  techniques  and procedures  including IED design and emplacement     Second  the Act formally directs the President to produce the long delayed National Strategy for Bombing Prevention and requires periodic updates to that strategy  As terrorist IED technology and tactics evolve  so too must our efforts to deter  detect  prevent  protect against  and respond to them     Third  the Act promotes more research  development  testing  and evaluation of counter explosive technologies as well as the transfer of military know how and technologies  as appropriate  to other Federal  State  and local entities with bombing prevention responsibilities  Given the militarys experience with IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and the more than  15 billion that it has devoted to developing counter explosive technology  it is imperative to accelerate the identification  modification  and commercialization of military technologies for domestic use by all levels of government  To View Photos of the Press Conference      Click picture to view video
