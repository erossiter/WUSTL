sent the following letter to Dr  Michael D  Griffin  Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA   regarding allegations that NASA officials have attempted to censor Dr  Jim Hansen  NASAs top climate scientist  Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman requested an explanation of NASAs policies on information sharing between government scientists  policy makers  and the general public and of practices concerning the independence of NASA scientists work and statements made about their work  The text of the letter is as follows    Dr  Michael D  Griffin Administrator National Aeronautics and Space Administration Washington  DC 20546  February 14  2006  Dear Dr  Griffin   We are writing to express our concern about recent news reports  notably in The New York Times that NASA officials have attempted to prevent Dr  Jim Hansen  NASAs top climate scientist and Chief of the Goddard Space Flight Center s Goddard Institute for Space Studies  from fully conveying his views  If true  this type of censorship would be an impediment of one of the most basic elements of a successful government scientific agency  informing the American public    These news reports also describe incidents in which NASA scientists were directed to shape their work or their public statements about their work in order to reflect certain priorities of the Administration   According to The New York Times  January 29  2006  Dean Acosta  deputy assistant administrator for public affairs at NASA  said that government scientists are free to discuss scientific findings  but that policy statements should be left to policy makers and appointed spokesmen   On July 18  2001  Dr  Hansen testified before our Committee  While Dr  Hansen s testimony primarily focused on his scientific findings  he also offered his view of the policy implications of his findings  We found his testimony  including his discussion of policy implications  to be extremely informative both to our Committee and to the American public   Maintaining the integrity of science is essential both to scientific inquiry and to the policy making process  To that end  we believe scientists should be free to discuss both the results and implications of their research with the scientific community  policy makers  and the American public  and to do so in a manner fully reflective of the analysis and conclusions resulting from their work  Dr  Hansens recent conclusion that 2005 was the warmest year on record  as well as the implications of that discovery with respect to the rate and volume of atmospheric build up of greenhouse gases  are highly pertinent to the ongoing scientific inquiry on climate and to the continued development of climate policy in the United States  These matters go directly to questions that both scientists and policymakers must face with respect to the amount of time society has to respond to the challenge of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and to the effects of rapid climatic change   It is imperative that scientific findings regarding the impacts of increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  and all other scientific matters   be communicated on a timely basis without any form of censorship  It is also imperative that NASA scientists be afforded the independence necessary to pursue their work   We appreciate your recent statement in support of scientific openness at NASA that instructs staff that it is not the job of public affairs officers to alter  filter or adjust engineering or scientific material produced by NASA s technical staff  This is a step in the right direction  however  further clarification of NASA s information sharing policies is required   Accordingly  we request a detailed explanation of NASAs policies on information sharing between government scientists and policy makers as well as the general public  We also request detailed clarification of NASAs policies and practices regarding the independence of NASA scientists work and statements made about their work   NASA has a history of scientific excellence  We look forward to working with you to ensure NASAs continued contributions to the understanding and protection of our planet  We appreciate your prompt response to this inquiry   Sincerely     Senator Susan Collins Senator Joseph Lieberman Chairman Ranking Member
