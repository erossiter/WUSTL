                                      February 28  2007 Washington  DC  Senator Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor in support of major legislation that she has introduced to reform federal contracting practices  The Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007 would provide increased oversight and transparency in the federal governments dealings with contractors  strengthen the procurement workforce  reform the Inspector General community  and combat waste  fraud  and abuse    Senator Collins comprehensive contracting reform bill increases competition by mandating competition for all government task or delivery orders over  100 000  a practice that already exists at the Department of Defense  The legislation promotes more informed and effective competition for orders over  5 million by requiring more information in a contracts statement of work  To increase the quality of competitive bids and improve transparency of the federal acquisition process  the bill mandates post award debriefings for task or delivery orders valued over  5 million    The Accountability in Government Contracting Act would achieve many other important reforms  including provisions that    Specifically address demonstrated problems in contracting for assistance programs in Afghanistan by requiring the Administrator of USAID to revise the agencys strategy for assistance to include measurable goals  specific time frames  resource levels  delineated responsibilities  external factors bearing on success  and a schedule for program evaluations      Reform the Inspector General  IG  system by prohibiting IGs from accepting any cash award or cash bonus from the agency they are auditing or investigating  clarifying that IGs subpoena power extends to electronic documents  establishing professional qualifications for the designated federal entity  DFE  IGs  and giving DFE IGs the same authority that Presidentially appointed IGs have to investigate and report false claims and to recoup losses resulting from fraud below  150 000      Strengthens effective oversight when sole source contracting is appropriate by requiring publication of notices at the FedBizOpps website of all sole source task or delivery orders above  100 000 within ten business days after the award      Reins in the practice of awarding contracts missing key terms  such as price  scope  or schedule  and then failing to supply those terms until the contractor delivers the good or service by requiring contracting officers to unilaterally determine all missing terms  if not mutually agreed upon  within 180 days or before 40 percent of the work is performed      Extends a tiering control rule that prevents contractors from using subcontracts for more than 65 percent of the cost of the contract      Decreases the governments reliance on large single source service contracts by strengthening the preference for multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity  IDIQ  contracts by prohibiting single awards of IDIQ contracts for services over  100 million      Ensures that interagency contracting is producing value by requiring the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  OFPP  to collect and make publicly available data on the numbers  scope  users  and rationales for these contracts      Helps federal agencies recruit  retain  and develop an adequate acquisition workforce by creating acquisition internship programs  a government industry exchange program  a scholarship program for graduate study  promoting contracting careers  requirements for human capital strategic plans by chief acquisition officers  and a new senior executive level position in OFPP to manage this initiative      Targets wasteful use of government purchase cards by seeking better analysis of purchase card use to identify fraud  identify potential savings  negotiate discounts  collect and disseminate best practices  and address small business concerns in micro purchases      Addresses the de facto outsourcing of program management responsibility when a large contractor becomes the lead systems integrator for a multi part project by
