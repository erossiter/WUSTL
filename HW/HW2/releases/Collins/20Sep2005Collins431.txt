                                      September 20  2005  WASHINGTON  D C      Senators Olympia Snowe  R ME  and Susan Collins  R ME  are urging President Bush to increase funding for the Department of Energy   s conservation and management programs in a supplemental funding request to help the millions of Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina   To address the urgent energy crisis facing the country  the Senators are requesting  100 million for the State Energy Program  SEP    500 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP   and  90 million for an energy efficiency public information initiative   Each of these programs takes steps to help reduce energy consumption and lower energy prices           Our country was on the verge of an energy crisis before the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina  and now we are being faced with record high energy prices   By investing in conservation initiatives  we can lower energy prices and help families  small businesses  and others reduce the painful burden of soaring energy prices     Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement        Below is the full text of the letter to the President       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20500             Dear President Bush        Re   Response to Energy Emergency facing American Families       As the Administration works to put together a comprehensive supplemental funding request to help American families address the social and economic destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina  we urge you to consider additional funding for the Department of Energy   s energy conservation and management programs   The destructive force of Hurricane Katrina is reverberating across our nation  particularly effecting low income families who are facing extraordinary increases in transportation and home energy costs   As you determine critical funding to immediately assist Hurricane Katrina victims  we urge you to address the urgent energy needs that face the country          State energy officials across the nation are participating in almost daily conference calls coordinating emergency actions and declarations  investigating allegations of price gouging  calming the public  and taking other actions as necessary   After Hurricane Katrina  prices of gasoline increased to their highest level ever with cost increases reaching nearly twice what they were last year   Natural gas escalated to over  11 mmbtu  143 percent over last year  and heating oil prices reached record levels at  2 05 gallon in New York Harbor  77 percent higher than last year   These prices illustrate the energy crisis facing Americans   With increased volatility  refinery and pipeline outages  and uncertain mid term availability of Gulf Coast oil and natural gas  this coming year looks extremely grim   With major propane distribution centered in Mississippi  we are also concerned about the impacts of these high prices on rural America        About 70 percent of the daily production of oil from the Gulf of Mexico  and 54 percent of the daily natural gas production  was shutdown due to Hurricane Katrina   The hurricane also closed about 1 9 million barrels per day of refining capacity in the Gulf region   About half of this capacity will be fully operational over the next few days  but the remaining capacity may not be available for more than a month   While conditions are slowly improving  efforts to reduce energy consumption in all sectors of the economy will work to reduce energy burdens of American families as well as help address the current supply constraints facing our economy        We urge you to provide  100 million for the State Energy Program  SEP    500 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program  and  90 million for an energy efficiency public information initiative   These appropriations levels are consistent with the authorization levels provided in the Energy Policy Act of 2005   These are immediate actions that will begin to help consumers as soon as the money is appropriated          The State Energy Program helps reduce energy consumption for residential consumers  schools  hospitals  the agricultural sector  commercial enterprises  and industry   For every federal dollar invested in SEP  over  7 is saved in energy costs   These funds would immediately be directed to energy efficiency projects to bring usage down right away   Loan and grant programs  such as the Texas  Loan Star  program  which has saved over  152 million in avoided energy costs  will help this winter and next summer when the needs will be most apparent   A similar program in Iowa has saved  224 million in energy costs to date       Heating fuel expenditures are expected to increase this winter between 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the Midwest  17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South  29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the Northeast  and  39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest   Heating costs for the average family using heating oil are projected to hit  1 666 during the upcoming winter   This represents an increase of  403 over last winter   s prices and  714 over the winter heating season of 2003 04   For families using natural gas  prices are projected to hit  1 568  representing an increase of  611 over last year   s prices and  643 over 2003 04   The Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP  provides vital resources to low income households to reduce energy consumption   WAP could expand quickly and reduce energy usage by approximately 25  in each home that is helped   Over 105 000 homes will be weatherized in 2005 based upon existing appropriations levels   Families can use savings resulting from weatherization to pay for other necessities  while reducing the nation   s energy demand by the equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil every year    With much higher prices expected for home energy  the dollar value of these savings is greatly increased  and the savings in oil and natural gas will keep more supply available in the market          A greatly expanded public education initiative is required to encourage the public to tune up vehicles  inflate tires  conduct energy audits of homes and implement measures to reduce energy usage  and promote the use of newly approved federal tax credits for energy efficiency  This education program would be coordinated with the Energy Star Program  jointly operated by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency           Thank you for your consideration                                                                                        Browse by
