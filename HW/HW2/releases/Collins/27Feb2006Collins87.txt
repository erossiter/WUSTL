                                      February 27  2006   WASHINGTON  DCHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins has introduced a resolution disapproving of the deal that would enable Dubai Ports World  DPW  to purchase Peninsular  Oriental  P  O  without an additional national security review and Congressional consultation  The Senators resolution directs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  to conduct a 45 day investigation to ensure that the sale will not have an adverse effect on national security and to brief Members of Congress on the findings of the investigation before the transaction is allowed to proceed     Senator Collins said that this recent incident has revealed shortcomings in the CFUIS process  which is required by law to conduct a 45 day investigation in such cases  The Committee  however  did not conduct the investigation as required     In addition  Senator Collins pointed out that this matter has highlighted the critical importance of port security to our nation  Last November  she joined with Senator Patty Murray  D WA  in introducing the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  which would provide  835 million annually for programs and initiatives to better secure our nations ports     Representative Jane Harman  D CA  has introduced a similar resolution in the U S  House of Representatives    Following is Senator Collins floor statement on her resolution    Mr  President  I rise to introduce a joint resolution disapproving the conclusion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  to allow Dubai Ports World  DP World  to take over certain port operations in the United States  My colleague and good friend  Congresswoman Jane Harman  will be introducing this resolution in the House of Representatives     This resolution would do the following   1  disapprove the CFIUS review of the transaction   2  direct the CFIUS to conduct a 45 day investigation in order to ensure that the sale will not have an adverse effect on national security  and  3  direct CFIUS to brief Members of Congress on the findings of its investigation before the transaction is allowed to proceed if the Committee maintains that it should go forth        The pending sale raises potential maritime security concerns  The sale would transfer control of Peninsular  Oriental  PO  Ports North America to DP World  a foreign government owned entity  PO Ports has extensive terminal and stevedoring operations along the eastern seaboard and on the Gulf coast  It encompasses not only terminal facility leases in six major U S  ports  as has been reported widely in the media  but also stevedoring and terminal operations in a total of twenty one U S  ports  including in my home state in Portland  Maine    We have long acknowledged the vulnerability of our ports   both as a potential target and as a conduit through which terrorists  their weapons or other contraband may enter the U S  Coming from a state with three international cargo ports  I am keenly aware of the importance of our seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which they are located  In addition to our ports  economic significance  the link between maritime security and our national security is evident    The attacks of 9 11 have forced us to reassess and rebuild our entire approach to security  Against an enemy determined to cause maximum harm to both the American people and the American economy  we are building a structure that  in great part  relies upon private public partnerships  Nowhere is this more apparent than in our ports   where terminal operators  longshoremen  port authorities  importers  carriers  and others have worked with the United States Coast Guard  Customs and Border Protection  and state and local law enforcement to put security plans in place     The foreign government in question  that owns DP World  is the government of Dubai  part of the United Arab Emirates  UAE   While UAE is an ally in the war on terrorism  it also has been used as a base of terrorist operations and financing  In fact  the 9 11 Commission reported that UAE was both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem  The attacks of 9 11 were planned in part in the UAE  and much of the financing for those operations was funneled through the UAE banking system  The facts warrant a thorough 45 day investigation by CFIUS  not a cursory review    Mr  President  this incident has revealed significant shortcomings in the CFIUS process  It is not adequately transparent and does not provide for sufficient oversight reporting to appropriate Committees and the leadership of Congress  The Exon Florio provision of the Defense Production Act gives the President the authority to suspend or prohibit any foreign acquisition  merger or takeover of a U S  corporation that is determined to threaten the national security of the U S  Through Executive Order  the President established the CFIUS to review transactions pursuant to Exon Florio and make a recommendation regarding the exercise of his authority  It may be appropriate for the reviews  which may involve proprietary data and classified information  to be held confidential  However  once a decision has been reached by the CFIUS  it is wholly appropriate  and even necessary  that Members of Congress be briefed on the findings of the review and the basis for the decision    Mr  President  I am truly troubled by the review process that was followed with respect to this purchase  The more I learn  the more questions are raised  The law requires a 45 day investigation in cases where an acquirer is controlled by a foreign government  as in the case of DP World  and the acquisition could affect the national security of the U S  However  the CFIUS did not conduct an investigation  as the plain language of the statute would demand        I am pleased that  in a recent development  the Administration has agreed to undertake a 45 day investigation as a result of discussions with DP World and Congressional leadership  Perhaps its recommendation  once briefed to Congress  will allay concerns that have been raised  Perhaps the national security implications  apparent on the face of the deal  will be adequately addressed through a more rigorous process  Given the remaining uncertainties  however  I felt it was important to proceed with the introduction of this resolution  in conjunction with my colleague in the House  Congresswoman Harman    The silver lining of recent events is that they have served to highlight the critical importance of port security to our nation  Last November  Senator Murray and I introduced the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act of 2005  This comprehensive legislation authorizes  835 million annually for programs and initiatives to better secure our nation s ports      It would help build a coordinated approach to maritime and port security across all levels of government and with our overseas trading partners  improving our nations security as it expedites trade with those governments and businesses that join in this goal    The bill addresses the problem of uncoordinated supply chain security efforts  directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a strategic plan to enhance security for all modes of transportation by which containers arrive in  depart from  or move through seaports of the United States  The strategic plan also must include protocols for the resumption of trade in the case of an incident    This legislation recognizes that America s ports  large and small  are our partners in keeping our nation safe and our economy strong     Mr  President  I seek my colleagues support both for this resolution and for the GreenLane bill  Thank you                                                                         Browse by
