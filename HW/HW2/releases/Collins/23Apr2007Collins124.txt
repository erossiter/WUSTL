                                      Senator Collins  Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  holds a hearing to address campus security April 23  2007 Washington  DC       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   held a hearing today entitled Security on Americas College Campuses to address issues related to security preparations on college campuses across the nation    Senator Collins said  Colleges and universities defy easy answers for law enforcement officials and first responders  Our college campuses are in many ways attractive targets for those who intend to harm America  And although campus security is primarily a state  local  and institutional responsibility  the federal government plays a role in strengthening security through the Department of Homeland Security  the Department of Education  and FBI  the Secret Service  and other agencies    Senator Collins explained that campus security should be considered in the broader context of homeland security  As potential targets for mass murders  educational institutions have vulnerabilities similar to those of shopping malls  theaters  and transportation hubsthat is  large numbers of people and relatively open public access    But we can do more to identify best practices  to disseminate them  to help with their implementation  and to assess their effectiveness  We can work with our first responders to ensure effective responses to attacks  And campus communication systems can also be improved to allow more effective alerts and permit better coordination of responses  said Senator Collins     The Senator said that University of Maine Public Safety Chief Noel March has pointed out that the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators is cooperating with the Department of Justice to develop a National Center for Campus Public Safety that would help work toward these objectives      Witnesses described the challenges associated with strengthening security at our nations college campuses  and provided ideas about how the federal government can support such efforts    W  Roger Webb  President of the University of Central Oklahoma and former Commissioner of Public Safety for the state of Oklahoma said that 9 11 should have been a wake up call to the potential of mass violence on university campuses  but very little had happened to change the level of security at most campuses  He said that more needs to be done to provide professional counselors to assist with troubled and disturbed students  He also said that school officials should have training in threat assessments and in analyzing a threat in order to provide proper response and intervention  In addition  Webb said that universities should be able to respond to emergencies with up to date technologies    Another witness  David Ward  President of the American Council on Education and former Chancellor at the University of Wisconsin agreed that technology is increasingly playing an important role in protecting college campus communities  He said that he supports an effort by the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators  IACLEA  to develop best practices  training materials  and guidance for campus communities in matters of security  Ward said he also supports the creation of a National Center for Campus Public Safety  The center would promote collaboration among national and local law enforcement agencies and would strengthen the administrative and operational components of campus security systems  He said that it is essential that every campus have an emergency plan that identifies a core response team  a communications plan  and a way to implement the movements of emergency and other staff in a variety of scenarios     Other witnesses included  Steven Healy  President of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators  IACLEA   and head of campus security at Princeton University  Russell Federman  Ph D   Director of Counseling and Psychological Services University of Virginia  and Irwin Redlener  M D
