of the Senate Armed Services Committee  is the principal speaker this morning at a christening ceremony for Sampson  the 28th Arleigh Burke AEGIS class destroyer built at Bath Iron Works  Senator Collins address comes one day after she was was pleased to announce that Congressional negotiators have reached a final compromise agreement on the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization bill that secures full funding of  3 4 billion for the DD X  program  the amount for which she fought to secure  This bill authorizes the simultaneous construction of two DD X  ships in FY 2007 08  one of which will be built at Bath Iron Works    Maintaining the DD X  dual lead ship strategy is critical to our national security  which requires that a high priority be placed upon building up our naval fleet to counter existing and emerging threats  said Senator Collins  This agreement will maintain the DD X  program schedule and the planned workload at Bath Iron Works  BIWs future is tied to the construction of the DD X  and that is why I am so pleased that the Senates position prevailed in these conference negotiations    The following is the full text of Senator Collins remarks at todays ceremony    Governor Baldacci  Senator Snowe  Congressman Allen  Congressman Michaud  Deputy Secretary Stiller  Admiral Hamilton  Commander Roos  President Shipway  Ms  Parsons  officers and crew of the USS Sampson  men and women of Bath Iron Works  distinguished guests  and friends  it is a great honor to join you today to celebrate the christening of this great ship at this great shipyard   We gather today to celebrate the new  the cutting edge  This is most advanced warship in the world  built in a modern facility by the industrys most skilled hands  manned by officers and crew with the highest level of training and expertise  all combining to meet the challenges of the 21st Century   This also is a celebration of history  a noble  inspiring  and heroic history  It begins with this ships namesake  Admiral William Thomas Sampson   William Sampson entered the United States Naval Academy at the age of 17  He graduated four years later  at the top of his class  while the Civil War was raging  He served with great distinction and valor as executive officer of that strange and perilous new breed of ship  the Ironclad  After the war  he stuck with his Navy through its years of decline and was a leading force in the creation of the robust New Navy that emerged in the later decades of that century  He helped take the United States Navy from sail to steam and from wood to steel   Admiral Sampson is best remembered for his leadership at the Battle of Santiago in Cuba during the Spanish American War  That battle  on the morning of July 3rd  1898  was one of the greatest naval engagements in history  Under Admiral Sampsons steadfast command  it became one of historys most resounding victories  His famous message following that triumph speaks to his sense of purpose and devotion to his country  The Fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present  the whole of Cervera s Fleet   So great was the mark Admiral Sampson left upon our Navy that the ship we christen today is the fourth to bear his name  The first served with distinction during the First World War  combating that new and terrifying weapon  the U Boat  The second was one of the most decorated ships of the Second World War  keeping the sea lanes of the North Atlantic open  suppressing submarine attacks at the Panama Canal  battling kamikaze assaults in the Pacific and supporting the landings that led to victory    DDG 10 was a vital part of freedoms shield during the Cold War  and helped advance the cause of freedom during Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield  Among the class of ships known as the greyhounds of the sea  the destroyers named Sampson have always led the way  Whatever challenges the future may bring  I know that DDG 102 will add to this inspiring record   The thread of history runs through this celebration  At each of the four Sampson christenings  a member of Admiral Sampsons family has stood as sponsor  and we are greatly honored to have his great granddaughter  Clare Parsons  serve in that capacity today  She is also the daughter and granddaughter of Admirals  But Ms  Parsons is more than the descendant of great Naval leaders  she is Navy all the way  she  too  served in uniform and retired as a Commander in the Navy Reserves  This great family exemplifies patriotism and duty  and we salute them   The thread of history also runs through this shipyard  DDG 102 is the third Sampson built here at Bath Iron Works  As an example of how this event brings together past  present  and future  consider that this is hull number 500 laid here at BIW  a sequence that began with the passenger steamer Cottage City back in 1890  and this is the first christening to take place at BIWs new  state of the art Land Level Transfer Facility  Throughout all the years  through all the changes in ship design and in the shipyard itself  one thing has remained constant  the dedication  innovation  and hard work of the men and women who pass through these gates   But the history we celebrate today did not just happen  it was made  It was made by great leaders like Admiral Sampson  and by great families like his  It was made by generations of Americans who have stepped forward to defend our nation  and it was made by workers who strive to build the best for those who defend us   This tradition must continue  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I have seen first hand that seapower is crucial to defend our freedom and to extend the blessings of freedom to others  I have fought for shipbuilding and acquisition policies that will keep the United States Navy pre eminent  our shipyards strong  and our skilled workers building the best ships in the world  Ships such as this and the next generation of destroyers to come  the DDG 1000  are essential if America is to continue to meet the challenges of the 21st Century   The New Navy that won that great victory at Santiago was built by the skilled and dedicated shipbuilders of a century ago  The skilled and dedicated shipbuilders of Bath Iron Works today have inherited that proud legacy  Like those they follow  they live in a time when American seapower is in danger of not being able to meet the challenges and threats of the day  Like those who fought against the decline of American seapower in that earlier time  we must provide our Navy  and our shipbuilders  with the support and resources they need to meet the challenges and to protect our nation against all threats  And  Im pleased to report that the Defense Authorization bill that we just finished negotiating will help keep our Navy and Bath Iron Works strong   The spirit of those who manned those uncertain and untried ironclads  who faced down the U Boats  who knocked the kamikaze pilots from the skies  and who stood up to the Iron Curtain lives on in the officers and crew of this new USS Sampson  As we honor those who served in the past  we honor you who serve today  You inherit a proud legacy  and whatever challenges the future may bring  we are confident that you will enhance it  you will write inspiring new chapters in our nations naval history  Wherever you sail  the prayers of a grateful nation will go with you  All Americans wish you fair winds and following seas  and that God may always speed you safely home
