                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               June 13  2007 Washington  DC       The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  of which Senator Susan Collins is the Ranking Member  today approved a resolution that she and Senator Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  coauthored to reaffirm the constitutional protections of sealed domestic mail  This approval paves the way for the legislation to be considered by the full Senate  The measure is also cosponsored by Senators Tom Carper  D DE   Norm Coleman  R MN   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Russ Feingold  D WI   and Patrick Leahy  D VT     The resolution was introduced in response to a signing statement issued by the White House following the signing into law of the Collins Carper postal reform legislation  That White House statement resulted in confusion about the Administrations commitment to abide by the basic privacy protections afforded sealed domestic mail     Our resolution makes perfectly clear to all law abiding Americans that the federal government will not invade their privacy by reading their sealed mail  Any contrary interpretation of the Postal Reform Act is just plain wrong  said Senator Collins  Nothing in the Postal Reform Act  nor the Presidents signing statement alters the privacy and civil liberties protections provided to a person who sends or receives sealed domestic mail  Mail sealed against inspection is entitled to the strongest possible protections against physical searches  With only very limited exceptions  the government needs a court issued warrant before it can search domestic mail    The Postal Reform bill  which was signed into law on December 20  2006  represents the most sweeping reforms of the U S  Postal Service in over three decades  It will help the Postal Service meet the challenges of the 21st Century  establish a new rate setting system  and help ensure a strong financial future for the Postal Service  And it also protects the basic features of universal service  The new law also provided for continued authority for the Postal Service to establish a class of mail sealed against inspection   The text of the resolution is as follows   Whereas all Americans depend on the United States Postal Service to transact business and communicate with friends and family   Whereas postal customers have a constitutional right to expect that their sealed domestic mail will be protected against unreasonable searches    Whereas the circumstances and procedures under which the government may search sealed mail are well defined  including provisions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  50 U S C  1801 et seq    and generally require prior judicial approval   Whereas the United States Postal Inspection Service has the authority to open and search a sealed envelope or package when there is immediate threat to life or limb or an immediate and substantial danger to property   Whereas the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act  Public Law 109 435  expressly reaffirmed the right of postal customers to have access to a class of mail sealed against inspection   Whereas the United States Postal Service affirmed January 4  2007 that the enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act  Public Law 109 435  does not grant Federal law enforcement officials any new authority to open domestic mail    Whereas the signing statement on the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act  Public Law 109 435  issued by President Bush on December 20  2006  raises questions about the Presidents commitment to abide by these basic privacy protections  and  Whereas the Senate rejects any interpretation of the Presidents signing statement on the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act  Public Law 109 435  that in any way diminishes the privacy protections accorded sealed domestic mail under the Constitution and federal laws and regulations   Now  therefore  be it resolved  that the Senate reaffirms the constitutional and statutory protections accorded sealed domestic mail                                                                             Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Current record
