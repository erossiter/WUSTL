Treatment Act  CAPTA  programs  Senator Collins joined eleven of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee Subcommitte on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education specifically requesting additional resources for state grant programs under CAPTA that assist communities in stemming child abuse and ensuring that affected children receive proper treatment    The text of the letter is provided below    The Honorable Arlen Specter  The Honorable Tom Harkin Chairman  Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor  HHS and Education Subcommittee on Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations  and Related Agencies Appropriations 184 Dirksen Senate Office Building  123 Hart Senate Office Building      Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin    We are writing in support of increased funding for Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  CAPTA  programs  CAPTA established a focal point within the federal government to identify and address issues of child abuse and neglect  and to support effective methods of prevention and treatment   While our protection system remains sorely in need of resources  funds for CAPTA programs have not kept pace with the needs of communities for supporting families and protecting children  In 2004  according to the most recent data released this month by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  an estimated 3 million reports of possible abuse and neglect were made to states  and almost 900 000 ofthese reports were substantiated  States are hard pressed to treat children or protect them from further harm when they lack basic resources to do so  In 2004  just over 40 percent of the child victims received no services following a substantiated report of maltreatment  Almost 1 500 children died as a result of abuse or neglect  To compound this tragedy  the most endangered are disproportionately the youngest  The recent data show that more than 80 percent of children who were killed by abusers were younger than 4 years old  and 44 percent of those never reached their first birthday   CAPTA s Title I basic state grants help states strengthen their child protection systems  The nation s child welfare system has long been stretched beyond capacity  When measured against the federal Child and Family Service Reviews developed by HHS to evaluate a state s performance in protecting children  no state passed the test  Federal officials repeatedly cited states for certain deficiencies  significant numbers of children suffering abuse or neglect more than once in a six month period  caseworkers not visiting children often enough to assess needs  and not providing promised medical and mental health services  CAPTA s Title I grants are designed to help states provide the necessary attention to protect children   CAPTA s Title II authorizes grants to states to help develop community based prevention services and resources to support families  including parenting education classes  home visiting services  mutual support groups for parents  respite care for families with disabled children  as well as family resource centers to connect families and children to the services they need  Billions of dollars are spent every year on foster care    too often the only option for families in crisis  While we should be protecting children who have been the most seriously injured  we can do a much better job at protecting children before the damage is so bad that we have no other choice than to remove them from their homes  Increasing funding for CAPTA s basic state grants and community based prevention grants will help in a modest yet constructive way to begin to address the current imbalance   Additional funds for CAPTA would support prevention services  including parent education and home visiting  for children and their families who are unserved in their communities  Additional funding for CAPTA state grants would help to shorten the time for the delivery of post investigative services and increase the number of children receiving services  It is time to invest additional resources to work in partnership with the states to help families and prevent children from being abused and neglected    Sincerely                                                                        Browse by
