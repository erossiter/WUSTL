                                      June 30  2005   Washington  D C     U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  and Susan M  Collins  R ME  announced that  13 802 000 in federal funding for land and wildlife projects in Maine have been approved in this year   s Fiscal Year  FY  2006 Interior Appropriations bill  which the Senate passed last night by a vote of 94 to 0   This bill includes  26 3 billion in funding for the Department of the Interior and related agencies nationwide                       These projects are among the most important land and wildlife conservation projects for Maine   If we are to preserve our valuable natural treasures  we must continue to support these essential programs with the funding they so rightly deserve     said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement         Senators Snowe and Collins announced that the Interior Appropriations bill includes funding for the following Maine projects        5 million for the Katahdin Ironworks Forest Legacy Project    The inclusion of this project mirrors the President   s request in his FY 2006 request   The project was ranked number four in the nation out of all Forest Legacy projects and proposes a conservation easement over 37 000 acres of forested lands for the protection of the property  s significant natural and recreational resources  to ensure permanent public access to the tract  s many outstanding lakes  streams and mountain peaks  and to provide for sustainable harvesting to support the local wood products economy          2 48 million for the Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery   This funding will support wastewater treatment compliance at the Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery in East Orland  and will enable the hatchery to be in compliance with State of Maine and national EPA laws and policies regarding hatchery discharges  In addition  there will be a direct benefit to receiving waters and users of receiving waters in assuring that fully treated effluents are being discharged from these Service facilities   The ability to continue full production of Atlantic salmon fry and smolt operations for these hatcheries and their partners depends on the capability of administering high technology water and wastewater treatment systems so that fish production can continue without jeopardizing environmental conditions in receiving waters        1 5 million for the Machias River Phase 2 Forest Legacy Project     This funding would support the Phase II Forest Legacy Project in order to acquire 7 785 acres of land  including a 1 000   corridor along shorelines on 3rd  4th  and 5th Machias Lakes and 5th Machias Stream  as well as a 2 286 acre parcel of forest land expanding the Duck Lake Unit to Nicatous Lake and Gassabias Stream   In all  Phase II will protect over 47 miles of lakeshore and over 13 miles of stream frontage   With both phases completed  270 miles of prime lake  river  and stream frontage will be protected  some 86  of the Machias River  s Atlantic salmon spawning and reaing habitat  and the famous backcountry canoe route will also be preserved          1 million for the Penobscot River Restoration Project   This funding would be used for the purchase and removal of the Great Works Dam and the Veazie Dam on the Penobscot River   The Penobscot River Restoration Project is a five year   50 million project to restore the natural flow of Maine  s largest watershed   This project is a partnership of the State of Maine  the U S  Department of Interior  the National Park Service  the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  the Bureau of Indian Affairs  the Penobscot Indian Nation  the Atlantic Salmon Federation  PPL Inc   the Natural Resources Council of Maine  and other environmental groups        1 million for the Atlantic Salmon Recovery     National Forrest Wildlife Foundation    This funding  through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation  will support efforts to protect the Atlantic salmon in Maine   The Atlantic Salmon was listed as endangered by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  USFWS  and the National Marine Fisheries Service          750 000 for the New England Green Chemistry Consortium   This project will further develop a New England regional Green Chemistry Consortium to support interdisciplinary research collaborations between New England universities and industry  Green chemistry is a science based approach to pollution prevention involving reducing or eliminating the use or generation of hazardous substances in the design  manufacture or application of chemical products   Academic partners include the University of Massachusetts  the University of Maine  the University of Connecticut  the University of New Hampshire  and the University of Vermont  The University of Maine will focus on Green Chemistry technologies for Natural Resource Processing         600 000 for Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge    These funds would allow the Rachel Carson NWR to acquire 4 properties  including two significant ownerships in the Parsons Beach area that total 100 acres and abut already protected refuge lands in a critical protection focus area   The 56 acre Parsons Woods tract contains the headwaters of a tributary of the Little River  the bulk of which flows through existing refuge lands and empties into the Atlantic between Laudholm and Crescent Surf beaches   The 44 acre Back Creek Woodlands property consists of wetlands and associated wooded upland habitat and has considerable frontage along Back Creek  which flows into Back Creek Cove  a tidal inlet that lies a mere two thirds of a mile from the confluence of the Mousam River and the Atlantic Ocean at Parsons Beach   The Back Creek Woodlands property abuts the Harts Woods property  which was acquired by the Refuge in FY 2003  and together with the Parsons Woods property will provide additional critical linkages to previously protected lands         500 000 for the University of Maine  Northern States Research Cooperative     This funding  as a part of the Northern States Research Consortium  NSRC   would greatly enhance the ability to assure sustained productivity of the Acadian forest   Specifically  it would be used to study the long term effects of different modes of partial harvesting on growth and yield  genetic diversity of crop trees  the benefits of trying to manage for late successional forest types  and the maintenance of biodiversity and environmental quality   This is essential for the management of Maine   s hardwood trees to address stand improvement practices and the effects of harvesting practices on residual crop trees   The Northern States Research Consortium  NSRC  was authorized by Congress in 1998  Public Law 105 185  to support cross disciplinary  integrative  and collaborative research on ecosystems  economic development  community development  forest products and conservation efforts to benefit the Northern Forest         472 000 Dover Foxcroft Water District  Pleasant River Lumber Waterline Extension Project   The funding would allow the completion of the waterline extension and water system upgrade project in the Town of Dover Foxcroft  beginning on Fairview Avenue and extending to the Pleasant River Lumber mill yard  The project will provide improved fire protection at the Pleasant River Lumber mill  This facility has had several major fires in recent years  including 1984  when the main mill burned  and again in 1995 and 1998         500 000 for the Town of Machias  CSO replacement project    This funding will address deficiencies at the town of Machias    wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment facility  Presently  waste flows exceed the capacity of the sewer pipes to convey the waste  resulting in overflows of untreated sewage to the Machias River  In addition  the existing wastewater treatment plant is aging and in need of renovation
