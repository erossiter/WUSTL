                                      July 13  2007 Washington  DC    Reed  Collins Urge President to  Release Energy Assistance Funds  WASHINGTON  DC As temperatures continue to soar across the nation  U S  Senators Jack Reed  D RI  and Susan Collins  R ME  today sent a letter to President Bush calling on him to release  201 52 million in emergency funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to help alleviate the burden high energy prices have placed on working families and seniors throughout the country  Reed and Collins were joined by over 30 of their Senate colleagues in making the request   LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs  and can provide life saving assistance to provide air conditioning and fans to the elderly and disabled  Each year  almost 5 million low income families rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating and or cooling their homes    In February  Congress approved an additional  181 17 million in emergency LIHEAP funding for fiscal year 2007  adding to an existing balance of  20 35 million  The President has not yet released any of this contingency funding this year    Congress has given President Bush the ability to help working families and seniors who are struggling to keep up with their energy bills  said Reed  the Chairman of the Northeast Midwest Coalition  As temperatures rise  Americans continue to face record high energy bills  and many are facing the prospect of having their electricity and gas turned off because they are unable to pay  It is time that the President does the right thing and releases this additional funding   Collins  also a Chair of the Coalition  stated  With the increased costs of heating and cooling our homes  we must provide adequate funding for this essential program that serves as the lifeline to some of our most vulnerable citizens  It is my hope that the President will support our request to immediately release these emergency funds  For low income families  this money can literally be a matter of life and death   In their letter  Reed and Collins noted that a recent survey conducted by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  found that at least 1 2 million households across the United States were disconnected from electric and natural gas service from March through May of this year  with numbers expected to rise as utilities complete credit and collection procedures and states continue to undergo energy market restructuring    Text of the letter follows   July 13  007  The President The White House Washington DC  Dear Mr  President    The FY2007 Continuing Resolution  PL 110 5  provided  181 17 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund  increasing its balance to  201 52 million  We strongly urge you to release LIHEAP contingency funds to help low income seniors and families address their energy burden  especially given this weeks national heat wave    The National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  recently completed a national survey of utility arrearages and shutoffs  The survey found that millions of low income households this year are facing a severe hardship paying arrearages from last winters heating bills  coping with impending and actual shutoff of service  and meeting rising air conditioning costs  The survey estimates that at least 1 2 million households have been disconnected from electric and natural gas service during the March through May period following the expiration of state shutoff moratoriums  This is a conservative estimate as the level of shutoffs is likely to go higher as utilities complete credit and collection procedures     According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  residential electricity prices are expected to increase at a rate of 3 percent during 2007  States undergoing market restructuring continue to experience more rapid price increases as rate caps expire and higher fuel costs are passed through to consumers  In some instances  customers may see rate increases of up to 50 percent     Low income Americans experience a much higher energy burden than the average American household  On top of rising home energy costs  prices at the pump are placing an additional burden on low income Americans this summer  Gasoline prices have reached their highest level ever and are projected by EIA to average 21 cents higher than last summer  Too many of these households face difficult financial choices trying to meet basic human necessities on an income that simply won t stretch far enough to cover it all  No family in our nation should be forced to choose between paying a home energy bill and putting food on the table for themselves and their children  No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances     We request the federal government release funding from the LIHEAP contingency fund to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses  Releasing this money now will not solve the problem fully  but it will certainly help     Sincerely    end                                                                        Browse by
