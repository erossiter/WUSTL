                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               November 15  2005   WASHINGTON  D C       Today  United States Senators Patty Murray  D Wash   and Susan Collins  R Maine  announced their introduction of the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act   Murray  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  and Collins  Chairman of the full Senate Homeland Security Committee  co authored the bill to improve the security of the millions of cargo containers that enter America  s ports unchecked each year   Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  are original cosponsors of this legislation       The nation  s current cargo security regime was built pre 9 11  with an emphasis on efficiency but not on security   At present  opportunities for terrorists to tamper with cargo exist at every step along the supply chain   Terrorist organizations could use containers to smuggle weapons or terrorists into the United States  or could turn a container into a weapon by detonating a conventional  chemical  biological or nuclear weapon within a container once it arrives on American shores          Right now  there is a gaping hole in America  s security when it comes to the cargo entering our ports each day   Murray said    To protect our nation we have to develop a cargo security system that closes vulnerabilities  provides a way to resume trade after an incident  and maintains the efficient flow of commerce   Our GreenLane bill addresses these issues  taking into account the input of all the key stakeholders and experts  and I want to thank Senator Collins for her hard work and cooperation in helping to write this bill and get it introduced in the Senate           Coming from a state with three international cargo ports  I am keenly aware of the importance of our seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which they are located   In addition to our ports    economic significance  the link between maritime security and our national security is evident     Senator Collins said     The global maritime industry is crucial to our nation   s economy  and our cargo ports are undeniably on the front lines of the war against terrorism   This legislation sets clear goals for improving the security of this vital sector  and it provides the resources to meet those goals          An attack launched on  or through  America  s seaports could result in significant loss of life and the crippling of our economy  Consequently  since 9 11  experts have been calling for an upgraded security system for shipping containers   The Murray Collins bill builds on the lessons from the 9 11 Commission  GAO investigations  and other reports to protect against the human and economic costs of a terrorist attack through our ports       The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act Will       Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability         Prevent a lengthy shutdown of America  s seaports in the event of an incident     protecting America  s economy from severe disruption        Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient       Push the borders out and reduce the haystack so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo       The bill improves security at America  s ports by establishing       The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures       Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs       The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures   regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies       Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level       The Act also Authorizes Port Security Grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT        The economic consequences of a terrorist attack which exploits any vulnerabilities in any commercial supply chain are enormous   said Senator Lieberman    Yet DHS has been slow to address those vulnerabilities  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act will strengthen underlying cargo security programs  and build on them to ensure this country has a robust  layered system of security to protect the ports and cities of the United States  I am also pleased that this bill includes  400 million in Port Security grants           This legislation addresses one of our nation   s most vulnerable sectors     said Senator Coleman      Since 2003  my Subcommittee has been at the forefront of a bicameral and bipartisan oversight investigation into cargo security   Chairman Collins and Senator Murray are to be applauded for their collective leadership on the GreenLane Maritime Security Act  I believe it will fundamentally strengthen supply chain security while preserving the movement of trade  This is significant legislation that provides our agencies the authority to ensure that their security programs have the teeth they have been lacking          Noted homeland security expert Dr  Stephen Flynn praised the bill        The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Enhancement Act of 2005 is the most comprehensive legislative initiative to date to tackle the challenge of ensuring that an intermodal container is not used as a poor man  s missile   It redresses many of the well documented weaknesses of the C TPAT and CSI programs and provides a framework for rewarding private sector players who work with DHS to raise the security bar   Dr  Flynn said    I applaud Senator Collins and Senator Murray for providing such timely bipartisan leadership on this critical issue   This bill should be placed at the top of the docket of the 109th Congress and embraced by the White House as advancing the cargo security elements of its new National Maritime Security Strategy        The bipartisan proposal will be introduced in the Senate today
