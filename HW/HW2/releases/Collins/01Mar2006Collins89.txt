                                     Senators Murray  Collins Co Author Groundbreaking  Bipartisan Cargo Security Legislation  March 1  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    The debate over the pending takeover of six U S  port terminals by Dubai Ports World  DPW  has highlighted the critical importance of port security to our national security  In November  Senators Patty Murray  D Wash   and Susan Collins  R Maine  announced their introduction of the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  Murray  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  and Collins  Chairman of the full Senate Homeland Security Committee  co authored the bill to improve the security of the millions of cargo containers that enter America s ports unchecked each year  Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  are original cosponsors of this legislation   The nation s current cargo security regime was built pre 9 11  with an emphasis on efficiency but not on security  At present  opportunities for terrorists to tamper with cargo exist at every step along the supply chain  Terrorist organizations could use containers to smuggle weapons or terrorists into the United States  or could turn a container into a weapon by detonating a conventional  chemical  biological or nuclear weapon within a container once it arrives on American shores    Right now  there is a gaping hole in America s security when it comes to the cargo entering our ports each day  Murray said  To protect our nation we have to develop a cargo security system that closes vulnerabilities  provides a way to resume trade after an incident  and maintains the efficient flow of commerce  Our GreenLane bill addresses these issues  taking into account the input of all the key stakeholders and experts  and I want to thank Senator Collins for her hard work and cooperation in helping to write this bill and get it introduced in the Senate   Coming from a state with three international cargo ports  I am keenly aware of the importance of our seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which they are located  In addition to our ports economic significance  the link between maritime security and our national security is evident  Senator Collins said  The global maritime industry is crucial to our nations economy  and our cargo ports are undeniably on the front lines of the war against terrorism  This legislation sets clear goals for improving the security of this vital sector  and it provides the resources to meet those goals   An attack launched on  or through  America s seaports could result in significant loss of life and the crippling of our economy  Consequently  since 9 11  experts have been calling for an upgraded security system for shipping containers  The Murray Collins bill builds on the lessons from the 9 11 Commission  GAO investigations  and other reports to protect against the human and economic costs of a terrorist attack through our ports   The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act Will   Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability    Prevent a lengthy shutdown of America s seaports in the event of an incident  protecting America s economy from severe disruption    Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient   Push the borders out and reduce the haystack so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo   The bill improves security at America s ports by establishing   The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures   Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs   The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures  regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies   Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level   The Act also Authorizes Port Security Grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT   The economic consequences of a terrorist attack which exploits any vulnerabilities in any commercial supply chain are enormous said Senator Lieberman  Yet DHS has been slow to address those vulnerabilities  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act will strengthen underlying cargo security programs  and build on them to ensure this country has a robust  layered system of security to protect the ports and cities of the United States  I am also pleased that this bill includes  400 million in Port Security grants   This legislation addresses one of our nations most vulnerable sectors  said Senator Coleman  Since 2003  my Subcommittee has been at the forefront of a bicameral and bipartisan oversight investigation into cargo security  Chairman Collins and Senator Murray are to be applauded for their collective leadership on the GreenLane Maritime Security Act  I believe it will fundamentally strengthen supply chain security while preserving the movement of trade This is significant legislation that provides our agencies the authority to ensure that their security programs have the teeth they have been lacking  In an op ed in the New York Times on February 28th  Dr  Steven Flynn a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and retired Coast Guard officer and James M  Loy  a former deputy secretary of homeland security and commandant of the Coast Guard praised the GreenLane Act  Ports are the on  and off ramps to global markets  and they belong to a worldwide system operated by many different private and public entities  Since the United States cannot own and control all of that system  we must work with our trade partners and foreign companies to ensure its security  A major step in that direction would be to construct a comprehensive global container inspection system that scans the contents of every single container destined for America s waterfront before it leaves a port  rather than scanning just the tiny percentage we do now  There is already a bipartisan bill that the White House and Congress could embrace to advance this effort  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security bill  co sponsored by Senators Susan Collins  Republican of Maine  and Patty Murray  Democrat of Washington  provides incentives for American importers to accept the modest fees associated with a global container inspection system  The bill would also establish minimum security standards and encourages the tracking and monitoring of containers throughout the supply chain
