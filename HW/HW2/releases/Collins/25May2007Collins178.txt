                                      May 25  2007 Washington  DC       The Senate Armed Services Committee has approved the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which includes key provisions authored by Senator Collins for Bath Iron Works  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  the University of Maine  Saco Defense  Pratt  Whitney  and other Maine companies    This legislation contains a variety of crucial provisions that will provide critical force protection to our men and women in uniform ensure the long term viability of our Armed Forces by increasing the end strength of the Army and Marine Corps  restore our militarys readiness  and continue the development of technologies to counter existing and emerging threats  It also includes key shipbuilding provisions that are important to the Navy and our overall national security   said Senator Collins  who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  In addition  the Senate Armed Services Committee has again recognized the valuable contributions of Maine companies to our national security by funding important defense programs in our state    At Senator Collins request  the Senate bill ensures a continued and steady workload at Bath Iron Works by authorizing  2 9 billion for the second  and final  fiscal year of funding for construction of the dual lead DDG 1000 Zumwalt class destroyers  In addition  Senator Collins authored an amendment  which was included in the Senate Armed Services Committee bill  to restore  480 million for the Littoral Combat Ship  LCS  program  One of the two LCS variants is being designed and built by a Bath Iron Works led team  The Senate version of this legislation as drafted initially cut all funding for this program in fiscal year 2008  but Senator Collins was able to restore funding to ensure continued development of this important program   Senator Collins expressed concern  however  that the House version of the Defense Authorization bill includes a provision to prohibit the start of construction on lead ships until the Secretary of Navy certifies that detailed design is complete  This provision  if enacted  would create yet another obstacle to and could further delay the Navys awarding of the construction contract for the first Bath Iron Works DDG 1000 destroyer    The House version would also require that the next generation class of Navy cruisers  which will be the follow on to the DDG 1000 destroyer  be powered by nuclear propulsion systems  even though neither of the U S  Navys proven surface combatant shipyards  Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipyard  have the facilities or certifications required to construct nuclear powered surface combatant ships  This provision could dramatically increase the costs of future surface combatants  thereby reducing the overall number of ships built at a time when the Navy is seeking to revitalize and modernize its fleet    Senator Collins was successful in ensuring that these provisions were not part of the Senate bill  and she vowed to fight against them during conference negotiations    Also at Senator Collins request  the Senate version of the Defense Authorization bill provides  4 1 billion above the Presidents budget request to expedite procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  MRAP  vehicles  which will further protect service members from improvised explosive devices  IED  in Iraq and Afghanistan  The Senate Armed Services Committee also authorized a 3 5 percent across the board pay increase for service members  0 5 percent above the Presidents budget request  and includes provisions to improve mental health screening of and treatment for service members    In addition  highlights of the Senate Armed Services Committee bill includes     6 1 billion for continued development of the F 35 Joint Strike Fighter  JSF   Pratt  Whitney builds the F135 engine for the JSF with partial work performed at the Pratt  Whitney North Berwick facility       442 3 million for C 17 Globemaster III aircraft  the engines of which are built by Pratt  Whitney with partial work performed at the Pratt  Whitney North Berwick facility       51 3 million for M2HB  50 Caliber Machine Guns and  67 1 million for MK19 MOD 3 40mm Grenade Launchers  both of which are manufactured at Saco Defense in Saco       9 7 million for construction of a Consolidated Emergency Control Center at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard       6 9 million for the Maine Army National Guard to field the Integrated Disaster Management System  developed by Global Relief Technologies in Kennebunk and Portsmouth  in support of critical medevac operations in Iraq  This system provides near real time data management and analysis to and from field operators via hand held devices       5 9 million for the Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research  which benefits the University of Maine
