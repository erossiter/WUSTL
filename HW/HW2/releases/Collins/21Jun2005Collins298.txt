Senator Collins founded   Co Chairs Senate Diabetes Caucus       Washington  DC   Senator Susan Collins today chaired a hearing to examine the impact that juvenile diabetes has had on American children and their families  the economic costs of caring for people with diabetes  and the promising breakthroughs in juvenile diabetes research that could lead to better treatments or a cure for the disease   11 year old Stephanie  Steffi  Rothweiler of Falmouth  Maine testified at today  s hearing  as a Children  s Congress Delegate representing the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation  JDRF    A total of 150 delegates  ages 2 to 17  were chosen to represent their states in Washington  DC this week   Stephanie was one of six delegates chosen to testify at today  s hearing         Diabetes is a life long condition that affects people of every age  race and nationality   It is the leading cause of kidney failure  blindness in adults  and amputations not related to injury   Moreover  it is estimated that diabetes accounts for more than  132 billion of our nation  s annual health care costs  and that health spending for people with diabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have diabetes   said Senator Collins    These statistics are truly overwhelming   But what really motivated me to devote so much energy to this issue was meeting more and more people   like our delegates today and their families   whose lives have been forever changed by diabetes   That is why it is so important that you have all traveled to Washington today to tell your stories   You put human faces on all of the statistics   You will help us to focus on what Congress can do to help us better understand and ultimately conquer this terrible disease         Rothweiler talked about what it is like to live with diabetes and urged Congress to support medical research to advance treatments and to help discover a cure    I have learned a lot about life that I might not have if I didn  t have diabetes   Rothweiler said    One thing I have learned is how fortunate I was to have caught the diabetes early   I also know how lucky I am to have parents who give up their nights  weekends  and every hour of every day to take care of me and make sure I stay in tight control of my blood sugar levels so I stay as healthy as possible   I am also lucky to have access to the best technologies   I wear an insulin pump which makes it easier to stay in good control   I know that it  s possible to find a cure for diabetes   think about all of the miraculous advances that have occurred in our time   And I know that a cure will only come from research         Actress Mary Tyler Moore  Olympic swimmer Gary Hall  movie producer Doug Wick  and Dr  Allen Spiegel of the National Institutes also
