Husson College in Bangor  At the Bangor ceremony  the College will award 233 undergraduate degrees  108 masters degrees  and two honorary doctorates to Woodrow W  Cross  CEO of Cross Insurance and the Reverend Dana Kennedy  a retired Episcopal minister and author  Seen here in the photo from left to right are Dr  Teresa Steele  Dean of the School of Health  Susan Marie Steele who received her Master of Science in Nursing  and Catherine Steele Willey    Following is the full text of Senator Collins address to the graduates    President Beardsley  Chairman Sawyer  members of the Board  distinguished faculty and staff  parents  family  friends  and  most of all  the Class of 2006  it is a great pleasure to join you for the Husson College commencement  Congratulations to the members of this outstanding class  You did it    Congratulations also to the two outstanding Husson alumni awarded honorary doctorates today  Woodrow Cross and the Reverend Dana Kennedy exemplify the Husson spirit of accomplishment and service  and the honors are richly deserved       And  of course  I must congratulate Coach Winkin for reaching that amazing milestone of 1 000 college baseball victories  He exemplifies the great Husson spirit of combining knowledge and determination to achieve success  I know all Husson fans join me celebrating his achievement  and in promising to be reasonably patient in his pursuit of number 2 000    We also join President Beardsley in thanking Richard Dyke for his outstanding act of generosity  He exemplifies that great Husson spirit of gratitude and generosity  of giving back to those who helped make success possible    Our gratitude and joy today are tempered by the loss of a wonderful friend  scholar  and leader  Bob Smith  who played such a critical role of Hussons growth and success  All of us who were privileged know Bob miss him terribly but know the pride that he would be feeling today as another outstanding class of students graduates    The typical commencement address includes two standard features  The first is a promise to be brief  I hereby make that promise  I must caution you  however  that the Senates standard for brevity is different  sort of like dog years    The second is to include a combination of predictions and advice  But I am mindful that I dont remember anything about what the speaker said at my own college commencement  not even his name  So I approach that task with humility    This college has a history that is truly inspiring  It began more than a century ago as the Shaw School of Business on the second floor of a building in downtown Bangor  offering instruction in such cutting edge technologies of the day as typing and telegraphy    Since then  Husson College has grown tremendously  both in the size of this beautiful campus and in the range of the courses and degrees offered  It has grown because  though all those years  Husson has remained true to its founding principles of responding to needs  recognizing opportunities  and delivering real value      My prediction for you is that your Husson education will deliver real value for you your entire life  It will be the gift the keeps on giving  I have never known a school  a faculty or a student body more focused on preparing for a professional career than here at Husson  Husson truly is unusual in its dedication to this aspiration and its clear sense of purpose    It is a quality I saw every day during my time here at the Center for Family Business  I remember Missy Chasse  my wonderful work study student from Ashland  who came from a family business background  She shared everything she knew  and took in everything she could learn  I see that same quality of giving back as you receive among those of you in the school of health  school of business  school of education and liberal arts majors as well  This is a quality I know you graduates and alumni cherish and will continue    I have seen in Husson students an emerging sense of personal pride  a sense of self worth second grounded in knowledge and confidence  I dont exactly know what brings it on  whether its the hands on learning  the personal attention from the faculty  the friendships that develop with other students  your lab mates  roommates  teammates    or whether it is self discovery  But it is a wonderful quality you have nurtured and developed  It is one of the greatest gifts of a Husson education  As I travel throughout Maine and across the nation I find Husson alumni from every walk of life who possess that invaluable sense of self worth  I see it in you    Husson is more than a pretty campus in a small city that shines  as Thoreau put it  like a star on the edge of night  Husson is a network  It is a network that includes teachers  architects  bankers  nurses and therapists  counselors  criminal justice administrators  hospital CEOs and doctors  corporate executives and entrepreneurs  heads of architectural firms  senior law partners and entrepreneurs  It is a network that reaches across our state and around the world  You graduates are now part of that network       Husson delivers because it is always moving forward  The changes in the ten years since I worked here are astonishing and have strengthened this college  If there is one thing Husson graduates dont need to be told  its that the world is changing every day  A big part of the Husson spirit is anticipating change  We have business graduates who have become architects and attorneys  nurses who are hospital CEOs  and teachers who have become ministers  Think of your Husson degree as more than proof that you can do one thing well  By developing the skills to perfect one profession you have learned the discipline  leadership skills  and problem solving capabilities to change with the times  The Husson spirit is not just about being part of change  but of leading it    The changes that lie ahead are profound  and they will require the full measure of the Husson spirit  I challenge you to put the critical thinking skills you have developed here at Husson to work on the complex national and global issues that we must confront    Think about international affairs and the balance between spreading democracy and womens rights versus staying out of harms way    Think about energy and the environment  Be willing to be rational and to look for compromise that recognizes your personal role   Think about education and how we assess how well we are doing  Think about the trade offs between assuring every student a shared curriculum versus giving quality teachers the freedom to teach in the way they believe is best   Think about the challenges of a healthcare system where the ideal solutions may exceed our ability to pay  compounded by the aging of our population   Think about entitlements versus taxation  private property versus the common good  freedom of personal choice versus the laws and traditions that protect the rights of others   Think about war and peace and terrorism  and about the difference between impassioned  informed advocacy and partisan bickering  Think about the price of freedom   I challenge you to apply your Husson education not just to the great issues of our times  but also in your personal lives  to help you do things wisely  to help you make good decisions  be it a difficult family or professional decision  or an ethical or political decision  That is ultimately what a college education is all about  That is what your Husson education has prepared you for   Today  each of you has met the great challenge of earning a college degree  As you go forward in pursuit of the next goal  I know you are well aware that you didnt get this far by yourselves  The people here at Husson have done more than just give you a great education  They have filled you with that great Husson spirit   And those people here in the audience beaming with pride  your parents  your family  and your friends    had a lot to do with it  too  Their support and encouragement helped you meet this challenge  and they will be there for the challenges to come  Let everything you do from this day forward honor their sacrifices and belief in you   The diplomas you receive today represent a great deal of hard work on your part  They also represent a great debt you owe those who made it possible  There are many ways you can repay this debt  May I suggest one   Stay in Maine   You graduates come from 123 Maine towns  eight states  and six countries  I know you are eager to get out there and show the world what you can do  I urge you to apply your talent  energy  and enthusiasm right here in Maine  Whether at the beginning of your career or later on  Maine needs what you have to offer   A final piece if advice  Serve your community   Maine needs communities that are attractive to the entrepreneurs  the innovators  the risk takers who will create the businesses and jobs of the future  Whether its joining the volunteer fire department or ambulance crew  helping out at your local school or hospital  serving on your town council or planning board  or participating in a service club  your community needs you   In a 1978 commencement address at the University of Virginia  Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said the privilege of attending college brings with it  and I quote  an unceasing responsibility to use your knowledge and training for improving the lives of others   For more than a century  the great Husson spirit  the spirit of accomplishment and service  of knowledge and determination  and of gratitude and generosity    has inspired generations of graduates to meet that responsibility  It is a spirit that lives within the Class of 2006  Again  graduates  congratulations and good luck                                                                               Browse by
