                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 20  2005  Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins today joined Senate colleagues in writing a letter to Energy Bill conferees expressing strong opposition to opening the Outer Continental Shelf to seismic inventory   Use of this inventory would allow potentially damaging seismic technology in the vital fishing grounds of Georges Bank and the other areas of the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS    During consideration of the Energy Bill  the Senate defeated a Collins backed amendment that would have stricken a provision requiring the government to inventory all potential oil and natural gas resources in the entire outer continental shelf            I am hopeful that the conferees will do their part to protect the ecosystem and economies of the coastal communities of New England  and uphold the current moratoria on oil surveying activities on the Outer Continental shelf     Senator Collins said      If an oil spill were to occur as a result of drilling on Georges Bank  it would have catastrophic effects on the Bank   s unique ecosystem   It is critical that we protect Georges Bank and the other areas of the outer continental shelf from the potentially devastating impacts of offshore drilling  and remain committed to protecting our nation   s invaluable fishing grounds           Senator Collins is hopeful that the conferees will reverse the Senate vote on drilling related activities on the Outer Continental Shelf  as this strategy was successful in the 108th Congress when a similar amendment offered by Senator Collins was unsuccessful on the Senate Floor but ultimately prevailed when the bill went to Conference         Senator Collins has worked consistently on this issue during her time in the Senate   In 1999  Senator Collins introduced a resolution imposing a moratorium on drilling on the Canadian side of Georges Bank until 2012   The United States also has a moratorium on drilling Georges Bank until 2012         Senator Collins also worked to include language in the FY 2002 Interior Appropriations Bill that would prohibit the use of funds for offshore preleasing  leasing  or related activity on Georges Bank   This amendment was signed into law  and similar language has been included in subsequent interior appropriations bills          Following is the text of the letter      Dear Conferees        We commend you for all of your hard work on S  10  the Senate Energy bill  We appreciate your willingness to work with us to address our concerns about changes to the moratoria on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  and to allow for a fair debate   We write to express our strong opposition to including any provision in the conference committee on the Energy Bill that would in any way weaken the OCS moratoria        We are particularly concerned about a provision included in the Senate energy bill  Section 326  allowing a seismic inventory of offshore resources and ask that it not be included in the committee conference report   This provision runs directly counter to language that Congress has included annually in appropriations bills to prevent leasing  pre leasing  and related activities in most areas of the Outer Continental Shelf   A seismic inventory is the first step toward drilling in areas currently under the OCS moratoria and will expose our nation  s beaches and fisheries to unnecessary risks        This provision  and any other provision that undermines the OCS moratoria  threaten the environment and economies of coastal states   As you conference the energy bill  we ask that you do not include any provision that would in any way threaten the OCS moratoria        Thank you for your continued consideration of our views on this important subject                                                                                 Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Current record
