                                     Measure Includes Chemical Security Legislation and FEMA Reorganization Sought by Collins  Delays Costly Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative September 29  2006 Washington  D C   Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  today urged her colleagues to support the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report and urged speedy passage of the measure  which includes several provisions authored by the Senator  The Report is slated for floor consideration in both housesbeforeCongress recesses  It allocates  34 8 billion to improve vital components of our homeland security  including implementing new security standards for our nations chemical facilities and strengthening the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   both of which were spearheaded by Chairman Collins    This bill represents a comprehensive package of carefully crafted national security improvements  said Senator Collins  There are major advances in protection for chemical facilities  which are a major homeland security vulnerability  Further  the far reaching FEMA reforms sought by my Committee are essential to ensuring that we can better prepare for and respond to all disasters in a more timely and effective manner  The Conference Report included language crafted by Chairman Collins and House Homeland Security Committee Chairmen King that gives DHS new authority to require mandatory security standards at high risk chemical plants nationwide  DHS is directed to require covered facilities to complete vulnerability assessments and create and implement site security plans  It gives the Secretary a means to inspect and sanction non compliant facilities  including the authority to shut down non compliant facilities  The provision protects security information but allows it to be shared with appropriate authorities  including State and local government officials and first responders  This regulatory authority is authorized for up to three years until permanent  comprehensive authority is enacted    The Report also includes provisions crafted by Collins to strengthen FEMA  Specifically  FEMA becomes a distinct entity within DHS  similar to the Coast Guard and Secret Service  protected from reorganizations that might degrade its capabilities  Its preparedness and response capabilities are reunited  empowering the agency to meet the challenges of all aspects of emergency management  preparedness  mitigation  response  and recovery  The Report allows for a stronger regional focus that will include multi agency Strike Teams to ensure a speedy response  and creates a new Office of Emergency Communications that will develop a national emergency communications strategy  and coordinate efforts by the federal  state  and local governments  emergency responders  and the private sector to achieve effective emergency communications  Finally  the package includes new measures and controls to achieve more efficient purchases of goods and services  and to prevent and detect fraud  waste and abuse  These weremanyof the core recommendations of the Committees Hurricane Katrina report  Five years since 9 11  a year past Katrina  we still face systemic weaknesses in our arrangements for preparation and response  A CBS News  New York Times poll conducted earlier this month revealed that only 14 percent of Americans feel safer than they did five years ago  We can do a great deal to change that perception  and the reality as well  said Senator Collins  Whether our next great national trauma is inflicted by terrorists  by accident  or by natural forces  there are many urgent tasks that need to be started sooner rather than later   At the request of Senator Collins  the Conference Report also pushes back implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative until June 1  2009  affording DHS the time needed to develop standards for alternative forms of U S  identification so that residents in border states like Maine are not forced to acquire costly passports  Additionally  the Conference Report   Provides for significant investment in Customs and Border Protection to implement the Container Security Initiative and to staff borders between ports of entry  Increases funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to improve investigation and intelligence  Funds the Transportation Security Administration to upgrade railroad safety  Allocates new resources to the Coast Guard and the Secret Service  Funds grants toassist state and local law enforcement with terror prevention activity  port security  firefighter assistance  and rail security                                                                         Browse by
