                                        Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act    Would Help Maine Manufacturers Fight Unfair  March 26  2007 Washington  DC    Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Evan Bayh  D IN  have reintroduced the Stopping Overseas Subsidies  SOS  Act  which will allow the   United States to fully enforce its antisubsidy laws and help companies fight unfair trade from overseas  Illegal subsidies  which often take the form of   free rent and utilities and loans that are never meant to be repaid  allow foreign companies to price their products at artificially low levels  giving   them an unfair advantage over American companies that receive no such advantages  The SOS Act would revise current trade laws to ensure that all   countries doing business with the U S  are operating under the same rules that help to ensure fair competition for American manufacturers  Senators Collins   and Bayh originally introduced this legislation in March 2005  during the last session of Congress     Our nations manufacturers and their employees can compete against the best in the world  but they cannot compete against nations that provide huge subsidies and other unfair advantages to their producers  Time and time again  I hear from manufacturers in my state whose efforts to compete successfully in the global economy simply cannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing and subsidies of nations such as China  The results of these unfair practices are lost jobs  shuttered factories  and decimated communities  said Senator Collins  U S  industries dont want protection  they want fair competition  Illegal subsidies distort fair competition  regardless of the economic system in which they are used  Our legislation simply levels the playing field by allowing anti subsidy petitions to be brought against non market economies in addition to market economies  Some countries  such as China  want to have all the benefits of engaging in international trading institutions and systems yet continue to cheat on the system with no penalties  It is time these countries were held to the same standards as other countries around the world    For example  the American residential wood furniture industry has experienced devastating losses due to surges of unfairly priced furniture imports from China  According to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  146 600 jobs  or about 22 percent of the workforce  have been lost in the U S  furniture industry since 2000  Unfairly priced imports from China are a leading cause in these job losses  Chinas wooden bedroom furniture exports to the U S   which amounted to just  169 million in 1999  reached an estimated  1 8 billion in 2006  By subsidizing investments in furniture manufacturing facilities  China is exploiting the U S  market to the benefit of its producers and putting our employees at an unfair advantage     One furniture manufacturer in Maine  Moosehead Manufacturing  struggled for years to cope with the onslaught of unfair imports from China  Despite   the companys quality products and attempts to survive through several rounds of layoffs and participation in the federal Trade Adjustment for Firms program  Moosehead was not able to keep its doors open in the face of unfair Chinese imports  The company announced its closing on February 8  2007  said   Senator Collins  This is a tragic development  for this family owned business  for its skilled employees  and for the community and state  It is because of the experience of manufacturers such as Moosehead that I am reintroducing the Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act    Until recently  the practice of the Department of Commerce was to accept an anti subsidy petition against any market economy such as Canada or Chile     but not against a non market economy such as China  As a result  non market countries that subsidize their industries the most heavily and cause the most   injury to U S  industries and workers  such as China  were exempt from the reach of American anti subsidy laws  The countervailing duty statute on its   face in no way limits the application of the CVD law to any country  Unfortunately  the Departments interpretation of this statute for the last   two decades has been that it does not apply to non market economies  and this policy was upheld by a 1986 federal court decision that maintained that   Congress needs to clarify the statute on this issue  which is what the SOS Act does     According to the United States Department of Labor  10 400 manufacturing jobs in Maine have been lost since 2001  a 14 8 percent decline  The   legislation introduced by Senators Collins and Bayh has received the support of numerous national manufacturing organizations and manufacturing businesses in Maine  including the Maine Forest Products Council  Maine Wood Products Association  and the NewPage Corporation   NewPage Corporation thanks Senator Collins for all her work on this important legislation  said Jerry LeClaire  NewPage Rumford vice president   and mill manager  Application of the subsidy law to China will help ensure fair trade in the paper industry  and will help preserve high quality   papermaking jobs in Maine  and elsewhere  NewPages Rumford mill has 1 050 employees and operates four paper machines  producing 1 800 tons of coated printing papers each day
