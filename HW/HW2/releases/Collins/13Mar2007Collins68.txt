                                     Improving America s Security Act Passes by a Vote of 60 38 March 13  2007 Washington  DC        Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Tuesday hailed passage of their bipartisan bill to enact remaining 9 11 Commission recommendations  saying it will help secure the nation against terrorist attacks as well as natural disasters  The Senate approved S  4  the Improving Americas Security Act of 2007  by a vote of 60 38    When this bill becomes law  we will have taken a critical step toward building a safer and more secure America for the generations to come  Lieberman said  This will ensure the American people are better protected against the consequences of natural disasters  such as Hurricane Katrina  than they are today  And we will have done everything possible to make sure no other Americans suffer the loss that so many experienced after the brutal terrorist attacks of 9 11    This legislation continues the work of Congress to strengthen homeland security and build upon the 9 11 Commission s recommendations  I believe it will help make our nation safer  said Senator Collins  Our legislations broad front attack on the threats we face will ensure good value for every dollar our nation spends to improve our defenses at the federal  state  and local levels  It will provide appropriate transparency and accountability into the governments security decisions  It will also strike an appropriate balance between increased security and our cherished civil liberties     S 4 would increase risk based homeland security grants to states and localities  improve information sharing among all levels of government  restrict terrorists ability to enter the U S   and create an interoperable communications grant program for first responders  It also strengthens privacy rights and civil liberties     Specifically  the Lieberman Collins bill will     Authorize  3 105 billion for each of the next three years for the homeland security grant program to increase prevention and preparedness for terrorist attacks  The grants will be distributed overwhelmingly based on the risk to an area from a terrorist attack  The funds would be allocated through Urban Area Security Grants  State Homeland Security Grants  Emergency Management Performance Grants  and emergency communications and interoperability grants   Create a dedicated interoperable grant program within FEMA to help state  local and tribal governments build communications systems that allow first responders from different organizations and different jurisdictions to talk with each other in a disaster   Improve the governments ability to disrupt terrorists travel and infiltration of the U S  by requiring the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program  VWP  through improved reporting of lost or stolen passports  requiring countries to share information about prospective visitors who may pose a threat to the U S   and authorizing an electronic travel authorization system through which travelers would apply in advance for authorization to enter the U S   Strengthen the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board by giving members fixed terms and requiring them to be Senate confirmed  by expanding responsibilities to inform the public  and by providing the board with subpoena power through the Attorney General   Establish a voluntary certification program for private sector preparedness to provide companies with a clear roadmap for strengthening preparedness   Improve counter terrorism information sharing within the federal government and among federal  state and local officials by making the Program Manager of the Information Sharing Environment permanent  creating standards for state and local fusion centers  assigning federal intelligence analysts to them  and creating intelligence fellowship programs for state and local officials      Provisions related to rail  aviation cargo  mass transit security  and nuclear proliferation that came out of the Commerce  Banking  and Foreign Relations Committees were melded with the Homeland Security Committee bill on the floor  This bill takes an all hazards approach to homeland security  Lieberman said  It not only strengthens our defenses against the threat of a terrorist attack  but also prepares all levels of government to respond better to natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina
