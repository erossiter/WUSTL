                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               September 11  2006 Five years ago  our nation experienced one of its darkest days and finest hours  With shocking suddenness  an act of unparalleled cruelty transformed a late summer morning of uncommon brilliance into one of unfathomable horror  On that awful morning  September 11th was transformed from a mere point on the calendar into an eternal monument to the deepest human emotions of loss  of sacrifice  and of resolve  We pause today to remember those whose lives were taken that terrible morning  2 996 innocent men  women  and children  workers doing their jobs  travelers embarking on trips  Men and women like Robert and Jacqueline Norton of Lubec  Maine  who boarded Flight 11 to celebrate a sons wedding in California  In the days just before the trip  the Nortons planted new raspberry bushes in their garden and Robert  at age 85  helped repair the concrete steps at their church  At age 85  Robert Norton was the oldest to perish that day  At age 2  Christine Hanson of Groton  Massachusetts  was the youngest  She was traveling with her parents to that place of childhood dreams  Disneyland  The aircraft that was to take the Hanson family on their dream vacation instead was driven into the North Tower  There  on the 92nd floor  were John and Sylvia Resta of Queens  New York  They worked together and on September 11th they died together  Sylvia Resta was seven months pregnant  The Pentagon that morning was filled with men and women who had dedicated their lives to serving their country  Among them was Commander Robert Allan Schlegel  After his 1981 graduation from Gray New Gloucester High School in Maine  he went to college  married his high school sweetheart  Dawn  and followed a tradition set by his father and two brothers by joining the United States Navy  His fifteen year Naval career was one of achievement and courage  Among his many commendations were the Meritorious Service Medal  four Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals  and the Purple Heart  Shortly before September 11th  he had been promoted to the rank of Commander  His new office  on the second floor of the Pentagon  was believed to be the point of impact of Flight 77  Each of these names  and the names of so many more  represent lives of accomplishment  contribution  and promise  Each loss leaves a wound in the hearts of families and friends that can never be fully healed  But September 11th was not just a day of personal tragedy  It was an attack on the United States  an attack on freedom  an attack on civilization  We must never forget what was lost  and what remains at stake  We also pause today to remember the heroes whose courage saved countless lives then  and who continue to inspire us  Yamel Merino  of Yonkers  New York  was described by colleagues as the perfect EMT  She gave her life while helping the injured near the World Trade Center when the first tower collapsed  After an outstanding career with the FBI  John ONeill became head of security for the World Trade Center  He exited the building safely after the first of the two hijacked planes hit  but re entered when he saw the extent of the damage and the danger to others  He saved lives  but could not save himself  After his safe exit from the Pentagon  Staff Sergeant Christopher Braman rushed back into the burning building  returning again and again to find survivors and to carry them to safety  He stayed on the scene for the next three days  working past exhaustion  saving lives with the search and rescue skills the U S  Army had taught him  In the days and weeks immediately following the attacks  we were moved by the selfless courage of the men and women    passengers and crew    aboard Flight 93  By wresting control of that aircraft from the terrorists  they knowingly gave their lives so that others might live  Todd Beamers Lets Roll  became our nations rallying cry  Last month  additional recordings of emergency calls made that terrible morning were released  One contains a statement that describes with eloquent simplicity the spirit of September 11th  Amid the suffocating smoke  searing flames  and falling debris of the South Tower  the last words Fire Captain Patrick Brown spoke from the 35th floor to the outside world were these  Were still heading up  We may never know where the courage to keep heading up into such danger comes from  We must always honor it  We must never forget  As we pledge to never forget what was lost and what was given on September 11th  we must in the same breath pledge to do all that we can to prevent future attacks  We can offer no guarantee  but it must be our goal  The fundamental obligation of government is to protect its people  Since September 11th  we have done much to meet that obligation  Immediately after the attacks  we passed legislation to close the gap between law enforcement and intelligence that the terrorists exploited  The reauthorization signed into law earlier this year makes permanent many provisions from the original law that are important to protect Americans from terrorists  Equally important  it contains significant new safeguards that protect the civil liberties we cherish but that the terrorists despise  We created the Department of Homeland Security to provide a unifying core to the vast effort of detecting and preventing terrorist attacks  assessing and protecting our vulnerabilities  and improving our response to disasters of all types  Through DHS  we have made great investments in training and equipping first responders throughout the nation  We have strengthened our borders with additional personnel  better coordination with state and local authorities  and cutting edge technology so that they remain open to our friends but increasingly closed to our enemies  We passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  which Senator Lieberman and I authored  This legislation  based on the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  brought about the most comprehensive reforms of our intelligence community in more than a half century so that the trail of dots terrorists leave behind as they plan  train  and organize will never again be left unconnected  This newly restructured intelligence community has uncovered terrorist plots  cells  and financing operations  and it played an important role in thwarting the scheme to blow up transatlantic airliners that was exposed in Britain last month  And today we are on the brink of passing the GreenLane Maritime Security Act  Americas seaports are vital to our economy  but at the same time they offer a port of entry for those who would do us harm  or for devastating weapons  This bipartisan legislation will help build a coordinated approach to maritime and port security across all levels of government with our overseas trading partners  In addition to improving our nations security  it will expedite trade with foreign governments and businesses  and provide financial assistance to our ports as they strive to strengthen their terrorism prevention and response effort  I urge my colleagues to take this major step toward protecting these valuable and vulnerable facilities  We have taken many such steps  None was easily taken  All were accompanied by controversy  conflict  and reasonable differences of opinion  Yet  working together  we found a way  Each  however  remains a work in progress  DHS has yet to develop the cohesion  the common culture  that is needed for its complex mission  First responder grants to the states still lack the accountability and effective measures of progress needed to prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars  Ongoing shortages of detention space and personnel leave our borders at risk  Other gaps remain  Tens of millions of Americans live and work in proximity to plants that produce  use  or store large quantities of hazardous chemicals  The American chemical industry is a major and beneficial component of our nations economy  There is no question that attacking these facilities fits squarely within the terrorist strategy of causing maximum harm to our people and to our prosperity  Yet five years after 9 11  five years after this horrific strategy was fully revealed  America is left vulnerable by an incomplete and inadequate patchwork of laws and voluntary industry standards that far too many facilities fail to observe  The Homeland Security Committee approved our bipartisan Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act more than three months ago by a unanimous vote  For the first time  our legislation would ensure that high risk chemical facilities are covered by federal standards that would not only help to deter terrorist attacks  but also to mitigate the consequences of an attack  Our legislation would give the Department of Homeland Security the strongest possible remedy to ensure compliance  the authority to shut down any chemical facility that does not adequately address the risks of a terrorist attack  Unless this legislation moves forward  these highly attractive terrorist targets  targets that can be found in every state  and in communities large and small  will remain without the protection they require  The heroes of 9 11 faced grave danger and made great sacrifices in order to save others  They performed magnificently despite being hampered by obsolete and incompatible communications equipment that placed them in needless peril and that resulted in needless loss of life  The Post Katrina Emergency Reform Act  which Senator Lieberman and I introduced  contains strong provisions to establish a comprehensive national emergency communications strategy  to coordinate state grants for interoperable communications  and to regularly assess the communications systems that are so essential for effective disaster response  It is time to act on this legislation  we must never again send our first responders into harms way with a deficiency that has been so thoroughly revealed  These are not barriers we have run up against  but hurdles we have yet to clear  Together  energized by our shared commitment to protect the American people  we can surmount them  The greatest challenge is to recognize that the challenges presented by terrorism constantly evolve  As the devastating attacks in Madrid  Bali  Istanbul  Beslan  London  and in Israel prove  the terrorists will strike wherever opportunity allows and wherever innocent people are the most vulnerable  The terrorists resourcefulness  cunning  and patience are exceeded only by their depravity  Indeed  one of the most striking findings of the 9 11 Commission was that the September 11th attacks were made possible by a failure of imagination  Commercial airliners had long been a target of terrorists  the conventional wisdom was that they would be targeted in two ways  to hijack for the purpose of taking hostages  or to blow up in mid air  To envision airliners being hijacked to use as missiles would have taken some imagination  but it was not unimaginable  How different things might be today  five years after September 11th  2001    if our imagination had been fully engaged five years before  1996 was the year that Ramzi Yousef  while awaiting trial for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  was convicted of a conspiracy to plant bombs aboard a number of US airliners operating in East Asia  and of placing the bomb that exploded aboard a Philippine airliner late the previous year  1996 was the year of the truck bomb attack on Khobar Towers  an attack that specifically targeted U S  personnel  And it was the year Osama bin Laden relocated from Sudan to Afghanistan  established a new base of operations under the protection of the Taliban  and declared war on the United States  The terrorist strategy was evolving to direct and massive attacks on high profile American targets  but we failed to see it  We failed to imagine that these seemingly isolated events were tied together  In the aftermath of 9 11  we learned that  although the terrorists targeted high profile targets in major cities  they did much of their planning  training  and transiting in smaller communities  communities such as Stone Mountain  Georgia  Norman  Oklahoma  and Portland  Maine  It may be that they believed these locations shielded their activities from the scrutiny they would have been subjected to in their larger  more terrorism savvy target locations  Today  there is no question that this tactic has evolved  As the recent arrests in Canada and Miami  the attacks on the London subway of a year ago  and the foiled airliner plot in Britain have made clear  terrorism masterminds no longer rely upon operatives imported from abroad to infiltrate target nations and to carry our attack  The emerging threat is from home grown terrorists  Again  the tactic of avoiding scrutiny  this time at our borders  is apparent  Whether the target we seek to protect is a cargo port  a chemical plant  a public water supply  the electricity grid  or the information technology networks critical to our economy  it does not take a stretch of the imagination to see that an attack could come from within just as easily  perhaps even more easily  than from abroad  In fact  Timothy McVeigh and the D C  snipers tell us that this is not so much a matter of imagination as it is of recognizing reality  From John Walker Lindh  we already know that the most extreme ideology can take root even among those who enjoy the most privileged circumstances our society can offer  As the details of the British airliner plot emerge  it becomes evident that home grown terrorists  working in conjunction with masterminds overseas  can be every bit as sophisticated as the imported terrorists who attacked us on 9 11  What is particularly alarming about this tactic is that it does not just infiltrate our society with hate filled operatives  but attempts to infect our society with terrorisms murderous ideology  I am particularly concerned by the extent to which this infection is spread within our state and federal prisons  Richard Reid  the infamous shoe bomber  and Jose Padilla both were indoctrinated into Islamic extremism while in prison  Less well known  but equally lethal  is Kevin James  a self styled Imam who  while a California State Prison inmate  founded an organization based upon his radical interpretation of Islam  James recruited among his fellow inmates  allegedly instructing them that it was their duty to kill his perceived enemies of Islam  in particular U S  military personnel and supporters of Israel  Upon their release  his followers reportedly conducted surveillance on military installations  the Israeli Consulate  and synagogues  It is alleged that they sought firearms with silencers and also explosives  and that they financed their operations through a string of armed robberies in the Los Angeles area  These operatives have been arrested and they face trial next month  The new face of terrorism  born and raised in America  in Great Britain    has been exposed  This new face is being created in a setting that is supposed to bring rehabilitation and reform  It is being created with taxpayer dollars  This is the reality that we must confront  We must not allow our imagination to fail us again  On this day of remembrance  of sorrow  and of gratitude  our thoughts must turn to those who have given so much to defend our nation against terrorism  the men and women of our armed forces  They have freed Afghanistan from a regime that harbored al Qaeda  that brutalized its own people  and that cruelly oppressed Afghan women  They battle bravely in Iraq  They have given 50 million people who once had no hope the chance to seize and embrace freedom  Like our efforts to secure our homeland  these military operations have been conducted amid controversy  conflict  and with vigorous differences of opinion throughout our nation  Let no differences  however  prevent us from honoring the courage and sacrifice of those who wear our nations uniform  Five years ago  in what seemed like a moment  September 11th was transformed from a day like any other day into one that  for as long as our nation stands  will stand alone  The loss we relive this day reminds us of the value of all that we must protect  The heroism reminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people  Our accomplishments remind us that we can meet any challenge with decisive action  As long as we keep the meaning of this day of remembrance in our hearts  we will meet the challenges that lie ahead                                                                           Browse by
