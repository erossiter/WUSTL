                                     Chairman Collins Asks Secretary to Consider Affects of Rules on Frequent Travelers   on States Like Maine April 18  2005  WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Susan Collins  who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  which oversees the Department of Homeland Security  has contacted DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff to request that he take into account the affect new passport rules could have on border states  such as Maine  where frequent travel between the border is crucial   DHS has begun the process of drafting new rules  pursuant to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative to strengthen security by requiring a passport or other documents for travel across our borders  Senator Collins is requesting that during the rulemaking process  DHS look not just to passports  but at other forms of identification such as drivers licenses  that could be acceptable  and that the department search for ways to enable frequent travelers to cross the borders more rapidly        As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  which Senator Collins co authored  she included provisions in the bill that provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with the authority to take into account the needs of border communities        The text of Senator Collins    letter to Secretary Chertoff is as follows       April 18  2005      The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security      Dear Secretary Chertoff        I am writing to you today regarding the Department of Homeland Security   s plan to implement  in conjunction with the Department of State  the documentary requirements of section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  IRTPA    This section requires U S  citizens and nonimmigrant aliens to present a passport  or documents sufficient to denote identity and citizenship  for travel into the United States from Western Hemisphere countries         In enacting the IRTPA  Congress recognized both the importance of strengthening our borders and protecting our nation against the threat of terrorism  and maintaining the free flow of legitimate tourism  trade  and other services that are so vital to our border communities   Striking the right balance will be critical   In my home state of Maine  for example  many Mainers rely on the ability to quickly and easily cross the northern border to travel to their jobs  attend church  and visit family and friends   Many Canadians also frequently cross the border into Maine in order to visit family and friends  shop in our stores  and dine in our restaurants          I am concerned that the travel of people we know  people who travel across the border regularly as part of their family  social  spiritual  work  and personal lives  people who pose no threat to our country or our neighbors  will be unnecessarily inhibited if we do not allow some alternative to passports   President Bush   s recent comments to the American Society of Newspaper Editors indicate that he shares these concerns   Expressing his belief that requiring all travelers to carry a passport may disrupt the legal flow of traffic and people  the President suggested that we must examine ways to expedite the legal flow of traffic across our borders         With these concerns in mind  I included provisions in the IRTPA to ensure that the interests of people living in border communities are taken into account as the Secretary of Homeland Security develops these new travel initiatives   Specifically  I authored language requiring that the Secretary   s plan to implement these new requirements seek to expedite the travel of frequent travelers  including those residing in border communities  and in doing so  make readily available a registered traveler program   I also ensured that the Secretary had the authority to allow travelers to enter the United States with an alternative document  or a combination of documents  sufficient to denote identity and citizenship          While I understand and appreciate the Department   s suggestion that registered traveler plans currently in existence  such as NEXUS  are likely to be accepted in lieu of a passport  I understand that NEXUS has not been implemented at any Maine port of entry   Until convenient and cost effective programs are readily available to all people living on the border  I urge the Department to implement alternatives to passports that will not unduly burden these individuals   I should also note that State driver   s licenses will soon be made more secure through the rulemaking process established in section 7212 of the IRTPA   In light of the anticipated improvement in the reliability of these documents  I would ask that the Department also consider driver   s licenses  perhaps in combination with some other document  as possible alternatives to passports                Sincerely              Susan M  Collins        Chairman                                                                         Browse by
