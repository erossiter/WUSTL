                                      September 12  2005  Washington  D C     Tonight  Senator Susan Collins will be managing the Senate Floor debate on a resolution that could overturn the EPA   s flawed rule on mercury emissions   The resolution of disapproval  introduced by Senators Collins and Patrick Leahy  D VT   ensured a vote on this flawed rule       Following are Senator Collins remarks          Mr  President  I rise today in support of S  J  Res  20   This resolution would disapprove of the EPA  s improperly crafted rule on mercury emissions  a rule that both the agency   s own IG and the GAO have criticized          In the wrong form  mercury is an acutely dangerous toxin that can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm  especially to children and pregnant women   Recent studies indicate that at least one in six women of childbearing age in the United States carries enough accumulated mercury in her body to pose risks of adverse health effects to her children  should she become pregnant          Tragically  EPA   s own scientists found that some 630 000 infants were born in the United States in a 12 month period from 1999 to 2000 with blood mercury levels higher than what is considered safe   In addition  a new study released just last week by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine found that more than 1500 children are born in the United States every year with mental retardation as a result of mercury exposure            To see just how toxic mercury is  one does not have to look any farther than my home state of Maine   Every freshwater lake  river  and stream in my state is subject to a mercury advisory warning pregnant women and young children to limit consumption of fish caught in these waters   While this advisory is bad enough for the many anglers who love to fish Maine  s beautiful waters  it is especially difficult for indigenous peoples like those of the Penobscot Indian Nation for whom subsistence fishing is an important part of their culture          Mercury is dangerous not only to people  but also to wildlife   Let me cite one study conducted by researchers in my own state   The Biodiversity Research Institute in Falmouth  Maine  found that mercury concentrations in loon eggs increase from western to eastern North America   They found that mercury concentrations in loon eggs in Maine were dangerously high  nearly four times higher than those found in Alaska  which is not exposed to mercury from power plants            Despite the overwhelming hazards of mercury pollution and the fact that coal fired power plants are the single largest source of mercury emissions in the United States  the EPA inexplicably decided to remove power plants from the list of mercury sources that must be regulated under the strictest provisions of the Clean Air Act          Instead  the EPA rule would regulate mercury emissions under a much weaker cap and trade program  and would give industry an extra decade to meet this weaker emissions level          If this rule goes into effect  power plants will be free to continue spewing unlimited amounts of toxic mercury into our air until the year 2018          Both the EPA Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have severely criticized the EPA rule   The Inspector General found that the EPA conducted analyses in order to justify a predetermined conclusion  did not adequately analyze the impact of the rule on children  s health  and did not conduct the appropriate cost benefit analysis of regulatory alternatives   The GAO found that there are cost effective mercury controls that would make it possible to achieve far greater mercury emissions reductions than EPA is calling for          I call on our colleagues to join me  Senator Leahy and many others in sending this flawed rule back to the agency   The EPA  s mercury rule is not based on science  did not employ proper cost benefit analyses  harms human health and our environment  and should not be allowed to go into effect   Our resolution would give EPA the chance to fix these flaws and come back with a rule that would better protect the American people and the nation   s streams  rivers  lakes  air  and wildlife                                                                                            Browse by
