                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Collins says Judge Roberts is eminently qualified to serve as Chief Justice September 27  2005  WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Susan Collins today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor in support of Judge John Roberts   President Bush nominated Judge Roberts to become the next Chief Justice of the United States   The Senate is expected to vote on Roberts    nomination on Thursday       Following is the text of Senator Collins    remarks          Mr  President  I rise today to speak in favor of the nomination of John Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United States          The Chief Justice is commonly referred to as the    first among equals     a title reflecting the significance of this position in terms of shaping the Court  and serving as the head of the Judicial branch   Assuming he is confirmed  Judge Roberts will be only the 17th person in our nation   s history to serve as Chief Justice       In confirming a Chief Justice  we entrust this individual with an enormous power     the power to interpret the Constitution  to say what the law is  to guard one branch against the encroachments of another  and to defend our most sacred rights and liberties   Along with these powers  this individual also bears a responsibility to act with an understanding of the limited role of judicial review and the need for judicial restraint         The cases that come before the Supreme Court each year present legal issues of tremendous complexity and import   Given the difficulty of the questions presented  it is not surprising that most good Justices do not know how they will rule before a case comes before them   Their decisions are rendered only after extensive briefing  argument  research  and discussion with the other Justices   Indeed  when any person goes before the Court  he or she has a right to expect that the Justices will approach the case with an open mind and a willingness to fully consider all of the arguments presented         Some of our colleagues have called on nominees to announce beforehand how they would rule in cases that have yet to come before them    Yet  a good judge will not know  and would not try to say     even hazarding a guess could raise questions about judicial impartiality and integrity        Similarly  our ability to question nominees about future cases is limited by the difficulty of predicting the issues that will come before the Court over the next several decades    Twenty years ago  few would have expected that the Court would hear issues related to a presidential election challenge  would try to make sense of copyright laws in an electronic age  or would confront questions on how to protect our cherished civil liberties in light of a new domestic terrorism threat         And even if nominees were to indicate how they would rule  the reality is that we are not in a position to hold them to their word   Appointments to the Court are  of course  lifetime appointments           While we can not know with certainty how a nominee will rule on the many questions that may come before him or her  we can and must strive to take the measure of the person  carefully assessing the excellence of the nominee   s qualifications  integrity  and judicial temperament  as well as the principles that will guide the nominee   s decision making        Does the nominee have the intellect and learning necessary to be a superb jurist   Is he or she open minded and pragmatic   Does he or she have a sense of restraint and humility concerning the role of a judge   Does the nominee take seriously the role of our courts in protecting our basic liberties and rights from the passions and fads of the moment   And for Judge Roberts  the answer to these questions is yes        The excellence of his legal qualifications is beyond doubt   He is a superb attorney and one of the finest legal minds of his generation    Prior to his appointment to the D C  Circuit in 2003  Judge Roberts had argued an impressive 39 cases before the Supreme Court  and more often than not  his arguments were accepted by a majority of the Court   The ABA Standing Committee on the Judiciary has had three separate occasions to review his qualifications for his nominations to the Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court  and in every instance  it has given Judge Roberts its highest possible rating        Earlier this month  I met with Judge Roberts to discuss his judicial philosophy  his views on the importance of precedent  and the role of the judiciary   I was extremely impressed by his answers to my questions  which reassured me that he will be a justice dedicated to the rule of law     not someone who bends the rules to suit personal preferences or to advance a particular agenda       At our meeting  I asked Judge Roberts about his views regarding the importance of stare decisis     the principle that courts should adhere to the law set forth in previously decided cases   I asked Judge Roberts whether a judge should follow precedent  even if he believed that the original case was incorrectly decided in the first instance   He told me that overruling a case is a    jolt to the legal system    and said that it is not enough that a judge may think a prior case was wrongly decided    He emphasized the importance that adherence to precedent plays in promoting evenhandedness  fairness  stability and predictability in the law        Following my personal meeting with Judge Roberts  I felt confident that Judge Roberts was eminently qualified to serve as Chief Justice   The Judiciary Committee hearings have only further confirmed my view that he is the right person for this weighty position         Without question  these hearings demonstrated Judge Roberts    keen legal intellect and commanding knowledge of the law and the precedents of the Supreme Court    He demonstrated a winning and collegial style while under fire  and his testimony has been justifiably praised   Most important  he demonstrated an understanding of the limited role of the judiciary and a deep and abiding commitment to the rule of law        During the confirmation process  I was impressed by Judge Roberts    statement that he wants to be known  he said     as a modest judge       This simple phrase is one that speaks volumes about the approach he brings to the Court   It tells us that he knows a judge must be restrained by the law  and by the principles  the practices  and the common understandings that make up our legal tradition         It tells us that he has an abiding respect for our Constitution  for the separation of federal powers it describes  and for the powers it reserves for the states and for the people   Perhaps most important  it tells us that his rulings will not be influenced by his own political views and personal values  whatever they may be          Given the increasing concerns about judicial activism and the desire by some to use the courts to achieve the political ends that have alluded them  I believe that Judge Roberts    modest and disciplined approach to the law will serve our nation well        The President  in consultation with the Senate  has selected an outstanding nominee   We have fulfilled our advice and consent responsibility through extensive interviews  investigations and hearings   Judge Roberts has emerged from this process remaining true to his ideals of the proper role of a judge  and demonstrating beyond a doubt his fitness for the office       Based on my personal discussions with Judge Roberts  my review of his record  and his testimony before Judiciary Committee  I am confident that Judge Roberts will be a Justice committed to the rule of law and one who will protect the liberties and rights guaranteed by our Constitution    I believe he will exercise his judicial duties with an understanding of the limited role of the judiciary to review and decide the specific cases before them based on the law     not to make policy through case law   He will be guided not by his own personal view of what the law should be  but by a disciplined review and analysis of what the law is   He understands that the very integrity of our judicial system depends on judges exercising this restraint         For these reasons  I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Roberts  and I applaud the President for making an outstanding choice                                                                               Browse by
