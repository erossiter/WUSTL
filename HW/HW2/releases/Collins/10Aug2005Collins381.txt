                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               August 10  2005  The closure of Brunswick Naval Air Station would be harmful to our national and homeland security   That is not just my personal opinion  it is the considered and repeated military judgment of the Department of Defense   This judgment has been stated many times during the BRAC deliberative process and most recently was reiterated in a July 26  2005  letter from the Navy to me  which I ask be included in the record         The Department of Defense rejected the closure of Brunswick Naval Air Station because of the base   s clear military value  specifically its strategic location  surge capability  and capacity to handle all DoD aircraft          In its July 26th letter from Anne Davis  Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy for Base Realignment and Closure  the Navy put forth a compelling case for the retention of Brunswick   While this letter reiterates the Department   s support for realignment  its assertions actually make a strong case against realignment and closure   Let me read the Navy   s own words from this letter           Commander Fleet Forces Command supports retention of Brunswick     because it will support future requirements for homeland defense and surge capability   The specific Maritime Homeland Defense requirement is stated in terms of response time to any maritime threat against the northeast coast of the United States   Because this area is not a standard operating area for U S  naval vessels  and because of the proximity of NAS Brunswick to the great circle navigation routes from Europe  P 3s operating out of NAS Brunswick currently provide the Maritime Homeland Defense initial response coverage          United States Northern Command  working in cooperation with the military departments and the U S  Coast Guard  is developing an air to surface concept of operations that will address this responsiveness concern with other assets or force packages that will be combined with the current P 3 mission capabilities to facilitate maximum response flexibility           Numerous sites in the northeast have been considered as potentially feasible locations to conduct P 3 detachment operations     and NAS Brunswick continues to be viewed by the Navy as the optimal site in New England            The letter continues      In addition to its location in the northeast  NAS Brunswick is an ideal location     because it has a fully functional weapons facility that can support all weapons available for deployment aboard the P 3  and because its geographic location permits armed aircraft to depart on maritime missions without flying over inhabited areas           The letter goes on to say      NAS Brunswick also has enormous strategic value as the last remaining active DoD airfield in the northeast   NAS Brunswick supports     several large NATO joint training exercise opportunities   In addition  NAS Brunswick is a critical logistics and refueling hub for DoD aircraft flowing in and out of the U S  Central Command and U S  European Command theatre of operations          Brunswick will also continue to function as an important location for aviation training  because it can and will remain capable of logistically supporting all of the aircraft currently in DoD inventory   Its utility is not limited to DoD aircraft  but includes aircraft of the Air National Guard and other Federal agencies          Commissioners  these are not my words  they are the Navy   s   Closing Brunswick would leave the Northeast more vulnerable to threats and would create an intolerable risk for the Department and the nation   Moreover  the DoD recommendation to realign Brunswick ignores what the Department itself describes as the base   s    enormous strategic value           Although Ms  Davis   response in this letter is focused on using Brunswick for detachment operations  it clearly states that this naval air station is vital for the Maritime Homeland Defense of the northeast United States         The closure or realignment of Brunswick  and the subsequent removal of the base   s aircraft  would significantly and dangerously degrade operational readiness and would increase response time in emergencies   The proposed realignment would not meet the needs of Northern Command   s homeland defense missions and would result in diminished effectiveness and lower efficiency  with numerous hidden costs associated with detachments       Commissioners  closure or realignment would violate the BRAC criteria   The Navy  Department of Defense and national security are best served by a fully operational base at Brunswick   Thank you for your attention to our presentations
