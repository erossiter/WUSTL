                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               March 1  2005  WASHINGTON  D C      Co Chairs of the Northeast Midwest Senate Coalition  Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and Senator Jack Reed  D RI  have requested that the budget include  3 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    In a letter to the Senate Budget Committee  Senators Collins and Reed  who were joined by nearly 50 of their colleagues  outlined the vital role that LIHEAP plays in ensuring that our nation   s low income families and seniors have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs          LIHEAP funds are vital to many families across the nation who struggle to pay the bills in order to stay warm during the long  harsh winters     Senator Collins said      People are jeopardizing their health and safety in order to pay essential home energy bills   By adequately funding LIHEAP  we can offer assistance to millions of these families             Many low income seniors and working families entered this winter without heat or electricity due to unaffordable energy prices last year  and thousands of these families remain without heat   The President can help them now by release the remaining LIHEAP emergency funding     Reed stated      Also  we must be prepared for the cold weather and high energy costs next year and provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal year 2006   Families should not have to choose between paying their bills and buying food             Following is the text of the letter       The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation   s low income households   LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South   We are writing to request that the budget provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2006 and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2007   With  3 billion in regular funding and advance appropriations  LIHEAP can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability       For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans     spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills   Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil and propane prices continue to increase          Since 1981  the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown   This winter  LIHEAP will serve an estimated 5 million households   Yet  this is only about 15 percent of the 32 million households that are eligible for federal assistance   We recognize the difficult choices that you face in shaping the fiscal 2006 budget resolution  however  we believe that the continued growth in households eligible for LIHEAP assistance demonstrates that the need for this program has never been greater   The LIHEAP program remains seriously underfunded   The program needs at least  3 billion simply to equal the purchasing power it provided in 1982        Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing and food   The Boston Medical Center found that many poor children with chronic health conditions start to lose weight and suffer additional health problems associated with malnutrition in the winter because their families are spending less of their income on food and medicine and more on fuel bills   The National Energy Assistance Directors Association surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills   The survey found that in the last five years            38 percent of LIHEAP recipients went without medical or dental care            30 percent went without filling a prescription or taking the full dose of a prescribed medicine            28 percent did not make a rent or mortgage payment            22 percent went without food for at least one day  and           21 percent became sick because their home was too cold       We also request advance funding for LIHEAP   Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer   Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited Federal resources    It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait       Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to make sure that working families  seniors and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs                                                                                  Browse by
