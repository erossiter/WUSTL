                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator Collins recently chaired a hearing to examine the impact that juvenile diabetes has had on children and their families  the economic costs of caring for people with diabetes  and the promising breakthroughs in juvenile diabetes research that could lead to better treatments or a cure for the disease  Shortly before the hearing  Senator Collins met with children afflicted with Juvenile Diabetes  November 2  2007  U S  Senator Susan Collins has sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor HHS Appropriations requesting  69 157 000 for the Division of Diabetes Translation  DDT  at the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC      The Division of Diabetes Translation at the CDC is the primary government vehicle focusing on the prevention and management of diabetes  The Division translates medical research into practices and programs that can be used in local communities to help those at risk for diabetes prevent and delay the onset of the disease  Currently  the Division only has the resources to fund 28 of the 50 state diabetes prevention and control programs at a basic level  with an average grant of about  725 000  The remaining 22 states  including Maine  receive capacity building grants  with an average grant of about  270 000  just about a third the size     As the founder and Co Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus  I have learned a lot about this disease and the difficulties and heartbreak that it causes for so many American families  Diabetes is a life long condition that affects people of every age  race and nationality  It is the leading cause of kidney failure  blindness in adults  and amputations not related to injury  said Senator Collins  I strongly believe that increased funding for the Division of Diabetes Translation will allow more of those at risk for diabetes to delayand hopefully preventthe onset of this tragic disease     Senator Collins letter was cosigned by a bipartisan group of 12 senators     A Full Text of the Letter Follows     Dear Senator Harkin and Senator Specter     As you begin the conference on the FY 08 Labor  Health and Human Services  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  we write to ask that you provide  69 157 000 for the Division of Diabetes Translation  DDT  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   This is the level of funding that was included in the appropriations bill passed by the House of Representatives earlier this year     Diabetes is a costly and devastating disease  Nearly 21 million Americans are living with diabetes  and one in three American children born today will develop the disease  Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death by disease in the United States  It is also the leading cause of kidney failure  blindness in adults  and amputations not related to injury  Moreover  it is estimated that diabetes accounts for more than  132 billion of our nations annual health care costs and one out of every three Medicare dollars  Health care spending for people with diabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have diabetes     The Division of Diabetes Translation  DDT  at the CDC is the primary vehicle through which the federal government focuses on the prevention and management of diabetes  The DDT literally translates medical research  including research conducted at the National   Institutes of Health  into practices and programs that can be used in local communities to help those at risk for diabetes to prevent or delay the onset  as well as to assist people currently suffering from diabetes to access necessary resources to treat their disease  Unfortunately  however  the DDT currently only has the resources to fund 28 of the 50 state diabetes prevention and controls programs at a basic implementation level  with an average grant of about  725 000  The remaining 22 states receive capacity building grants  with an average grant of about  270 000  just about a third the size     We greatly appreciate that the Senate bill allows for an increase in funding for this program for the first time in three years  During that time  however  the prevalence of diabetes has increased by about 24 percent  We simply cannot afford to continue to underfund programs to prevent  detect  and treat this dreadful disease  Increased funding for HIV AIDS has decreased the death rate in this country from that terrible disease to approximately 17 000 last year  This is a wonderful example of what prevention linked with research can do to stave an epidemic  and we should do the same with diabetes     Thank you for your consideration  and again we urge the Conference Committee to fund the Division of Diabetes Translation at the higher House passed funding level of  69 157 000     Sincerely                                                                        Browse by
