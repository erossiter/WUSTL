                                      Bill Includes Sen  Collins    Provision to Tie Iraqi Reconstruction Dollars to Progress on Benchmarks May 16  2007 Washington  DC           In a vote that shows bipartisan and increasing support for legislation requiring the Iraqi government to meet certain of benchmarks of progress  a majority of the U S  Senate today voted in support of an amendment authored by Senators John Warner  R VA   and Susan Collins  R ME   The amendment requires the President to provide two progress reports to Congress  on July 15 and September 15 of this year  on whether the Iraqis are meeting a number of benchmarks essential to achieving political reconciliation in Iraq  The benchmarks include  requirement that the Iraqis increase the number of their security forces capable of operating independently  enactment and implementation of de Baathification legislation  enactment of constitutional and electoral reforms  and passage of legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of oil revenues     In addition  the amendment includes a provision authored by Senator Collins that would require the Iraqis to meet the benchmarks in order to receive reconstruction dollars from the U S  government  This is the first instance where the U S  Senate has gone on record supporting economic consequences if the Iraqis do not meet certain benchmarks     In a speech to the U S  Senate  Senator Collins said  It is important that there be consequences if the Iraqis do not meet these benchmarks  This amendment includes a provision I authored that conditions the release of reconstruction funds to progress made by the Iraqi government  If the Iraqis are not making progress  we should not continue to provide reconstruction funds    Senator Collins is also calling on Senate leaders to include the Warner Collins benchmark provisions when the Senate considers the Supplemental Appropriations bill  There is clearly a majority of support in the Senate for benchmarks  When the Senate considers the Iraq Supplemental Spending bill  it should include the benchmarks that are laid out in the Warner Collins amendment        Senator Collins also reiterated her view that if the Presidents strategy of deploying additional troops to Iraq  which she opposes  does not demonstrate significant results by September  then she believes that Congress should consider all options  including a redefinition of our mission in Iraq and a gradual  but significant withdrawal of our troops next year   A summary of the Warner Collins Amendment follows   The entire text of the amendment can be found on Senator Collins website  www collins senate gov    Conditions the U S  strategy in Iraq on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks they themselves have laid out  These benchmarks include increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units capable of operating independently  ensuring the rights of minority political parties in the Iraqi legislature are protected  enacting and implementing de Baathification legislation  and enacting constitutional and electoral reforms      Requirement that the Iraqis allocate and spend  10 billion in Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects  including delivery of essential services  on an equitable basis     Requires the President to submit an initial report on July 15  2007  assessing whether the Iraqis have made satisfactory progress towards meeting each of the benchmarks  If the Presidents assessment is that the Iraqis are making unsatisfactory progress  the President will include in the July report a description of how the U S  political  economic  regional  and military strategy in Iraq will be revised to achieve progress on the benchmarks    Requires the President to submit a second report to Congress on September 15  2007  further assessing whether the Iraqis are making progress on benchmarks  This report will be accompanied by testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee by General Petreaus    Conditions the release of economic funds to the Iraqis on their meeting the benchmarks  Our amendment would prohibit the release of funds from the Economic Support Fund  which provides U S  assistance for economic reconstruction projects  to the Iraqis unless and until the President of the U S  certifies in his July and September reports that the Iraqis are making progress on the benchmarks     Lays out a redeployment plan if the Iraqis decide within the context of their constitutional framework that they want U S  troops to leave Iraq    Full Text of

by Mr  Warner and Ms  Collins    TITLE __   PRESIDENTS STRATEGY IN IRAQ   SEC  1  Findings regarding progress in Iraq  the establishment of benchmarks to measure that progress  and reports to Congress    a  Congress makes the following findings    1  Over 145 000 American military personnel are currently serving in Iraq  like thousands of others since March 2003  with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces  and are deserving of the strong support of all Americans     2  Many American service personnel have lost their lives  and many more have been wounded in Iraq  the American people will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families     3  The United States Army and Marine Corps  including their Reserve components and National Guard organizations  together with components of the other branches of the military  are performing their missions while under enormous strain from multiple  extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan  These deployments  and those that will follow  will have a lasting impact on future recruiting  retention  and readiness of our nations all volunteer force    4  Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of sectarian and intra sectarian violence based upon political distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni and Shia populations     5  Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in order to achieve reconciliation  for there is no military solution  The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq     6  The responsibility for Iraq s internal security and halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign Government of Iraq     7  In December 2006  the bipartisan Iraq Study Group issued a valuable report  suggesting a comprehensive strategy that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region  and a change in the primary mission of U S  forces in Iraq  that will enable the United States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly   8  The President said on January 10  2007  that Ive made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraqs other leaders that Americas commitment is not open ended so as to dispel the contrary impression that exists   9  It is essential that

works to meet these benchmarks    10  As reported by Secretary of State Rice  Iraqs Policy Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of political  security  and economic benchmarks and an associated timeline in September 2006 that were  a  reaffirmed by Iraqs Presidency Council on October 6  2006   b  referenced by the Iraq Study Group  and  c  posted on the President of Iraqs website    11  On April 21  2007  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that our  American  commitment to Iraq is long term  but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women patrolling Iraqs streets open endedly and that progress in reconciliation will be an important element of our evaluation    12  The Presidents January 10  2007 address had three components  political  military  and economic  Given that significant time has passed since his statement  and recognizing the overall situation is ever changing  Congress must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its
