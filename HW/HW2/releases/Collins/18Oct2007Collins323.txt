                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Bill would substantially cut US greenhouse gas emissions  October 18  2007 Washington  DC      U S  Senator Susan Collins is an original cosponsor of legislation that would achieve substantial  long term cuts in U S  greenhouse gas emissions  The Americas Climate Security Act  ACSA  is authored by Senators Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  and John Warner  R VA     On its own  the America s Climate Security Act  ACSA  is projected to reduce total U S  greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 19  below the 2005 level  4  below the 1990 level  in 2020 and by as much as 63  below the 2005 level in 2050  This bill was presented as the core of a new federal program that Congress should pass to avert catastrophic global climate change while enhancing America s energy security      Climate change is one of the most daunting challenges we face and we must develop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  That is why I am pleased to be an original co sponsor of the Lieberman Warner America s Climate Security Act  This bipartisan bill presents a practical  economically sound approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from U S  electric power  transportation  and manufacturing sources by 70 percent over 2005 levels by 2050  said Senator Susan Collins     With all the irrefutable evidence we now have corroborating that climate change is real  dangerous  and proceeding faster than many scientists predicted  this is the year for Congress to move this critical legislation  said Lieberman  If we fail to start substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next couple of years  we risk bequeathing a diminished world to our grandchildren  Insect borne diseases such as malaria will spike as tropical ecosystems expand  hotter air will exacerbate the pollution that sends children to the hospital with asthma attacks  food insecurity from shifting agricultural zones will spark border wars  and storms and coastal flooding from sea level rise will cause mortality and dislocation      In my 28 years in the Senate  I have focused above all on issues of national security  and I see the problem of global climate change as fitting squarely within that focus  said Warner  Today we introduced a balanced bill  Senator Lieberman and I found a good  sound  starting point that sends a significant signal that the U S  is serious about taking a leadership role in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions     In July 2007  The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  found that if the U S  achieves emissions reductions of the magnitude mandated by ACSA  then   making conservative assumptions about the pace of emissions reductions in the rest of the world   the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will remain below 500 parts per million  ppm  at the end of this century  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  keeping the concentration below 500 ppm will avoid a high risk of global warming that would cause severe impacts      America s Climate Security Act controls compliance costs by allowing companies to trade  save  and borrow emission allowances  and by allowing them to generate credits when they induce non covered businesses  farms  and others to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions or capture and store greenhouse gases      The Act invests set aside emissions credits and money raised by the auction of such allowances in advancing several important public policies  including  but not limited to      Deploying advanced technologies and practices for reducing emissions      Protecting low  and middle income Americans from higher energy costs      Keeping good jobs in the United States  and     Mitigating the negative impacts of any unavoidable global warming on low  and middle income Americans and wildlife      Several key environmental groups  companies  and other organizations  including the National Wildlife Federation  Environmental Defense and the National Resources Defense Council  have expressed support for ACSA      Larry Schweiger  President and CEO  National Wildlife Federation     This is a bipartisan breakthrough on global warming that takes us a giant step closer to a historic vote in the United States Senate  I commend Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner for drafting a strong bill to protect wildlife from global warming      John Rowe  Chairman and CEO  Exelon Corporation     As an early and vocal advocate for climate change legislation  Exelon applauds the bipartisan leadership of Senators Lieberman and Warner to introduce a bill that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address global warming as soon as possible  The legislation represents another important step towards developing the bipartisan consensus necessary to enact legislation this Congress  We are especially pleased that the bill recognizes the need to protect electricity consumers by allocating part of the allowances to local utilities for the benefit of their customers      Steve Cochran  National Climate Campaign Director  Environmental Defense     Lieberman and Warner have paved the way for a historic committee vote on a bill that promises to make great strides toward climate security and economic growth  Thanks to their thoughtful approach we re moving beyond talk and quickly toward action      Steven Kline  Vice President for Corporate Environmental and Federal Affairs  PGE Corp     We believe America s Climate Security Act provides a solid starting point for constructively advancing a comprehensive  national response to and policy on climate change  Senators Lieberman and Warner have developed a thoughtful proposal that recognizes the urgent need for action by designing a program to achieve significant emission reductions from all sectors of the economy  The bill includes provisions that prioritize energy efficiency and technology development and deployment  as well as innovative ideas to protect electricity consumers  manage overall program costs  and provide states with the resources to help address the unique needs of their communities and citizens as we transition to a low carbon economy and adapt to a changing environment  America s Climate Security Act takes significant steps toward recognizing that a national program must balance the economic  technology  and environmental challenges of combating climate change      Frances Beinecke  President  Natural Resources Defense Council     The introduction and planned markup of America s Climate Security Act by Senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner represents an important step forward in the overdue process to enact comprehensive  mandatory global warming legislation  Committee consideration of this legislation will help move us toward the substantial reductions in global warming pollution we need to protect our climate  The bill also recognizes the need to direct proceeds from the pollution allowance market to important policy objectives  including promoting clean energy solutions  protecting the poor and other consumers  ensuring a just transition for workers in affected industries  and preventing impacts abroad that lead to conflicts and threats to security      The Members of the Association of Fish  Wildlife Agencies     Our organizations  representing millions of American sportsmen and sportswomen  thank you again for working with us to help address the challenge of climate change by both reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and providing important new resources to assist fish and wildlife survive in the face of this unprecedented challenge    In addition to Senator Collins  Senators Norm Coleman  R MN   Tom Harkin  D IA   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Benjamin Cardin  D MD   and Amy Klobuchar  D MN  are original
