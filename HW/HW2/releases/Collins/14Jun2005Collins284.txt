                                      June 14  2005  WASHINGTON  D C      With the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission having barely begun its work reviewing the Pentagon   s BRAC recommendations  Maine and New Hampshire   s congressional delegations are working to make sure the Department of Defense  DoD  does not attempt to get a head start on implementing its recommendations or prevent any member of the armed forces or civilian employee from testifying before the Commission  In a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and New Hampshire Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu asked for his assurance that DoD not preemptively identify or carry out any permanent transfer of activities or personnel from any installation identified by the Department for possible closure or realignment prior to Congressional consideration of the final list  The Senators also called on Secretary Rumsfeld to permit any member of the Armed Forces to freely testify before the Commission as to the military value of any military installation  and asked that no member of the Armed Forces who does so be punished in any way      The Department of Defense should under no circumstances begin to take action on closing and realigning bases across the country before the BRAC process has come to an end     said the Senators in a joint statement     Also  in order to ensure that the BRAC Commissioners receive all the information they need to make their decisions  all members of the Armed Services or civilian employees should be free to provide any and all information requested by the Commission without fear of reprisal                       Following is the full text of the letter       Dear Mr  Secretary                  As you know  we are currently reviewing the information supporting your recommendations to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  and we will be presenting information to the Commission in connection with installations in our states that we believe have mistakenly been included in your proposed list for closure or realignment                   In connection with that effort  we request your assurance that there will be no effort by the Department of Defense to preemptively identify or carry out any permanent transfer of activities or personnel from any installation identified by the Department for possible closure or realignment prior to Congressional consideration of the final list of BRAC recommendations  except for reasons of national security or a military emergency  as required by Section 2909 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act                  To enable the BRAC Commission to obtain authoritative information regarding decisions on military value taken by the Department in connection with its recommendations  we request that you permit any member of the Armed Forces to freely answer questions and or provide to the Commission testimony as to the military value of any military installation for purposes of the Commission   s consideration of the Secretary   s recommendations  Further  we seek your assurance that no member of the Armed Forces may be discharged  demoted  suspended  threatened  harassed  or in any other manner discriminated against because such member provided  caused to be provided  or is about to provide testimony or other information to the Commission  Finally  we ask that these same assurances be provided with respect to civilian employees at military installations                  Thank you for your attention to this matter                                                                                     Browse by
