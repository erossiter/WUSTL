                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               April 6  2007 Washington  DC      American Forest  Paper Association  AFPA  has announced its support for Senator Susan Collins legislation that will help Maine manufacturing companies fight unfair trade competition from overseas  AFPA says it will work with Senator Collins to encourage Congress to enact the Stopping Overseas Subsidies  SOS  Act  which will give the U S  government the legal strength to enforce fair trade laws against all countries that export goods into the U S  It would revise current trade laws to ensure that all countries doing business with the U S  are operating under the same rules that help to ensure fair competition for American manufacturers    I am pleased to receive the support of AFPA in our efforts to fight unfair trade practices that are hurting American workers and closing American companies  said Senator Collins  Unfair market conditions cannot continue to cause our manufacturers to hemorrhage jobs  No state understands this more than my home state of Maine  According to the United States Department of Labor  10 400 manufacturing jobs in Maine have been lost since 2001  a 14 8 percent decline    The Department of Commerce has recently accepted the first anti subsidy duty petition against a non market economy since the mid 1980s  The case was filed against China by New Page Corporation  a coated free sheet paper company with operations in Maine  Ohio  and Maryland  Despite its efficient  state of the art mills  skilled and dedicated employees  strong relationships with customers  strategically located mills and distribution facilities and growing markets for its products  New Page had to shut down an entire paper line as a result of unfair foreign competition  On Friday March 30  2007  the Department of Commerce announced it would impose anti subsidy duties against China in the New Page case  New Page is a member of the American Forest and Paper Association  which praised the decision   The legislation introduced by Senators Collins has received the support of numerous other national manufacturing organizations and manufacturing businesses in Maine  including the Maine Forest Products Council  Maine Wood Products Association  and the NewPage Corporation   The SOS Act will allow the United States to fully enforce its antisubsidy laws  including against nonmarket economies such as China  According to a 2005 study by the American Forest and Paper Association  China is using an array of subsidies to promote the development of timber and pulp production in China  These include government loans and loan subsidies for technology renovation  promotion of foreign investment in state owned enterprises  and   Page 1 of 2    Page 2 of 2    protection of debt ridden state owned enterprises that maintain excess or idle production capacity through local government soft loans and loan forgiveness   The following is the text of AFPAs letter of support for Senator Collins legislation   On behalf of the American Forest  Paper Association  AFPA   please allow me to express our support for the overall objective of S  974  the Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act  As in the past  AFPA and our member companies support the extension of the U S  countervailing duty  CVD  law to imports from non market economies  including China   AFPA is the national trade association of the forest  pulp  paper  paperboard  and wood products industry  The industry accounts for approximately 6 percent of the total U S  manufacturing output  employs more than a million people  and ranks among the top 10 manufacturing employers in 42 states with an estimated payroll exceeding  50 billion  Our industry faces significant international competitiveness challenges  including subsidized imports  and  therefore  supports your legislation as a means of leveling the playing field   AFPA and its members have supported free and fair trade policies consistently  including the extension of permanent normal trade relations with China  However  the Chinese government in recent years has provided a wide range of subsidies  including export subsidies  large grants  low interest loans  input subsidies  and the like to encourage the development and global competitiveness of favored industries  including the forest products industry  These subsidies provide Chinese exporters with an unfair  competitive advantage and significantly fuel China s growing trade surplus with the United States  which reached  232 billion in 2006   To address these concerns  we support your legislation and agree that the U S  Department of Commerce should not continue to exempt China from coverage under one of the most important trade laws  the countervailing duty law  which off sets subsidy practices by U S  trading partners  There is no reason  in light of WTO rules or U S  law  for Commerce to continue to exempt China from coverage under the U S  countervailing duty law  Applying the CVD law to China  which subsidizes its industries heavily  would alleviate some of the economic harm caused to U S  manufacturers   The U S  forest products industry can compete successfully against anyone in the global marketplace if the playing field is level  We have plentiful fiber resources  a skilled labor force  and access to capital markets  However  when foreign governments provide direct and indirect subsidies to our competitors the playing field is tilted against our industry  with potentially severe economic and financial consequences to our companies and workers   Your legislation will apply the U S  countervailing duty law correctly to China and other non market economies  As we have in previous Congresses  AFPA is pleased to support the objectives of S  974 and we offer to work with you and other stakeholders to ensure that the language of the bill is compliant with WTO rules  We look forward to working with you to enact this legislation so that the domestic forest and paper industry can compete on a level playing field within the global marketplace      Regards   Juanita D  Duggan  President and Chief Executive Officer
