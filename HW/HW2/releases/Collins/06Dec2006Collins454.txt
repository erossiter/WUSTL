                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Collins Weekly Column December 6  2006   As we look forward to the 110th Congress  one of my top priorities is to   expand access to affordable health care for all Americans  There are still   far too many Americans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate   coverage  As many as 46 million Americans are uninsured  and millions more   are underinsured     Health care coverage matters  The simple fact is that people with health   insurance are healthier than those who are uninsured  People without health   insurance are less likely to seek care when they need it  and to forgo   services such as periodic check ups and preventive services  As a consequence    they are more likely to be hospitalized or require costly medical attention   for conditions that could have been prevented or treated at a curable stage     Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis  with   insurance premiums rising at alarming rates  Whether I am talking to a self   employed fisherman  a displaced worker  the owner of a struggling small   business  or the human resource manager of a large company  the soaring cost   of health insurance is a common concern     These cost increases have been particularly burdensome for small   businesses  the backbone of Maines economy  Maine small business owners want   to provide coverage for their employees  but they are caught in a cost   squeeze  They know that if they pass on premium increases to their employees    more of them will decline coverage  Yet these small businesses simply cannot   afford to absorb double digit increases in their health insurance premiums   year after year     The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and   families who must purchase health insurance on their own  Monthly health   insurance premiums in Maine often exceed a familys mortgage payment    Clearly  we must do more to make our health care system more efficient and   health insurance more available and affordable     I have joined my colleague from Louisiana  Senator Mary Landrieu  in   introducing bipartisan legislation  the Access to Affordable Health Care Act    which combines a variety of public and private approaches to make quality   health care coverage more affordable and available     Since most Americans get their health insurance through the workplace  it   is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed    The fact is  however  that as many as 83 percent of Americans who do not have   health insurance are in a family with a worker     Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small businesses    In fact  some 63 percent of uninsured workers either work for a small firm or   are self employed  Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health   insurance than larger firms  which makes them less likely to offer coverage    The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will help these employers cope with   rising costs by creating new tax credits for small businesses to make health   insurance more affordable  It will also provide grants to help businesses   form group purchasing cooperatives  These cooperatives will enable small   businesses to band together to purchase health insurance jointly  This will   help to reduce their costs and improve the quality of their employees health   care     The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will also expand access to   affordable health care for individuals and families  One of the first bills   that I sponsored when I came to the Senate was legislation to establish the   State Child Health Insurance Program  which provides insurance for the   children of low income parents who cannot afford health insurance  yet make   too much money to qualify for Medicaid  Since 1997  this program  which is   known as SCHIP  has contributed to a one third decline in the uninsured rate   of low income children  Today  more than six million children  including   approximately 14 500 in Maine  receive health care coverage through this   remarkably effective health care program     Our legislation builds on the success of this program and gives States a   number of new tools to increase participation  States would have the option   of covering the parents of the children who are enrolled in programs like   MaineCare  States could also use funds provided through this program to help   eligible working families pay their share of an employer based health plan    In short  the legislation will help ensure that the entire family receives the   health care they need     Our legislation also strengthens the health care safety net by increasing   funding for Community Health Centers  which provide critical primary care   services to millions of Americans  regardless of their ability to pay  And    it addresses inequities in the Medicare system that have hurt rural states   like Maine     Finally  health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health  As   noted authority and physician Dr  Michael Crichton has observed  The future   of medicine lies not in treating illness  but preventing it  Many of our   most serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy behaviors    smoking  lack of exercise  and poor diet  These three major risk factors   alone have made Maine the state with the fourth highest death rate due to four   largely preventable diseases  cardiovascular disease  cancer  chronic lung   disease and diabetes  These four chronic diseases are responsible for 70   percent of the health care problems in our state     The Access to Affordable Health Care Act therefore contains a number of   provisions designed to promote healthy lifestyles  An ever expanding body of   evidence shows that these kinds of investments in health promotion and   prevention offer returns not only in reduced health care bills  but in longer   life and increased productivity  The legislation provides grants to States to   assist small businesses with worksite wellness programs for their employees    It also authorizes a grant program to support new and existing community   partnerships such as the Healthy Community Coalition in Franklin County  to   promote healthy lifestyles among hospitals  employers  schools and community   organizations     The Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for reform   based on principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority in Congress   could agree  The plan takes significant strides toward the goal of universal   health care coverage by strengthening the health care safety net and by   bringing millions more Americans into the health insurance system
