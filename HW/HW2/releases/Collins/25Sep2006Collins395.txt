                                      September 25  2006 Washington  D C   Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and Senator Russ Feingold  D WI  sent the following letter today to the Senate Finance Committee Chairman and Ranking Member  urging them to prevent Medicare payment cuts to home health and hospice agencies that could put millions of our most vulnerable population at risk   The full text of the letter is included below    September 22  2006   The Honorable Charles Grassley  Chairman The Honorable Max Baucus  Ranking Member Senate Committee on Finance 219 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington  D C  20510  Dear Senators Grassley and Baucus   Home health and hospice have become increasingly important parts of our health care system  The kinds of highly skilled and often technically complex services that our nations home health and hospice agencies provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older persons to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be  in the comfort and security of their own homes  We therefore urge you to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to important home health and hospice services by supporting a full market basket inflation adjustment beginning January 1  2007   The Administrations FY 2007 budget includes a proposal to freeze the Medicare home health market basket index for the second straight year  calendar year 2007   with subsequent market basket reductions of 0 4 percent in 2008 and 2009  This would result in a  3 5 billion cut in home health payments over five years  The Administration also proposes to cut the market basket updates for hospice by 0 4 percent in 2007  2008 and 2009  reducing hospice payments by  550 million over five years    These cuts would come on top of ten years of substantial reductions in Medicare home health spending  Provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  BBA  resulted in a 50 percent cut in Medicare home health spending by 2001  far more than Congress intended or the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  projected  Home health as a share of Medicare spending has dropped from 8 7 percent in 1997 to 3 8 percent today  and is projected to decline to 2 6 percent of Medicare spending by 2015    We believe that further reducing payments for home health care would be counterproductive to controlling overall health care costs  Home care has been demonstrated to be a cost effective alternative to institutional care in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs  In fact  the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  MedPAC  recently noted the results of a 2002 RAND study which showed that in terms of Part A costs  episodes in an inpatient rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility are much more costly for Medicare than episodes of care among patients going home   MedPACs June 2005 Report to Congress     Further reducing Medicare home health care expenditures would also be in direct conflict with the Administrations desire to prioritize health care in the home as a cost effective alternative to institutional care  During the World Health Congress in February of last year  Secretary Leavitt said  Providing the care that lets people live at home if they want is less expensive than providing nursing home care  It frees up resources that can help other people  And obviously  many people are happier living at home    Given home health agencies rising transportation costs  the use of new and more costly technology and telehealth  and ever increasing costs for skilled nurses and therapists  a home health payment freeze in 2007 would place the quality of home health services and the home care delivery system itself at significant risk  It would also exacerbate the already serious problem of recruiting and retaining registered nurses  therapists and home health aides and could leave home health providers no alternative but to reduce the number of visits and or patient admissions  which would ultimately affect access to care and clinical outcomes  In addition to these costs  hospices are also experiencing rising costs for pain management pharmaceuticals  and finding that patients with shorter lengths of stay are requiring more intensive services    In order to ensure that home health care and hospice remain a viable option for Medicare patients  we urge you to stand by the current position in the Senate passed budget resolution when the Committee considers issues related to the Medicare program and reject any efforts to reduce the market basket inflation update for home health and hospice benefit payment rates  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter      Sincerely    Susan Collins Russ Feingold
