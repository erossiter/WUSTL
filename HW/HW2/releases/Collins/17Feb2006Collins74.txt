                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               February 17  2006 WASHINGTON  DC  Senator Susan Collins  R ME  has introduced legislation in the Senate to help provide transportation to senior citizens and the blind  The Older Americans Sustainable Mobility Act would establish a demonstration project to develop a national network of transportation providers that would help older Americans and people who are blind who may struggle with or not have the ability to drive  The measure would help give freedom and independence to seniors and the blind in order to go about their daily lives    The following is the statement that Senator Collins gave on the Senate floor when she introduced the bill last night   All around the Nation  older Americans are struggling to stay active and independent while their ability to drive themselves declines  A few live in communities with well developed public transportation services geared to our senior citizens  but most do not  Many seniors drive as long as they can  perhaps longer than they think they should  simply because they feel they have no alternative    That is why I am today introducing the Older Americans Sustainable Mobility Act of 2006  Despite its rather awkward name  this legislation has a great purpose  It would create a 5 year demonstration project  overseen by the Administration on Aging  to establish a national  nonprofit senior transportation network to help provide some transportation alternatives to our aging population  The goal of this network is to build upon creative  successful models that are already showing how the transportation needs of older Americans can be met in a manner that is economically sustainable    This last point is important  Senior transportation is a complex and expensive logistical problem  We cannot expect to address this problem by creating a brand new  expansive  Federal Government program that requires the commitment of vast sums year after year in order to succeed  We can t afford that  and that really isn t what older Americans want    What older Americans want is what most of us have and take for granted  the freedom and mobility that our automobiles provide    My legislation would build upon models that have demonstrated how senior citizens can stay active and mobile even after they stop driving  One such model is ITNAmerica  which has been operating in my home State of Maine since the mid 1990s and has since branched out to communities across the Nation  ITNAmerica uses private automobiles to provide rides to senior citizens whenever they want  almost like a taxi service  Riders open an account which is automatically charged when the service is used  Riders can get credits for rides through volunteer services  through donations  and this is what I think is most intriguing  by donating their private car to the program after they have decided that they should no longer drive    Kathy Freund  the founder of ITNAmerica  sees this as a way of taking something people see as a liability  and turning it into an asset  Through Kathy s extraordinary vision and hard work  ITNAmerica has developed a model that works because it allows older Americans to make the transition away from driving themselves without asking them to sacrifice their independence  or to learn at an older age how to navigate public transportation systems that may simply be inappropriate for their needs  or widely unavailable in many parts of the country  They can still be mobile  they can still go where they want and when they want  and they can go by car    Senior citizens will often keep their vehicles long after they have stopped driving  I am sure you have seen these vehicles in your State as I have in mine  You will see them sitting in driveways  unattended and poorly maintained  sometimes not driven for many months at a time  In this form  these cars are   wasting   assets  But ITNAmerica has found that the value of these cars can be unlocked by allowing seniors to exchange them for rides  That is why my bill calls for the creation of a once in a lifetime tax benefit for seniors who exchange their cars for rides  valued at the amount of the ride credit they are provided    One of my senior citizen constituents  June Snow from Falmouth  ME  has been using the system that I described  the ITNAmerica system  since 1995  when her eyesight began to fail  At first  she used the program only to get into the city  Portland  and only after dark  when she found it more difficult to drive  But more recently she has traded her car for rides  and now she depends on the system to go everywhere she needs to go  She finds that the program allows her to get around town  to run errands  and do the things she has to do and wants to do without worrying about whether she will be able to get safely from one place to another  She told me  It s not like riding a bus  where you have to work with their schedules  and they won t stop and help you with your groceries  They won t make you get your feet wet walking through the snow to the bus stop    But what she loves most is the personal attention she gets from the drivers  most of whom are volunteers  They help you to the door  and they even carry your bundles and put them in the trunk  she says    My bill also creates a limited time matching grant program to help communities establish sustainable transportation alternatives for seniors as part of a national network  Programs that wish to compete for these matching grants must be able to show that they can become self sustaining after 5 years  and that they can operate after that period without reliance on public funds  So what I am proposing  is that we just provide some seed money as a catalyst  to get these programs going  with the full expectation  indeed the requirement  that they become self sustaining without any public funds after the initial period  My bill also provides smaller grants to help transportation providers acquire the technology they need to connect to this network  and grants to encourage efforts to get the baby boomers more involved in supporting transportation alternatives in their communities  The total cost of these grant programs would be only  25 million over the full 5 year period  Then the program sunsets  and these wonderful transportation programs that would be created all over the country would be sustainable on their own without public funding    The challenge of providing transportation alternatives to our Nation s senior citizens is literally growing by the day  The bill I am offering is one step toward a reasonable  practical  solution to this important challenge  I think all of us know of neighbors and family members who reach their senior years and really shouldn t be driving anymore but are very reluctant to give up those car keys because there are simply no workable alternatives for them  This bill would provide those alternatives  and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation                                                                        Browse by
