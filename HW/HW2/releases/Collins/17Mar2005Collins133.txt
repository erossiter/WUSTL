                                      March 17  2005  Washington  D C         Senate Friends of Ireland     Senators Susan Collins  Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Christopher Dodd  D CT  have released an annual St  Patrick   s Day statement supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland            St  Patrick   s Day is a great opportunity for all Irish Americans to celebrate the rich tradition of their Irish culture     Senator Collins said      It is also a time to address the need for peace and justice in Northern Ireland  which can be achieved through full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement            Following is the text of the Senators    statement       The Friends of Ireland in the Congress join 38 million Irish Americans in celebrating the unique ties between America and the island of Ireland    We welcome the Taoiseach  Bertie Ahern  to the United States  and we send our warmest greetings to all the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland        Irish Americans care deeply about Northern Ireland  and we commend President Bush for his efforts to keep the American government involved in the pursuit of peace       In 1998  the parties to the Good Friday Agreement committed to    partnership  equality and mutual respect as the basis    for moving forward   We continue to believe that inclusive power sharing    based on those three defining qualities     is essential to the viability and advancement of the democratic process in Northern Ireland           A political system based on inclusive power sharing requires trust and confidence   The parties to the Good Friday Agreement also affirmed their    total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means              The allegations of IRA responsibility for the bank robbery in Belfast in Northern Ireland last December have seriously undermined the trust and confidence that are essential to advance the process   The January murder of Robert McCartney by members of the IRA     and the subsequent IRA call  for vigilante justice    has further undermined that trust          Robbery and murder are despicable acts of criminality  and we condemn them and their perpetrators in the strongest possible terms   We deplore the tragic setback they have caused for the peace process in Northern Ireland       Sinn Fein is at an historic crossroads   It cannot be a fully functioning democratic party with the albatross of the IRA around its neck  There is no place for paramilitary and criminal activity in a democratic party   As the only significant elected party with a paramilitary wing in Northern Ireland  Sinn Fein has a unique responsibility to take the gun and criminality out of politics once and for all    To this end  we look forward to completion of decommissioning by the IRA and to an announcement that the IRA will cease to exist as a paramilitary organization and to Sinn Fein working cooperatively with the Police Service of Northern Ireland   It has been seven years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed  and the time for these decisive and final acts is long over due        Clearly  there is essential work to be done in ending all paramilitary activity  permanently restoring the democratic institutions  progressing with demilitarization  and advancing an equality agenda   But without dramatic action for peace by the IRA  we fail to see how progress can be made        Since the Democratic Unionist Party became the majority Unionist party in Northern Ireland  it has often been unclear as to whether it would be willing to share power with Sinn Fein under any circumstances   Statements by DUP members have often been conflicting on this key issue  as have statements on their acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement   It is important that the DUP share power with Sinn Fein and all parties  and commit itself to working in a Northern Ireland Assembly that embraces the Good Friday Agreement and works cooperatively for all the people of Northern Ireland        We commend the Irish and British Governments for their ongoing efforts to work with the political leaders in Northern Ireland to restore the trust and confidence that are essential to advance the peace  On this St  Patrick  s Day  we look forward to the day when the Good Friday Agreement will be finally and fully implemented  and to the day when stable democratic institutions  peace  and justice will be achieved in Northern Ireland            SENATE FRIENDS OF IRELAND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE      Edward M  Kennedy  Christopher J  Dodd   Susan M
