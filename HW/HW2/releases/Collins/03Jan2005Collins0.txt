                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               January 3  2005  Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins  along with Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin  are requesting that President Bush include funding for the Collins Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act in his fiscal year 2006 budget  The Collins Feingold legislation was signed into law in 2002 and provides grants for rural communities to improve access to dental health care to help address the shortage of dentists in underserved areas of our nation  In a letter to the President  the Senators requested that at least  10 million be included for this program in the FY 2006 budget request          Too many people across Maine and the country lack access to dental care     Senator Collins said     The Collins Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act will make oral health care services more accessible in our nation   s rural and underserved communities  but it is crucial that funding be put in place to make this program work  Dental care is an integral part of overall health care     said Senator Collins       Senator Collins introduced this legislation to address the serious shortage of dentists in rural communities   In Aroostook Country there is only one dentist for every 5 500 people           The text of the letter is as follows       Dear Mr  President          The Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2002 included the Collins Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act  which is intended to improve access to oral health care by strengthening the dental workforce in our nation   s rural and underserved communities   The legislation authorizes  50 million through FY 2006 for grants to States to help them develop innovative dental workforce development programs specific to their individual needs  and we are writing to request that you include at least  10 million for this program in your FY 2006 budget request        While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last 50 years  these improvements have not occurred evenly across all sectors of our population  particularly among low income individuals and families   Too many Americans today lack access to dental care   While there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delay the progression of dental health problems  an estimated 25 million Americans live in areas lacking adequate dental services   As a consequence  these effective treatment and prevention programs are not being implemented in many of our communities   Astoundingly  as many as eleven percent of our nation   s rural population has never been to the dentist        This situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce is graying   More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will retire in the next ten years and the number of dental graduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees   As a consequence  many states are facing a serious shortage of dentists  particularly in rural areas         The Dental Health Improvement Act authorized a new State grant program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services that is designed to improve access to oral health services in rural and underserved areas   States could use these grants to fund a wide variety of programs   For example  they could use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment programs for dentists practicing in underserved areas   They could also use the grant funds to establish or expand community or school based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental clinics    To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts  States could use the funds for placement and support of dental students  residents  and advanced dentistry trainees   Or  they could use the grant funds for continuing dental education  through distance based education  and practice support through teledentistry        This program will help make oral health care services more accessible in our nation   s rural and underserved communities  and we therefore urge you to include at least  10 million for this critically important program in your FY 2006 budget request        Thank you for your consideration of our request  and we look forward to working with you                                                                                     Browse by
