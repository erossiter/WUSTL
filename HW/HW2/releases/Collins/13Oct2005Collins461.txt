                                     New Government Report Reinforces Need for the Critical Program October 13  2005  WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe and Susan Collins are encouraging the Bush Administration to seek more funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  following the release of a government report today reinforcing the need for the program  Senators Snowe and Collins joined Senators John Kerry  D MA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Jack Reed  D RI  in a letter to Administration officials calling for an additional  3 1 billion for LIHEAP funding this winter         According to a report that was released today by the Energy Information Administration  American families will face significant price increases in home heating costs this winter   Households with natural gas heat   55 percent of all households nationwide   are expected to spend about 48 percent more this winter in fuel expenditures   Households in the Northeast   where 30 percent of households use heating oil as their primary heating fuel  are projected to pay about 30 percent more in heating costs             This report reaffirms that the LIHEAP program is as critical as ever for low income families and seniors     said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement      With prices of heating oil expected to reach  3 a gallon  we must provide adequate funding for an essential program that serves as a lifeline to some of our must vulnerable citizens  It is our hope that this report provides an added impetus for making sure that the 78 percent of Mainers who use home heating oil to make it through our long  cold winters are able to afford to heat their homes this year            They called on the Bush Administration to support  3 1 billion in additional LIHEAP funding so that families in New England and across the country do not have to choose between the necessities of life and keeping warm this winter         Below is the text of the letter         October 12  2005      Secretary Mike Leavitt  The U S  Department of Health and Human Services      Director Joshua B  Bolten   The Office of Management and Budget       Dear Secretary Leavitt and Director Bolten       Today the Energy Information Administration  EIA  released its Short Term Energy Outlook  The report shows that families     particularly low income families and seniors     are facing an increasingly more expensive heating season  According to the EIA  this winter  residential space heating expenditures are projected to increase for all fuel types compared to last year  On average  households heating primarily with natural gas are expected to spend about  350  48 percent  more this winter in fuel expenditures  Households heating primarily with heating oil are expected to pay  378  32 percent  more this winter  Households heating primarily with propane can expect to pay  325  30 percent  more this winter  If our weather is colder than usual  expenditures will be significantly higher       Just last week  50 Senators from across the country and across political parties joined together to support  3 1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    That  3 1 billion in emergency funding coupled with the President   s budget request of  2 billion would bring LIHEAP funding to its fully authorized level   The amendment had broad support from state energy officials who have made clear that additional funding is urgently needed  Unfortunately  due to a procedural maneuver  the amendment failed        The State Energy Directors released a survey about the difficult choices that LIHEAP households make when they face unaffordable energy bills   Seventy three percent of the households surveyed reported that they cut back on and even go without other necessities  like food  prescription drugs  rent  or mortgage payments  One in five LIHEAP households reported that they went without food for at least one day over the last five years because of unaffordable energy bills   Twenty four percent used their stove or oven to provide heat  The Mortgage Bankers Association expects steep energy costs to increase the number of missed payments and lost homes beginning later this year         To date  the Administration has indicated that it does not intend to seek additional funding for LIHEAP  As today   s report from the EIA points out  the warning has been issued   We can all foretell the next disaster facing American families   What will we do to protect Americans from this upcoming energy storm   We believe the answer is to provide  5 1 billion in LIHEAP assistance and we hope that you will work with us to secure this funding            Sincerely   Senator John Kerry  Senator Olympia Snowe   Senator Edward Kennedy   Senator Jack Reed   Senator Susan Collins                                                                             Browse by
