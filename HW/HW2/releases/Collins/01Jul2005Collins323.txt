 This funding will be used to complete the dredging at the Narraguagus River   The Army Corps has completed the dredging of the lower portion of the entrance channel   The Narraguagus River must be dredged in order to maintain its function as a viable navigation channel   The project is vital to the economy of Washington and Hancock Counties   The present channel depth is presenting a hazard to navigation and has forced most of the fishing vessels to relocate to deepwater areas in order to obtain adequate clearance  Without the maintenance dredging  these conditions are expected to become more critical           Portland Harbor   520 000       This funding supports needed dredge work for Portland Harbor   The Army Corps of Engineers has determined that this amount is necessary in order to ensure the continued safety of the Harbor for commercial and recreational vessels           Searsport Harbor    250 000       This funding will be used for general investigations for the Army Corps of Engineers at Searsport Harbor           Saco River and Camp Ellis Beach     150 000        This funding will be used to protect the beaches of Camp Ellis adjacent to the Army Corps jetty in Saco  Maine  The U S  Army Corps of Engineers  ACOE  has indicated that this amount is necessary to complete plans and specifications  Studies have shown that the Army Corps jetty  built over 100 years ago  has contributed to beach erosion and the loss of more than thirty houses to the sea  The houses currently in danger were once six rows back from the water            Penobscot River Reconaissance Project      100 000       This funding will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to initiate and complete a reconnaissance study  and initiate a feasibility study of measures to restore anadromous

State of Maine  the Penobscot Partners  a coalition including the Atlantic Salmon Federation  the Penobscot Indian Nation  the Natural Resources Council of Maine  Maine Audubon  American Rivers and Trout Unlimited   and PPL Corporation announced an historic agreement to restore the once magnificent migratory fisheries on the Penobscot River while also providing the opportunity to maintain more than 90 percent of current energy generation        The agreement calls for the purchase and removal of two dams closest to the sea  the purchase  decommissioning and proposed bypass  or removal if necessary  of a third dam  and improved fish passage at four other dams   Successfully implemented  the project will restore large free flowing sections of the river for the benefit of improved water quality  ecological diversity and the re establishment of critical connections between the ocean  the river  and basin            Bass Harbor  Tremont     95 000        This funding would be used to complete plans and specifications for the channel and anchorage expansion project at Bass Harbor            Carvers Harbor   270 000       This funding will be used on dredge work for Carvers Harbor
