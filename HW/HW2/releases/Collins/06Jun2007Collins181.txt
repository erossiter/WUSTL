                                     Senate to Consider Energy Legislation as Early as Next Week  June 6  2007 Washington  DC        Senator Susan Collins was joined today by Senator Joe Lieberman in introducing legislation that represents one of the most comprehensive approaches ever to address our nations energy conservation issues  while working to protect our environment  The Collins Lieberman Energy Independence  Clean Air and Climate Security Act  would provide an integrated approach to reducing Americas dependence on foreign oil  clean our air  and address climate change  all of which affect each other  The bill also helps protect American jobs by not providing a competitive edge to high energy consuming nations like China  The Senate is slated to consider energy legislation as early as next week     In a speech to the U S  Senate  Senator Collins said  This legislation takes an integrated approach that is much needed and long overdue if we are to address the inseparable issues that are crucial to our nations economy  security  and to the health of our people and planet    Senator Collins further said  The choice is not between hobbling our nations economy and protecting our environment  This legislation is based upon the principle that the research  development  and implementation of new approaches to energy independence and environmental stewardship will provide a powerful new stimulus for our economy  All too often  we are confronted with proposals to address one issue that only aggravates the other  The integrated approach in this legislation will help us break through that impasse    Specifically  the Collins Lieberman legislation aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions by implementing new standards for the transportation and electricity sectors of the economy  which together account for 73 percent of greenhouse gas emissions  It would enable the U S  to reduce its dependence on foreign oil while also addressing climate change  it would reduce power plant emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020  it would immediately implement CAF standards for automobiles  and the standards set forth in the bill would apply to all products sold in the U S  regardless of where they are manufactured  thereby protecting American jobs by not providing competitive advantages to other nations     Senator Collins explained that the legislation incorporates key provisions of other important legislation before the Senate  such as other CAF standards bills  the Clean Power Act  and the Advanced Clean Fuels Act  all of which Senator Collins has cosponsored     Americans deserve to breathe clean air  pay reasonable gas and electric prices  live in a world with a stable climate future  and have the peace of mind that comes with secure energy supplies  The Collins Lieberman Energy Independence  Clean Air  and Climate Security Act offers a comprehensive  integrated approach to these issues    A summary of the major provisions of the legislation is as follows    Authorizes  60 million for abrupt climate change research     Increases fuel economy standards to automobiles to 35 miles per gallon by 2019 and 45 miles per gallon by 2030  while closing the SUV loophole      Indefinitely extend the tax credit  of up to  3 400  for consumers to purchase hybrid and lean burn passenger vehicle to help consumers afford more fuel efficient cars      Promote the use of public transportation by subsidizing fares  encouraging companies to    subsidize fares  and authorizing funding to build energy efficient and environmentally  friendly modes of transport like clean buses and light rail     Creates tax incentives for manufacturer to produce more energy efficient vehicles      Requires EPA to develop fuel economy standards for heavy duty vehicles      Repeals the federal statute that preempts state law from establishing fuel economy standards for motor vehicles      Requires the Secretary of Energy to improve the fuel efficiency of federal fleets by 30       Significantly increases the amount of advanced clean fuels in the nations fuel supply by requiring increasing volumes of fuels that have low greenhouse gas emissions and that are produced in an environmentally sound way      Cuts all four power plant pollutants over the next six years  The pollution that causes smog and asthma attacks  nitrogen oxides  would be cut by 75 percent from 1997 levels  the pollution that causes soot and early death  sulfur dioxide  would be cut by 75 percent below Phase II Acid Rain levels  toxic mercury emissions would be cut by 90 percent from 1999 levels  and emissions of carbon dioxide  which forms a heat trapping blanket in the atmosphere that causes global warming  would be cut to 1990 levels      Addresses threats from global warming  Power plants are the largest source of U S  global warming pollution  responsible for 40 percent of national carbon dioxide emissions  Similar to Senator Collins Clean Power Act  this provision seeks to return carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020  to reduce global warming threats       Helps reduce Americans heat and electric bills by doubling the Department of Energy  DOE  Weatherization Program funding to help consumers save money on their energy bills by weatherizing their homes and by creative tax incentives for usage of alternative energy sources and energy saving appliances      Directs the Department of Energy to establish an energy efficiency resource standard  EERS   Electricity and natural gas suppliers would be required to achieve an annual performance standard for peak demand reduction      Requires utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from clean  renewable energy sources  This percentage would start at 1  in 2008  and then rise every two years until it reaches 20  in 2020           Click picture to view video
