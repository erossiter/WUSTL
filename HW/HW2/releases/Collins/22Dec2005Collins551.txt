                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Spending Bill Includes an Additional  50 Million to Benefit BIW Workers December 22  2005 Washington  D C     WASHINGTON  DC With Senator Collins support  the U S  Senate has approved the fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill  which includes  50 million within the DD X  program and an additional  50 million for DDG 51 modernization  both of which benefit Bath Iron Works  Senator Collins worked to also secure authorization of this funding in the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which she is a member  In total  the bill includes  1 8 billion for the DD X  program  a combined  1 1 billion in research and development and  716 million for procurement of the DD X   This represents the Presidents request  which Senator Collins worked successfully to include in this final spending bill  despite efforts by the House to drastically cut funding for the DD X  program       The Defense spending bill also includes crucial funding for our troops and  2 9 billion in disaster assistance for victims of Hurricane Katrina  In addition  the bill includes millions of dollars for defense related projects for Maine  which will benefit    America s national security while helping secure jobs in the State      Senator Collins was also successful in her efforts to have stripped from the bill a provision that was included in an earlier version of the bill that would have permitted oil and gas drilling on ANWR  something that Senator Collins has strongly and consistently opposed  In addition  she was able to secure a commitment from Senate leadership that emergency funding for the LIHEAP program would be considered as one of the first items for consideration when Congress reconvenes in January      In related legislation  which was also approved by the Senate  Senator Collins was successful in her efforts to permanently prevent the Navy from proceeding with a one shipyard acquisition strategy  ensuring that both BIW and Ingalls will be involved in work related to the DD X  program           MORE            Following Senate approval of the bill  Senator Collins said  This legislation is good news for our national security and for BIW  The skilled workforce at BIW plays a vital role in our military and this bill includes crucial funding to ensure that BIW builds the major surface combatants that our Navy needs  including the next generation of destroyers  the DD X   as well as modernization of the DDG 51s  As the Navy s lead contractor on DDG Modernization design and engineering  BIW will be incorporating the first package of modernization upgrades on its FY05 new construction ships  the DDG 111 and DDG 112  The shipbuilding provisions in this Defense spending bill are in sharp contrast to an earlier House version of the bill  which would have slashed DD X  funding by over  1 billion and did not include the Presidents full request for the overall program or for research and development      This bill provides vital funding for our troops to help ensure that they have the best equipment possible to defend our nation  And it includes vital dollars for the victims of Hurricane Katrina who are still struggling to get back on their feet following one of the worst natural disasters of our nations history       I am also pleased that the Senate came to an agreement to strip language from the bill that would have permitted oil and gas drilling at ANWR  This is a matter that I strongly oppose and it did not belong in this defense spending bill       I am troubled that the final bill did not include the LIHEAP money we sought  But we did forge an agreement with leadership that will provide for Senate consideration of a LIHEAP emergency spending bill when Congress reconvenes  This is a commitment to which I will hold leadership          Highlights of the bill s defense projects for    Maine are as follows      Full funding of Presidents Budget at  1 8 billion for the DD X  program  BIW     50 million for
