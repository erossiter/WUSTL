                                     Warner Collins legislation would allow advanced appropriations for DD X  program March 16  2005  Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins  R ME  has introduced legislation with Senator John Warner  R VA  that would allow the use of advanced appropriations for shipbuilding   The Warner Collins legislation would allow the cost of shipbuilding projects to be divided among current and future years that it takes to complete the projects  rather than the current budget practice of appropriating the entire cost in a single year at the beginning of the projects   It was offered as an amendment to the Budget Resolution that is currently being considered in the Senate   Senator Warner is the Chairman and Senator Collins is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee   The legislation is also co sponsored by the Chairman of the Senate Appropriation Committee  Senator Thad Cochran  R MS            Current budget rules do not reflect the realities of ship construction     said Senator Collins in introducing the legislation     Currently  a ship must be entirely appropriated within one year   This severely distorts the shipbuilding accounts  and does not allow the Navy to budget in the most efficient way possible   The key to controlling the price of ships is to minimize fluctuations in the shipbuilding account   Smoothing out the workload would allow our shipyards  in cooperation with the Navy  to plan and budget in the most efficient way possible          Senator Collins pointed out that ship procurement presents unique budget challenges   Defense ships take years to produce and can cost billions of dollars   And because of the current practice of appropriating the entire cost of a ship at the beginning of a project  if a large ship is scheduled to be funded in a particular year  it is nearly impossible for the Navy to allocate funding for the other ships that it requires          It   s not that the requirement for other ships doesn   t exist     it   s that we don   t give ourselves the tools to better manage the ship construction budget     said Senator Collins      This amendment helps to lay the foundation for creating a more realistic  rational  way of procuring ships   It will help the Navy and our nation   s shipbuilders to better plan  and thus minimize the unnecessary costs that come from the erratic fluctuations in our ship procurement rate   In doing so  it will also let us maximize the number of ships that we can procure          Senator Collins has spoken with a number of Navy officials about this issue  and they have agreed with her that the current manner of funding ships is flawed   Secretary of the Navy Gordon England recently told Senator Collins during a hearing that the use of alternative funding mechanisms  like advance appropriations  for shipbuilding would    allow us to buy them better and on a better schedule and better for the industrial phase           Senator Collins stressed that it is crucial for the Navy not only to have the most capable ships  but also the sufficient numbers of ships to meet national security requirements   The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review  prepared by the Department of Defense  stated that the Navy required a surface fleet of at least 310 ships to meet our national security requirements   Today  the fleet is below 300 ships   She has also pointed out that the Navy has admitted that it needs more DD X  destroyers than what is currently included in the Administration   s current budget request
