                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               June 7  2006 U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Susan M  Collins today urged the U S  State Department to keep Saudi Arabia on the U S  list of religiously intolerant nations  a classification that could subject the country to further action against it  including economic sanctions  In September 2004  the State Department designated Saudi Arabia as a county of particular concern  CPC  for its systematic violations of the right to freedom of thought  conscience  religion and belief in accord withthe International Religious Freedom Act of 1998  IRFA  Last summer  the State Department issued a waiver for Saudi Arabia claiming the need to engage in direct diplomacy  However  the waiver expired in late March  and no action with regard to Saudi Arabia has been announced by the U S  government   It boggles the mind that even though our own government has concluded that religious freedom does not exist in Saudi Arabia  the State Department refuses to put any muscle into its relationship with Saudi Arabia and make it a priority that they face the consequences of being named a CPC  Schumer said  We know that Saudi funded madrassas promote religious intolerance and violence in schools  We know that Saudi Arabia brutally prohibits the public expression of religion that is not the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam  And we know that Saudi efforts to export militant ideology inflame anti Western sentiments throughout the world  If that isn t enough to warrant action by the State Department  I don t know what is   Senator Collins said  It is disheartening that the Saudi Government continues to persecuteShi a Muslims and those whodeviate from the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam Although it is a positive step forward that the State Department has designated Saudi Arabia as a Country of Particular Concern  this designation means nothing if there are not steps taken to sanction Saudi Arabia for its actions  This religious intolerance must not continue without consequence   Saudi Arabia has a long history of denigrating its religious minorities  According to the State Departments 2006   the approximately one million Shi a Muslims that claim Saudi citizenship are prohibited from teaching their religion and must worship in secret because government law forbids the practice of any form of Islam aside from the official state religion of Wahhabism Salafism  Shi a Muslims also face state sanctioned discrimination as a result of their beliefs  as the Saudi regime restricts their employment in the petroleum industry  the military  and government agencies  Non Muslims also face similar persecution and marginalization  Despite laws permitting non Muslims to practice their religions privately  those who do are routinely subject to arrest  imprisonment  lashing  deportation  and sometimes torture  Government policy allows court judges to dismiss the testimony of people who are not practicing Muslims  Crimes against Muslims often result in harsher penalties than those against non Muslims  Finally  non Muslim religious materials like Bibles and videotapes are often confiscated by government officials    Schumer and Collins said that it is clear from our the U S  governments own reporting that over the past few years the Saudi government has continued to violate the right to freedom of thought  conscience  religion  or belief  In September 2003  the mutawaa  religious police  arrested 16 foreign workers for practicing Sufism  A month later  two Egyptian Christians were arrested and jailed on religious grounds and released three weeks later  Also that month  several Protestant foreign workers were arrested by the civil police and released the same day without charge  In December 2003  a foreign worker was arrested and charged with apostasy  later reduced to blasphemy and resulting in a sentence of two years in jail and 600 lashes  In March of last year  an Indian Christian foreign worker was arrested and tortured for preaching Christianity  and remains in prison   In order that the promotion of freedom of religion and belief is a consistent part of U S  foreign policy  IRFA requires the U S  government to take steps in response to the CPC designation One year later in September 2005  a 180 day waiver of action on that designation was authorized in order to allow additional time for the continuation of diplomatic discussions leading to progress on important religious freedom issues  At that time  the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom stated publicly that the U S  government should use the 180 day extension directly to engage the Saudi government to achieve demonstrable progress by the end of that period of time    In a letter to Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  Schumer and Collins wrote  We are very concerned that since the waiver expired in late March  now two months ago  no action with regard to Saudi Arabia has been announced by the U S  government  We fully expect that any action or agreement reached with the Saudi government will be made public in the interest of the accountability that results from transparency  Therefore  we write today requesting further information on what actions the U S  government will take to address Saudi Arabias designation as a CPC
