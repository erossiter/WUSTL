                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               January 26  2005  MR  CHAIRMAN  I want to commend you for holding this important hearing to examine the risks and benefits associated with prescription drug importation and the purchase of prescription drug over the Internet        One of the greatest challenges facing American consumers is the high cost of prescription drugs   Soaring prescription drug costs have placed a tremendous strain on family budgets   They have also imposed a heavy burden on employers     both public and private     who are struggling to provide affordable health insurance coverage to their workers   It is therefore no wonder that American consumers everywhere are looking across the border and into their computer screens in search of more affordable prescription drugs        It is well documented that the average price of prescription drugs is much lower in Canada and Western Europe than in the United States  with the price of some drugs in my home state of Maine being twice that of the same drugs that are available only a few miles away in a Canadian drug store          It simply does not seem fair that American consumers are footing the bill for the remarkable  yet costly  advancements in pharmaceutical research and development  while our neighbors just across the border receive those same medications at substantially lower prices   That is why I have long supported legislation to allow American consumers to benefit from international price competition on prescription drugs by permitting FDA approved medicines made in FDA approved facilities to be re imported into this county    But I am also concerned that we make certain that this is done safely and responsibly    I am pleased that this morning   s hearing will also focus on a slightly different but closely related issue     the safety challenges posed by the sale of prescription drugs over the Internet        The growth of the Internet in recent years has created many new opportunities for consumers to shop on line for health related products  information and services   The Internet offers many advantages for on line shoppers     convenience  competitive prices  privacy  and easy access to health and medical information   Morever  through the Internet  individuals with disabilities  the elderly  and patients living in remote areas can easily obtain information  products and services that they previously acquired only with great difficulty   As a consequence  the sale of consumer products over the Internet has grown rapidly  including the sale of prescription drugs        The number of on line pharmacies has increased dramatically from the 190 identified by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  in October of 2000 to an estimated 1 400 sites in April of 2004   While online drug sales by reputable pharmacies can have many advantages for patients  they also present new and unique challenges for regulators  law enforcement and policymakers   And rogue online pharmacies can be a prescription for disaster for unwary consumers        Last June  I participated in a hearing held by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  PSI  which revealed disturbing evidence about the ease with which U S  consumers can purchase dangerous and often addictive controlled substances from Internet pharmacy websites   I was particularly alarmed to learn that more than 90 percent of on line sites do not require a prescription or validate that there is a legitimate patient physician relationship         I believe that we need legislation to protect consumers from these rogue internet pharmacies   This is one of the primary reasons that I have joined Chairman Smith in cosponsoring Senator Gregg   s Safe IMPORT Act  which establishes federal licensing requirements and penalties for all Internet pharmacies that conduct or solicit business in the United States   The legislation also requires verification of a legitimate patient prescriber relationship  and establishes verification procedures for all prescriptions        MR  CHAIRMAN  while I believe that we must do all that we can to make prescription drugs more affordable  we must also do all that we can to ensure patient safety   This hearing is an important part of that process  and I commend the Chairman for raising these important issues                                                                                     Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Current record
