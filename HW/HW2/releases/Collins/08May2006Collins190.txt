                                     Senator Collins Also Secures Over   90 Million In Other Defense Related Projects For Maine May 8  2006 WASHINGTON  DC Senator Susan Collins  who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  has secured full funding in the defense authorization bill  at the Presidents requested level of  3 4 billion  toward two DD X  next generation destroyers  The bill would ensure that one DD X  would be built at BIW and the other at Ingalls in Mississippi  And also at the request of Senator Collins  it includes  25 million for the DDG modernization program at BIW   In addition  the bill includes over  90 million in other defense related projects for Maine     I am pleased that my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee have recognized how critical the DD X  destroyer program is to the future of our Navy and to the skilled workforce at BIW  said Senator Collins  The Senate defense authorization bill would ensure that the Navy proceeds with two DD X  destroyers over the next two years  one of which will be built at BIW  This funding is key in helping us to maintain the skilled workforce at BIW and meet the requirements of the Navy  said Senator Collins    Contrary to Senator Collins DD X  provision included in the Senate bill  the House defense authorization legislation would provide construction funding for only one DD X   which would likely be built at Ingalls in Mississippi  Senator Collins described the House bill as potentially devastating to BIW  In addition  the House bill would curtail the overall DD X  program after only two destroyers are built  The Navy has requested seven over the next ten years     The defense authorization bill now proceeds to the full Senate for consideration     At the request of Senator Collins  the Senate version of the bill also includes over  90 million for other defense related projects to benefit Maine and our national security  Senator Collins successful funding follows    MORE
