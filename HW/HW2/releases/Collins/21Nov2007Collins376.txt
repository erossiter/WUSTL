                                       November 21  2007 Washington  DC      In order to help low income families who are struggling with increased energy costs  U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe and Susan Collins have sent a letter to the President requesting the immediate release of  20 million that remains in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund  In addition  Senators Snowe and Collins are asking the President to support at least  2 4 billion for the LIHEAP program in the Fiscal Year 2008 budget    Recently  crude oil prices have reached record highs and home heating oil prices in Maine are at their highest level ever  said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement  As Mainers gather to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday  we must remember all of those who can not afford to heat their homes as a result of these record high prices  We urge the President to release these funds immediately to help our neediest citizens   LIHEAP is a federal grant program that provides states with funding for home energy assistance programs  The LIHEAP program provides assistance for 48 000 low income and elderly Mainers each year    In September  Senators Snowe and Collins secured  7 2 million in contingency LIHEAP funds for Maine  The Senators also supported a  250 million increase in LIHEAP funding in the Labor HHS bill that recently passed the Senate but was vetoed by the President  In addition  earlier this month  Senators Snowe and Collins wrote to the Administration requesting that  5 1 billion for LIHEAP be included in the President 2009 budget request    Below is the text of a letter sent to the President today    The President The White House Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  President    We are writing to request that you release the remaining  20 million in contingency LIHEAP funds and to urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the LIHEAP program in FY2008  With the price of oil approaching  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter    Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million    LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances     We request that your Administration release funding from the LIHEAP contingency fund to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses and we urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the program in FY2008         For more
