                                     Savings Would Increase LIHEAP Funding to Help Low Income Americans Stay Warm December 11  2005  WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Susan Collins  who has been working to increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   is calling on Congress to pay for the increase by repealing unnecessary oil and natural gas tax incentives that benefit major oil corporations  as well as placing a tax on windfall oil profits  Senator Collins  joined by Senator Jack Reed  D RI   both of whom lead the Northeast Midwest Coalition  have sent a letter requesting that the Senate Finance Committee consider these options to increase LIHEAP funding this winter    Although oil and natural gas companies are experiencing record profits  existing tax policy provides these same companies with billions of dollars in unnecessary and unwarranted subsidies and tax incentives  said Senators Collins and Reed    Senator Collins has been fighting to ensure LIHEAP assistance is funded at an adequate level  She has pointed out that the recent hurricanes have caused heating oil and gasoline prices to soar  which will force many families in Maine and throughout the nation to choose between turning off their heat or putting food on their tables    At a time when huge oil corporations are posting record profits  low income families should not be forced to choose between putting food on the table and putting heating oil in the tank  said Senator Collins    Each year  4 5 million low income families  including about 46 450 households in Maine  rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes  LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs    Following is the text of the letter to the Senate Finance Committee    Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus    We are writing to urge you to consider including revenue measures to finance  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in the tax reconciliation bill that the Committee is considering  While there are a number of potential measures to raise revenue for this increased spending  we believe two have particular merit  a tax on crude oil windfall profits and repeal of unnecessary oil and natural gas tax incentives  We would like to work with you to explore these options  Oil companies reported record profits for the third quarter on surging prices  Chevron posted profits of  3 6 billion  BP profits rose to  6 5 billion  Royal Dutch Shell profits grew to  9 billion  and ExxonMobil profits gushed to nearly  10 billion  According to Business Week  ExxonMobil earned  150 million for every working day in the past three months  In light of these profits  we do not believe the oil industry needs taxpayer subsidies originally designed to shore up a struggling industry at a time when oil prices were closer to  10 per barrel than to  60 per barrel  While this year has been exceptionally lucrative for the oil industry  rising energy prices threaten to financially overwhelm low income families and seniors this winter  Americans are experiencing extraordinarily high run ups in energy prices that jeopardize the ability of many families to stay warm this winter    In 1980  Congress established the LIHEAP program as part of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act  Twenty five years later  with energy prices overwhelming workers salaries and seniors Social Security checks  it is appropriate to again tax windfall profits to aid in energy assistance  We believe a temporary  one year windfall profit tax on integrated oil companies is a small price to pay to provide Americans with energy security this winter  The cost of a windfall profit tax to integrated oil companies is small  For the companies listed above  this additional funding would amount to approximately 10 percent of profits from a single quarter  or in the case of ExxonMobil alone  just one third of the Company s third quarter profits    Although oil and natural gas companies are experiencing record profits  existing tax policy provides these same companies with billions of dollars in unnecessary and unwarranted subsidies and tax incentives  For example  a provision allowing the oil and gas industry to expense intangible drilling costs is predicted to cost the Federal Government  2 3 billion over five years  According to the Congressional Research Service  this provision provides a subsidy to the oil and gas industry that is not available to other industries  is economically inefficient  and promotes investment decisions that are based on tax considerations rather than inherent economic considerations  With net profits of a single oil company reaching nearly  10 billion in a single quarter  it is absurd to think that federal taxpayers are actually subsidizing capital costs for the oil industry    The  2 92 billion we are seeking is in addition to the funding provided in the fiscal year 2006 Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies appropriations bill  and would bring total LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion  the amount authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005  With this funding  LIHEAP could serve 12 million families this year  This is double the number of families served last year  but still only one third of those eligible  States could also increase the level of benefits to help with rising costs  For seniors  this funding would mean they would not have to choose between buying life saving medication and paying their natural gas bill  For working families  this funding would mean they do not have to decide between putting food on the table and putting heating oil in the tank    We hope the Finance Committee will support this effort to increase LIHEAP funding this winter  and would welcome the opportunity to work with you on this matter                                                                       Browse by
