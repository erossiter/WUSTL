                                      May 1  2007 Washington  DC      Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Tuesday expressed concerns over the federal governments failure to adopt government wide procedures for designating and sharing Sensitive But Unclassified  SBU  information within and among all levels of government   The Senators  in a May 1  2007 letter to several high ranking federal officials  requested that the Administration move quickly to adopt and implement a consistent set of procedures for agencies to follow when handling SBU information  The Senators noted that different procedures for different agencies create confusion over which rules to follow when disseminating this sensitive information  often hampering information sharing  which can result in major gaps in intelligence   A December 16  2005 presidential directive instructed the Director of National Intelligence  the Secretary of Homeland Security  and the Attorney General to recommend a consistent set of procedures for handling SBU information within one year  The Senators  noting that this deadline has passed  asked about the status of those recommendations   Text of the letter   sent to the Director of National Intelligence  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  the Attorney General  the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs  and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  is below   May 1  2007  The Honorable Michael Chertoff Secretary U S  Department of Homeland Security Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff   We are writing to request that the Administration move quickly to adopt and implement guidelines for the consolidation of sensitive but unclassified designations  SBU  identified by the Program Manger for the Information Sharing Environment  ISE   We are very concerned about the threat that a lack of consistency in the use of SBU designations poses to the sharing of information  both among federal agencies and with our state  local  and tribal partners  To that end  we are seeking answers to specific questions related to the progress in standardizing these designations   A March 2006 GAO report found 56 SBU designations in use by federal agencies  while the Program Manager for the ISE  PM ISE  estimates at least 107 such markings  To add to the confusion  there is no consistent set of rules and procedures for handling and disseminating this information  In fact  different agencies have substantially different policies for handling information marked with the same designation  We believe that when officials are confused as to the rules governing the dissemination of information  they often err on the side of not sharing    Our first responders bear the brunt of this ineffective information sharing  When they are not provided with adequate intelligence  they are unable to properly train or equip their personnel to respond to emerging threats  To facilitate dissemination of pertinent and timely intelligence information to these first responders  the federal government must remove roadblocks erected because of the overuse and inconsistent application of SBU designations    Recognizing the need to improve the consistency of SBU designations  the President directed the DNI and the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit recommendations for the standardization of SBU procedures  This requirement was part of a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies issued by the President on December 16  2005  The memorandum  laying out the requirements for the information sharing environment  included five guidelines and two requirements  Guideline 3 is to standardize procedures for sensitive but unclassified information   The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General were directed to recommend standardized SBU procedures for homeland security information  law enforcement information  and terrorism information  within 180 days of the date of the Presidents memorandum  Within one year of the date of the memorandum  the DNI was directed to recommend standardized SBU procedures for all other types of information  These recommendations were to be submitted through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs  and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism   If we are to prevent future terrorist events and be better prepared to respond to such events  as well as natural disasters  there must be better information sharing between federal agencies and with our state  local  and tribal partners and the private sector  We believe that prompt attention to the standardization of SBU designations is essential to improving information sharing  To that end  we are seeking the following information    The office of the Program Manager for the ISE briefed our staff on the concept of Controlled Unclassified Information  CUI  and their plan for consolidating SBU designations  This plan would fulfill the requirements of Guideline 3  If the CUI regime envisioned by the Program Manager is approved  will it be implemented for all types of information  including homeland security  law enforcement  and terrorism information      Based on the dates in the Presidents memo  the recommendations for standardizing SBU designations are overdue  What is the status of these recommendations  When do you expect the adoption of recommendations  Once recommendations are adopted  when can we expect a plan for implementing them      Implementing the regime for standardizing SBU designations  once it is finalized  poses a significant challenge  What will be done to ensure that it is used exclusively by the agencies under your authority  How will you ensure its use by other agencies      Are there plans to order the re labeling of SBU products  If not  what processes will you put in place for reviewing existing information to determine whether it should be shared      Because distinct responsibilities are assigned to different officials  we are sending an identical copy of this letter to the Director of National Intelligence  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  the Attorney General  the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs  and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism                                                                            Browse by
