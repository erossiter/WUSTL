Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees investigation to examine the governments preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina  The hearing was the 21st in a series of hearings over the past six months that included 74 witnesses from all levels of federal  state  and local government  As part of the investigation  the committee also conducted 300 interviews and reviewed some 820 000 pages of documents  Todays hearing focused on recommendations for reform and included testimony from the Government Accountability Office  GAO   Department of Homeland Security Inspector Generals  DHS IG  Office  and other homeland security and emergency response experts    Our purpose and our obligation now is to move forward to create an emergency preparedness and response structure that brings immediate improvement and that guarantees continual progress  This will not be done by simply renaming agencies or drawing new organizational charts  We are not here to rearrange the deck chairs on a ship that  while perhaps not sinking  certainly is adrift  said Senator Collins  This new structure must be based on a clear understanding of the roles and capabilities of all emergency management agencies  It must establish a strong chain of command that encourages  empowers  and trusts front line decision making  It must replace ponderous  rigid bureaucracy with discipline  agility  cooperation  and collaboration  It must build a stronger partnership among all levels of government with the responsibilities of each partner clearly defined  and it must hold them accountable when those responsibilities are not met    Expert witnesses today agreed with Senator Collins suggestion to create regional task forces that would plan for and train to react to catastrophes in their regions  whether they be natural disasters or a terrorist attack  Senator Collins has suggested that the task forces would combine emergency response departments and agencies across federal  state  and local governments as well as public and private entities    The witnesses who testified at todays hearing were  The Honorable Barbara A  Mikulski  U S  Senator  The

Katrina  The GAOs recommendations included clarifying the roles and responsibilities of key federal officials  clarifying various aspects of the National Response Plan  and strengthening planning and response capabilities     Senators Collins and Lieberman expect to release a committee report on their investigation later this month
