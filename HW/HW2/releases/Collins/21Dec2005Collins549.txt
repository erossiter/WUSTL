                                     Spending Bill Includes an Additional  50 Million to Benefit BIW Workers  ANWR Provision Stripped From Final Bill      December 21  2005 Washington  D C     WASHINGTON  DCWith Senator Collins support  the U S  Senate has approved the fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill  which includes  50 million within the DD X  program and an additional  50 million for DDG 51 modernization  both of which benefit Bath Iron Works  Senator Collins worked to also secure the funding in the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which she is a member  In total  the bill includes  1 8 billion for the DD X  program  a combined  1 1 billion in research and development  and  716 million for procurement of the DD X   This represents the Presidents request  which Senator Collins worked successfully to include in this final spending bill  despite efforts by the U S  House to drastically cut funding for the DD X  program       The Defense spending bill also includes crucial funding for our troops   2 9 billion in disaster assistance for victims of Hurricane Katrina  and  2 billion for the LIHEAP program which will benefit Maine this winter  In addition  the bill includes millions of dollars for defense related projects for Maine  which will benefit Americas national security while helping to secure jobs in the State      In related legislation  which was also approved by the Senate today  Senator Collins was successful in her efforts to permanently prevent the Navy from proceeding with a one shipyard acquisition strategy  ensuring that both BIW and Ingalls will be involved in work related to the DD X  program       Following Senate approval of the bill  Senator Collins said  This legislation is good news for our national security and for BIW  The skilled workforce at BIW plays a vital role in our military and this bill includes crucial funding to ensure that BIW builds the major surface combatants that our Navy needs  including the next generation of destroyers  the DD X  as well as modernization of the DDG 51s           MORE         DEFENSE APPROPS  2         As the Navys lead contractor on DDG Modernization design and engineering  BIW will be incorporating the first package of modernization upgrades on its fiscal year 2005 new construction ships  the DDG 111 and the DDG 112  The shipbuilding provisions in this Defense spending bill are in sharp contrast to an earlier House version of the bill  which would have slashed DD X  funding by over  1 billion and did not include the Presidents full request for the overall program or for research and development           This bill provides vital funding for our troops to help ensure that they have the best resources and equipment possible to defend our nation  And it  includes vital dollars for the victims of Hurricane Katrina who are still struggling to get back on their feet following one of the worst natural disasters in our nations history           I am also pleased that the bill includes  2 billion for the LIHEAP program including funding that could be available this winter to states like Maine  where we have so many low income families that rely on this critical program           I am very disappointed however  that a provision to allow oil and gas drilling at ANWR  something I have strongly and consistently opposed  I supported efforts to strip this provision from the bill and believe that it was out of the scope of the legislation and inappropriate for it to be included           On balance however  the funding for our troops  shipbuilding  Katrina victims  LIHEAP  and defense programs in Maine is too critical to jeopardize by killing the legislation           Highlights of the bill  include defense projects for Maine are as follows
