                                      December 13  2005 Washington  D C      WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Susan Collins has joined a group of her Republican colleagues in calling on the Senate leadership to reject cuts to the Medicaid program  which were proposed in the House version of the budget reconciliation legislation  In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Minority Leader Harry Reid  Senator Collins and her colleagues are urging the leaders to support the Senate version of the bill  which is currently being negotiated with House leaders  The Senate legislation saves money in the Medicaid program by reducing waste and abuse without negatively affecting families and seniors who rely on the Medicaid program         Medicaid is such a critical program for low income families and elderly individuals in  Maine  and throughout the nation  We should not be balancing the budget on the backs of our families who rely on this important program  said Senator Collins         In their letter the Senators wrote  Medicaid is a vitally important program that serves almost 54 million poor  disabled  chronically ill and elderly Americans  It provides a range of benefits from screenings and vaccinations for the young  to home health and long term care for the elderly  Given the breadth and diversity of the people it helps  Congress must remain committed to the strength and viability of Medicaid      The letter was circulated by Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  and signed by Senators Susan Collins  Olympia Snowe  Norm Coleman  R MN   Arlen Specter  R PA   Mike DeWine  R OH   and Lincoln Chafee  R RI          A text of the letter is as follows                                           MORE                    MEDICAID  2         December 13  2005       The Honorable William H  Frist The Honorable Harry Reid Majority Leader Minority Leader United States Senate  United States  Senate S 230 Capitol S 221 Capitol Washington  DC  20510   Washington  DC  20510      Dear Majority Leader Frist     Throughout the budget process we have been concerned about the impact to  America s lowest income and most vulnerable from policies implemented to secure budget savings  We were heartened by the Senates effort to protect these Americans by utilizing system efficiencies and eliminating waste and abuse from the Medicaid program  Unfortunately  the House of Representatives did not take a similar path  Therefore  as the Senate begins its work to reconcile the two budget reconciliation bills  we urge you to hold firm in defending the Senates policies regarding Medicaid     Medicaid is a vitally important program that serves almost 54 million poor  disabled  chronically ill and elderly Americans  It provides a range of benefits from screenings and vaccinations for the young  to home health and long term care for the elderly  Given the breadth and diversity of the people it helps  Congress must remain committed to the strength and viability of Medicaid     As indicated by the strong support from beneficiary groups  advocates and providers  the Senate bill ensures that the most vulnerable among us are not called upon to carry the burden of balancing the budget  This was accomplished by adhering to a few key principles  First  the Senate bill limits the cuts to a total of  10 billion  the savings level which the Finance Committee was instructed to achieve  The bill utilizes both Medicare and Medicaid to reach the required  10 billion in budget savings  and holds the net level of Medicaid cuts to under  5 billion  Most importantly  the Senate bill does not achieve any savings through policies that would negatively impact beneficiaries  We strongly urge you to continue to defend these principles and preserve the Senates policies on Medicaid in the final budget reconciliation agreement     In particular  we are concerned with policies included in the House bill that would impose new cost sharing requirements on beneficiaries  alter eligibility policies for long term care that impact the middle class  and provide unlimited flexibility to states to change benefits  These proposals were debated within the Senate and soundly rejected      We look forward to working with you on developing a conference report that can garner wide support among Senators and supporters of the Medicaid program
