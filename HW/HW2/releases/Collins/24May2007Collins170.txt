                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May 24  2007    House and Senate leaders have agreed on an Iraq Supplemental Appropriations bill that includes provisions authored by Senators John Warner  R VA   Susan Collins  R ME  and Ben Nelson  D NE  that require the Iraqi government to meet certain benchmarks of progress  The provisions require the President to provide two progress reports to Congress  on July 15 and September 15 of this year  on whether the Iraqis are meeting 18 benchmarks essential to achieving political reconciliation in Iraq  The benchmarks include  requirement that the Iraqis increase the number of their security forces capable of operating independently  enactment and implementation of de Baathification legislation  enactment of constitutional and electoral reforms  and passage of legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of oil revenues    The legislation was passed by both the House the Senate on May 24 and will soon be signed by the President    An exact version of the Warner Collins Nelson proposal was approved by a bipartisan majority of the Senate in a separate vote last week     During a news conference on Capitol Hill today  Senator Collins said  This legislation will not only ensure that our troops get the funding that they need for training  for equipment  for other essential purposes  it will ensure that the Iraqis are accountable for meeting benchmarks  It also requires that there will be consequences if the Iraqis do not meet these benchmarks     The Warner Collins provision includes a measure authored by Senator Collins that conditions the release of reconstruction funds to progress made by the Iraqi government  If the Iraqis are not making progress  we should not continue to provide reconstruction funds  This sends a very strong message to the Iraqi leaders that the status quo is not acceptable  It also tells the Iraqis that our presence and our commitment in Iraq is neither open ended nor unconditional said Senator Collins     Senator Collins also reiterated her view that if the Presidents strategy of deploying additional troops to Iraq  which she opposes  does not demonstrate significant results by September  then she believes that Congress should consider all options  including a redefinition of our mission in Iraq and a gradual  but significant withdrawal of our troops next year      In addition Senator Collins recently called on the Senate Armed Services Committee to provide an opportunity in early September for General David Petraeus to give the Committee a full assessment of the current U S  strategy in Iraq    A summary of the Warner Collins Amendment follows     Conditions the U S  strategy in Iraq on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks they themselves have laid out  These benchmarks include increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units capable of operating independently  ensuring the rights of minority political parties in the Iraqi legislature are protected  enacting and implementing de Baathification legislation  and enacting constitutional and electoral reforms      Requires that the Iraqis allocate and spend  10 billion in Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects  including delivery of essential services  on an equitable basis     Requires the President to submit an initial report on July 15  2007  assessing whether the Iraqis have made satisfactory progress towards meeting each of the benchmarks  If the Presidents assessment is that the Iraqis are making unsatisfactory progress  the President will include in the July report a description of how the U S  political  economic  regional  and military strategy in Iraq will be revised to achieve progress on the benchmarks    Requires the President to submit a second report to Congress on September 15  2007  further assessing whether the Iraqis are making progress on benchmarks  This report will be accompanied by testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee by General Petreaus    Conditions the release of economic funds to the Iraqis on their meeting the benchmarks  Our amendment would prohibit the release of funds from the Economic Support Fund  which provides U S  assistance for economic reconstruction projects  to the Iraqis unless and until the President of the U S  certifies in his July and September reports that the Iraqis are making progress on the benchmarks     Lays out a redeployment plan if the Iraqis decide within the context of their constitutional framework that they want U S  troops to leave Iraq
