                                      November 27  2006   Washington  DC   Senator Susan Collins is working with federal regulatory   agencies to protect Maine s lobster industry from being adversely affected by   new fishing regulations that are currently under consideration  The National   Marine Fisheries Service has proposed a rule to amend the Atlantic Large Whale   Take Reduction Plan  ALWTRP  that would strongly impact Maine lobstermen    While Senator Collins supports the overall goal of the ALWTRP  to protect the   endangered right whale  she believes that any changes to fishing regulations   must take into consideration the true economic impact those changes will   have on Maine s lobster industry     According to the National Marine Fisheries Service  the annual cost of   the proposed rule would be  14 2 million  and the Maine lobster industry is   expected to absorb  12 8 million of that cost  But Senator Collins believes   the impact on Maine s lobster industry and the state economy would be even   greater     The adverse economic impact on small  family owned vessels would be the   greatest in the near shore areas  In fact  more than 75 percent of the   projected cost of the rule is expected to be incurred by lobstermen operating   in the inshore and near shore areas of Maine  said Senator Collins  I urge   that further analysis of the true regulatory cost of this rule is needed and   reasonable alternatives be considered that would minimize the economic impact   on the lobster industry  Only then  will these regulations work to protect   both the right whale and the Maine fishing industry    The full text of Senator Collins  letter is below    The Honorable Rob Portman  Director  The Office of Management and Budget  725 17th Street  N W   Washington  DC 20503   Dear Mr  Portman     I am writing to convey my concerns about the proposed rule to amend the   Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan  ALWTRP   The fishing industry is an   important component of Maines economy and heritage  and changes to the ALWTRP   will affect many fishermen throughout my state  Therefore  I request your   careful consideration of this rule and the socio economic impacts it will have   on Maine     Fixed gear fisheries  especially the lobster fishery  are very important   to the local economies of Maines costal communities  Maines lobster   fishery  which is valued at over  300 million  is composed of more than 7 000   license holders  As you can imagine  there are many fishermen in Maine who   are anxiously following the development of modifications to the ALWTRP     There are a number of concerns that the Maine fishing industry would like   addressed as these modifications of the ALWTRP move from the proposed to the   final stage  I would like to highlight some vital modifications to the   proposed rule that are essential for Maines commercial fisheries  Chief   among my concerns is that the true economic impact of this rule is not   reflected in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement  In fact  I have not   seen evidence that an accurate socioeconomic baseline for the lobster industry   was established in formulating this rule     A primary issue is the proposed limitations on floating groundlines    Maines rocky bottom habitat is unique along the Atlantic coast and much of it   is not compatible with sinking or neutrally buoyant groundlines  Operational   costs and gear loss due to interactions with Maines rocky bottom habitat make   sinking and neutrally buoyant groundlines unworkable in many areas of the   state  Maine fishermen cannot be limited to using sinking and neutrally   buoyant groundlines  as currently proposed  some flotation is operationally   needed     The development of a low profile groundline provides great promise for   both the industry and our conservation goals  The State of Maine  in   cooperation with the lobster industry  continues to research the development   of low profile groundlines with the support of the National Marine Fisheries   Service  NMFS   As soon as a workable low profile groundline is fully   developed and tested  the ALWTRP must be flexible enough to incorporate this   new development in a timely way  Until low profile groundline is developed   that will serve the needs of conservation and the industry  access to floating   groundlines is necessary     There is strong support in Maine for Alternative 5 contained in the   Proposed Rule for the ALWTRP  Unfortunately  this alternative was not   selected as one of the preferred alternatives by the National Marine Fisheries   Service  As the modifications to the ALWTRP move from the proposed stage to   the final stage  it is vital that Alternative 5 be implemented with the   exemption lines originally proposed by the State of Maine     The exemption lines proposed by the Maine Department of Marine Resources   during the scoping process are based on 35 years of sound data obtained from   the Northeast Fisheries Science Center  Additionally  this exemption area   contains the rocky terrain of Maines coastline that does not support feeding   whales and makes the use of sinking groundlines dangerous and impractical  As   NMFS has recognized  the marginal benefit to whale protection in the inshore   area would be minimal  However  the adverse economic impact on small  family   owned vessels would be the greatest in the near shore areas  In fact  more   than 75 percent of the projected cost of the rule is expected to be incurred   by lobstermen operating in the inshore and near shore areas of Maine     According to the National Marine Fisheries Service  the annual cost of   this rule will be  14 2 million  and the lobster industry is expected to   absorb  12 8 million of that cost  I believe even these figures do not truly   capture the impact this rule could have on Maines economy  For example  NMFS   estimates that sinking groundlines will cost up to 73 percent more than   currently used groundlines  However  lobstermen and rope manufacturers agree   that the initial replacement cost of the rope could far exceed this    Furthermore  NMFS does not recognize that the sinking groundlines will have to   be replaced far more frequently than floating groundlines and many lobster   traps will need to be replaced due to gear lost from fishing sinking line    Also  the DEIS does not give consideration to the increased labor costs that   will be necessary to refit lobster gear  The projected costs will only be a   fraction of the realized costs to the lobster industry     The modification of the ALWTRP will have profound implications for   Maines coastal economy  I urge that further analysis of the true regulatory   cost of this rule is needed and reasonable alternatives be considered that   would minimize the economic impact on the lobster industry  Only then  will   these regulations work to protect both the right whale and the Maine fishing   industry     The Maine lobster industry is an environmentally responsive fishery that   has worked hard to protect endangered whales  Furthermore  providing enhanced   protection of whales and utilizing alternatives that are less onerous to the   lobster industry are not mutually exclusive goals  The changes I have outlined   in this letter are cooperative  common sense measures that would increase the   protection of whales without imposing such a financially detrimental burden on   the lobster industry     Thank you for your attention to this matter
