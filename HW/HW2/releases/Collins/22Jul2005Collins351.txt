                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 22  2005  Homeland Security is about protecting targets  minimizing damage  and assisting victims  it also is about detecting and arresting terrorists before they can strike   Terrorists are inherently unpredictable  aiming at vulnerable targets wherever they find them   in large and small communities alike   While the September 11th terrorists completed their murderous mission in the metropolitan areas of Washington  D C  and New York City  we have learned that they began their deadly work in smaller communities   Two of the terrorists began their mission in our own state of Maine     at the airport in Portland  others organized and trained in communities such as Lawrenceville  Georgia  and Norman  Oklahoma     The Senate recently approved legislation that I authored with Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut  which strikes the right balance between ratcheting up funding to New York  Washington  D C   and other high risk areas  and ensuring that we improve our capabilities in all states so there are no weak links in our homeland defenses    Our legislation recognizes that  while we increase security where we believe the risk of terrorist attack is greatest  risk assessment is an art  and not a science   It is an educated guess   We do not know with certainty where terrorists will attack   They could choose to attack so called    soft    targets  such as malls  or schools  in Middle America to spread terror into the heartland   They could choose to attack our food supply  much of which is grown in rural America   As the Director of the FBI has stated  our country is    awash in potential targets      And  as we have seen in London  Madrid  Russia  Indonesia  Iraq  and Israel  terrorists have no qualms about exploiting any vulnerability anywhere  whether in metropolitan cities or small towns     in order to kill innocent men  women  and children and create fear and panic    Our legislation  for the first time  creates a framework for the distribution of billions of dollars in state homeland security grants that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  allocates each year to assist first responders and state and local officials in helping to prevent terrorism and prepare for an attack   It gives the DHS Secretary unprecedented authority to target funds based on risk   This grant formula doubles the amount of funding allocated to high risk states while ensuring that all states receive a guaranteed minimum level of funding so that they may attain a minimum level of preparedness   Under our legislation  California will receive a baseline amount of funding five and a half times greater than smaller states   New York and Texas will receive a baseline amount more than three times greater      In addition to the minimum level of funding  states are eligible to receive additional grant funds to address their unique risks  threats  and vulnerabilities   The Congressional Research Service has determined that altogether  the Collins Lieberman proposal would allocate roughly 80 percent of the total funds to states based solely on risk factors   Our formula also recognizes that states    efforts to address homeland security vulnerabilities and needs are most often long term projects that will require many years to complete   For example  creating a communications network that all first responders can use is a complicated  expensive  and lengthy process   Multi year planning is critical for states to develop a successful prevention and response strategy   Maintaining a predictable level of state grant funding each year will allow states to plan and budget in order to meet their preparedness needs   Finally  our legislation would subject homeland security grants to tough new accountability measures  such as an independent Government Accountability Office audit and a requirement that all purchases help achieve levels of prevention and response capabilities   In this way  the amendment would prohibit wasteful spending on items such as leather jackets and air conditioned garbage trucks as has occurred in the District of Columbia and New Jersey   This legislation dramatically improves the homeland security state grant process by instituting a clear set of risk based factors that do not exist now   This way  the entire nation will be better prepared to prevent  and if necessary  respond to the next terrorist attack   This funding formula is a well reasoned  intelligent strategy to protect all Americans against the terrorist threat   Terrorists will strike wherever there is a vulnerable target  and it is our duty to better prepare  so we might prevent  attacks on our homeland
