                                     Senators Collins and Lieberman Requested the Investigation  Which Uncovered Numerous Cases of Wasteful Spending  Abuse by DHS  July 19  2006 WASHINGTON  DCSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman today led a committee hearing to discuss the findings of a recent Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation into the misuse of government purchase cards by the Department of Homeland Security during the months immediately preceding and following Hurricane Katrina  The hearing  titled DHS Purchase Cards  Credit Without Accountability  focused on investigative work that was requested by the Senators  The GAO found numerous cases where questionable items  such as iPods and a 63 inch plasma television  were purchased using the cards  as well as instances where DHS was unable to account for items such as flat bottom boats and laptop computers   Witnesses included Managing Director of GAOs Forensics Audits and Special Investigations  Greg Kutz  and DHS Chief Financial Officer David Norquist   Following initial news reports of the GAOs findings and prior to the Committee hearing this morning  a DHS official notified Committee investigators that the Department was able to locate some of the items that it was unable to find during the course of the GAOs investigation   I am convinced that the items identified in the GAO report would still be missing were it not for this GAO investigation and our Committees hearing  said Senator Collins  She added  The American people expect the federal government to spend their tax dollars wiselyespecially in this time of great fiscal pressures and a large budget deficit That is why it is so disturbing that this new GAO investigation uncovered yet more evidence of wasted taxpayer dollars following Hurricane Katrina  DHS lacks the most basic safeguards to prevent waste  fraud  and abuse in the purchase card program and has left the door wide open for these abuses   Senator Collins also said that she opposed the increase of the purchase card threshold from  2 500 to  250 000 that was authorized after Hurricane Katrina for fear that it would leave open opportunities to wasteful spending  GAOs investigation indicates that my fears were warranted  Senator Lieberman said    Senators Collins and Lieberman were successful in their efforts to lower the spending limit on the cards back to  2 500    Highlights of the GAOs investigation include    Overall poor management and oversight by DHS of the purchase card program   The GAO found that  of the cases it examined  44 percent of purchase card transactions failed to have written authorization and 63 percent did not have evidence that the good and services were actually received   A case where a cardholder purchased 20 flat bottom boats for twice the retail value   A cardholder purchased a 63 inch plasma big screen TV that investigators found in its original box six months after it was purchased   Laptop computers that were purchased but never inventoried   A case were a cardholder purchased meals ready to eat for a total cost of over  464 000 including  30 000 in shipping costs  Yet many of the MREs were never used and ended up in warehoused across the country  including one in El Paso  Texas   A cardholder spent over  7 000 on 54 iPods for data storage even though such data could be stored using other  far less expensive alternatives   During the hearing  Norquist assured Committee members that he was working to ensure that all DHS cardholders  as well as those of agencies that fall under the jurisdiction of DHS  be required to follow guidelines set forth in a manual that is now applicable to only cardholders at DHS headquarters  Senators Collins and Lieberman have long pressed for the manual to be completed and implemented    In addition  Senators Collins and Lieberman pointed out that the GAO investigation illustrates why it is important for the Purchase Card Waste Elimination Act  which was coauthored by Senator Collins and cosponsored by Senator Lieberman and other Committee Members  be signed into law as quickly as possible  The bill was approved last month by the Senate and would require that the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  issue guidelines to assist agencies in improving the management of purchase card programs  that the General Services Administration identify additional opportunities to achieve savings  and that OMB report annually to Congress on the progress agencies are making on both of these fronts  The House has not yet acted on the bill                                                                         Browse by
