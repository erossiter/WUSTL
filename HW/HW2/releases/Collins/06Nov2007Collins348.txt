                                       November 6  2007 Washington  DC       U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R ME   Patrick Leahy  D ME    Judd Gregg  R NH   John Sununu  R NH   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Susan Collins  R ME   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Jack Reed  D RI   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI  and Christopher Dodd  D CT  sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson this week to approve the Northeast Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load cleanup plan  As part of the plan  the region requires enhanced federal guidelines for mercury pollution coming into the Northeast from other parts of the country   In recent years  the Northeastern states of Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut  and New York have drastically reduced mercury pollution from in state power plants  Yet the region fails to meet current EPA guidelines because of the mercury pollution brought in from neighboring states  Todays letter follows a similar plea made recently by the governors of the Northeastern states    The Northeastern states  including Maine  continue to be at end of the tailpipe of mercury  spewing coal fired power plants in the Midwest  said Snowe  Maine has led the way in reducing mercury emissions within the state  but we must see strong action on the part of the EPA to reduce mercury emissions that enter our state from sources in other states  The petition from the region clearly identifies that our State simply can not do anything more  The lax approach by EPA in regards to our national problem has failed to protect the health of our children  Maines natural resources and the economies that depend on them    Despite mercurys toxic effects  special interests have been able to impose a do nothing policy on the American people  said Leahy  Our region has long led the way in curbing mercury pollution  which is among the least controlled and most dangerous poisons threatening pregnant women and children  Because mercury pollution knows no borders  we need a sensible national approach to protect Vermonters and all Americans    Like other states in the Northeast  New Hampshires air quality is uniquely impacted by toxic emissions from coal fired power plants in the Midwest  especially mercury  Gregg said  In spite of some gains made at the state level  mercury emissions still pollute New Hampshires waterways  contaminate fish stocks  and pose a significant health risk  Federal action is required  and Im disappointed that the EPA has not more rigorously fulfilled its obligations under the Clear Air Act to reduce mercury emissions  As a first step  the EPA should approve the Northeast regional mercury plan  and it must also promulgate clean air regulations that benefit the environment  not dirty coal fired power plants  The toxicity of mercury to the health of humans and the environment has been documented time and again by scientists around the world  While state and federal regulations have made great strides combating high mercury levels in air and water sources  tougher federal standards are needed  Northeastern states have a plan to reduce mercury pollution and Administrator Johnson has the ability to implement these guidelines  I strongly urge him to put them in place   Mercury is a toxin that is extremely harmful to children and pregnant women  in particular  said Collins  Maines waterways are threatened by emissions from power plants located in other states  yet the EPAs current rules do little to address this serious problem  That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues in urging the EPA to approve the Northeast Regional Mercury TMDL to help reduce toxic mercury in our environment   Connecticut and its partner states in the Northeast have stepped forward with a plan to remove from the region s waters mercury pollution that is harming children and expectant mothers  said Lieberman  The least the EPA can do is to approve the states  plan   This is a national problem that demands a national response  said Reed  The EPA needs to lay out and enforce strict federal guidelines to prevent harmful pollutants like mercury from coming into the Northeast from other parts of the country   Rhode Island is working hard to keep poisonous mercury out of our air and water  but our people are still suffering from pollution from Midwestern power plants  said Whitehouse  a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  The Bush administration needs to stop blocking our states progress on pollution controls  and Ill keep fighting for higher emissions reductions standards to protect our health and environment and stop global climate change   Pollution knows no boundaries  said Dodd  While Connecticut and other Northeastern states have reduced mercury emissions by 70 percent between 1998 and 2002  our efforts to combat this dangerous toxin will be undermined if the EPA does not take critical action to regulate the mercury pollution entering the Northeast from other parts of the country    The following is a copy of the letter    Stephen Johnson  Administrator  Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Room 3426  Washington  DC  Dear Administrator Johnson   We are writing to request that you expeditiously approve the petition for the Northeast Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL     The Northeast states of Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut  and New York have drastically reduced mercury pollution in recent years  For example  between 1998 and 2002 state initiatives to reduce mercury pollution from municipal waste combustors and medical waste incinerators prevented 8 000 pounds of mercury pollution  Indeed  nearly all in region sources of mercury have been eliminated in the Northeast  While our States efforts are laudable and have produced tangible results  our federal standards have been virtually stagnant and maintained the status quo  Mercury is atmospherically deposited and it is becoming increasingly evident that for our states to comply with Section 303 d  of the Clean Water Act strong federal action that encompasses all of the States is essential    The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed scientific research demonstrating that maternal consumption of unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm resulting in children that suffer from learning disabilities  poor motor function  mental retardation  seizure disorders and cerebral palsy  This clearly impacts the health of our region  as well our economic wellbeing  Currently  six of the seven Northeast states have statewide freshwater fish consumption advisories directly as a result of mercury pollution  Currently 10 000 bodies of water as well as 46 000 miles of rivers in the Northeast are listed as impaired for fish consumption due to mercury pollution    On October 24th  the Northeast States submitted the Northeast Regional TMDL  which states  The Northeast regions ability to achieve the calculated TMDL allocations is dependent on the adoption and effective implementation of national and international programs to achieve necessary reductions in mercury emissions  As you know  mercury pollution originates from two major sources  wastewater discharge and atmospheric deposition  The Clean Air Mercury Rule  CAMR  insufficiently reduces emissions through atmospheric deposition and amounts to only 70 percent reduction by 2018  The CAMR will not allow our states to move forward with this TMDL  We therefore urge you to approve the Northeast Regional Mercury TMDL and again ask you to strongly consider reevaluating the CAMR and promulgate national rules consistent with the regions TMDL    Thank you for your serious consideration of our request  and we look forward to hearing your response at your earliest convenience
