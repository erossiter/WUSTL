                                     DHS agrees to Collins  recommendations to extend implementation   reestablish negotiated rulemaking committee  Collins pledges to continue working to help states with cost of compliance  March 8  2007 Washington  DC            The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  today announced its proposed rules for Real ID  which include an agreement the Department made with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  to give states more time to implement the new regulations  DHS also agreed to reestablish a rulemaking committee that Senator Collins had originally created in order to allow states and other interested parties to have a formal role in the rulemaking process  Senator Collins today called this agreement with DHS major progress  but also pledged to continue to work to help states with the cost of complying with the new law   These two major concessions by the Department   the extension for compliance and the reconvening of the negotiated rulemaking committee   are major steps forward  But they do not solve all of the issues and all of the problems with the Real ID Act  the biggest of which is the huge cost of compliance  said Senator Collins  I am pledging today to continue to work very closely with our state leaders and with DHS to calculate what the actual costs of compliance are going to be and to work to try to find some funding to assist states in the cost of compliance   Senator Collins had introduced an amendment in the Senate that called for extending the deadline by which states would need to comply with Real ID until two years after the final regulations were finalized  As a result of negotiations between Senator Collins and DHS  the Department agreed to allow states to request a deadline extension through December 31  2009  simply by stating that the Departments delay in promulgating final regulations has not allowed states enough time to consider the final rule  This agreement worked out by Senator Collins and DHS addresses one of the major problems that state leaders  the National Governors Association  and the National Conference of State Legislatures had identified with the Real ID Act  Without the delay  states would have been required to be in full compliance with Real ID by May 2008  even though DHS had yet to issue the regulations giving states detailed guidance on how to comply with law  The NGA and NCSL have supported Senator Collins efforts   This is significant progress  The Department has finally recognized that it was simply unfair to impose this burden on the states to set such an unrealistic compliance date when the Department had failed to issue the regulations  said Senator Collins  So the Department announced today that any state that seeks an additional two years to comply with the regulations will be granted that extension  This is major progress   Senator Collins amendment also called for the negotiated rulemaking committee  created under the Collins Lieberman Intelligence Reform Act of 2004  to be reconvened to provide comment to DHS on the proposed regulations  This committee was composed of federal officials  state officials   including Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap   and representatives from other interested parties  who were working to create standards that would provide secure identification without unduly burdening states and without threatening fundamental privacy protections  DHS agreed that it will invite the members of the negotiated rulemaking committee to the Department to provide oral comments on the proposed regulation   Following todays announcement by DHS  Senator Collins withdrew her amendment   To date  Congress has appropriated about  40 million to help states comply with the Real ID Act  The National Governors Association estimates the five year cost for states to comply with the law is  11 billion   Clearly if the costs do prove to be that high  we have an obligation to come forward and assist the states in the cost of compliance  said Senator Collins      Click picture to view video                                                                         Browse by
