                                     Weekly Column  July 21  2006 In the early 1920s  the great great grandfathers of Ron and Ruth Moir moved each of their families from Canada to Maine with the dream of becoming farmers  The wet springs and mild summers of Aroostook County were ideal conditions for growing many crops  but none more so than the potato  The two farmers built successful farms that flourished over the years  Four generations later  in the spirit of their ancestors  Ron and Ruth Moir established their own potato farm in Woodland  The couples three sons inherited that commitment to potato farming  and today  each of them also owns and operates a potato farm  The Moirs are just one family of so many families that are proud to carry on this tradition  The Maine Potato Board says that there are nearly 500 potato growers in our state  from the rolling fields of Aroostook County to the western mountain region around Bethel  In most cases  the fields that first blossomed with potato plants many years ago remain in family hands    I recently had the pleasure of honoring and reflecting on this proud history when I participated in the 59th Annual Potato Blossom Festival in Fort Fairfield  A couple of the many highlights of my trip included participating in the festival parade  as I do every year  and attending the potato industry dinner where I was pleased to help recognize Ron and Ruth Moir as Maines 2006 Farm Family of the Year by presenting them with a flag that flew in their honor over the U S  Capitol  I spoke with growers and other leaders in the potato industry  and I was reminded of the harvests that I participated in as a child growing up in the County   Maines potato industry has certainly faced many struggles since the Moirs ancestors planted their first potatoes  Even so  it remains the cornerstone of Maines natural resource based economy  Today  the industry accounts for more than 6 100 jobs and has an economic impact of over  500 million annually  We must foster this proud heritage by ensuring that Maines potato farmers continue to sustain and improve their crops  For this reason  I have worked to support funding and projects of particular interest and benefit to the potato industry  Notably  the Agricultural Appropriations bill that was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in late June included almost  6 million in funding that will directly benefit Maines agricultural interests  I worked for the inclusion of two research projects of importance to Maines potato farmers  the development of new potato varieties  and support for the USDAs Agricultural Research Service  ARS  New England Plant  Soil  and Water Laboratory at the University of Maine in Orono   The goal of the potato variety research is to identify improved varieties of seed potatoes for Maine and other North American markets that combine excellent quality with high yields and pest resistance  This project evaluates new potato varieties for everything from their chipping or fresh market potential to their resistance to pests and disease    The New England Plant  Soil and Water Laboratory has operated for more than 25 years and is particularly critical to Maines potato industry because it is the only ARS facility in New England  This allows the laboratory to conduct experiments addressing the unique challenges that face potato growers both in the region and across the country  The research performed at this laboratory will help improve rotation systems and management practices  find more efficient uses of nutrients and water  and develop better methods to control insects and weed growth     These initiatives are of paramount importance if we are to maintain Maines high standards for the health and quality of our potato crops  The vitality of this industry depends on the ongoing efforts undertaken farmers  scientists and the federal government    I would like to congratulate all who participated in this years Potato Blossom Festival for making it a wonderful event again this year  As the Moir family and other Maine potato growers look forward to a successful and bountiful harvest this year  I will continue to work in Congress to secure the resources and fundingneeded to help ensure that this proud family farming heritage continues to thrive
