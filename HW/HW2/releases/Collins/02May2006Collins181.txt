                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May 2  2006 Washington  D C   Port security legislation authored by Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R ME   Senator Patty Murray  D WA   Ranking Committee Member Joe Lieberman  D CT  and Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  passed the Committee today and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate  Entitled the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  the bill would implement needed security reforms at our nations seaports  including establishing improved cargo screening standards  providing incentives to importers to enhance their security measures and ensuring the successful resumption of shipping in the event of a terrorist attack  Similar legislation  modeled after the Collins Murray legislation  recently passed a House panel    The Committee also approved a measure offered by Senators Collins and Lieberman that would pilot an integrated scanning system to cover 100 percent of containers bound for the United States from three foreign ports within one year  As amended  the language would allow for the expansion of the pilot program as soon as practicable and possible    For years we ve known that our ports are vulnerable  and even the 9 11 Commission identified them as a possible target for terrorists  The American people need to know that our ports are secure and the cargo entering our country is safe  no matter whose hands it may have passed through  Senator Murray said  This is precisely why Senator Collins and I introduced the GreenLane Act  I applaud Committee passage of our legislation and I look forward to bringing it to the floor of the Senate where we can move ahead and ensure the safety of our residents and the strength of our economy   Experts have repeatedly told me and members of the committee that our ports are one of our biggest vulnerabilities  Our bill will help build a coordinated approach to maritime and port security across all levels of government and with our overseas trading partners  said Senator Collins  In addition toimprovingour nations security  it willexpedite trade with foreign governments and businesses  and provide financial assistance to our ports as they strive to strengthen their terrorism prevention and response effort  The enactment of these reforms will ensure that cargo containers entering our ports do not become the Trojan horses of the 21st century   The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act serves as another building block in our effort to protect our national and economic security before terrorists strike  said Senator Lieberman  Prior to 9 11  the system for international trade was predicated on efficiency  moving millions of tons of goods across our borders or through our ports every day  Since then  weve been working to inject security into that equation without causing the very economic harms terrorists have in mind  Programs like the Container Security Initiative and the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism have provided a foundation for a layered security system at our ports and throughout the global supply chain  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act builds on that foundation   I am pleased that this bill provides practical solutions for the gaps in our nations port security by putting a focus on detection without impeding the flow of commerce  said Senator Coleman  Most importantly  this bill includes a critical section that requires DHS to implement three full scale operational pilot programs of the 100 percent scanning system  At the conclusion of these pilots  DHS will report on how to expand its findings to all international ports  This is a tremendous step forward  and I will stay on top of this issue to ensure DHS moves out aggressively to implement this system   The Committee held a hearing on The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act in April  in which the directors of both the Portland  Maine  and Seattle  Washington  port authorities voiced the urgent need for enhanced security at our seaports  These sentiments were echoed by officials from the Department of Homeland Security  The hearing came at the heels of the third major incident since January 2005 of Chinese nationals arriving undetected at a U S  port in a sealed cargo container  This event  as well as the Dubai Ports World contract  underscores the flaws in our current maritime security structure and the need for comprehensive legislation to address these concerns   Approximately 95 percent of our nations overseas trade  worth nearly  1 trillion  enters or leaves through our seaports  Foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approximately 800 million tons of goods that come into our country  In fiscal year 2005 alone  more than eleven million containers arrived on American soil by sea and this number is growing at a rate of over 10 percent a year  While this figure represents robust trade  it also signals a considerable risk to our nations security    Specifically  the bill would    Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability    Help prevent a lengthy shutdown of America s seaports in the event of an incident  protecting America s economy from severe disruption    Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient   Push the borders out so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo   The bill improves security at America s ports by establishing   The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest  level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures   Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs   The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures  regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies   Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level   The Act also authorizes port security grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT  and authorizes  835 million for port security generated through the collection of customs fees                                                                       Browse by
