                                     Emergency funds would help needy Maine families prepare for winter September 24  2007 Washington  DC         In order to help low income families fill their oil tanks before the arrival of cold winter weather  U S  Senator Susan Collins today sent a letter to Jim Nussle  Director of the Office of Management and Budget  requesting the release of  151 5 million that remains in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund    The end of summer  and the eventual arrival of cold winter weather  will result in an increased demand for heating oil  It is likely that this demand will cause prices to rise as well  The immediate release of these funds will help our neediest citizens fill their oil tanks now  and will be a more efficient use of these funds     Each year  4 5 million low income families  including about 46 450 households in Maine  rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes  LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs    The following is Senator Collins full letter to Director Nussle    The Honorable Jim Nussle Director Office of Management and Budget Old Executive Office Building Washington  DC 20503  Dear Director Nussle   Congratulations on your recent confirmation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget  Given the depth of budgetary challenges facing this nation  it has never been more important to have an individual as qualified and accomplished as yourself leading the office    I am writing to ask you to release the remaining  151 5 million in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund  If the Administration fails to release the remaining funding   131 million of that balance will expire on September 30    In Maine  we frequently get our first snowfall in October  Temperatures are already dropping into the thirties in parts of the state and frosts as early as late August are common in Northern Maine  One of the most important ways to help people get through Maine s winters is to start making assistance available prior to the arrival of cold weather    In the 2006  2007 heating season  Maines LIHEAP program provided support to more than 46 000 households  Maine experienced a record high number of service shut offs  and the average household heating costs rose  400 per customer  This all means that Maines low income households are facing a severe hardship catching up from last winters heating bills  coping with impending and actual shutoff of service  and preparing for the 2007  2008 winter season  The LIHEAP funds could be used to allow our most vulnerable citizens to have at least some heating oil in their tanks prior to the arrival of cold temperatures  Since heating oil prices frequently rise with the arrival of cold  releasing these funds now would not only provide the most benefit for our neediest citizens  but would also be a more efficient use of funds    I ask that you release the remaining LIHEAP funds in order to help low income families fill their tanks with home heating oil before the arrival of fall and cold weather  I believe that this funding would not only be extremely important to help our most vulnerable citizens address high energy prices and cold weather this fall and winter  but would also provide for a more efficient use of funds  In contrast  if we allow these funds to expire  we will have lost an opportunity to help struggling citizens during this difficult period of high energy prices   LIHEAP is especially critical as the Nation struggles with an explosion in energy prices  For low income families and people on fixed incomes  it can be extremely difficult to meet rising energy prices  Too many Maine families are literally forced to choose between buying groceries or heating their home    Thank you for your consideration                                                                             Browse by
