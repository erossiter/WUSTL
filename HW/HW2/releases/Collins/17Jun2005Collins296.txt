                                     Sen Collins Works to Make Additional Information More Accessible to the Public June 17  2005  WASHINGTON  DC     Senator Susan Collins has provided Maine   s community groups with an interest in the base closure and realignment  BRAC  process  the Maine and New Hampshire governors and congressional delegations  and BRAC Commission Analysts for Maine   s bases with a disk containing thousands of pages of BRAC related documents that she received as a result of the subpoena she issued to obtain the documents  In addition  Senator Collins has directed her staff to create a database to make it easier for these individuals and groups to access this useful and crucial information         In a memo to community groups and the Maine and New Hampshire delegations  Senator Collins said that she would be immediately sending disks containing information that she received as the result of the subpoena that she  as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  and ranking member Joseph Lieberman issued to the Department of Defense on June 7   In addition  information released to date by the Department and posted on its website is difficult to access and in some cases  impossible to search  So Senator Collins has been working to create a system whereby individuals can search for specific information        The text of Senator Collins    memo is as follows             M E M O R A N D U M      TO    Kittery Portsmouth Community Group    Brunswick Task Force    Grow DFAS Limestone    Maine Congressional Delegation    New Hampshire Congressional Delegation    Governor Baldacci    Governor Lynch    BRAC Commission Analysts for DFAS Limestone  PNSY  and BNAS      FROM  Senator Susan Collins      RE   Additional Documents to Share Search Capabilities      DATE   June 17  2005                                                                                                                                                                      The Department of Defense  DoD  has produced thousands of pages of documents  and posted thousands more on its webpage  in response to the subpoena that Senator Lieberman and I issued last week   In total  DoD has posted approximately 25 million pieces of information in hundreds of specific documents on its webpage   Although the documents are organized by broad categories  they can only be searched one at a time   For technical reasons  a significant portion of these documents  approximately 20 percent  cannot be searched using a standard search function and need to be read manually          Staff searched various categories of documents  posted by DoD as of June 15  relevant to Brunswick Naval Air Station  Kittery Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  and DFAS Limestone   Because of the technical issue noted above  the searches cover approximately 80 percent of the relevant pages on the website   The results are set forth on a CD that is being delivered or sent via FedEx to you today        In addition  we have been working to find a way to conduct quick  reliable searches across the entire set of documents made available by DoD   Staff from my office  including technical support professionals  are creating a searchable database of all relevant BRAC documents   We expect it to be operational by early next week for documents disclosed by DoD as of June 9   We will add to the database over the course of the week         In response to the subpoena  we have also received disks containing thousands of pages of additional information  which we also plan to add to our database   In the coming days  we expect to receive more information from DoD   Once we have all of the DoD webpage and supplemental documents in our database  we should be able to conduct searches capable of identifying files containing particular terms or using a variety of other search parameters   We are in the process of determining how to maximize accessibility of these search capabilities          We will continue to share with you whatever relevant information we discover and encourage you to continue letting us know what additional and specific data we need from DOD to help make our case        Finally  earlier this week  both Senator Lieberman and I met with Secretary Gordon England who promised the Department  s continuing cooperation   I specifically asked Secretary England to make available the Department analysts who were most involved in the decisions on our bases and the DFAS Center   He agreed to do so
