                                      December 7  2005 Washington  D C      WASHINGTON  DC A recent report issued by the National Postal Policy Council concludes that the price of first class mail would be 10 20 percent higher if postal reform legislation is not enacted  Postage payments for the next 10 years will be meaningfully smaller under either the House  HR 22  or the Senate  S  662  bill  with those under the Senate bill smaller than those under the House bill  the report found  Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Thomas Carper  D DE  are the authors of the Senate postal reform legislation         Senator Collins said  The U S  Postal Service is the lynchpin of a  9 billion dollar industry that provides 9 million jobs nationwide  It is important to our economy  but under its current business model  the Postal Services financial future is not viable  It is crucial for our nations economy and for the future of the U S  Postal Service that the Collins Carper legislation be enacted      The National Postal Policy Councils report is as follows        First Class Mail Postage Costs with and without Reform          Prepared for the National Postal Policy Council      by SLS Consulting  Inc      Lawrence  G  Buc       September 26  2005         First Class Mail Postage Costs with and without Reform          RESULTS       Enactment of postal reform legislation is likely to have a dramatic effect on postage payments for those who mail First Class Mail  Postage payments for the next 10 years will be meaningfully smaller under either the House  HR 22  or the Senate  S  662  bill  with those under the Senate bill smaller than those under the House bill  As Figure 1 below shows  postage savings for First Class mailers could be quite significant        The postage savings is due to the net USPS cost savings from lifting the escrow and changing the retiree benefit payment mechanisms as prescribed by H R  22 and S  662 as well as implementation of a CPI based rate indexing system beginning in 2008        Figure 1  Estimate of Potential 2006 15 Savings From Postal Reform for First Class Mailers  Millions of Dollars                METHODS       SLS modeled First Class Mail postage over ten year  from 2006 to 2015  both with and without reform  For the reform cases  we used the provisions of H R  22 as passed by the House and the provisions of S  662 as unanimously reported to the floor by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  We modeled postage costs for mailers with annual volumes of 50 million  100 million  250 million  and 500 million pieces of First Class Mail per year        KEY ASSUMPTIONS       Like any model  our model embodies a number of important assumptions  Changes in these assumptions would lead to changes in our results        Annual mail volume was disaggregated by rate category based upon proportions from the Postal Services FY 2004 First Class Mail Billing Determinants report              2006 postage for all cases are based upon the rates proposed by the Postal Service in the current rate case  Docket No  R2005 1              With or without reform  the Service increases rates again on January 1  2007  Based upon a statement made by Jim Miller  Chair  USPS Board of Governors    without reform  rates will be increase by mid single digits in 2007  the model assumes that  without reform  the 2007 rate increase will be six percent  With reform  rates will increase less due to the rate relief provided by the reform legislation under consideration  The magnitude of this relief was developed based upon USPS cost estimates              After 2006  the model assumes that  with reform  postage will increase annually at the rate of CPI  Without reform  postage will increase annually at the rate of CPI 1             The model assumes that the percentage rate increase for Single Piece and Workshared First Class Mail will be the same in any given year and will be so either with or without legislation  This assumes that either with or without reform  Single Piece and Workshared mail will maintain their current rate relationship and that the worksharing provisions of the bills do not affect rates  If  in fact  the rate relationship changes dramatically between Single Piece and Workshared First Class Mail  savings from reform will be affected and could be either greater or smaller than those shown in the figure above  However  given that these rate relationships have been relatively stable  we considered the assumption we selected to be reasonable and appropriate                                                                       Browse by                                                                                  Current record
