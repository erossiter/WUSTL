possible     said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement           We are pleased that our colleagues have recognized the importance of these projects to the state of Maine  These dollars will provide benefits throughout the state and enable the Maine Department of Transportation to undertake a many of its highest priorities     the Senators added      We are also pleased that this legislation updates the manner in which the Department of Transportation calculates how much money each state will receive from the highway trust fund  This update will provide Maine with a much

program known as CMAQ  which is a program within the Highway Trust Fund    Because of this  Maine needs to receive an exemption to use CMAQ funds to pay for the Downeaster   In this bill  an amendment offered by Senators Snowe and Collins was adopted and extends that exemption until the expiration of the legislation  in September of 2009                 In addition  at the request of Senators Snowe and Collins  the Highway Bill also designates the route from Calais  Maine to Watertown  New York as a    High Priority Corridor     which will make that east west route eligible to receive additional funding in future appropriations bills under the Federal Highway Administration   s National Highway System  Surface Transportation  and Bridge Programs         Prior to the passage of this bill  every other region of the United States had a designated High Priority Corridor except the Northeastern U S   despite the tremendous volume of trade that is transshipped through our ports and across our northern border with Canada                                                                                  Browse by
