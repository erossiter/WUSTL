                                      March 16  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  Senator Susan Collins requested an increase in the maximum Pell Grant award from  4 310 to  5 100  Senator Collins co authored the letter with Senator Russ Feingold  D WI   A bipartisan group of over 35 senators has signed the letter   College costs have sky rocketed  while Pell Grants have failed to keep up with the increase  noted Senator Collins  In 1975  the maximum Pell Grant represented approximately 80  of the costs of a four year public institution  However  in 2006  the maximum award would only cover about 33   This recommended increase in Pell Grants will help make post secondary more affordable   Below is the text of a letter sent to Senator Kent Conrad  Chairman and Senator Judd Gregg  Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee   Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg   As the Senate Budget Committee begins consideration of the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution  we write to indicate our support for an increase in the maximum  Pell Grant award from  4 310 to  5 100  and strongly urge you to provide that increase in your budget assumptions for the program this year  Proposals over the past year from various groups and constituencies including the Commission on the Future of Higher Education  the President  and members of both parties of Congress  demonstrate broad  bipartisan support for an increase the maximum Pell Grant award  While we are strongly supportive of an increase in the Pell Grant  we urge the Budget Committee to ensure that the increase in Pell Grants does not come at the expense of other important need based programs like the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program  SEOG   the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership program  LEAP  or the Perkins Loan Revolving Fund program   We were pleased that the maximum Pell Grant award received its first boost in four years to  4 310 in the recently enacted Joint Funding Resolution for FY 2007  This is a good step in the right direction  but more needs to be done to boost need based aid for low income students if we are to continue to address the college access issues facing many low income Americans   As college costs have increased  the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has continued to decline over the years  In 1975  the maximum Pell Grant represented approximately 80  of the costs of attending a four year public institution  But in 2001 2002 the maximum Pell Grant covered only 42  of those costs  and by 2005 2006 it covered just 33   Consequently  an increasing number of students are turning to private loans to cover the costs of higher education  According to the College Board  the amount of private student loans grew about 27  every year between the years of 2000 2001 and 2005 2006  Congress needs to  do more to boost need based aid so that students are not forced to take on unmanageable levels of debt   We also urge you to protect and support other need based aid programs like SEOG and the Perkins Loan Revolving Fund  We have heard from a number of our constituents who are supportive of an increase in the Pell Grant maximum award  but who caution against paying for the increase in Pell by cutting SEOG and Perkins Revolving Fund  two programs that serve similar student populations as the Pell  We believe there are other fiscally responsible ways to pay for an increase in the Pell program without having to resort to cutting these other critical education programs  Therefore  we urge the Budget Committee to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to  5 100  while also rejecting the cuts to SEOG  LEAP and the Perkins Loan program in its budget assup1ptions for FY 2008   We thank you for considering our request and look forward to working with you to make higher education more affordable for all Americans
