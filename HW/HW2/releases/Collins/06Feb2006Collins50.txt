                                     Senators  Federal Coordinator Needs Stronger Authority to Implement Recovery   Rebuilding Plan February 6  2006  Washington  DC     Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT   the Chairman and Ranking Member respectively of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  today wrote a letter to President Bush urging him to broaden the existing authority of the Federal Coordinator for the Recovery and Rebuilding of the Gulf Coast Region   Senators Collins and Lieberman say  given the enormity of the recovery and reconstruction needed along the coast and the number of agencies involved  that the Federal Coordinator  Donald Powell  should have a central role not just in coordinating and communicating federal policy  but also in ensuring its proper implementation  They say Powell needs authority to tailor bureaucratic procedures to the pressing realities on the gulf coast   Powell recently told Committee investigators that        I am the President   s eyes and ears but not his arms      Senators Collins and Lieberman are leading the Senate investigation into the government   s preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina   To date  they have held 15 Committee hearings to examine the issue and are expected to hold several more before the end of the month      In addition to Senators Collins and Lieberman  Senators Norm Coleman  R MN   Tom Coburn  R OK   and David Vitter  R LA  also signed the letter   The following is the text of the letter to President Bush     Dear Mr  President        As part of its ongoing examination into the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina  the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a field hearing in Gulfport  Mississippi and toured New Orleans on January 17  2006   The Committee received testimony at the hearing from Donald Powell  the Federal Coordinator for the Recovery and Rebuilding of the Gulf Coast Region   Based on what we heard from Mr  Powell and others at the hearing  as well as the devastation the Committee witnessed first hand throughout the Gulf Coast  we are writing to urge you to broaden the Federal Coordinator   s authority so that he might more effectively direct the federal government   s reconstruction and rebuilding activities      It is clear that in scope and complexity  the task of rebuilding the Gulf Coast remains staggering   The destruction caused by Katrina has created what many believe to be the worst humanitarian crisis in our country since the Great Depression   Some progress has been made in removing debris  returning basic services to local communities  and providing short term assistance to residents   Yet the job of longer term reconstruction has     Page 1 of 2    Page 2 of 2       barely begun   Entire communities remain completely destroyed more than five months after the storm   In many areas there is little sign of rebuilding  and enormous piles of debris continue to slow these efforts      While local officials expressed gratitude for the public and private aid that has come from so many quarters  they also described mounting frustration with bureaucracy and delay regarding a range of federal programs crucial to rebuilding   They told us of difficulty in understanding and accessing many such programs and of decision making that seems needlessly complex and delayed   As the mayor of Bay St  Louis succinctly put it     Life is already too complicated for those in need      With their futures uncertain  some residents of the Gulf Coast are losing hope      Given the enormity of the task and the many agencies involved at all levels of government  we support strengthening the authority of the Federal Coordinator to oversee the federal government   s role in rebuilding the Gulf Coast region   Your executive order establishing the Federal Coordinator office provides that it is the    policy of the United States to provide effective  integrated  and fiscally responsible support from across the Federal Government to support       recovery and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast region            It states that the first function of the Federal Coordinator is    to ensure the proper implementation    of that policy   The executive order thus appears to recognize  and properly so in our view  that the Federal Coordinator should have a central role not just in coordinating and communicating federal policy  but also in its implementation      Our concern is that the Federal Coordinator lacks adequate authority to accomplish the policy stated   We have no doubt that Mr  Powell brings commitment and sound fiscal and managerial experience to the position   We also know he has your confidence   The problem is that he appears to have little real authority to drive policy or to require federal agencies to tailor bureaucratic processes to the pressing realities of the Gulf Coast region   The relevant agencies shall    respond promptly    to the Federal Coordinator   s requests and    provide information    and    cooperate    with him  but his authority over them goes no further   As Mr  Powell recounted  the Federal Coordinator can gather information  put together proposals  and identify shortcomings  but he cannot force agencies to streamline wasteful  time consuming contracting practices nor require the harmonization of programs among federal agencies that may be working at cross purposes   As Mr  Powell aptly summarized it     I am the President   s eyes and ears but not his arms      Months after the storm  it should be apparent that this arrangement is not adequate given the enormous tasks at hand      We urge you to broaden the Federal Coordinator   s authority over federal agencies so that he may carry out his reconstruction duties more effectively and thereby improve the federal government   s overall response in the Gulf Coast   We encourage you to do so as promptly as possible  given the pressing nature of the task ahead                                                                         Browse by
