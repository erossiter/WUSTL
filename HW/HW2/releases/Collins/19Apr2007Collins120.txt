                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Road Ahead  Implementing Postal Reform April 19  2007  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has invested a great deal of time and effort on the issue of postal reform  This process  which began in 2002  included numerous hearings and close consultation with the entire range of experts and stakeholders  from the managers of the United States Postal Service and employee unions to non profit organizations and other members of the mailing community     I was proud to stand alongside Senator Carper last December as the President signed the postal reform legislation that bears our names into law  Through the long and complex process of crafting this comprehensive modernization of the Postal Service  it became clear to us why postal reform is enacted only every 30 years     But enacting legislation is only part of the equation  The other is implementation  and that is why we are here today  Although the issues that we confronted were many and complex  our purpose was straightforward  to position the Postal Service for the 21st Century  to ensure the affordable universal service that is essential to the American people  and to strengthen a service that is the linchpin of a  900  billion mailing industry that employs 9 million Americans in fields as diverse as direct mailing  printing  catalog production  paper manufacturing  and financial services  The health of the Postal Service is essential to the vitality of thousands of companies and the millions that they employ  as well as to the more than 750 000 postal employees     Given the important contributions of the mailing industry to the Postal Service and our economy  I am particularly concerned by the sudden and sharp rate increases proposed by the Postal Regulatory Commission for Standard Mail flats  These proposed rates could drive smaller catalog companies out of business or at least undermine their profitability  This is exactly the kind of double digit  unpredictable jump in rates that our reform bill was designed to prevent     Let me illustrate the damage this proposal will cause to the catalog mailing industry with some examples from my home state of Maine  Geiger Brothers  a family business in Lewiston  is a manufacturer  supplier  and distributor of catalogs  calendars  and a wide variety of other printed materials  including the world famous Farmers Almanac  This company estimates this decision would cause an increase in mailing costs of 29 percent  This proposed increase would cost Geiger Brothers an additional  600 000 this year     Another fine Maine company  Cuddledown is a nationally renown manufacturer of luxury down comforters and other high quality bedding products with a heavy reliance on mail orders  This family owned business  located in Portland  estimates that this proposal would increase its mailing costs by 18 percent     I have also heard from L L  Bean  Maines legendary outdoor outfitter and a world leader in catalog sales  which would be negatively affected by the rate increase and may need to reduce its mailings in order to maintain postage costs at a sustainable level     These unexpected and steep increases will cause similar harm to catalog mailing businesses throughout the nation  Not surprisingly  the comments filed in response to the proposed rates indicate that this increase will cost jobs and stifle economic growth of companies vital to communities throughout our country     In addition to the concerns I have with the current proposed rate increase  I would strongly discourage the Postal Service from filing a final rate case under the old rate setting rules before postal reform is fully implemented  Filing a new rate case would divert resources and effort from developing a modern system of rate regulations as required under the new postal reform law     I look forward to the testimony we will hear today concerning how the PRC and the Postal Service are working to ensure predictability and stability in the rate setting process and implementing other core principles of the postal reform act                                                                       Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Current record
