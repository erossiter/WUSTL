                                     Senators ask FERC to reject proposal that would increase rates  12 15 billion for New England July 5  2005  Washington  DC     Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins today pressed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to reject a proposal that could increase electricity rates in New England by  12 billion to  15 billion over the next five years   The Senators oppose the Location Installed Capacity  LICAP  proposal  which is currently being considered by FERC as a way to encourage power plant owners and utilities to build new power plants and upgrade existing systems to in order to generate sufficient levels of electricity for New England   The Senators wrote in a letter to FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher that it is imperative to consider alternative proposals that will allow Maine and New England to meet its electricity needs in a more cost effective and responsible way           Under this proposal existing electricity generators will receive economic benefits without any assurance that they will in fact invest in new capacity for their customers in New England  yet it will cost Maine homeowners and businesses upwards of a billion dollars     said the Senators in a joint statement      Our region and our ratepayers cannot afford these extraordinary increases on top of already rising electric bills due to higher fuel charges  transmission upgrades  and other system costs           All six of New England   s governors  utility commissions  and attorney   s general  as well as Maine   s Public Advocate  business owners  and trade associations also oppose the LICAP proposal        The following is the full text of the joint letter by Senators Snowe and Collins       Dear Mr  Chairman        We are writing to express our deep concern over the Locational Installed Capacity     LICAP     proposal currently pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC   Devon Power LLC  et al   Docket No  ER03 563 030    This proposal  as defined by the FERC Administrative Law Judge in her June 15  2005    Initial Decision     could impose between  12 billion and  15 billion in additional electricity rates on New England over just the next five years according to estimates by ISO New England   Our region and our ratepayers cannot afford these extraordinary increases on top of already rising electric bills due to higher fuel charges  transmission upgrades  and other system costs  with virtually no assurance that the additional generating capacity they are intended to incentivize will actually be built   It is imperative that FERC consider alternative proposals that will allow our region to meet its electricity needs in a more cost effective and responsible way   In making this request  we join with all six of New England   s Governors  Utility Commissions  and Attorneys General  as well as Maine  s Public Advocate  business owners and trade associations in opposition to the pending LICAP proposal        The purported intention of LICAP is to provide incentives for power plant owners and utilities to add power plants and implement system improvements so as to promote electric reliability  Yet  these payments go to existing generators with no requirement that those generators invest in new capacity   While we understand that it is FERC   s intention that these payments serve as a    market signal    to encourage new investment  there is no assurance that such investments will be made and  in fact  existing generators may have a disincentive to make such investments because their LICAP payments will decrease if new capacity is built   And  while we also understand that part of the purpose of this proceeding was to ensure that existing generation units needed for system reliability during periods of high demand would receive sufficient funds  the initial decision rejected that portion of the ISO   s proposal that would have helped ensure that these units actually fulfilled this role       Throughout this proceeding numerous alternatives have been proposed by New England representatives that would help ensure that New England meets its electrical needs with less cost and uncertainty than embodied in the LICAP proposal   These alternatives have been summarily rejected by FERC and by the ALJ   For example  the    Summary and Conclusion    of the June 15  2005 Initial Decision begins with rejection of ten separate alternatives  including delaying LICAP until needed transmission upgrades are in place  as    impermissible collateral attacks on the Commission   s previous orders in this case          We therefore appeal directly to you and your fellow commissioners to reevaluate the LICAP concept  and allow New England to propose alternatives that will keep our region economically viable and ensure that additional capacity is truly available  when and where it is needed
