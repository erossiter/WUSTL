                                     ITC Examining Whether Unfair Trade with China Has Harmed Maine Paper Industry Senator Collins recently testified before the International Trade Commission regarding the American paper industry  October 18  2007  Recently  Senator Collins testified before the International Trade Commission during a hearing to discuss whether the governments of China  Korea  and Indonesia have illegally subsidized their paper industries and adversely affected the paper industry in Maine and throughout the nation  Senator Collins was invited to testify before the government panel because of her leadership in working to ensure that the paper industry has the ability to compete with foreign producers on a level playing field  She also worked to encourage the ITC to consider this particular issue     Excerpts of Senator Collins testimonyare as follows     Our nation s manufacturers and their employees can compete against the best in the world  but they cannot compete against nations that provide huge subsidies and other unfair advantages to their producers  Time and time again  I hear from Maine manufacturers whose efforts to compete successfully in the global economy simply cannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing and subsidies of nations such as China  The results of these unfair practices are lost jobs  shuttered factories  and decimated communities     Over the past decade China has undergone a significant economic transformation  and today China s economy is no longer completely owned and controlled by the government  The problem is not China s economic liberalization and modernization  however  The problem is that while China is becoming a key international economic player  it has repeatedly refused to comply with standard international trading rules and practices  These violations include the use of subsidies and other economic incentives that are designed to give its producers an unfair competitive advantage     I have long been a proponent of applying our nations countervailing duty laws to China  For the past four years  I have introduced a bipartisan  bicameral bill called the Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act to ensure that the Department of Commerce treats countervailing duty petitions filed against China the same way as the Department does in cases filed against our other trading partners  I have been concerned for many years by this unequal treatment     I was very pleased when  on November 22  2006  the Department of Commerce finally accepted the first countervailing duty petition against a non market economy since the 1986 court decision  This is the case you are considering today filed by NewPage Corporation  a coated free sheet paper company with operations in Maine  Ohio  Michigan  Kentucky  and Maryland  Despite its efficient  state of the art mills  skilled and dedicated employees  strong relationships with customers  strategically located mills and distribution facilities and growing markets for its products  NewPage has been forced to curb its production lines as a result of unfair foreign competition     U S  paper mills  including several mills in Maine  enjoy a huge competitive advantage over producers in other parts of the world  In Maine  we have an abundant supply of the primary renewable resource    timber    which produces very high quality pulp for paper production  We have ample hydroelectric power to run our mills  and we have the best trained  the most efficient  and most dedicated paper workers     With this winning combination  U S  producers should easily succeed in this market  but instead we have witnessed large market share increases from countries like China that don t even produce their own pulp  There is a reason for that  China cheats  The government of China has targeted its domestic coated paper industry with subsidies that have directly hurt U S  producers like NewPage     In the NewPage case  the Department of Commerce found in its recent investigation that China has used a number of subsidies considered illegal under WTO rules to give its paper industry an advantageThe result is that in the United States  Chinese coated free sheet imports have increased by an average 75 percent annually over the past four years  despite the Chinese having to ship their products thousands of miles to reach the U S  market     Unfair trade practices in China and other countries have had a tremendous negative effect on many industries in Maine  The pulp and paper industry in Maine has often been referred to as the backbone of my State s economy  and with good reason  The industry contributes nearly  1 5 billion to the state s GDP every year  In total  the pulp and paper industry accounts for 22 percent of all manufacturing wages in the state  In some communities  the mill can represent 60 80 percent of total tax revenues and be the only major employer in the whole community     When machines or mills are shut down  it is  quite simply  devastating  And Maine has lost nearly 600 jobs in the coated free sheet  uncoated free sheet and uncoated groundwood sectors due to machine and mill closures over the last five years  This means the loss not only of the jobs of the paper workers themselves  but also the jobs that are dependent on these primary jobs  For every job directly lost at a paper mill  another 2 3 jobs are indirectly affected  including transportation and service related jobs     Three producers in Maine make coated free sheet paper  NewPage has a mill in Rumford  Maine  Verso Paper has two mills  one in Bucksport and one in Jay  Maine  And Sappi Fine Paper North America has two mills  one in Westbrook and the other in Skowhegan  Maine  Altogether  some 4 000 workers in Maine derive their employment from the production of coated free sheet paper  I am very proud of these producers  The mills are efficient and up to date  They employ sustainable forestry practices that ensure a viable long term supply of timber  while protecting our environment  But I am deeply worried  Already  Sappi shut down one of its coated free sheet machines in Westbrook  Maine  NewPage had a temporary shut down of one of its machines in Rumford during the first quarter of this year  These mills need to have a healthy rate of return that will not only allow them to stay in business  but to be able to invest in upgrades and the latest production technologies  In a capital intensive industry like this one  capital investment is critical     I also am concerned that without offsetting duties to counteract the unfair trade  we might see a continued tidal wave of imports  particularly from China  The industry has provided you with data that shows that between now and the end of 2009  the Chinese industry will add some three million tons of new coated free sheet capacity  This is the equivalent of one half of all U S  production in 2006     Given these circumstances  I urge you to consider the record carefully  as I believe you will find that if the violations of international trading rules and practices are not properly addressed  Maine s proud tradition of the pulp and paper industry could ultimately be lost to unfairly advantaged foreign competition     Thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you today    Click picture to view video
