                                      September 21  2006 WASHINGTON  D C The New York Times today published an article detailing the current effort in Congress to pass chemical security legislation  In June  the Senate Homeland Security Committee  chaired by Senator Susan Collins  unanimously passed the Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act  which would require that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  establish and enforce mandatory security standards at our nations chemical facilities to guard against potential terrorist threats  The bill would give DHS new authority to shut down facilities that failed to meet these standards     The following is the article that appeared in todays New York Times     September 21  2006    By  WASHINGTON  Sept  20  After nearly five years of debate over whether the chemical industry should be required to protect plants better against a terrorist attack  a fierce struggle is going on behind the scenes in Congress to deal with what is considered one of the nations most serious vulnerabilities  The clash  which could be resolved as soon as Thursday  is testing the balance of power not just between  and   but also between rival Republicans in the House and the Senate and between environmentalists and the chemical industry  all of whom have dug in to defend their views  But the Bush administration  the chemical industry  Democrats  Republicans and environmentalists do agree on one important point  voluntary measures put into place by the industry after the 2001 terrorist attacks are not enough  An analysis by the  found 272 chemical plants nationwide at which an attack or accident could affect at least 50 000 people and an additional 3 400 plants at which more than 1 000 people were at risk  In too many cases  everyone agreed  plants have not complied with the voluntary standards requiring them to evaluate vulnerabilities to a terror attack and to take steps to eliminate them  like installing fences  cameras or other security measures  As recently as Tuesday  it looked as if the chemical industry  with the assistance of Senator George V  Voinovich  Republican of Ohio  was on its way to winning approval for regulations that echoed almost word for word what the industry had been seeking  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff would have been authorized to establish regulations requiring security measures  but the regulations would have applied only to a sliver of facilities that manufacture  use or store toxic chemicals and that are deemed to have the highest levels of security risk  Mr  Chertoff would not have had the power to shut down plants not in compliance  The proposal would also have left decisions about security plans entirely up to these high risk plants  Nothing in this section authorizes the secretary directly or indirectly to require any particular security measure  the proposed language said  That wording had been endorsed by 34 senators  all but one Republicans  in a letter that Mr  Voinovich circulated Monday  But Democrats  and some Republicans  said the proposed regulation was far too friendly to the industry  This closed door deal is industry written and incomplete  Senator   Democrat of New Jersey  said in a statement Wednesday  Americans shouldnt be fooled that this will protect them from a terrorist attack on a chemical plant  We need stronger measures that will force the industry to take this issue seriously  Industry officials acknowledge that they were pleased with the proposal by Mr  Voinovich  and they have been lobbying intensely to get it passed  It is short  simple and effective  said Margaret Hunt  a lobbyist for the Edison Electric Institute  which is helping a broad range of companies that would be affected by the regulations monitor the negotiations  We kind of like it  Approval of the industry backed measure is now in question because of objections raised by Senator  of Maine  Representative Peter T  King of New York  and  of New Hampshire  all Republicans who hold powerful positions  Ms  Collins and Mr  King are the leaders of the Senate and House committees that oversee the Homeland Security Departments operations  and Mr  Gregg is chairman of the Senate panel that oversees its budget  and thus controls the bill into which Republicans want to include some form of regulations  Mr  Gregg said in an interview Wednesday that the Republicans organized by Mr  Voinovich must come to an agreement with Mr  King  Ms  Collins and others with oversight authority before any language would go into the budget bill  He said he hoped to have a final agreement on the Department of Homeland Security budget bill in time for it to win final passage by Congress before it goes on recess this month until after the midterm elections  Mr  King and Ms  Collins want the proposed regulation changed so it applies to all chemical plants that are at high risk  instead of just the highest  spokesmen for the two said  They want the Homeland Security Department to inspect plants to ensure compliance and shut any that do not honor the rules  They also want any regulations inserted into the budget to expire after three years  so Congress will have a chance to pass more comprehensive rules   I do want a chemical plants bill  but one that is meaningful  Mr  King said Wednesday evening   Many Democrats  meanwhile  are struggling to add even stronger provisions to the regulations that would allow states like New Jersey  which already has its own plant rules  to have stronger requirements and to allow the Homeland Security Department to mandate that plants consider switching to less toxic chemicals  if the conversion would not be excessively expensive or complicated  Five years after 9 11  security at our chemical plants is still voluntary and our cities and critical infrastructure are still too vulnerable  said a letter signed Wednesday by 22 Democrats and one independent  all senators  Too many legislators have worked too long on comprehensive legislation to see that effort undermined by backroom deals  As it monitors the negotiations  the chemical industry is seeking most importantly to prevent regulations that would order plants to consider switching the chemicals they use  Industry representatives argue  as they have since the debate began  that Democrats and environmentalists are trying to hijack what had been an antiterrorism matter and use it to advance their own agenda  They were trying to pursue their agenda to ban certain chemicals under the guise of security  said Scott Jensen  a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council  This is not the appropriate place to have that debate  Environmentalists say that a fence or security camera is not enough to prevent a dangerous chemical release in an urban area  that only replacing the highly toxic chemical will accomplish that goal   Ms  Collins  who has a track record in important negotiations including the reconfiguration of the government intelligence agencies and the restructuring of the  now pending before Congress  said in an interview Wednesday evening that she remained hopeful that an agreement would be reached in time to insert regulations in the budget bill  This vulnerability has been raised time and again by terrorism experts  she said  It is a glaring one that invites attack
