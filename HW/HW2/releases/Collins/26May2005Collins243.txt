                                     Bill Would Extend Forum for Residents   Input and Allow Park to Work to Reduce Traffic on MDI May 26  2005  WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Susan Collins and Congressman Mike Michaud today introduced legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives  respectively  that would extend opportunities for local residents   input into management at Acadia National Park  increase Acadia  s ability to conserve land  and allow the park to move forward with plans to reduce traffic and improve the park experience for residents and visitors in future years        Acadia serves the residents of Maine and the country  and we will do what we can to ensure that the park will continue to create economic activity and jobs in Hancock County  promote conservation and education  and work with local communities to meet the needs of residents in Hancock County   said Senator Collins and Congressman Michaud        The legislation was applauded by those working to preserve and promote Acadia    Acadia National Park is a natural and cultural icon of Maine  and all who cherish this place are grateful for the leadership of Senator Collins and Congressman Michaud in submitting a bill to give it further safeguards   They and the rest of the Maine delegation are constantly working to protect and improve Acadia  which injects  130 million a year into the state  s economy   said Ken Olson  president of Friends of Acadia  an independent philanthropy that has raised  15 million in private endowments for the park             Specifically  the legislation extends the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission for 20 additional years  increases the land acquisition ceiling by  10 million  to  28 million  and authorizes the Secretary of Interior to participate in and spend appropriated monies to participate in work on an off island intermodal transportation facility       The Acadia National Park Advisory Commission is one of the best ways for local residents to voice their opinions on the management of Acadia   Existing legislation  which this bill extends for 20 years  requires the superintendent of Acadia National Park to request the advice of the commission on matters relating to the management and development of the park        Extending the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission continues an important tradition of local input into Acadia management decisions   For 20 years  residents have had a forum to express their views on park management directly to the superintendent  and we feel it is important that this local input continue   said Collins and Michaud       The Maine Department of Transportation  Friends of Acadia  and others are continuing to explore the development of an intermodal facility in Trenton that would allow Downeast Transportation and Island Explorer to meet with a parking lot  in an effort to reduce traffic on MDI   With the Park Service  s involvement  this site could eventually be home to a visitor center   However  because this area is outside of the park boundary  the Park Service is currently unable to contribute funds or staff to this project   The legislation introduced by Senator Collins and Representative Michaud would authorize the Park Service to participate in the Trenton intermodal facility        As everyone involved continues to work to reduce traffic and look at the creation of an off island intermodal facility  it is essential that the Park Service be involved in that process   This legislation allows the Park Service to provide resources and staff to assist in moving the intermodal facility forward and reducing traffic on Mount Desert Island   said Collins and Michaud       The bill also increases Acadia National Park  s land acquisition ceiling by  10 million  to  28 million   There are still many tracts of private land within Acadia  s authorized boundary that can be developed in ways incompatible with the purposes of the park  Congress established the official boundary in 1986   The National Park Service was directed to buy properties within the boundary from willing sellers to complete the park  however  due to escalating real estate prices on Mount Desert Island  the park is now limited in its ability to protect additional lands        Because of rising real estate prices on Mount Desert Island  we need to update Acadia  s land acquisition ceiling  which will allow the park to buy land from willing sellers to fill in some of the holes that still remain in Acadia   This will increase conservation in the park and ensure that uses within the park boundary are compatible with Acadia National Park  s mission   said Collins and Michaud                                                                                      Browse by
