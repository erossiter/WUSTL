                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               February 5  2007 Washington  DC        Senator Susan Collins issued this statement on the Presidents budget proposal that was released today    The Presidents budget includes an increase of  3 2 billion  for a total  14 4 billion for shipbuilding  This will enable the DD X  program and the Navys dual lead ship to stay on track  This funding acknowledges the importance of the DD X  to our Navy and national security  This funding level also closely reflects the request that I made late last year     I am also pleased that the budget proposal includes a  238 million increase for the National Park Service Operating Budget  which would benefit Acadia National Park  In addition  I am pleased that the President included my request for  10 million for the Penobscot River Restoration project    In October  I wrote a letter to the President asking him to provide a significant increase in the Pell maximum award  I am pleased that the president s budget recommends raising the maximum Pell award to  4 600  which is an important step forward  Last week  I introduced the Improving Access to Higher Education Act  which would raise the maximum Pell award to  5 100    a  1 050 increase over current levels     It is also good news that the President is calling for  87 million to speed the approval process for lower cost generic drugs to help lower the cost of prescriptions drugs for seniors    I am very disappointed  however  in a number of budget requests that will be detrimental to Maines low income children  seniors  and families  For example  the budget proposes a significant cut for LIHEAP funding  The result could be substantially    more   less heating assistance available for Maines low income families  My hope is that the proposed increase in LIHEAP emergency funding could help meet the inevitable shortfall    It is also concerning that the Presidents budget proposal does not provide sufficient funding for the SCHIP program that is so critical in helping to ensure that Maines low income children have adequate health care  The budget proposes significant cuts in Medicare and Medicaid spending and it makes harmful cuts to the Community Services Block Grants and Community Development Block Grants     While it is positive that the budget would increase overall funding for the Title I program  the budget would also flat fund the Head Start program  which is in need of greater funding  It would also eliminate that Educational Technology State Grant program  which has been very beneficial to Maines students                                                                            Browse by                                                                                                Current record
