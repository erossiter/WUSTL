                                     Collins says proposed plan will be especially harmful to small airports October 3  2005  WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Susan Collins today urged the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to delay plans to privatize Flight Service Stations nationwide  including the Bangor International Airport   The FAA has entered into a contract that would turn functions of Flight Service Stations over to Lockheed Martin resulting in the loss of nearly 30 positions at the Bangor station        In a letter  Senator Collins and several Senate colleagues urged FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to delay implementation of the plan until Congress completes the Fiscal Year  FY  2006 appropriations process   Although the House of Representatives has rejected the FAA   s proposal  the Senate has yet to consider the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill        Following is the text of the letter       The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20591      Dear Administrator Blakey       We are writing to request that the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  delay implementation of plans to turn functions of Flight Service Stations over to a private company until Congress completes the Fiscal Year  FY  2006 appropriations process  As FY 2005 comes to a close  it is important that any funds used to implement the privatization plan are directly appropriated by Congress       The House of Representatives has already weighed in against privatizing Flight Service Station operations through the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill  On June 30  2005  the House of Representatives rejected the FAA   s proposal by approving an amendment  by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 238 to 177  to prohibit the FAA from spending funds on the privatization plan  The Senate has yet to consider the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill        General aviation pilots depend on Flight Service Stations to provide weather briefings  temporary flight restrictions  emergency information  and aid in search and rescue  Flight Service Station Specialists use their expertise of regional weather  landscape  and flight conditions to ensure pilots reach their destinations safely  Their work has kept general aviation running smoothly and has literally saved lives       The Federal Aviation Administration   s proposal to privatize Flight Service Stations will lead to decreased safety for pilots of small planes because they will no longer be talking to personnel familiar with regional weather and topography  The consolidated system will strain service capability because fewer employees will be responsible for a growing system of general air traffic        The proposed plan will be especially harmful to rural areas that more heavily rely upon smaller aircraft  Whether moving products and services as part of the global economy  or shepherding sick patients for medical care  communities require a basic air infrastructure network  By ensuring that Flight Service Stations can continue to serve all areas  general aviation pilots will continue to be able to serve regions that may otherwise not have service        Accordingly  we request that the FAA delay implementation of plans to turn Flight Service Stations functions over to a private company until Congress finalizes the FY 2006 budget  While the FAA intends to shift these government employees over to private control as soon as October 2005  it is important that this transition is not implemented until the Senate can consider the privatization of Flight Service Stations        Because the FAA has specifically requested that Congress provide  150 million for the implementation  it is only appropriate that the Senate evaluate this request through the budget process  Implementing the FAA   s privatization plan without allowing Senate consideration ignores Congressional intent  We appreciate your consideration of this request  and look forward to the FAA   s continued cooperation with Congress in ensuring that general aviation pilots are provided the best service possible       Sincerely                                                                                          Browse by                                                                    Current record
