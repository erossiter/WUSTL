                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Collins Drafted Resolution with Senators Warner and Nelson January 22  2007 Washington  DC         Senator Susan Collins  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today joined Senator John Warner  R VA   former Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Ben Nelson  D NE   and Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  in introducing a bipartisan resolution opposing the Presidents plan to augment U S  military forces in Iraq    It has been a pleasure to work with my colleagues  Senators John Warner and Ben Nelson  to draft this balanced  bipartisan  resolution that clearly expresses our views on the Presidents plan to send more troops to Iraq  that distinguishes between the sectarian violence in Baghdad and the violence in Anbar Province    My thoughts were shaped by my most recent trip to Iraq in December  I came back convinced that an overall increase in American troops in Baghdad is not the answer to ending the sectarian struggle in Iraq  By contrast  I personally believe that the U S  does need reallocate troops out of Baghdad and into the Anbar province where our troops are battling al Qaeda and foreign fighters     This resolution firmly says that the Senate disagrees with the plan that the President has presented  but it also respectfully urges the President to consider alternatives and to work with us to come up with a bipartisan plan to achieve our goals  that would encourage the Iraqi government to take the long overdue steps that are needed toward political reconciliation  to form a true unity government  Ultimately  resolving the sectarian violence requires a political  not a military  solution in which the Sunni minority is more fully integrated into the power structures    There is no more critical issue facing our nation right now than developing a new strategy in Iraq  Our hope is that we can come together  in a bipartisan way  and put the Senate on record on this vital issue    Following is the full text of the Resolution       110th CONGRESS   1st SESSION  S  RES    Resolution expressing the sense of Congress on the new strategy in Iraq   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES   Mr  Warner  for himself  Mr  Nelson and Ms  Collins  submitted the following resolution  which was     RESOLUTION  Resolution expressing the sense of Congress on the new strategy in Iraq   Whereas  we respect the Constitutional authorities given a President in Article II  Section 2  which states that The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States  it is not the intent of this resolution to question or contravene such authority  but to accept the offer to Congress made by the President on January 10  2007 that  if members have improvements that can be made  we will make them  If circumstances change  we will adjust   Whereas  the United States strategy and operations in Iraq can only be sustained and achieved with support from the American people and with a level of bipartisanship   Whereas  over 137 000 American military personnel are currently serving in Iraq  like thousands of others since March 2003  with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces  and are deserving of the support of all Americans  which they have strongly    Whereas  many American service personnel have lost their lives  and many more have been wounded  in Iraq  and the American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor their families    Whereas  the U S  Army and Marine Corps  including their Reserve and National Guard organizations  together with components of the other branches of the military  are under enormous strain from multiple  extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan    Whereas  these deployments  and those that will follow  will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting  retention and readiness of our nations all volunteer force   Whereas in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006  the Congress stated that calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full sovereignty  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq   Whereas  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723  approved November 28  2006  determin ed  that the situation in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security   Whereas  a failed state in Iraq would present a threat to regional and world peace  and the long term security interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq that can sustain  govern  and defend itself  and serve as an ally in the war against extremists   Whereas  Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever widening problem of sectarian and intra sectarian violence based upon political distrust and cultural differences between some Sunni and Shia Muslims    Whereas  Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to achieve reconciliation  and the failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq    Whereas  the responsibility for Iraq s internal security and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces   Whereas  U S  Central Command Commander General John Abizaid testified to Congress on November 15  2006  I met with every divisional commander  General Casey  the Corps Commander   and  General Dempsey  We all talked together  And I said  in your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq  And they all said no  And the reason is  because we want the Iraqis to do more  Its easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work  I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future   Whereas  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki stated on November 27  2006 that The crisis is political  and the ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the politicians    Whereas  there is growing evidence that Iraqi public sentiment opposes continued U S  troop presence in Iraq  much less increasing the troop level   Whereas  in the fall of 2006  leaders in the Administration and Congress  as well as recognized experts in the private sector began to express concern that the situation in Iraq was deteriorating and required a change in strategy  and  as a consequence  the Administration began an intensive  comprehensive review of the Iraq strategy  by all components of the Executive branch    Whereas  in December 2006  the bipartisan Iraq Study Group issued a valuable report  suggesting a comprehensive strategy that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region  and a change in the primary mission of U S  forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly    Whereas  on January 10  2007  following consultations with the Iraqi Prime Minister  the President announced a new strategy  hereinafter referred to as the plan   the central element of which is an augmentation of the present U S  military force structure through additional deployments of approximately 21 500 U S  military troops to Iraq    Whereas  this proposed level of troop augmentation far exceeds the expectations of many of us as to the reinforcements that would be necessary to implement the various options for a new strategy  and led many members to express outright opposition to augmenting our troops by 21 500   Whereas  the Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to assume a greater share of security responsibilities  disband militias  consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws to reconcile sectarian differences  and improve the quality of essential services for the Iraqi people  yet  despite those promises  little has been achieved    Whereas  the President said on January 10  2007 that Ive made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraqs other leaders that Americas commitment is not open ended so as to dispel the contrary impression that exists    Whereas  the recommendations in this resolution should not be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in  or withdrawal of  the present level of forces  Now therefore be it Resolved  by the Senate  the House of Representatives concurring   That it is the sense of Congress that    1  the Senate disagrees with the plan to augment our forces by 21 500  and urges the President instead to consider all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic goals set forth below with reduced force levels than proposed   2  The primary objective of the overall U S  strategy in Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen the unity government  ultimately leading to improvements in the security situation    3  the military part of this strategy should focus on maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq  denying international terrorists a safe haven  conducting counterterrorism operations  promoting regional stability  and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full responsibility for their own security   4  United States military operations should  as much as possible  be confined to these goals  and charge the Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating sectarian violence   5  the military Rules of Engagement for this plan should reflect this delineation of responsibilities   6  the United States Government should transfer to the Iraqi military  in an expeditious manner  such equipment as is necessary   7  the Senate believes the United States should continue vigorous operations in Anbar province  specifically for the purpose of combating an insurgency  including elements associated with the Al Qaeda movement  and denying terrorist a safe haven    8  the United States Government should engage selected nations in the Middle East to develop a regional  internationally sponsored peace and reconciliation process for Iraq   9  the Administration should provide regular updates to the Congress  produced by the Commander of United States Central Command and his subordinate commanders  about the progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward this end   10  our overall strategy should not be regarded as an open ended or unconditional commitment  but rather as a new strategy that hereafter should be conditioned upon the Iraqi governments meeting benchmarks that must be specified by the Administration
