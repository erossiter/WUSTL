                                     Senator Collins Attended White House Bill Signing Ceremony  December 27  2006 WASHINGTON  DC President Bush signed into law landmark postal reform legislation that was authored by Senator Susan Collins and is the first modernization of the Postal Service in more than 30 years  Senator Collins said that the new law will ensure the continuation of universal postal service at an affordable rate  The bill was coauthored by Senator Tom Carper  D DE      Senator Collins postal reform bill will modernize the rate setting process to provide more predictability in postal rates and will help ensure a stronger financial future for the Postal Service  During the signing ceremony  President Bush recognized Senator Collins  thanking her for her years of work on the legislation       Senator Collins said  The U S  Postal Service is the lynchpin of a  900 billion mailing industry  providing nine million jobs nationwide in fields as diverse as direct mailing  printing  catalog companies  paper manufacturing  and financial services  But under its current business model  which has not been updated in decades  the financial future of the Postal Service is not viable  The only way to avoid what the Government Accountability Office refers to as a death spiral  of excessive and unpredictable rate increases which lead to further reductions in mail volume  is through this comprehensive reform   The bill represents three years of work by Senators Collins  Carper and others      Highlights of Senator Collins postal reform bill are as follows      Replaces the current lengthy and litigious rate setting process with a rate cap based structure for market dominant products such as First Class Mail  periodicals and library mail  Price changes for market dominant products would be subject to a 45 day prior review period by the Postal Regulatory Commission  PRC   Under the compromise agreement  after 10 years from enactment  the PRC would have the authority to modify or adopt an alternate system if found to be necessary   Grants the Postal Service Board of Governors the authority to set rates for competitive products like Express Mail and Priority Mail  as long as these prices do not result in cross subsidy from market dominant products  Establishes a 30 day prior review period during which the proposed rate changes shall be reviewed by the Postal Regulatory Commission   Introduces new safeguards against unfair competition by the Postal Service in competitive markets  Subsidization of competitive products by market dominant products would be expressly forbidden  and an appropriate allocation of institutional costs to competitive products would be required    Transforms the existing Postal Rate Commission into the Postal Regulatory Commission with greatly enhanced authority to ensure that the Postal Service management has greater latitude and stronger oversight  Among other things  the Postal Regulatory Commission will have the authority to regulate rates for non competitive products and services  ensure financial transparency  establish limits on the accumulation of retained earnings by the Postal Service  obtain information from the Postal Service  if need be  through the use of new subpoena power  and review and act on complaints filed by those who believe the Postal Service has exceeded its authority   Requires the Postal Service to file with the Postal Regulatory Commission certain Securities and Exchange Commission financial disclosure forms  along with detailed annual reports on the status of the Postal Services pension and postretirement health obligations in order to ensure increased financial transparency    Reaffirms USPS employees right to collectively bargain  This bill only makes changes to the bargaining process that have been agreed to by both the Postal Service and the four major unions  It replaces the rarely used fact finding process with mediation  and shortens statutory deadlines for certain phases of the bargaining process   Puts into place a three day waiting period before an employee is eligible to receive 45 days of continuation of pay  This is consistent with every states workers compensation program that requires a three  to seven day waiting period before benefits are paid   Repeals a provision of Public Law 108 18 that required money owed to the Postal Service due to an overpayment into the Civil Service Retirement System Fund to be held in an escrow account  which would essentially free up  78 billion over a period of 60 years  These savings would be used not only to pay off debt to the U S  Treasury but also to fund health care liabilities  and mitigate rate increases    Returns to the Department of Treasury the responsibility for funding CSRS pension benefits relating to the military service of postal retirees  No other agency is required to make this payment                                                                       Browse by
