                                     Senators Collins and Lieberman also send letters to DHS and Treasury expressing concern over sale February 21  2006 WASHINGTON  D C Senator Susan Collins  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  and Congresswoman Jane Harman  D CA   Member of the House Homeland Security Committee  today announced their intent to introduce a resolution calling upon the Administration to reconsider the sale of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company  PO  to Dubai Ports World  DPW   Senator Collins said that she believes that the Administration must take a closer look at the transaction in order to ensure that it will not have an adverse affect on our national security   The more I learn  the more questions are raised  I am troubled by the national security implications of allowing the transaction to proceed  said Senator Collins  While UAE is an ally in the war on terror  the UNAE has historically been used as a base of terrorist operations and financing  It is clear that this transaction has received far less scrutiny than it should have and that is why I plan to introduce a resolution of disapproval in the Senate when the session resumes next week    PO has major container terminal operations in New York  Philadelphia  Baltimore  Miami  and New Orleans  Closer to home  PO conducts stevedoring operations in the Port of Portland  Maine   In addition to announcing a joint resolution  Senator Collins sent letters to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Department of Treasury Secretary John Snow expressing serious concerns with the proposed sale of operations at six major U S  ports to Dubai Ports World  DPW   a company owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates  The letter was also signed by Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D CT   and Senators Norm Coleman  R MN   Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Carl Levin  D MI   Ranking Member    Following is the full text of Senator Collins letter to Secretaries Chertoff and Snow                     February 21  2006    The Honorable Michael Chertoff Secretary U S  Department of Homeland Security Washington  DC 20528  The Honorable John W  Snow Secretary U S  Department of Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Ave   NW Washington  DC 20220  Dear Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Snow    We are writing to express our serious concerns regarding your review of the purchase of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company by Dubai Ports World  DP World   As this transaction will result in the transfer of multiple terminal operations in major U S  ports to a Dubai government owned entity  it would seem to demand a more rigorous assessment  if not a full investigation  Even more significant is the historic use of the United Arab Emirates  UAE  as a base for terrorism financing and operations  Therefore  we ask that you provide a briefing to Members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  as soon as possible  on the basis for the decision to allow this transaction to proceed    As you know  Federal law requires that the President review the national security impact of foreign investments in the United States  The President has delegated this responsibility to the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   headed by the Department of Treasury  and including representatives of the Departments of Commerce  Defense  Homeland Security  Justice and State  Although any member of the CFIUS may raise an objection to the acquisition  we understand that  in the current case  no objection was raised  This past weekend  Secretary Chertoff noted that there were conditions or requirements to address national security concerns associated with this transaction  The briefing to our Committee should include a discussion of such conditions or requirements that will be imposed upon DP World should the acquisition go forward  We ask that you fully describe CFIUSs deliberations regarding the national security implications of this transaction    While the United Arab Emirates is a recognized partner in the war against terrorism  it is located in a highly sensitive region of the world for terrorist activity  Some of the 9 11 hijackers traveled to the United States from the UAE  where they were engaged in operational planning for the attacks  Much of the financing for the attacks was transferred through the UAE banking system          It is critical to our national security that the government thoroughly review pending foreign investments in the United States  We believe that the Administration should be working more closely with Congress where acquisitions are of such a sensitive nature  In addition  we will be looking into the DHS role in the CFIUS process to ensure appropriate consideration of homeland security concerns    Thank you for your response on this important matter
