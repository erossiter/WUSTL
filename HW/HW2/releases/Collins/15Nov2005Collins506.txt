jobs at Maine Military Authority in Limestone November 15  2005  WASHINGTON  DC    By a vote of 98 0  the U S  Senate has approved the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization bill  which includes several provisions that were authored and cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins  who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee   Provisions that were authored by Senator Collins include  100 million in funding for the DD X  program specifically for Bath Iron Works  a provision that prevents the Department of Defense from implementing a one shipyard acquisition strategy for the DD X    a provision that closes a loophole that allows American corporations to do business with terrorist states and a provision that helps preserve jobs at the Maine Military Authority in Limestone   The legislation also includes provisions that were cosponsored by Senator Collins that would increase military benefits and increase funding for uparmored Humvees          This authorization bill is good for the Navy  good for our men and women in uniform serving around the world  and good for our nation     said Senator Collins   She explained that the bill contains  1 8 billion for the DD X  program   far more than the  700 million included in the House version of the bill  It also includes Senator Collins   s request for  100 million specifically for BIW   50 million over the President   s request  for advance procurement for the DD X  that will benefit BIW   In addition  it includes Senator Collins    provision that permanently prohibits the Department of Defense from moving forward with a one shipyard acquisition strategy competition for the DD X        She pointed out that in contrast  not only did the House version of the bill contain significantly less money for the DD X  program  a program that Navy officials have repeatedly said is crucial for the future of the Navy  but the House bill rescinds  84 million that Senator Collins was successful in securing last year for BIW to perform detailed design work on the DD X  destroyer           This legislation authorizes critical programs for our soldiers  sailors  airmen  and Marines serving our country at home and around
