                                     Senators Collins and Jack Reed  D RI  Request Emergency Funding November 30  2007 U S  Senator Susan Collins and Jack Reed  D RI   co chairs of the Senate Northeast Midwest Coalition are calling on the Senate Appropriations Committee to approve an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   Senators Collins and Reed are joined by a bipartisan group of 19 additional Senators in making the request to the Senate Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Agencies  the panel that oversees funding for LIHEAP     With the price of crude oil hovering near  100 per barrel  the Energy Information Administration is estimating that many American households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more to heat their homes during the coming winter  The rising cost of energy will put a greater strain on the LIHEAP Program prompting the request of this emergency funding     With winter already here  I deeply concerned with the rising price of heating oil and the strain it places on Maine families  noted Senator Collins  LIHEAP funding is critically important for those who would otherwise be forced to sacrifice the necessities of life such as food  rent  and prescription drugs to pay heating costs  Record high energy prices necessitate increased program resources to ensure that no family is forced to suffer through a severe winter without heat  The assistance provided by LIHEAP is crucial for Maine and other states this winter     Each year  more than 48 000 households in Maine rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes each year     A Full Text of the Letter Follows     Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter     We are writing to request that you include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of  3 412 billion  We recognize the difficult budget constraints that the Subcommittee faces and appreciate your support for additional funding for the LIHEAP program in FY2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Conference Report that was vetoed     With the price of oil hovering near  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2007 2008 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter     Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million  For these reasons  we believe an additional  1 billion in emergency funding is warranted     LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances     Moreover  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year     Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to increase funding for the LIHEAP program to ensure that low income seniors  individuals with disabilities  and families have the resources that they need to stay warm this winter      Sincerely                                                                         Browse by
