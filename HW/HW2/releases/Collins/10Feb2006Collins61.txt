                                     Military Officials Testify at Committee Hearing  Express Support for Unified Regional Efforts to Prepare for and Respond to Disaster Scenarios February 10  2006 Washington  DC  Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D CT  today held a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to examine the performance of the military in response to Hurricane Katrina  Witnesses included leaders from the Department of Defense  DOD  and National Guard  The hearing focused on the coordination of active duty and National Guard rescue and recovery efforts  questions about chain of command  and difficulties in the relationship between DOD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   Defense officials who testified today expressed the need for more frequent regional interagency training exercises to plan and train for a broad and unified response to catastrophic disasters  One witness also suggested that these exercises include private sector service providers that would need to contribute to response and recovery efforts    Our investigation has found that one of the fundamental problems at all levels of government in responding to Hurricane Katrina was the lack of concerted pre disaster planning  Expectations and capabilities must be understood in advance  so that needs can be met rapidly and efficiently when disaster strikes  said Senator Collins  The testimony today reinforced my belief that we should create regionally based task forces that include representatives from state  local  and federal agencies  including FEMA  the Defense Department  and other agencies that would play significant roles in the event of a catastrophe  whether it be a terrorist strike or natural disaster  The planning and training should include up front agreements with regard to command and control that might well differ from one catastrophic scenario to the next    By virtue of their leadership and professionalism  Generals Honore and Landreneau combined the capabilities of the fine men and women of the National Guard and the Active Duty forces  ultimately to great success  The White House cobbled together a change in the command structure at the height of the crisis  but the uniformed and civilian leaders of DoD confirmed the White House plan was a mistake  As we heard from General Honor  we must establish leadership roles in advance  and pre position assets that we know will be required  It is clear that proper planning  training  and exercising is essential in order to avoid confusion  unnecessary bureaucratic struggles  and human suffering  said Senator Lieberman   The witnesses who testified at todays hearing were  The Honorable Paul McHale  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense  U S  Department of Defense  Admiral Timothy J  Keating  Commander  North American Aerospace Defense Command and U S  Northern Command  Lieutenant General H
