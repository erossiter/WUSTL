California  Texas  Florida  Kentucky combine efforts to preserve industrial base      Washington  DC     Senators Olympia Snowe  R ME  and Susan Collins  R ME  today joined with Senators from Mississippi  Louisiana  Missouri  Alabama  Virginia  Rhode Island  and Connecticut in sending a letter to President Bush asking that he preserve two surface combatant shipyards for the construction of DD X  destroyers for the naval fleet   The Department of Defense is reportedly considering revising its acquisition strategy for the DD X  to conduct a winner take all competition in 2005  which would mean only one of the two shipyards would be awarded a Navy contract to design and construct the ships          We believe that any decision to pursue a winner take all strategy for DD X  is ill advised     wrote Senators Snowe and Collins  along with a group of 11 other Senators   They pointed out that the President   s Fiscal Year 2006 budget request maintains an acquisition strategy to build the destroyers in two shipyards  Bath Iron Works in Bath  Maine  and Northrop Grumman Ingalls of Pascagoula  Mississippi      We ask that the DD X  program be executed as contemplated by your 2006 budget request  maintaining the current split of work between both shipyards with regard to design and construction          In addition to Senators Snowe and Collins  the letter was signed by Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran of Mississippi  John Warner of Virginia  Christopher  Kit  Bond and Jim Talent of Missouri  Mary Landrieu and David Vitter of Louisiana  Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania  Joe Lieberman of Connecticut  Richard Shelby of Alabama  Jack Reed of Rhode Island  Patrick Leahy of Vermont  Saxby Chambliss of Georgia  Edward M  Kennedy of Massachusetts  Dianne Feinstein of California  John Cornyn of Texas  Bill Nelson of Florida  and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky       The full text of the letter is as follows      Dear Mr  President      We have become aware that the Department of Defense is considering whether to significantly alter the construction strategy for the Navy   s next generation destroyer  the    DDX       The present strategy contemplated by your 2006 budget request is to build the vessels in two shipyards  Northrop Grumman Ingalls of Pascagoula  Mississippi  and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works of Bath  Maine   The revised strategy being explored by the Department of Defense is to conduct a winner take all competition in 2005 between the two shipyards       The practical effect of a winner take all competition is twofold   First  the program would likely be delayed to accomplish the competition  possibly resulting in the layoff of several thousand highly skilled employees and significantly increasing the cost of ongoing programs at both facilities   The U S  shipbuilding industrial base has already endured a 75  reduction in employment during the past 15 years due to low rate production   Instability in the DDX program at this time could further exacerbate the permanent exodus of skilled men and women from the last remaining shipyards that produce our naval fleet        Secondly  the losing offeror would likely exit the surface combatant market  forever limiting the ability of this Nation to construct destroyers and cruisers at any significant rate    With regard to Navy force structure  construction of surface combatants at single shipyard would impact the Navy   s ability to maintain the quantity of warships stipulated by your fiscal year 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review   Further  it would also limit the number of warships that could be produced to support the force structure that will be defined by the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review        We believe that any decision to pursue a winner take all strategy for DDX is ill advised until the Department of Defense has completed the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review and submitted its findings to the Congress   Consequently  we ask that the DDX program be executed as contemplated by your 2006 budget request  maintaining the current split of work between both shipyards with regard to design and construction   With kind regards  we remain
