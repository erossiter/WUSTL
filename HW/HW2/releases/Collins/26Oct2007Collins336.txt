                                     Over 21  of America   s public school students benefit from funding October 26  2007 Washington  DC      U S  Senator Susan Collins today announced that she has called upon the President and his administration to continue funding for the Rural Education Achievement Program  REAP   Yesterday  Senator Collins and Senator Kent Conrad  D ND  sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Jim Nussle requesting the continuation of the REAP program in the FY2009 budget request  The REAP program provides support for Americas rural public schools and their students through supplemental grant funding    Rural schools in America often have difficulty affording all aspects of their students education due to the associated poverty and the additional costs required to service students covered over many square miles  It is estimated that one third of Americas schools and 21  of its public school students would benefit from the continuation of this program    Locally  120 schools in Maine were the recipients of more than  1 65 million of support when the 2007 REAP funding was announced in September  Since the introduction of the REAP program in 2002  Maines schools have received over  10 53 million    This is a critical issue  noted Senator Collins  Rural schoolslike many of those in Maineoften suffer from chronic under funding  causing the local students to suffer  I will work to see that this programs good work is continued    Senator Collins coauthored legislation that created the REAP program in 2002   The text of the letter follows   Dear Mr  Nussle     As you prepare the Presidents fiscal year 2009 budget request  we urge you to continue funding for the Rural Education Achievement Program  REAP   a program designed to provide crucial additional support to rural schools throughout the nation    We greatly appreciate the Administrations support of this valuable program by including funding for it in last years budget request  We ask that you preserve this funding and provide an increase so that the program may continue to grow  Nearly one third of America s public schools are in rural places  and more than 21 percent of our public school students attend these schools  This is the only dedicated federal funding stream to aid rural school districts in overcoming the increased expenses caused by geographic isolation    We firmly believe that this initiative addresses the unique needs of small  rural school districts  as well as low income  rural school districts  while ensuring accountability  In many cases  current federal formulas do not produce enough revenue to carry out the purposes the grant is intended to fund  Small  rural school districts often forgo federal education dollars because they lack the personnel and the resources to apply for competitive grants  By allowing school districts to combine funds  as well as providing additional funds based on enrollment  these districts are finally achieving the critical mass of funding required to undertake significant reform    Funds from this program have already helped to fund new technology in classrooms  distance learning opportunities  and professional development activities  as well as a vast array of other programs which will help rural districts make progress towards the goals of No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB   Because NCLB formula programs  such as Title I  are funded on a per pupil basis  small rural schools do not see the benefits from increases in Title I allocations that larger school systems may receive    This funding is particularly important now that accountability and testing requirements of NCLB have expanded the demands on local school administrators  This impact is most deeply felt in rural districts where the superintendent often serves as the sole administrator and is responsible for implementing these reforms  As the coauthors of this important legislation  we urge your continued support of REAP to meet the needs of our nation s small and rural schools  We thank you for your consideration of our request
