                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May 22  2007 Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins has requested an investigation of electricity charges in Maine and other markets that participate in Independent System Operators Regional Transmission Organizations  ISOs RTOs   ISOs and RTOs were intended to help electricity consumers save money by improving efficiency and reliability and increasing wholesale electricity competition  However  Senator Collins is now concerned that these ISOs and RTOs might not be living up to their full potential with respect to improving efficiencies and reducing costs  In addition  she is concerned they might not have adequate incentives to minimize costs    A report recently released by the Maine Public Utilities Commission suggests that not only are these electricity operators and organizations failing to save the average consumer money  they may actually be costing them more  said Senator Collins  We must determine whether these organizations are living up to their promise to consumers  and if not  what alternative options are available to states like Maine who are looking to protect families who need electricity at affordable prices    Senator Collins  as the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  has begun an investigation of ISOs and RTOs  As part of the investigation  Senator Collins and Senator Joseph Lieberman  the Committee Chairman  have requested that the independent Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigate ISO and RTO costs  structure  processes  and operations    High electricity prices are a terrible hardship for Maine families and businesses  and as such require very careful scrutiny  said Senator Collins  Every component of our electricity rates must be carefully examined  For example  ISO New England  which runs the electrical system in most of Maine  spent  124 million in 2005 on General and Administrative matters  Consumers have a right to know how the electricity grid is being managed and to expect that every effort is made to reduce prices    Maine last year passed a resolution directing the Maine Public Utilities Commission  PUC  to study the costs and benefits to Maine of being a member of ISO New England  The resolution also required the PUC to study the options available to Maine for leaving that organization  An interim report released by the Maine PUC earlier this year asserts that ISO New England could cost Maine consumers as much as  616 million in net costs over five years  and suggested that leaving ISO New England is an available option for utilities in Maine    The following is the text of the letter that Senators Collins and Lieberman wrote to GAO Comptroller General David Walker requesting the investigation   Dear Mr  Walker    It has been fifteen years since Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992  which authorized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to order jurisdictional  transmission owning utilities to provide open  non discriminatory transmission access to third parties in order to promote competition in the wholesale electricity market and lower costs for consumers  FERC acted aggressively to implement that new authority in Order 888  issued in 1996  by directing all jurisdictional utilities to file a standard tariff that set forth the costs  terms  and conditions for such service  instead of responding to individual complaints from generators seeking access to specific facilities  In issuing Order 888  FERC predicted that consumers would benefit significantly from competition and would see approximately  3 8 to  5 4 billion per year in cost savings     As part of the effort to achieve these objectives  the Commission sought in Order 888 to encourage the development of Independent System Operators Regional Transmission Organizations  ISOs RTOs   Order 2000  issued by FERC four years after Order 888  further promoted but did not require the development of RTOs  In response to these initiatives  six RTOs ISOs were formed  approved by FERC  and placed in control of the dispatch of facilities in significant portions of the nations electric grid    The ISO RTOs were intended to enhance reliability and the development of wholesale electricity competition  They were designed to control  on a region wide basis  the dispatch of generation and transmission facilities  but not to own them  FERC imposed specific RTO eligibility criteria  which the Commission believed would produce additional consumer benefits  Because these entities were intended to be independent of market participants  it was believed that ISO RTOs would be able to operate regional grids in a more efficient and less discriminatory manner  In short  both RTOs and ISOs were seen as means of improving overall efficiency and lowering costs     We are writing now out of concern that ISOs and RTOs might not be living up to their full potential with respect to improving efficiencies and reducing costs  and might not have adequate incentives to minimize costs    Creating and operating ISOs and RTOs have turned out to be costly  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on new staff  facilities  software  and other infrastructure just to begin operations of these organizations  Additional millions are spent each year operating these systems     RTOs and ISOs make many market development decisions and advance market design mechanisms that significantly affect consumer costs  While RTOs and ISOs must weigh many factors in making these decisions  we believe that seeking the lowest possible prices for consumers should be a high priority     While the RTOs ISOs have no profit motive  they also are not subject to the usual pressures or mechanisms to keep the rates charged for their services low  RTOs and ISOs are effective monopolies  since within their geographic boundaries they are the only entities providing regional transmission and market administration services  This has led to concerns that the lack of competitive pressure  which otherwise could help constrain ISO and RTO costs  can result in rates that are higher than necessary     As a result of high costs and disadvantageous operating characteristics  some members of ISOs are now considering leaving them  For example  on April 13  2006  the state of Maine passed a resolution directing the Maine Public Utilities Commission to study the costs and benefits to Maine of being a member of ISO New England  and the options available to Maine for leaving that organization  An interim report released by the Maine PUC on January 16  2007  asserts that ISO New England could cost Maine consumers as much as  616 million in net costs over five years  and suggested that leaving ISO New England was an available option for utilities in Maine  In addition  two large members of the Midwest ISO have already filed their intentions of leaving that ISO     In order to help the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee continue its oversight of restructured electricity markets  we request that GAO begin an investigation into ISO and RTO costs  structure  processes  and operations  Specifically  we ask that GAO address the following questions  to the extent practicable    1  We are interested in obtaining data  for each of the past five years  on relative RTO ISO startup and operating  For each RTO ISO  what  a  costs were incurred in connection with initial development and completion of the start up implementation phase   b  is the current annual operating budget  in both absolute terms and as expressed on the basis of the dollars per Kwh of energy that moves over each RTO ISOs grid   c  is the current capital budget     2  To the extent it can be determined  do RTO ISO markets reduce the all in  delivered costs to load for energy  capacity  and ancillary services in each affected region  eliminating the effects of fuel costs      3  For each RTO ISO region  please provide   a  a description of the process in place to conduct regional planning  including as to  i  transmission   ii  generation and  iii  demand side resources   b  a description of the process in place to ensure that reliability criteria not met through economic dispatch are satisfied at the lowest reasonable cost  and  c  the level of investment in transmission  generation  and demand side resources over the past five years    4  Does each RTO ISO have a defined mission statement   a  To the extent this is the case  do these mission statements include an obligation on the part of the RTOs ISOs to control administrative and operational costs  as well as the cost impacts of its market design decisions  in order to keep costs low for consumers   b  What incentives are built into the organization or mission of each RTO ISO with respect to ensuring that costs to consumers are as low as reasonably possible   c  Does each RTO ISO have a mechanism in place to identify  assess  track  and monitor the cost impacts of its decisions at the retail consumer level and  if so  how does that mechanism work    5  With respect to each RTO ISO   a  what process is in place to ensure that an evaluation of the costs and benefits of the market design proposals is conducted prior to their submission to the FERC for approval  and  b  what role do market participants and other stakeholders  e g   state commissions  play in the development  consideration and submission for approval to FERC and approval of  i  new market design proposals  and  ii  the RTO ISO annual operating budget    6  What is the level of customer satisfaction with each RTO ISO     7  What benefits have these ISOs and RTOs provided  If possible  please estimate the annual savings that may have accrued because of the creation of these entities    8  Provide your insights as to whether restructured electricity markets are delivering net benefits to end consumers and identify the potential impediments and or solutions    Thank you for your timely assistance in this matter                                                                            Browse by
