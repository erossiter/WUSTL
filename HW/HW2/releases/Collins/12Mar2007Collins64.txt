                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Legislation follows up on studies by the Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham March 12  2007 Washington  DC        Senator Susan Collins  R ME  today introduced legislation to create a comprehensive new program to measure mercury levels across the United States  The bipartisan Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act is cosponsored by Senators Joseph Lieberman  D CT  and Hillary Clinton  D NY     This legislation would create a comprehensive nationwide mercury monitoring network to provide sound mercury measurements that EPA sorely needs  said Senator Collins    This legislation would authorize  18 million in fiscal year 2008   13 million in fiscal year 2009   14 million in fiscal year 2010  and additional funding through 2013 for the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   United States Geological Survey  United States Fish and Wildlife Service  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to create a nationwide mercury monitoring program  The legislation would establish mercury monitoring sites across the nation in order to measure mercury levels in the air  rain  soil  lakes and streams  and in plants and animals   The legislation would provide new data to help address the flaws in EPAs existing mercury data  based largely on a computer model  which was used to justify the flawed Clean Air Mercury Rule issued in 2005   I was deeply troubled by the computer data which EPA used to justify its mercury rule  This data was neither peer reviewed nor verified with scientific measurements  and yet EPA used as the basis for its mercury rule which does not account for mercury hotspots and which places children and pregnant women at risk  said Senator Collins  Hopefully  the new measurements provided by this legislation will form the basis for a new mercury rule which adequately protects human health and environment   Senators Collins and Lieberman met with EPA Administrator Johnson in 2005 in order to express concerns over the EPA s proposed Clean Air Mercury Rule  At that time  Johnson misrepresented the mercury problem based on computer measurements which were not peer reviewed and which were not verified with scientific measurements    The legislation follows up on new studies  by David Evers and Wing Goodale of the Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham  Maine  Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University  Kathleen Fallon Lambert of the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation in Hanover  New Hampshire  and others  which were published in the January issue of BioScience Magazine  The studies demonstrate the existence of mercury hotspots in the northeastern United States and attribute much of the cause of the hotspots to power plant emissions     The studies conflict markedly with EPAs computer modeling data which was used to justify the EPA Clean Air Mercury Rule  For example  the studies showed that mercury deposition is five times higher than previously estimated by EPA near a coal plant in the vicinity of a biological mercury hotspot spanning southern New Hampshire and northeastern Massachusetts  The studies demonstrate major flaws in the EPA Mercury Rule  and also demonstrate the need for real mercury measurements  instead of the computer model used by EPA   I have long argued that EPA used faulty science in order to justify an insufficient mercury rule  and these studies prove it  said Senator Collins  With these studies  David Evers has shown the importance of real  on the ground mercury measurements  instead of relying solely on the computer model used by EPA to justify its misguided rule  The legislation I am introducing today would create a nationwide mercury monitoring network to provide the sound science that EPA so badly needs  Congress should act on this legislation expeditiously   Dr  David Evers  executive director of the BioDiversity Research Institute in Gorham  Maine endorsed the legislation  The new mercury monitoring bill introduced today by Senator Susan Collins addresses a crucial gap in our national public and environmental health infrastructure  said Evers  National networks exist for far less hazardous pollutants like acid rain  but there is no coordinated system for tracking mercury and its effects  This bill is particularly important in light of the EPA rule that allows mercury trading by coal fired power plants  My colleagues and I have demonstrated that mercury emissions produce local impacts and hotspots which trading may perpetuate  Its time to put a mercury monitoring system in place so that we can directly measure the impact of these federal policies and hold EPA accountable  Senator Collins bill is comprehensive  scientifically sound  and vital to protecting the health of fish  wildlife and people  Congress should act quickly to pass this bill and appropriate the necessary funds to put the mercury monitoring network into action   In addition  Senator Collins is working on new legislation that would reduce mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent                                                                             Browse by
