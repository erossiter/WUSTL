                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 6  2005  The first four BRAC criteria comprise the tenets of military value   It is clear that the Navy and DoD recognized the irreplaceable military value of Brunswick Naval Air Station     In the BRAC Commission   s first hearing with the Navy on May 18th  when questioned about the economics of realignment  the Chief of Naval Operations responded by saying  quote      This is a military value question more than anything else  and a naval base and the air base in the Northeast   We  re keeping SERE training up there  but we  re really keeping a strategic capability in the Northeast   That  s what it boils down to      The military value of Brunswick has not diminished since May 18th   DoD   s first BRAC criterion focuses on current and future mission capabilities and the impact on operational readiness of the total force   This includes the impact on joint warfighting  training and readiness   Brunswick is the only fully capable operational DoD airfield remaining north of New Jersey   Previous BRAC rounds closed all other active duty air bases in the Northeast  as this slide demonstrates   Brunswick is strategically located adjacent to the great circle routes for ships and aircraft crossing the North Atlantic   This location makes Brunswick a vital link in our national defense posture and critical for surveillance of ships coming from Europe  the Mediterranean  and the Middle East   Indeed  its proximity to major population centers  combined with its ability to support every aircraft in the DoD inventory  makes BNAS essential across the full range of homeland defense operations and contingencies   Brunswick   s unique location provides it with correspondingly unique capabilities for current and future operations in the defense of our homeland   Brunswick was a key base for homeland defense during the months following September 11th  providing P 3 surveillance missions under Operation Vigilant Shield  and land based combat air patrol for Navy ships at sea    And only Brunswick Naval Air Station can perform such missions efficiently in the future   Maritime patrol assets from Brunswick will continue to be needed to locate and monitor ships in the North Atlantic  including those potentially carrying weapons of mass destruction  cruise missiles  or other threats to our shores     Maritime Domain Awareness is a key component of homeland defense   Properly based Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft  or    MPRA     is essential to this increasingly important mission   As Rear Admiral Rich has pointed out  response time and endurance on station are critical in MPRA operations  and the location of a maritime patrol aircraft base is critical to those capabilities   The removal of full time  operationally ready maritime patrol assets from the northeast is contrary to the very concept of Maritime Domain Awareness and would leave our nation vulnerable   Removal of these aircraft would degrade readiness by requiring detachments from Jacksonville  Florida  to perform missions that can be performed much more efficiently and effectively from Brunswick   It is a move that would increase the risk of failure in the defense of our homeland  a mission in which even a single failure could be catastrophic   A review of the Navy   s analysis group minutes proves that the strategic location of Brunswick was confirmed by warfighting commands no fewer than ten separate times during the deliberations   The Commanders of Fleet Forces and Northern Command repeatedly voiced grave concerns to the Navy about the potential loss of Brunswick to their warfighting readiness   These commanders also said that the closure of Brunswick would damage the Navy   s ability to support Northern Command   s homeland defense missions   Removal of Brunswick   s air assets would have the same negative effects on this mission as would closure   The minutes show that the military value of individual facilities was determined early in the BRAC review process   In August 2004  the Navy   s infrastructure team presented the Navy analysis group with a list of 33 airfields that should be assigned military value scores for strategic location   Brunswick Naval Air Station was on that list     Yet  the Navy determined that only two airfields would receive scores for strategic location   The fact that Brunswick was not given any credit for its strategic location after two commanders weighed in no fewer than ten times about the strategic value of Brunswick   s location is inexplicable   The minutes of a January 2005 Navy analysis group meeting show that discussions were held on whether a scenario to close Brunswick was desirable  quote       in light of the fact that Brunswick is the last active duty DoD air base in New England and is relatively un encroached  the significant capital investment in facilities there  the requirement for a homeland defense capability in this region  and the loss of East Coast aviation capability this scenario would represent         Despite these concerns and those of our operational commanders  the Navy still forwarded to the Infrastructure Executive Council a recommendation to close Brunswick     As far as we can determine from a review of the minutes  the overriding factor that led the Navy to ignore the many advantages of Brunswick was a goal to locate maritime patrol aircraft at a single site on the East Coast   Yet  the Commander of Fleet Forces warned that      Closure of NAS Brunswick supports operational synergies associated with a single site P 3 MMA force at the unacceptable expense of closing a base offering numerous transformational and maritime Homeland Defense basing opportunities      The IEC subsequently rejected the recommendation to close Brunswick because  and I quote again     Department of Navy leadership expressed concern that closure of NAS Brunswick could have strategic implications regarding Northern Command   s homeland defense strategy and would result in the loss of the only Naval aviation footprint in New England      Commissioners  this statement recognizes that Brunswick is not just a training site or staging area   It is an operational airfield in the defense of our nation   The Navy   s recommendation to close Brunswick was overturned by the Council due to the base   s overwhelming strategic military value   This determination should have triggered the reconsideration of single siting maritime patrol forces on the East Coast   Yet  we can find no evidence that this occurred   The first measure of military value     the impact on mission capabilities and operational readiness     was ignored   The second BRAC criterion measures military value by considering the availability and condition of a base   s land  facilities  and associated airspace   This is what the Navy   s Infrastructure Analysis Team stated on January 11  2005  concerning the infrastructure at Brunswick          BNAS  the last active duty DoD airfield in New England  is available 24 7  365 days per year  and offers unique Joint and NATO strategic  physical  and training assets        BNAS is strategically located to base maritime homeland defense missions       Of note  BNAS has no encroachment issues  nearly 1 000 acres available for expansion  63 000 square miles of unencumbered training airspace  and nearly 12 000 Navy owned mountainous acres capable of accommodating joint exercises and meeting all Navy and Marine Corps Atlantic Fleet SERE training requirements at a single site       Armed aircraft can depart BNAS and enter offshore operating areas without over flying populated areas      Brunswick Naval Air Station is in first class condition  with more than  120 million in recapitalization and military construction during the past five years   As a result of this investment  DoD has  in effect  an all new airfield at Brunswick     With its side by side 8 000 foot runways  there are literally no aircraft in the DoD  s current or future inventory that Brunswick cannot support either in a transient role or permanent assignment   Other investments included   show slide         Hangar 6   Six Bays       Runway Recapitalization       Ramp   Taxiway Repairs       Aircraft Control Tower       Family Housing  Phases I  II   III       Transient Quarters       Relocated Base Entrance   NATO has recognized the importance of Brunswick to its operational capability  and backed up that recognition with significant investment in the base   s facilities     The station   s NATO built fuel farm regularly supports all types of foreign aircraft   Its state of the art Tactical Support Center  also NATO funded  provides vital command and control for operational and exercise flights by U S  and NATO maritime patrol aircraft   Of great significance  as has been mentioned  is the fact that Brunswick has the only hangar capable of hosting the MMA aircraft  which is scheduled to replace the P 3 starting in 2012   This hangar was specifically designed to support the MMA and its related unmanned aerial vehicles   The recommendation to realign Brunswick significantly deviated from BRAC criterion two by inadequately considering the value of this brand new infrastructure   Under realignment  additional MMA capable hangars would need to be built from scratch in Jacksonville   Rather than reduce excess capacity  this realignment would increase it and require significant military construction costs    As home to the four active duty squadrons  Brunswick provides basing and support essential to the entire Maritime Patrol Aircraft force under the Navy   s new Fleet Response and Flexible Deployment concept   This concept increases the proportion of MPRA aircraft and crews at bases in the United States  and requires them to maintain a high state of readiness for immediate surge deployments overseas   The Station   s simulator capacity is essential to meet the training needs of the fleet   s P 3 crews   I would note that the simulators at Jacksonville are already at maximum utilization now   Brunswick   s facilities  unencumbered airspace  and location at the nearest point in the United States to Europe and the Middle East provide the capabilities to support the Fleet Response concept   The conditions of criterion two are fully met by Brunswick Naval Air Station  but not properly recognized by either a realignment or a closure scenario   The third BRAC criterion is the ability to accommodate contingency  mobilization and future force requirements    Brunswick   s role during Operation Iraqi Freedom clearly demonstrates its ability to accommodate mobilization and surge requirements   Brunswick is the preferred refueling stop for tactical jet and turboprop aircraft crossing the Atlantic Ocean   The base hosted or provided logistical support for more than 120 aircraft returning from Middle East operations   Brunswick also provided berthing for more than 850 DoD personnel returning from Iraq to the U S  through Brunswick   The base   s ramp space is sufficient to park more than 250 maritime patrol or other large aircraft under maximum surge conditions   Additionally  as the northeasternmost base in the United States  Brunswick supports mobilization efforts every day   Naval Air Station Brunswick is the closest U S military airfield to the current theater of operations   Despite all the talk of transformation and jointness during this BRAC round  it is remarkable that the Navy did not ask in even one data call whether Brunswick could expand its current missions to more fully utilize the Air Station   s capacity   The only gaining scenarios run were for aviation assets from reserve air bases before Brunswick was considered for closure   This option was not even revisited after the final decision was made to realign  rather than close  Brunswick   Clearly  the Navy and the OSD missed a tremendous opportunity to strengthen U S  military capabilities by not placing other operational forces at Brunswick to fulfill current and future total force requirements that meet contingency  mobilization  surge operations  and training missions   A realignment to a Naval Air Facility or complete closure of NAS Brunswick eviscerates the military value of Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance assets by removing them from a superb facility in a critical theater of operations   It would require future detachments     from one U S  base to another     to meet mission requirements   The removal of Brunswick   s aircraft would significantly and dangerously degrade operational readiness   It would increase response time in emergencies   This proposed realignment would not meet the needs of Northern Command   s homeland defense missions   It would result in a Navy and a Department of Defense that will operate less effectively and efficiently  and with many hidden costs   Taken together  the first three criteria I have discussed are a measure of the most crucial elements of military value  now and in the future   By any fair and complete assessment  Brunswick Naval Air Station measures up   It must remain fully operational                                                                          Browse by
