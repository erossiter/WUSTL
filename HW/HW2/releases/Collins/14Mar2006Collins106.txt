introduce a bill to reform and strengthen the national security review process for foreign investments in the United States  CFIUS  following the controversy over the    Dubai ports transaction      Following is the full text of Senator Collins statement       Mr  President  I rise to introduce a bill to reform and strengthen the national security review process for foreign investments in the   United States   I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman  Coleman  and Akaka           In a global economy  foreign investment is becoming increasingly common in this country  The national security and homeland security implications of those investments must be scrutinized by the departments with responsibility for those critical matters           The controversy over the    Dubai ports transaction exposed serious flaws in the current law  In 1988  Congress passed the Exon Florio provision of the Defense Production Act to give the President the authority to suspend or prohibit any foreign acquisition  merger or takeover of a    U S  corporation that is determined to threaten our national security  Through an Executive Order  the President gave the Committee on Foreign Investment in the    United States  CFIUS  responsibility to review transactions pursuant to Exon Florio and to make recommendations to the President           The statute is something of an anachronism because of what it doesnt say  It focuses on acquisitions of    U S  companies that   1  are important to our military industrial base  or  2  have technology that could help a terrorist state develop weapons of mass destruction  Both of these issues are important  but neither addresses transactions that could help terrorists threaten our security right here at home  In other words  the CFIUS process is not designed to analyze transactions that involve a port terminal or other critical infrastructure within our borders                The Government Accountability Office  GAO   in a report issued September 2005  found that Exon Florios effectiveness in protecting U S  national security may be limited  limited because the Department of the Treasury  as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States    narrowly defines what constitutes a threat to national security  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the    United States focuses too much on the financial component and not enough on security            The Committee is supposed to identify transactions that could affect our national security  So  who chairs this Committee  Not the Department of Homeland Security  Not the Department of Defense  Not the Department of Justice  The Treasury Department  And chairing the committee is meaningful  because the chairmans interpretations of the statute  including the provision that makes a 45 day investigation mandatory in the case of foreign government controlled entities that could affect national security  tends to govern           GAO also found that Treasury is reluctant to initiate investigations to determine whether national security concerns require a recommendation for possible presidential action            Another serious shortcoming is that the intelligence community is not represented on the committee             Mr  President  these are concerns that we just cannot tolerate given todays threat environment  And that is why I am introducing legislation to abolish the CFIUS process and to create a new  inter departmental mechanism  chaired by the Department of Homeland security  to analyze transactions for both homeland security and national security implications  Our bill is designed to fix the process through the following changes           First  the bill would establish a new committee   the Committee for Secure Commerce  CSC    to replace the CFIUS  The CSC would be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security  The Secretaries of Defense and Treasury would serve as Vice Chairs  The Director of National Intelligence is specifically designated as a standing member  in order to ensure that important intelligence information is part of the deliberative process  With respect to other members  the President shall name appropriate agencies and offices to the committee           Second  the bill would explicitly include homeland security among the factors the Committee would consider in deciding whether to review or investigate a transaction           Third  the Secretary of Homeland Security would establish the process by which the committee reviews transactions  including the role and responsibilities of each member  In addition  each member would establish the process and procedure by which each respective agency would conduct its review  sharing that with the other committee members  It is important that committee members each have a general understanding of the scrutiny being applied to a transaction both within their own agencies and across the government  Such understanding was not apparent in the current CFIUS process           Should a transaction warrant an investigation  the bill would require the Director of National Intelligence to consolidate intelligence assessments                Lastly  this legislation would strengthen the reporting requirements to Congress  The existing process lacks transparency and does not allow sufficient oversight  It may be appropriate for the reviews  which may involve proprietary data and classified information  to be conducted confidentially  However  it is wholly appropriate that Members of Congress be briefed in a timely manner           The bill would also address the so called Byrd amendment loophole  requiring an investigation where the entity would be controlled by a foreign government  In looking at the plain language of the existing statute  a 45 day investigation should have taken place in the Dubai Ports World purchase of Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company  However  the Treasury Department interpretation of the statute for nearly 15 years has been contrary to congressional intent  and thus  Treasury found there was no need for the 45 day investigation  That so called ambiguity has been clarified in our bill  The bill would require a 45 day investigation in cases where an acquirer is controlled by a foreign government  as in the case of DP World           Mr  President  it is important that Congress take action to reform the review process for foreign investment in the    United States   This bill provides a new structure  appropriately focused on national security and homeland security  I seek my colleagues support in moving this legislation forward  Thank you                                                                              Browse
