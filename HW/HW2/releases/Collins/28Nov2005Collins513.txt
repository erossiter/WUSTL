                                     Collins requests an increase in the Pentagon   s shipbuilding budget citing the DD X  program November 28  2005  WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Susan Collins  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today sent a letter urging President Bush to propose an increase in the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DoD  budget that would begin to restore the nation   s shrinking U S  Navy fleet   Senator Collins is calling on the President to provide increased and consistent shipbuilding funding not subject to annual budget cuts in order to enable Congress  the Navy  and the shipbuilding industrial base  including Bath Iron Works  to plan for the future  increase the size of the fleet  lower costs  and maintain a stable shipbuilding industrial base        Following is the text of the letter       Dear Mr  President      I am writing to urge you to propose an increase in the Defense Department   s topline fiscal year 2007 budget to adequately meet the many ongoing needs of our military  particularly the need for additional shipbuilding funding        I am deeply concerned with the decreasing size of the United States Navy  and believe that the funding allocated to shipbuilding has not been adequate to sustain the numbers of ships necessary to meet future national security requirements   The fleet of the U S  Navy has dropped from 594 ships in 1987 to 281 ships today   the smallest Navy in our nation  s history since the First World War   For the last 12 years  we have been ordering an average of just six new ships a year   This is the lowest rate of naval ship production since 1932   If continued  our Navy soon will shrink to a fleet of 180 ships      The Navy   s fiscal year 2006 shipbuilding plan only calls for the construction of four new ships   two fewer than the Navy planned last year and far short of what is required to preserve today   s fleet in the long term   Budget constraints led to the drastic reduction in the acquisition and funding for DD X  destroyers in December 2004   All of the Congressional defense committees have attempted to help the Navy   s shipbuilding program by adding funding for the next fiscal year and by approving alternative funding policies  but these efforts alone are not sufficient   The budget requests submitted to Congress for the shipbuilding and conversion account for the last five years have averaged just over  9 5 billion a year  with only  8 7 billion in the fiscal year 2006 budget request        During an April 12th Seapower Subcommittee hearing  Admiral Clark  the former Chief of Naval Operations  testified that     The low rates of procurement  combined with the year to year instability and lack of predictability in funding  are profound threats to our shipbuilding industry   In the shipbuilding world  they want and need long term   stability   They need this   In the design area  they need to be designing new platforms   We  re at a watershed period in our history      He went on to say that the 325 number  as presented in the Navy   s recent 30 year interim report on shipbuilding as the high range number  is    my 375 ship Navy with new concepts applied to it  and that  s where I  d love to be    Now  I believe that it will take  14 billion or  15 billion over time to do that          The effectiveness of our Navy  however  relies upon the continued enhancement of the fleet   s strength and size   The Senate Armed Services Committee  in its report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006  stated     The committee believes that the shipbuilding budget must be reviewed by the administration as a matter of utmost urgency     and that    the President consider establishing a special shipbuilding fund  which would be funded apart from the normal give and take within the Department of Defense budget process           I am requesting that your fiscal year 2007 budget allocate the amount of funding necessary for shipbuilding and conversion  budgeted without prejudice to other procurement needs in the DoD budget  even if this requires an increase in the topline   Consistent funding at this level will enable Congress  the Navy  and the shipbuilding industrial base to plan for the future and implement acquisition and production reforms to lower the cost of shipbuilding   The additional funding and efficiencies will sustain the number of ships at or around the minimum 300 ship level      We must not jeopardize our country   s ability to counter current and future threats to our national security  particularly at a time when we face critical defense and humanitarian challenges around the world   While it is crucial that the federal government be fiscally responsible in this time of escalating deficits  it is essential that we provide robust resources to our men and women in harm  s way as part of our sacred obligation to them and to their families   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I look forward to continuing my work to strengthen our fleet and all branches of our military   I appreciate your consideration of this important request                                                                                   Browse by
