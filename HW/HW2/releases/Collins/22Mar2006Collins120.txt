                                       March 22  2006  WASHINGTON  D C Senator Susan Collins accepted an award today from the American Association of Port Authorities  AAPA  in honor of her selection as their Port Person of the Year for 2006  The AAPA represents over 150 public ports throughout the United States  Canada and Latin American  and this year honored Senator Collins for her outstanding commitment to improving the security of our seaports and working to afford them with the resources needed to reach this goal   The text of Senator Collins acceptance speech is provided below   Thank you  Bernie  Thank you all for this very great honor  This award  what it stands for and who its from  means a great deal to me  I am very proud to be included with those outstanding leaders you have honored in the past  such as my colleague and partner on port security legislation  Senator Patty Murray   It is a real pleasure to see so many familiar faces here today  people I have worked closely with over the years  People like Captain Jeff Monroe  Director of Ports and Transportation for the City of Portland in my home state  The knowledge and dedication he  and so many others here  bring to maritime issues are great assets to me in my work in the Senate  I accept this award with deep gratitude for all who have made it possible     Coming from a maritime state  I know the importance of the ferries that bind communities together  the cruise ships that support our tourism industry  and the cargo ships that drive our economy    I would like to focus my remarks today on an issue that is of paramount importance to me  and to this outstanding organization  the security of our nations seaports  In preparing for this event  it occurred to me that  rather than give a speech  I could just hand out copies of the op eds  columns  and Congressional testimony by Bernie and your president  Kurt Nagle  that describe this issue so effectively  We truly are on the same page   The announcements on the Dubai Ports World deal caused much heated debate in Congress and throughout the country  The silver lining of this controversy is that it has forced much needed attention to the issue of port security  There are now more members of Congress than ever before joining those of us who have long argued that our ports are a major vulnerability in our homeland security    The urgency cannot be overstated  Approximately 95 percent of our nations trade  worth nearly  1 trillion  enters or leaves through our 361 seaports  Our ports receive more than 8 500 foreign vessels  which make more than 55 000 calls per year  These ships carry the bulk of the approximately 800 million tons of goods that came into our country  including more than nine million containers and 175 billion gallons of oil and other fuels    Al Qaeda has a stated goal of causing maximum harm to the American people and maximum damage to the American economy  Clearly  our cargo ports provide a tempting target  One has only to visit a major port like Seattle with its large urban population  two stadiums nearby  and daily ferries with thousands of passengers to realize the enormous loss of life that could occur if a dirty bomb were detonated   We already have had a glimpse of the staggering economic damage a terrorist attack on a cargo port could produce  damage that would extend far beyond the waterfront  The West Coast dock strike in the fall of 2002 cost our economy and estimated  1 billion for each of the ten days it lasted  It not only brought those ports to a halt  but also harmed businesses throughout this country and along the entire length of the supply chain  And that astonishing amount of harm was the result of an event that was both peaceful and anticipated  A terrorist attack would be neither   Just as the attacks of 9 11 grounded all commercial flights  an attack on one port would likely result in the closure of all ports for a time  And the federal government has yet to establish protocols for resuming port operations and for deciding which cargo would be release first after an attack  The impact on factories and retailers using just in time inventory  as many businesses do  would be devastating  Much of our agricultural sector would also be harmed as farmers would be unable to export their crops    In addition to the threat of a direct attack on any port  any one of the more than nine million containers that enter the United States each year has the potential to be the Trojan horse of the 21st Century  A container usually contains consumer goods like TV sets  sneakers  or toys  But it could contain terrorists  biological agents  or even a nuclear weapon   For years  criminals have used cargo containers to smuggle narcotics  firearms  and people into the United States  These containers may come from any one a thousand ports overseas  with varying levels of security  They also could be intercepted or tampered with along the way by those who seek to do us harm   Here is an example of this vulnerability  Last year at about this time  I toured the ports of Los Angeles Long Beach  The physical size of these facilities and the amount of activity that takes place are startling  So  too  are the opportunities they offer for terrorists to exploit   By coincidence  my visit came just days before 32 Chinese nationals were smuggled into the Port of Los Angeles in two cargo containers  Fortunately  the Trojan horse held people seeking a better way of life  and not terrorists seeking to destroy our way of life  They were caught  What is particularly disturbing about that case is that they were not caught by any security initiative or new program  but rather by an alert crane operator  We cannot continue to rely on luck  or even alert crane operators  to provide for the security of our seaports  our nation  and our people   The vulnerability is clear  In fact  the report of the 9 11 Commission states that  while commercial aviation remains a possible target  the opportunities to do harm are as great  or greater  in maritime transportation  Other experts warn that a weapon of mass destruction is most likely to be smuggled into our country via our cargo ports     Despite the acknowledged vulnerability of our ports  we have continually underfunded port security  Further complicating the issue  the Administration has again proposed the consolidation of all transportation and critical infrastructure grants into one program  the Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program  TIPP   I oppose this proposal because I believe that a dedicated funding stream is essential to addressing port security needs   Last week  I was successful in offering an amendment to the 2007 Budget resolution to ensure no less than  300 million in dedicated funding for port security grants  These additional funds would be directed to three essential purposes  providing port security grants  purchasing additional non intrusive inspection equipment  and increasing the rate of validation of C TPAT participants  The Senate vote is encouraging  but the budget process has a long way to go  I can assure you that I will continue to advocate that port security is funded at an increased level  Last spring  I introduced the Port Security Grants Act  At  400 million per year for five years  this legislation would provide a steady stream of funding as a substantial down payment on port security needs  This competitive grant program would give individual ports the flexibility they need to address local conditions  Strong accountability provisions would prevent wasteful spending  These port security dollars would originate from duties collected by Customs and Border Protection  This is a major commitment of resources  but it is fully proportional to what is at stake  A fundamental goal of port security must be to head off trouble before it reaches our shores  Current supply chain security programs within the Federal government  however  have been separately conceived and managed by different agencies  rather than woven together into a layered  consistent approach  These cargo security programs  while well conceived  have been flawed in their implementation   The Container Security Program  CSI   in which Customs negotiates agreements with the governments of our trading partners to establish standards for container inspection and security  is a good concept  But government investigations have determined that the CSI program has been of questionable effectiveness due to inadequate staffing and equipment   For example  the Government Accountability Office reported earlier this year that only 17 5 percent of the high risk cargo identified by Customs and Border Protection was inspected overseas under CSI  The rest  despite being targeted for inspection  was simply loaded on cargo ships and sent to our shores   We cannot eliminate the risk of terrorist attack  but better supply chain security can build a stronger shield against terrorism without hampering trade  Indeed  greater security can promote trade and strengthen the global economy by building confidence and trust   Late last year  Senator Patty Murray and I joined forces on legislation to strengthen this shield as we expedite trade  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act was developed in close consultation with key stakeholders including port authorities  major retailers and importers  carriers  supply chain managers  security and transportation experts  and Federal and state agencies  Many of you in this room today provided advice and feedback on our bill  I thank you for your efforts   First  the bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to develop a strategic plan to strengthen security for all modes of transportation by which containers arrive in  depart from or move through seaports of the United States  This plan would clarify the roles  responsibilities  and authorities of government agencies at all levels and of private sector stakeholders  It would establish clear  measurable goals for furthering the security of commercial operations from point of origin to point of destination  It would establish mandatory  baseline security standards and provide incentives for additional voluntary measures   Second  the bill would create a new Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure implementation of the strategic plan  This small but important office would better coordinate maritime security efforts within the Department of Homeland Security and among our international and private sector partners   Third  my legislation requires the Department to make faster progress in strengthening port security  I am deeply concerned by the slow pace of the Departments agenda  For example  the Department has been working on a regulation setting a minimum standard for mechanical seals on containers for more than two years  The Transportation workers Identification Card has languished for four years despite the obvious importance of a secure ID to controlling access to our ports   Such delays are unacceptable  This legislation would set clear timelines to ensure steady progress  It gives the Department six months to establish minimum standards and procedures for securing containers in transit to the U S  All containers bound for U S  ports of entry must meet those standards no later than two years after they are established   Fourth  my legislation requires that 100 percent of incoming containers be examined for radiation no later than one year after enactment  The Department has pledged to deploy radiation detection equipment at all ports of origin in the U S  to examine cargo  The zero tolerance policy for radiation has been discussed since 2002  As of last month  however  less than a quarter of the detection equipment necessary for domestic coverage has been deployed  Even more frustrating is that the Department has changed the target for system deployment multiple times   Fifth  my legislation also will provide the ongoing  predictable funding to support container security programs  For the first time  programs like the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT will receive steady funding and clear guidance   Supply chain security requires a partnership among the Federal government  state  local  and overseas governments  and the private sector  This requires substantial investment of time  effort  and money by our partners  Yet  to date  the Federal investment in supply chain security has been haphazard  unpredictable from year to year  You in the private sector cannot be expected to make these long term investments without knowing that your Federal partners will follow through   Some of you may be wondering about the name of this legislation  GreenLane  This would be a new  third tier of C TPAT  which offers additional benefits to participants that voluntarily meet the highest level of security standards  Cargo in transit to the U S  through the GreenLane would be more secure through the use of container security devices and stronger supply chain security practices  The additional benefits may include further reduced inspections  priority processing for inspections  and  most important  preference in entering U S  ports in the aftermath of a terrorist attack  This incentive based approach works with the business community   Finally  this comprehensive legislation also includes the port security grants which I have introduced as a separate bill as well  I will continue to fight for this and additional funding   Americas seaports  large and small  are on the front lines of the war against terrorism  and they are vital to our economy at all levels  As Bernie put it in a recent Washington Times op ed  Secure and efficient ports play a critical role in the seamless  invisible  reliable movement of goods on which our country and its consumers depend every day   We cannot take this seamless  invisible reliability for granted  We cannot eliminate the risk of terrorist attack  but we can build a stronger shield against terrorism without hampering trade or travel  Port security is now a high profile issue  With your continued support  I believe that we can pass this important legislation this year    Again  I thank you all for the opportunity to join you today  and for this great honor
