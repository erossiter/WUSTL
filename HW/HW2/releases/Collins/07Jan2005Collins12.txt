                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Recommends Matthew Dunlap to Committee established by Collins Lieberman intelligence reform bill January 7  2005  Washington  DC     Senator Susan Collins today recommended Maine   s Secretary of State  Matthew Dunlap  to be named to a federal rulemaking committee that will be charged with developing recommendations for new standards for driver   s licenses and personal identification cards   The negotiated rulemaking committee will be established by the U S  Department of Transportation   It is the first step in a collaborative process between the federal government and states  in accordance with the Collins Lieberman Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  to establish standards that would make driver   s licenses harder to forge and harder to obtain with fraudulent documents Dunlap is scheduled to be sworn in today as the 47th Secretary of State for the State of Maine       In a letter to Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta  Senator Collins wrote     As one of the authors of the provision requiring consultation with State elected officials and State offices that issue these forms of identification  I believe that State officials have invaluable insights to offer in this standard setting process   This State Federal partnership presents a meaningful opportunity to establish minimum standards that will  ultimately  aid in our efforts to strengthen our borders and protect our nation against the threat of terrorism   I believe that Maine   s Secretary of State would make a particularly valuable contribution to this process           Maine   s Secretary of State oversees the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles   This Bureau  established in 1905  is responsible for qualifying and licensing drivers  as well as maintaining records of driver history  vehicle ownership  and vehicle registration          With 100 years of experience in this area  Maine   s officials are eminently qualified to participate in this important undertaking     wrote Senator Collins      Furthermore  in light of its size and its location on the northern border  Maine is ideally situated to represent the interests of both less populous states and other border states  with whom the State shares an interest in securing the nation   s borders while also allowing the free flow of legitimate tourism  trade  and other services that are so vital to our border communities   Secure identification documents are a necessary part of maintaining that important balance          The Collins Lieberman bill requires standards that would make it more difficult to obtain a valid driver   s license with bogus documents or to create a fake license  which could then be presented for identification at a border crossing or to board an airline flight                                                                              Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Current record
