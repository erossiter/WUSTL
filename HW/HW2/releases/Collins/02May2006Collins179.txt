                                      May 2  2006 WASHINGTON  D C Senators Susan Collins  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman today sent a letter to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton responding to her request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  be returned to an independent status   Senators Collins and Lieberman have released a bipartisan  737 page  report titled  Hurricane Katrina  A Nation Still Unprepared  The report  which was passed by the full Committee today  is the result of a seven month investigation into the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005  At the heart of the report are 86 findings that focus on failures at all levels of government to plan  prepare and execute appropriate  timely  and effective mitigation and relief efforts for the Hurricane Katrina disaster  and recommendations that include replacing the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA      The full text of the Senators letter is as follows    May 2  2006  The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton 476 Russell Senate Office Building Washington  D C  20510   Dear Senator Clinton    We write in response to your letter of April 28  2006  in which you express your opinion that FEMA should be made an independent agency and your opposition to the structural recommendations we have presented to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  We appreciate you sharing your views on this important matter  For the following reasons  however  we have taken a different position on the future of emergency preparedness and response in this country    Our Committee has recently completed a seven month investigation of what happened in the days leading up to and during the response to Hurricane Katrina  We held 22 hearings at which 85 witnesses testified  Our staffs conducted more than 325 formal interviews and analyzed more than 838 000 pages of documents  We conducted transcribed interviews of 47 FEMA officials alone  In short  we took a close look at what went wrong in the Gulf States before and after the catastrophe struck    One of our most important findings is that FEMA is not   and never has been  prepared for a catastrophe of Katrina s nature  As Scott Wells  a 6 year veteran of FEMA and the number two federal officer in Louisiana during the Katrina crisis put it  FEMA is like bringing a donkey to the Kentucky Derby  It simply does not have the assets and resources needed to prepare for a massive hurricane like Katrina   not to mention a catastrophic terrorist attack   nor to carry out an effective response    Our belief is that taking a weak FEMA out of the Department of Homeland Security would result in a still weak  but independent  FEMA  The end result is an entity that still does not have the assets or resources to prepare for and respond to a catastrophe    One belief we share is that FEMA should be elevated within the governmental structure and that the head of FEMA needs to have a good relationship with the President  But  again  we do not believe that elevating a weak FEMA is the answer    Our answer is to strengthen FEMA  give it the stature  resources  and leadership it needs to be effective  and assign new responsibilities to the agency  We also would develop a robust regional structure so that the same officials assigned to assist state and local officials in responding to disasters work closely with them to prepare  To signal this new approach  we also propose a new name that better reflects the agency s new mission    In your letter  you express the belief that we would dismantle FEMA and reassign its duties within DHS  The effect of what we are recommending  however  is exactly the opposite  The hardworking professionals of FEMA deserve a fresh start  We would take FEMA s existing personnel and assets and combine them with key preparedness and response resources  like grant programs and infrastructure protection functions   and call the combined entity the National Preparedness and Response Authority  The Director of the Authority would be elevated to the same level as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security  The Director would report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  but would also be the President s advisor on emergency management issues and would report directly to the President in times of catastrophe    In other words  the professionals and assets of FEMA would become the core of a strong  new organization  and that organization would be given more clout within DHS and the government    The NPRA would also maintain sibling relationships with key DHS assets  like the Coast Guard and law enforcement officers of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  These are precisely the entities that can help in the response to a catastrophe   conducting critical search and rescue missions and protecting lives and property  Moving FEMA out of DHS means needlessly severing these important organizational ties  It is far better to keep the ties and to accomplish the goals from within the Department of Homeland Security structure  which we do                                                                       Browse by                                                                    Current record
