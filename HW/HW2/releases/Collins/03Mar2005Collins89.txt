                                     Collins Points Out Inconsistency in Navy Acquisition Strategy During Armed Services Hearing Today March 3  2005  Washington  DC    Senator Susan Collins  a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee  questioned Navy Secretary Gordon England during a hearing today about the Department of Defense   s proposed change in DD X  destroyer acquisition strategy   The new plan could result in a winner take all competition for contracts to design and build the ships   Senator Collins has maintained that the military must maintain two shipyards with the capability to design and construct the military   s next generation destroyer  the DD X        At today   s hearing  Senator Collins pointed out to Secretary England an inconsistency in the Navy   s approach to ship procurement   She noted that in 2001 there were two producers of nuclear submarines  Electric Boat  owned by General Dynamics  and Newport News   General Dynamics attempted to purchase Newport News  an acquisition which would have led to sole source production for nuclear submarines   The Navy blocked the acquisition  citing the fact that the merger would have given General Dynamics a permanent monopoly in nuclear submarine production   Now  the Navy is proposing a sole source strategy for destroyer production   Senator Collins noted this inconsistency and elaborated on the hazards of the strategy   Senator Collins said           This acquisition would have ended competition in nuclear submarine construction   After reviewing the transaction  the Department of Defense opposed this acquisition  and along with the Department of Justice  blocked it   In explaining the decision  Charles James  the Assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust said     This merger would give General Dynamics a permanent monopoly in nuclear submarines and would substantially lessen competition in surface combatants      Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Suzanne Patrick said in regards to this issue that    We really had to maintain competition   We could not afford to let the yard go to what would end up being a sole source for us of submarines                Mr  Secretary  the Department believed  very correctly  that our nation could not afford to have a sole source producer of submarines    Why is it that now the Department apparently believes that we should have a sole source for surface combatants     said Senator Collins      I fail to understand how this logic is not applicable today   The rationale taken to split production of the Virginia submarines seems to me to be as valid then as it is today     competition guarantees better costs  design and production       Senator Collins stressed that it is vital to the future strength of the naval fleet that the military maintain a strong shipbuilding industrial base with skilled and experienced workers   She also stated the importance of constructing enough ships to meet the nation  s security requirements   The Navy   s budget proposes that only five DD X  be built over the next five years  Navy officials have previously admitted to Senator Collins that the fleet requires more ships  such as the twelve DD X  destroyers proposed in last year   s budget         The Committee Chairman  Senator John Warner of Virginia  shared Senator Collins views  indicating his objections to changing the acquisition strategy to only one producer of major surface combatants       Senator Collins  along with a number of Senate colleagues  wrote a letter to the President asking that he preserve two surface combatant shipyards for the construction of DD X  destroyers for the naval fleet   The letter is in response to reports that the Department of Defense is considering revising its acquisition strategy for the DD X  to conduct a winner take all competition in 2005  which would mean only one of the two shipyards would be awarded a Navy contract to design and construct the ships
