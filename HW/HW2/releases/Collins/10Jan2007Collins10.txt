                                     By Senator Susan Collins Pictured L to R  Army Specialist Shannon Ruopp  Monmouth  Specialist Jonathan Westman  Caribou  Senator Collins  Captain Rob Brewer  Portland  and Specialist Gary Lausier  Van Buren  January 10  2007    I recently journeyed to Iraq and Afghanistan as part of a congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain  It was a trip of cargo planes and helicopters  flak jackets and helmets  difficult but very informative  The purpose was to assess our military  political  and economic operations  to confer with military and political leaders of the region  and to thank our troops for their sacrifice and commitment    This was my third trip to Iraq and Afghanistan  In Iraq  I went to Baghdad  Ramadi  the capital of the dangerous Anbar province  and Basra  the southern port city  In Afghanistan  I journeyed to Kabul and Khost  a province on the border with Pakistan  As always  the highlight of this visit was my conversation with men and women from Maine serving in these dangerous lands    I am so impressed by the men and women of our armed forces  Our troops are brave  dedicated  compassionate  and highly skilled  They are a credit to our nation  and they enhance the legacy established by those who wore our nations uniform in previous generations    It gave me great pleasure to bring to our troops a little gift of balsam sachets from Washington County  the fragrance of Maine  They were delighted with the sachets  A Maine soldier told me that he would hang the sachet by his cot so that he could dream of Maine   Although I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  the opportunity to visit these two war torn countries gave me access to information and insight that only comes from being out in the field  In Iraq  I found that the war is very different depending on where one is  In Baghdad  sectarian violence between the Sunnis and Shiites threatens the very existence of Iraq as a nation  has engulfed the capitol in violence  and has cost the lives of our troops and thousands of innocent Iraqis  One Iraqi woman told me that every day when she leaves her home  she wonders if she will make it back that evening  Indeed  while we were in meetings on our first day in Baghdad  more than 60 people were killed    Iraqs President Talbani told us that he is most fearful each day going through police checkpoints  a telling commentary on the corruption and infiltration afflicting the police force   In contrast to the sectarian violence gripping Baghdad  the fight in the western province of Anbar is with Al Qaeda in Iraq  and the violence there is most often Sunnis versus Sunnis  Unexpectedly  we heard some good news in Anbar  A group of leading Sunni tribal leaders has decided to back the coalition against Al Qaeda  If this development holds  it could finally bring stability to Anbar  long considered the most hostile and dangerous region of Iraq   In Basra  we met with British commanders who talked about the declining consent line  that is  when the British first arrived  their presence was welcomed by the population  but as time has gone on  their presence is less and less tolerated   Needless to say  there was much discussion in all of our meetings  whether with Iraqi leaders  American or British commanders  or rank and file troops  about whether or not more American troops are needed  My conclusion is that it would be a mistake to send more troops to Baghdad  Prime Minister Maliki did not welcome the prospect of more American troops and indeed seemed frustrated that he did not have more control over his own troops  One American general told me that a jobs program in Baghdad would do more good than additional troops  And it seems to me that the Iraqis themselves need to step up to deal with the sectarian violence plaguing the Baghdad region  Ultimately  resolving the sectarian violence requires a political  not a military  solution in which the Sunni minority is more fully integrated into the government    The one region where an American commander  General Kilmer  did specifically express the need for more troops was in Anbar province  General Kilmer told us that he could use another brigade  about 3 000 troops  or even two to build on the positive developments in the region  I agree with his assessment  but think that a reallocation of troops  rather than an overall increase  could meet his need   Turning to Afghanistan  I found that the Afghans face three serious threats  nacro trafficking  corruption  and a resurgence of the Taliban  The opium trade makes up 35 percent of the nations Gross Domestic Product  and Afghanistan is the source of 90 percent of the worlds heroin  USAID has sponsored a program designed to convert farmers from growing poppies to other high value crops such as fruit and nuts  but so far  it does not seem to have been very effective  Living in a desperately poor country in which nearly three quarters of the population over age 15 is illiterate  Afghan farmers are hesitant to convert to other crops that are less lucrative   With the drug trade has come corruption  We met with the new Attorney General who is clearly committed to cracking down on corrupt officials  His energy and determination are clear  but his task seems overwhelming  It should be a high priority for our government to give him the support and protection he needs to be effective   The resurgence of the Taliban is  in part  the result of a sanctuary that Pakistan President Musharraf has created in the region bordering Afghanistan  Although a safe haven was not President Musharrafs intention  that has been the result  President Karzai told us that every single one of the suicide bombers killing Afghans has been from Pakistan    As a result  the relationship between Afghan President Karzai and Pakistans Musharraf has deteriorated steadily  yet their cooperation is vital to combating the Taliban    There were some bright spots  We visited a training facility for the Afghan National Army  and we were all impressed with the toughness and pride of the Afghan soldiers    In addition  several NATO countries  including the U S   Great Britain  Canada  and the Netherlands  have fought courageously to bring stability to Afghanistan s south After the winter passes  however  all observers anticipate a resurgence of violence in the spring  and it is critical that NATO engage this fight unencumbered by restrictions some nations  such as France  have placed on their ability to battle the enemy   I appreciated having the opportunity to see first hand the challenges that we face in Afghanistan and Iraq  particularly at a time when our nation faces critical choices in determining our future strategy in both countries                                                                         Browse by
