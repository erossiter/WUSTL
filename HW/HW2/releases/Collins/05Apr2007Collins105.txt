                                      April 5  2007 Washington  DC      Senator Susan Collins today announced that she has joined with Senator Ken Salazar  D CO  in sending a bipartisan letter to Chairman Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA  and Ranking Member Senator Larry Craig  R ID   the of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee requesting the committee restore funding to the Land and Water Conservation Funds  LWCF  stateside grants program    The letter comes in response to the Presidents Fiscal Year 2008 budget in which all funding for the stateside LWCF program was removed  At present  a bipartisan group of 42 senators have signed on to the letter    The LWCF program was created in 1964 to provide money to federal  state  and local governments for the purchase of land  water  and wetlands for the benefit of all Americans  Since the LWCF program began  its funding has assisted in the creation and development of over 40 000 state and local park and recreation projects in every corner of the United States  Additionally  the demand for this funding remains strong  with over 40 states reporting unmet funding needs exceeding 80     The Presidents decision to remove funding for the LWCF program is unfortunate  noted Senator Collins  Our environment is a treasure  and the LWCF program has continuously provided the funding needed to protect it    Senator Collins recently joined with Senator Salazar in sending a letter to President Bush requesting that he restore the funding to the LWCF program   A copy of the letter follows  April 5  2007  Dear Chairman Feinstein and Ranking Member Craig   We are writing to urge the Committee to restore funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund  LWCF  stateside grants program for FY 2008 to  125 million   Between 2002 and 2005  the President requested  and Congress appropriated between  89 million and  140 million per year for the LWCF stateside grants program  Few federal investments positively touch more American lives than projects funded through stateside LWCF  We find  therefore  the elimination of all funding for this program  as called for in the Presidents 2008 Budget  unacceptable    Since its creation by Congress in 1964  the LWCF stateside grants program has helped states and local communities build parks and playing fields  carve out trails  and preserve open spaces in all 50 states  It is significant that a considerable amount of the income going to the Fund has come about through the leasing of offshore oil rights  While one resource is being used another is being protected  Through FY 2006  the LWCF stateside grants program has supported over 40 000 projects to acquire open space for parklands or develop outdoor recreation facilities  The Land and Water Conservation Fund works in partnership with states and communities to deliver and protect opportunities for outdoor recreation  In October 2006  four fifths of the states reported that 80  of their funding needs for recreation facility development and parkland acquisition were unmet  Given this assessment of the importance of investing in local parks and recreation projects  we believe funding for Stateside LWCF should be increased  not eliminated    Congress created the stateside LWCF program to strengthen the health and vitality of the citizens of the United States  The program succeeds in doing so by providing seniors safe places to stroll  by providing workers opportunities to reduce stress and stay sharp  and by providing kids playgrounds and playing fields to stay healthy  In fact  a growing body of evidence is showing LWCF projects to be critical infrastructure in the battle to reduce obesity  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  which estimates that 65  of American adults and 16  of children are overweight or obese  even small improvements in the lifestyles of Americans would yield marked health improvements  If 10  of adults began a walking program  for example  costs for heart disease would decrease by  5 6 billion  Each dollar invested in building a convenient trail or park is returned several times over in reduced health care costs and improved quality of life    Because the LWCF program has been so effective over its 42 year history in creating new opportunities for parks and recreation  and continues to be essential to improving the health of the American people  we are strongly urging you to restore  125 million to the LWCF stateside grants program   We look forward to working with you to support this important program and we thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our request                                                                            Browse by
