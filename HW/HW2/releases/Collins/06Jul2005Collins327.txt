                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               July 6  2005  Mr  Chairman  Commissioners  in deciding to close DFAS Limestone  the Department of Defense deviated substantially from criterion five   This criterion states that the Department must consider the potential costs and savings  including the number of years for the savings to exceed the costs    The Department of Defense assumes that the DFAS closures would start in 2006 and be completed in 2011   The initial one time cost for this plan is  282 million   It would be paid back in the first year  and the twenty year net present value of total savings under this proposal would be  1 3 billion   Based on this analysis  it appears that the Department would reap substantial savings from an overall consolidation   There is  however  a fatal flaw in this analysis     While the Department did an overall analysis of the savings that would result from consolidation  it did not examine the specific costs and savings related to the proposed closure of DFAS Limestone   In fact  the Department did not do COBRA runs for any scenarios that would involve keeping Limestone open  This is precisely the issue raised in Chairman Principi   s letter of July 1st   This omission led to a flawed conclusion that  if implemented  would not be in the best economic interests of the Department of Defense  the people of Maine  or the American taxpayer      By using the Department   s own certified data  and its own COBRA model  we have demonstrated that the best option for the Department is not to simply leave the Limestone Center open  but actually to expand it   Our analysis shows that keeping DFAS Limestone open would maximize savings and reduce costs overall     An expert hired by the State of Maine examined the Department   s COBRA run on the DFAS consolidation plan   He then ran the COBRA model to determine the effect on the bottom line costs and savings of three different alternatives to the Department   s recommendation  first  assessing the impact of keeping the status quo at DFAS Limestone  second  examining the impact of growing DFAS Limestone to 480 positions  and third  evaluating the impact of expanding DFAS Limestone to 600 positions      The analyst made no other changes to the overall data    For example  he accepted the Department   s assumption that the planned reduction of the workforce to 241 would occur at DFAS Limestone even though the facility currently has 353 employees   He ran the entire COBRA model covering all 26 facilities   He then compared the scenarios where DFAS Limestone remained open or expanded with the Department   s overall COBRA analysis under which Limestone would be closed    The results of this analysis are remarkable   Using the Department of Defense   s own certified data  it is clear that closing DFAS Limestone would result in significant costs  not savings   In fact  the COBRA model demonstrates that the best way to maximize savings for the Department of Defense is actually to increase the workforce at DFAS Limestone      This chart shows the COBRA results of the four possible scenarios    On the chart  the horizontal line in the middle represents the status quo  keeping Limestone open with its currently planned number of employees   The line above the horizontal represents the costs to the Department over time from closing Limestone   The lines below the horizontal represent savings to the Department from keeping Limestone open and expanding it    The Department   s own COBRA model demonstrates that  when you evaluate the proposed closure of DFAS Limestone on its own merits  the closure does not contribute anything to the savings from the overall DFAS consolidation   In fact  it is just the opposite  This chart demonstrates that the costliest option for the Department     the top line of the chart     is to close DFAS Limestone    Retaining DFAS Limestone would save the Department  1 4 million in one time military construction costs to renovate the Columbus site  as well as  6 4 million in personnel and moving costs for a total of  7 8 million   These costs are the spike you see on the top line of the chart in year 2008     According to the COBRA run  there would be no savings over the 20 year BRAC period from closing Limestone       Even maintaining the status quo at DFAS Limestone is preferable    According to the COBRA run  if the status quo were maintained at Limestone     the horizontal line on the chart     the Department would avoid spending the  7 8 million just discussed   The twenty year net present value of these savings is  1 7 million     The first rule of BRAC should be to    do no harm      It   s clear that closing DFAS Limestone would be costly to the Department  and thus  the taxpayers    As you can see  the greatest benefit to the Department is to increase the size of the DFAS Limestone workforce   The business case for increasing the workforce at Limestone is compelling   DFAS Limestone could accommodate an additional 239 people for a total of 480 people with no military construction costs   For the purposes of this model  it is assumed that these positions would be those that the Department proposes be moved from Norfolk to Columbus   By moving them instead to DFAS Limestone  it eliminates the need for military construction funding at Columbus   This also produces savings in other areas because overhead as well as personnel costs  due to differences in locality pay  are demonstrably lower at Limestone than at Columbus    This alternative would save  2 9 million in one time costs  and the twenty year net present value of the savings would be  10 8 million    The savings for this scenario    shown on this chart    in comparison to the scenario proposed by the Department are even more startling     Compared to the Department   s proposal  an expansion at Limestone to 480 people would save  10 7 million in one time costs  and the twenty year net present value of the savings from this alternative would be  12 5 million    Growing DFAS Limestone would provide even greater savings to the Department over the long term   This is evident when you examine the scenario     shown on the bottom line of this chart     whereby Limestone would receive an additional 359 positions  bringing its workforce up to 600   For the purposes of the COBRA run  this would entail the 229 Norfolk positions going to Limestone  along with 80 positions that would go to Limestone instead of to Columbus      This scenario would require military construction funding of  1 23 million  which would allow for the renovation of 24 000 square feet at DFAS Limestone   This cost is  however  more than offset by the savings that result from the reduced personnel and overhead costs     Again  let   s look at the substantial savings this option would provide in comparison to the Department   s plan   Compared to that scenario  this proposal saves  11 9 million in one time costs  and results in twenty year net present value savings of  15 1 million to the Department and to the American taxpayer    BRAC criterion six states that the Department needs to consider the economic impact on communities in the vicinity of military installations   While the Department did analyze the economic impact of the closure  this analysis did not play a role in determining which sites would be consolidated   At the onset of this process  the Department ran an optimization model to determine the shape of DFAS consolidation  but that model did not take into account economic impact   Nevertheless  that was how the Department determined to go forward with the three sites      We have asked the Department if economic impact was included in this optimization model   The answer we received back     quoted here directly from a Defense Department document     was that the optimization model to determine the three gaining locations for DFAS did not include economic impact on communities    As the Department   s own analysis shows  the economic impact of the closure of DFAS Limestone on the surrounding communities in Northern Maine is the most severe among all of the 26 affected DFAS sites    In other words  the Department calculated economic impact  but did not consider it in making its decision to close DFAS Limestone   Despite the clear mandate in the BRAC criteria  economic impact was not factored into the initial closure decision  which became the final decision   This disregard represents a substantial deviation from criterion six   It is particularly important in this analysis  because this closure would be a double blow to Northern Maine  given the previous closure of Loring Air Force Base    DFAS Limestone has been the anchor for the redevelopment of the base  and closing this facility based on faulty analysis would be unfair and unwise                                                                                     Browse
