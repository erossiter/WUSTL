                                      March 20  2007 Washington  DC        In a letter to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer and Ranking Member Jim Inhofe  Senator Susan Collins is requesting authorization of  25 million in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007  The funds would ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers will have the funds necessary to fully protect the residents and beachfront at Camp Ellis    Following is the full text of Senator Collins letter   Dear Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe   I am writing to thank you for authorizing funding for the Camp Ellis Beach Restoration Project in Saco  Maine  as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2006  and to request that the Committee specifically authorize  25 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to undertake this important beach restoration effort as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007    The safety and well being of the people of Camp Ellis and Saco  Maine  depend on successful action by the Army Corps of Engineers  Unfortunately  it is also precisely because of the Army Corps of Engineers that the safety and well being of this particular community are at risk       Over 100 years ago  the Army Corps built a jetty extending out from the Saco River  adjacent to Camp Ellis Beach  As has long been known by the residents of Camp Ellis and was recently confirmed by an Army Corps study  this jetty has altered the pattern of currents and sand deposition and is the primary cause of the devastating erosion of Camp Ellis   The extent of the erosion is truly shocking  Some 36 houses have washed into the sea in the last 100 years  The 1998 shoreline is 400 feet from where the shoreline stood in 1908  The houses that are now in danger were once six or more houses back from the sea    In recent years  the problem has taken on an even more dire aspect  The beach and dunes have retreated  and the sea advanced  to such an extent that a distinct possibility now exists that a large storm could entirely breach the peninsula and turn Camp Ellis into an island  Such an event would be devastating to the people of Camp Ellis     I was very pleased that the Honorable John Paul Woodley  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works  took the time to tour Camp Ellis with me and see for himself the devastating erosion at this site  It is an extraordinary experience to look out over breaking waves and blue water  knowing that you re looking at the former site of roads  houses  city blocks  and even a railroad track    The results of wave  modeling studies undertaken at the direction of the Army Corps of Engineers indicate that at least two structures are likely to be needed to protect Camp Ellis from further erosion and destruction of property  Current data indicate that it will be necessary to build  at a minimum  both an offshore breakwater and a spur coming off the jetty  The total cost of these projects is likely to approach  25 million  I therefore respectfully request that you specifically authorize a minimum of  25 million in order to ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers will have the funds necessary to act upon the best available science and fully protect the residents of Camp Ellis   I recognize the difficult fiscal situation in which this nation now finds itself  and I know that you will face severe fiscal restraints as you draft this bill  However  I ask that you take into account that this problem was caused by the federal government  through the construction of a jetty at a time in which the erosional impacts of shoreline structures were largely unknown  Although this jetty has served the navigational needs of the nation well over its 100 plus years of existence  it is now time for the federal government to make good on its obligation to help those people who have been negatively impacted by this structure  I therefore ask that you specifically direct the Corps to undertake this project   On March 13  2007  I  along with Senator Snowe  introduced the Camp Ellis Beach Restoration Act  This bill would ensure that the Army Corps has the resources and direction necessary to fully protect Camp Ellis  I ask that you incorporate this bill into the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 in order to accomplish the above ends   I thank you in advance for your assistance on this project  I know I can count on you to work with me to ensure that Camp Ellis once again sees the return of stable beaches  I am sure you will agree that Camp Ellis has waited far too long  and seen far too many homes lost  for this problem to continue unaddressed                                                                               Browse by
