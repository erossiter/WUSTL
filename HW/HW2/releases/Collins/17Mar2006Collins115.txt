                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               March 17  2006 In a global economy  foreign investment is becoming increasingly common in this country  Some of these transactions raise national security and homeland security concerns  The recent controversy over the potential sale of terminal operations at U S  ports to Dubai Ports World  DPW   owned by the United Arab Emirates  exposed serious flaws in the current law governing such foreign investments  That is why I have introduced a bill to reform and strengthen the national security review process for foreign investment in the United States    In 1988  Congress passed provisions of the Defense Production Act to give the President the authority to suspend or prohibit any foreign acquisition  merger or takeover of a U S  corporation that is determined to threaten our national security  Through an Executive Order  the President gave the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  responsibility to review these transactions and to make recommendations to the President    The CFIUS is supposed to identify transactions that could affect our national security  But neither the Department of Homeland Security  nor the Department of Defense  or even the Department of Justice chairs this Committee  Instead  it is the Treasury Department  Moreover  the intelligence community is not even represented on the committee   Furthermore  the Government Accountability Office  GAO   in a report issued last September  found that the laws effectiveness in protecting U S  national security may be limited because the Department of the Treasury  as Chair of CFIUS  narrowly defines what constitutes a threat to national security  The CFIUS focuses too much on the financial component and not enough on security     These are serious concerns that we simply cannot tolerate given todays threat environment  That is why  as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security  I have introduced legislation to abolish the CFIUS process and to create a new  interdepartmental mechanism  chaired by the Department of Homeland Security  to analyze transactions for both homeland security and national security implications  The bill  cosponsored by my colleague Senator Joseph Lieberman  is designed to fix the process through the following changes    First  the bill would establish a new committee   the Committee for Secure Commerce  CSC    to replace the CFIUS  The CSC would be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security  The Secretaries of Defense and Treasury would serve as Vice Chairmen  The Director of National Intelligence is specifically designated as a standing member  in order to ensure that important intelligence information is part of the deliberative process  With respect to other members  the President would name appropriate agencies and offices to the committee     Second  the bill would explicitly include homeland security among the factors the Committee would consider in deciding whether to review or investigate a transaction    Third  the Secretary of Homeland Security would establish the process by which the committee reviews transactions  including the role and responsibilities of each member  In addition  each member would establish the process and procedure by which its agency would conduct its review  It is important that committee members each have a general understanding of the scrutiny being applied to a transaction both within their own agencies and across the government  Such understanding was not evident in the current CFIUS process     Fourth  this legislation would strengthen the reporting requirements to Congress  The existing process lacks transparency and does not allow sufficient oversight by Congress  It may be appropriate for the reviews  which may involve proprietary data and classified information  to be conducted confidentially  However  it is wholly appropriate that Members of Congress be briefed in a timely manner    The bill would also make clear that an investigation is required when the entity would be controlled by a foreign government  In looking at the plain language of the existing statute  a 45 day investigation should have taken place in the DPW purchase of Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company  However  for nearly 15 years  the Treasury Departments interpretation of the statute has been contrary to congressional intent  and thus  Treasury found there was no need for the 45 day investigation  That ambiguity has been ended in my bill  The bill would require a 45 day investigation in cases where an acquirer is controlled by a foreign government  as in the case of DPW     If there is any silver lining to the port controversy  it is that it has highlighted the vulnerability of our ports and the need for a greater emphasis on security  Senator Patty Murray and I introduced legislation last November that would help ensure that our cargo coming into Americas ports is secured through a layered system to protect the American people and global commerce     Despite the fact that DPW recently announced that it would fully transfer the U S  operations to a U S  entity  serious concerns about this review process remain  That is why I am committed to ensuring that Congress takes action to reform and strengthen the review process for foreign investment in the United States
