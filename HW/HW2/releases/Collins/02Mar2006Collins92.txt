                                     DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff testifies at hearing chaired by Senator Collins March 2  2006 Washington  DC  Senator Susan Collins today chaired a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to examine the Administrations Fiscal Year 2007 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff testified at todays hearing  The FY2007 DHS Budget proposal requests  42 7 billion in funding  an overall increase of six percent from last year    The following is Senator Collins statement from todays hearing   Three years ago today  the Department first opened its doors  As we review the implications of this budget proposal for our homeland security  we must do so in the context of both the accomplishments and the deficiencies of the past three years   The 2007 budget proposal requests  42 7 billion in funding  an overall increase of six percent  The Presidents budget includes a number of funding increases that will help the Department of Homeland Security make America stronger and the American people safer   For example  it provides increases for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to better secure our borders and to help bring an end to the catch and release practice of not detaining illegal aliens caught by law enforcement officers  It also prioritizes intelligence gathering and analysis at the Department   In addition  the budget would create an office within the Department to strengthen the security of chemical facilities  This is of particular interest to me  as I have held four hearings on chemical security and have introduced bipartisan legislation  with Senators Lieberman  Coleman  Carper  Levin and others  to authorize the Department to establish performance based standards to enhance the security of our chemical plants   But there are aspects of this budget I find troubling  The mission of DHS cannot be successfully accomplished from Washington alone  The Department must rely on a partnership with state and local governments  Yet  the Administration cuts grants to states and local governments  to police  firefighters  and other first responders  These grants help train and equip our first responders  including providing them with interoperable telecommunications equipment  As we have seen time and again  from the 9 11 attacks to Hurricane Katrina  this training and equipment are essential to an effective front line response to catastrophes    There are other areas of insufficient funding  Although this budget recommends a four percent increase for the Coast Guard  this amount is inadequate given the enormous expansion of the Coast Guards homeland security mission since 9 11  Ironically  this budget proposes to expand the Coast Guards responsibilities even further by adding the mission of National Capital Region Air Defense  Nor does the budget adequately fund the Coast Guards non homeland security missions  Indeed  under the proposal  the Coast Guard would suffer cuts in the areas such as search and rescue  marine safety  and environmental protection  The cuts to search and rescue are particularly incomprehensible in light of the heroic performance of the Coast Guard during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita    I am also very concerned that this proposed budget maintains the Deepwater program as a 25 year acquisition project while we continue to spend tremendous sums on legacy assets that are near or past their service life   The silver lining of the reaction to the pending sale of Peninsular and Oriental to Dubai Ports World is that it has served to highlight the critical importance of port security to our national security  Last November  Senator Murray and I introduced the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act of 2005  based on our years of work on port security  This comprehensive legislation authorizes  835 million for programs and initiatives to better secure our nation s ports  It provides strong direction to the Department regarding the crucial next steps in supply chain security  Regrettably  the Administrations budget does not dedicate a separate funding stream for port security grants  whereas our bill provides  400 million for that purpose  The budget request folds port security in with all transportation and critical infrastructure  thus providing no assurance of funding to strengthen the security of our ports   This budget proposal was developed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  While the Committees investigation of the preparation for and response to Katrina has highlighted many outstanding performances  such as by the Coast Guard  our investigation also has revealed a great many failures across the partnership of government agencies charged with disaster preparation and response  Nowhere are these failures more profound and disturbing than those within the Department of Homeland Security  which bears the ultimate federal responsibility for effective preparation and quick response   I am encouraged that this budget requests  50 million for a National Preparedness Integration Program  a new initiative that will fund activities to strengthen the nations capacity to prepare for and respond to natural or other disasters through catastrophic planning and improving emergency communications  I look forward to discussing with Secretary Chertoff today how this new initiative and how the overall budget will produce far better results than we saw with Katrina   Finally  of course  we come to FEMA  From the delayed  uncoordinated  and ineffective response to Katrina to the recurring waste  fraud  and abuse that afflict the relief programs  the performance of FEMA during this disaster has been a disaster itself  The budget provides for a 10 percent increase to begin the strengthening of FEMA  but I remain concerned that the problems Katrina exposed require not only more resources but also better leadership and a more integrated culture at DHS    A budget is primarily about money  but it is about more than money  It is about priorities  As we review a budget that will carry the Department of Homeland Security into its fourth year  we must ensure that the priorities will truly advance the goal of a stronger  safer America
