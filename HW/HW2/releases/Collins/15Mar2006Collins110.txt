                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               March 15  2006 WASHINGTON  DC   Homeland Security Committee Chairman Susan Collins has released a letter responding to Ranking Member Joseph Liebermans request that the Committee issue a subpoena to allow committee staff to depose the Presidents personal staff to include White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Frances Townsend  and to compel the production of additional documents relating to personnel of the Executive Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President    To date  the committee has held 21 hearings  obtained over 820 000 pages of documents  including more than 17 000 documents from the White House  has heard testimony from 80 witnesses  and conducted recorded interviews of more than 325 individuals     In her letter to Senator Lieberman  Senator Collins noted out that the Committee investigators have been adamant in their pursuit of documents relevant to the investigation  and that in cases where there was agreement that agencies have not been cooperative  such as the case with the Department of Justice  subpoenas were issued     Full text of the letter is as follows   March 15  2006  The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman Ranking Member Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 604 Hart Senate Office Building   Dear Joe    I am writing in response to the letter you sent me today on our investigation of Hurricane Katrina  It has been a pleasure working closely with you over the past six months to examine closely the preparations for and response to this catastrophic event  From our two trips to the Gulf region  to our twenty one Committee hearings and countless meetings with state  local  and federal officials  to our current  decidedly bipartisan effort to produce a final report that does justice to our undertaking  I am proud of our thorough investigation     MORE      Lieberman letter  2    This has been an extraordinary undertaking  Together with our staffs  we have received and analyzed 820 000 pages of documents  formally interviewed more than 325 people  and received hearing testimony from 80 witnesses  I think it is fair to say that our investigation has been the most comprehensive of the Katrina reviews  each of which has been useful in advancing the publics understanding    In your letter of today  you ask that the Committee issue subpoenas to the White House to compel the depositions of members of the Presidents personal staff and the production of additional documents relating to personnel of the Executive Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President  In my judgment  such subpoenas are neither warranted nor appropriate    Such a request raises the important issue of the extent to which our efforts could hinder the ability of this President  and future Presidents  to receive the candid advice that he needs to perform his constitutional duties  It appears that much of what you ask the Committee to subpoena would be covered by executive privilege  Therefore  I do not believe that it is in the Committees interest to subpoena the White House simply for the purpose of securing such an assertion    Together  we have been relentless in our efforts to secure the information we need to ensure that our investigation is thorough and comprehensive  I believe we have succeeded  On October 7  2005  you and I sent extensive requests for documents and information to the White House and the Office of the Vice President  On January 12  2006  we sent another letter to the White House prioritizing our requests and demanding more documents and information  Throughout the process  we have been in direct communications with the White House to secure the documents and information that we required  When problems arose  I took the lead in calling Cabinet secretaries and White House officials to secure their cooperation    We have been similarly adamant in our pursuit of documents and information from federal departments and agencies  The Department of Homeland Security alone has produced more than 350 000 pages of documents and made available 73 witnesses for interviews    Moreover  when one federal entity refused to make key witnesses available for interviews  I issued five subpoenas for Department of Justice personnel  who were promptly interviewed by Committee staff     As a result of our efforts  we have a clear window into the functioning and role of the White House in the days before and after Hurricane Katrina made landfall    The Executive Office of the President has produced more than 17 000 pages of documents  These documents include memos  policy analyses  and emails with electronic attachments sent to individuals in the White House  The Committee also has received transcripts of the FEMA hosted video teleconferences  including those in which the President or other White House officials participated  Collectively  these documents show us the information that the White House was receiving from various agencies before landfall and during the response phase  The production contains documents relating to the White House Task Force Katrina and includes lists of individuals attending White House organized meetings and summaries of agency efforts  Also produced were documents that include information provided to the most senior officials within the White House during the critical period     MORE        LIEBERMAN LETTER  3     In addition to the documents  the White House has provided two extensive briefings on its role in the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina  and a third briefing on the White House Lessons Learned report  All three briefings were presented by Ken Rapuano  the Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security  who was deeply involved in the response to Hurricane Katrina at the White House  These briefings  which we both agreed were very useful  included significant question and answer sessions where Committee staff had the opportunity to explore issues in depth     In addition to the information we have received from the White House document productions and briefings  the Committee has analyzed the Lessons Learned report  which further details the White Houses involvement in  and shortcomings relating to  the response to Hurricane Katrina  The 125 specific recommendations in the report include several suggestions that recognize problems with the White Houses role before or following the catastrophe    The Office of the Vice President  too  produced documents that have helped us piece together its role  and that of the White House  with respect to Hurricane Katrina  Among the more than 6 300 pages of documents produced are substantive emails  policy memos  and reports on the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina  Some of the emails were from David Addington  Counsel to the Vice President  and now Chief of Staff   The OVP also produced daily reports of the White House Hurricane Katrina Task Force and Homeland Security Council agendas    Finally  the Committee has gained extraordinary insight into the White House role through the testimony and subsequent interview of former FEMA Director Michael Brown  In his February 10  2006 testimony before the Committee and interview with Committee staff two weeks later  as well as through documents he produced directly to the Committee  Mr  Brown gave us a remarkably detailed view into the workings and deliberations of the White House during this critical period  As a result  the Committee has a well developed picture of the White Houses interaction with the top federal official on the ground before and during the critical days after Katrina made landfall  As you point out  we know that  through Mr  Browns communications with Deputy White House Chief of Staff Joseph Hagin  the White House was aware the day of the storm of the devastation that New Orleans had suffered  And we know  from documents produced to us by Mr  Brown  that White House Chief of Staff Andy Card was aware of what Mr  Brown had told Mr  Hagin    In your letter  you cite a February 9  2006 memorandum prepared by the Congressional Research Service for our Committee to make the point that Congress has broad power to obtain documents and information from the Executive Office of the President  The memorandum goes on  though  to point out that  for Congress to overcome the executive privilege  it must make a showing of need and unavailability of the information elsewhere  It also suggests that one test of whether such need and unavailability exists is whether the Committee can put the various pieces of information we have obtained together to create a coherent picture of what occurred  and why  in order to develop an informed legislative response     I believe that we have assembled a coherent picture of what occurred and that  together  we will develop an informed legislative response    Sincerely    Susan M  Collins   Chairman                                                                       Browse by
