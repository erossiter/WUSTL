                                      March 15  2007 Washington  DC         Senator Susan Collins hasco signed a letter  drafted by Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  and Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT   that requests an increase in funding for the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program  The letter was sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee    The letter requests  4 1 billion in CDBG for the 2008 fiscal year  President Bushs budget proposes an estimated  2 975 billion in CDBG funding  a decrease of approximately  735 million from the 2007 fiscal year   CDBG funding benefits communities across Maine  Senator Collins said  From Maines largest  urban communities  to our many small  rural towns  the CDBG funds awarded each year allow communities to pursue infrastructure improvement projects and community and economic development initiatives that would otherwise be unaffordable  If the Administrations proposed cuts to CDBG are enacted  I am concerned that communities in Maine will no longer have access to this critical stream of funding   Below is the text of a letter sent to Senator Kent Conrad  Chairman and Senator Judd Gregg  Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee   Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg    As you near consideration of the fiscal year  FY  2008 Budget Resolution  we urge the Budget Committee to oppose the Presidents budget proposal to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grants  CDBG  Program by  735 million  20 percent  from the  3 710 billion enacted in FY07  Instead  we urge you to maintain the Federal governments commitment to community development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  and support a budget allocation of  4 1 billion in Function 450 for CDBG     CDBG is the centerpiece of the Federal governments efforts to help more than 1 100 entitlement cities  urban counties  and States meet the needs of low  and moderate income communities  The CDBG program is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs to revitalize communities with proven results  It helps to fund a wide range of activities  including homeownership assistance  housing rehabilitation  public improvements  public services  and economic development projects  According to HUD  over 95 percent of FY06 CDBG funding went to activities principally benefiting low  and moderate income persons  In addition  CDBG housing projects assisted 179 385 households in FY06  including financial assistance to new homeowners and rehabilitation assistance to the elderly and other existing homeowners  In addition  the program helped create and retain 55 957 jobs in FY06 and provided vital public services to over 11 million persons    We are very concerned about the impact past cuts have had on the program and the continued impact the proposed cuts will have on the communities that rely on this funding to serve their most vulnerable residents  principally low  and moderate income persons  The CDBG formula allocation was funded at  4 41 billion in FY 01  Since then the formula allocation has decreased by  670 million  or approximately 15 percent  with a five percent cut in FY05 and a 10 percent cut in FY06  The FY08 HUD budget would reduce the formula funding by another 20 percent  cutting the formula allocation by almost 35 percent in just five years  Because of the cuts to the formula allocation  programs and projects funded by CDBG  and the number of residents served by these activities  have been cut too  A survey prepared by the CDBG Coalition in March 2006 found that the impact of the program cuts have been devastating  The survey asked CDBG grantees to provide projections of what they will be able to achieve with their reduced FY06 formula allocations as compared to the results they achieved using their FY04 allocations  A total of 351 grantees  out of over 1 100 grantees  responded to the survey with the following results    5 588 fewer businesses to be assisted  14 881 fewer jobs to be created  3 345 fewer jobs to be retained  5 843 fewer households to be assisted through homebuyer assistance  5 064 408 fewer low  and moderate income persons to be served  255 569 fewer elderly persons to be served  391 823 fewer children and youth to be served  and  196 150 fewer homeless persons to be served     Communities will continue to experience setbacks with a decline in funding for the CDBG formula allocation  Therefore  we urge you to increase the allocation for Function 450 in the FY08 Budget Resolution to accommodate  4 1 billion for CDBG during the appropriations process  We appreciate your attention to this matter of mutual concern
