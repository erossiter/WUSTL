                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               June 23  2006 WASHINGTON  D C The U S  Senate has approved the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization bill  which includes key provisions authored by Senator Collins for the DD X  program and Bath Iron Works  BIW   In addition  the legislation would authorize  9 6 million for the construction of a new Drydock Waterfront Support Facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery  The final vote was 96 0  The bill now moves to conference proceedings with the House of Representatives    This legislation provides essential resources to our troops as they engage in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan  training at home  or deployments in other countries around the world  said Senator Collins  a member of the Senate Armed Services committee  In addition to being important for our nations security  the programs and projects included in the bill are evidence that Maine companies make valuable contributions to the military and our countrys defense    Senator Collins says she is pleased that the Senate bill ensures a continued and steady workload at BIW    This bill places a high priority on shipbuilding by authorizing the simultaneous construction of two DD X  ships in FY 2007 and 2008  This is in stark contrast to the House Defense Authorization bill  which recommends the procurement of only one DD X  at a time   Thus  the House bill would result in significant program delay and disruption and could negatively impact the planned workload at BIW    The House bill also recommends reducing the overall DD X  program to only two shipsa significant decrease from the Navy s requirement for a minimum of seven DD X  ships in its 313 ship plan     Abandoning the DD X  dual lead ship strategy would be a major blow to our industrial base and would be detrimental to our national security  which requires that a high priority be placed upon building up our naval fleet to counter existing and emerging threats  said Senator Collins  That is why I will now vigorously advocate for the Senate provisions during negotiations with the House             The Senate Defense Authorization bill also includes  25 million in funding  requested by Senator Collins  to accomplish planning and engineering for modernization of the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke destroyer class  This program provides significant savings to the Navy by applying some of the technology that is being developed for the DD X  and back fitting the DDG  which reduces the crew size by 30 to 40 people  The bill also includes funding requested by Senator Collins for other defense related projects that benefit Maine and our national security including      2 million to the University of Maines Army Center of Excellence in order to continue the design and testing of lightweight ballistic panel tent inserts made from composite materials  These life saving panels protect our troops from insurgent attacks when they are sheltered in temporary dining or sleeping facilities in hostile environments       5 million to Hodgdon Yachts in East Boothbay  in a joint venture with Maine Marine Manufacturing and the University of Maine  for the Mark V replacement patrol boat that supports the missions of the Navy  Special Operations  and the U S  Coast Guard     9 6 million for the Kittery Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Drydock Waterfront Support Facility in Kittery  Maine  This new facility will replace the current submarine support center that is more than 60 years old and poorly designed for its current use     The Defense Authorization bill also includes several amendments either authored or cosponsored by Senator Collins  which include    An amendment authored by Senators Collins and Akaka that would strengthen whistleblower protections for federal employees  It would provide for protections for federal employees who disclose government waste  fraud  abuse  or threats to public safety      An amendment cosponsored by Senator Collins that is intended to address the faculty shortage at Americas nursing colleges  The Troops to Nurse Teachers program is a six year pilot program aimed at encouraging nurses leaving the military to become nurse educators
