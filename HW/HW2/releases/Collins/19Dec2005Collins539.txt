                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Sens  Collins and Lieberman Introduce the Bipartisan Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act of 2005 December 19  2005 Washington  D C       WASHINGTON  DC   Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman have introduced major  comprehensive legislation that would  for the first time  address the security vulnerabilities that exist at our nations chemical plants  The Chemical Facility Anti terrorism Act of 2005 would provide broad new authority to the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that    America s chemical facilities are better protected from terrorists  The bill is cosponsored by Senators Norm Coleman  R MN   Thomas Carper  D DE   and Carl Levin  D MI       Senator Collins said  This legislation addresses one of our nations greatest vulnerabilities   the threat of a terrorist attack against a chemical facility  My legislation would provide broad new authority to the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the nations chemical facilities are better protected from terrorists  The potential devastation than an attack on a chemical facility could cause  the sheer number of these facilities  the current widespread lack of security  and the clearly states intent of terrorists to cause maximum harm to the American people and to our economy make these measures necessary      Senator Lieberman said  Since 9 11 opened our eyes to the threats we face on    U S  soil from Islamist terrorist groups  we have moved to improve security for many of the critical elements of our society and economy  Senator Lieberman said  But somehow we have not yet protected one of our greatest vulnerabilities   the chemical sector  This legislation is a forceful but pragmatic response to the challenge of chemical site security  It directs its greatest force and focus to those facilities that pose the highest risk in terms of potential loss of human life or other catastrophic results           Specifically  the bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to establish risk based criteria to determine which chemical facilities are vulnerable to terrorist attack and establish security standards for those facilities  Chemical plant facilities would be required to conduct vulnerability assessments and create site security and emergency response plans based on their specific vulnerabilities  subject to approval by the Secretary of Homeland Security        MORE               CHEM SECURITY  2         Facilities that fail to comply with the security standards would be subject to fines and penalties  In addition  the bill gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to shut down high risk chemical facilities that the Secretary believes have not adequately addressed the risk of a terrorist attack       The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has held four hearings on chemical security       Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act of 2005         Bill Summary 12 20 05            The Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act of 2005 gives the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  powerful new authority to regulate the security of chemical facilities across the    United States   The bill takes an integrated approach to security which addresses both the threat and consequences of a potential terrorist attack in a comprehensive manner  All covered chemical facilities must complete a vulnerability assessment  security plan  and emergency response plan  This legislation is both risk based and performance based      Risk based  The bill requires security measures at a given facility to be proportional to the threat and consequence of a potential terrorist attack at that facility  The greater the threat or consequence of a potential terrorist attack  the greater the security measures required to protect against such an attack or mitigate or reduce the consequences if there is an attack        Performance based  Chemical facilities must meet strong performance standards determined by DHS  DHS will direct facilities to defend against a certain type or level of security threat based on the tier to which the facility belongs and the risk the facility faces  Facilities can then choose the most economical and effective means of addressing the threat and consequence of a terrorist attack on their particular facility  Different means of mitigating or reducing the risk of a terrorist attack or the consequences of a terrorist attack are placed on a level playing field as long as they reduce vulnerabilities and achieve the standards established by DHS  If DHS determines that a chemical facility has not met the performance standard  or has not adequately addressed either the threat or consequence of a terrorist attack  DHS can order the closure of the facility          Covered Facilities         The bill requires DHS to designate covered chemical facilities based on a variety of risk factors  including the potential of death or illness caused by a terrorist attack  proximity to population centers  and the potential impact on national security  the economy  and critical infrastructure  As a starting point  the bill directs DHS to consider all facilities on the Environmental Protection Agency s Risk Management Program  EPA RMP  list  which contains more than 15 000 facilities which store  produce  or use greater than threshold quantities of hazardous chemicals  DHS would apply the specified criteria to these facilities        MORE        CHEMICAL SECURITY  3          The bill also gives DHS the authority to cover facilities not on the EPA RMP list  for example if the facility is of critical economic importance or contains greater than threshold quantities of ammonium nitrate or other chemicals not on the RMP list but of concern to DHS  DHS has one year to designate covered facilities  but must give preliminary notification to all facilities likely to be covered after six months        Tiered Approach to Security    In addition to designating covered facilities  DHS must also assign each facility to a security tier  The chemical sector is incredibly diverse  including chemical manufacturers  distributors  oil and petrochemical  and agriculture  The risks faced by different facilities are equally diverse  Since a rural facility may face very different security risks than a facility near a major population center  different tiers will help ensure that facilities undertake security measures proportional to the facility s risk  and will also help prioritize DHS s efforts on the highest risk tiers  For example  DHS must review security plans from higher risk tiers first  within one year  and those plans must be resubmitted more often  every three years  compared to every five years for other facilities   Nevertheless  all covered facilities must submit plans to DHS  and DHS must review all plans within five years        Vulnerability Assessment        All covered facilities are required to conduct a vulnerability assessment  based on a rigorous methodology developed or endorsed by the Secretary  that evaluates the sufficiency of security measures relative to both the threat and consequences of a terrorist attack  The vulnerability assessment must address the appropriate security performance standards established by the Secretary  and must also include an analysis of weaknesses in physical security  communications systems  and electronic  computer  or other automated systems  The vulnerability assessment must also evaluate the sufficiency of security measures  which include reducing  modifying  or substituting hazardous chemicals  in addressing vulnerabilities at the covered facility arising from the nature and quantity of hazardous chemicals and the use  storage  or handling of those chemicals         Security Plan         All covered chemical facilities must create and implement a site security plan which addresses the risks identified in the vulnerability assessment  meets the appropriate security performance standards established by the Secretary  and includes security measures appropriate to the tier level of the chemical facility sufficient to deter  to the maximum extent practicable  a terrorist incident or a substantial threat of such incident  Chemical facilities must coordinate their security plans with federal  state  and local government officials  including law enforcement and first responders  Each security plan must designate a security officer who will be the point of contact for federal  state  and local law enforcement and first responders  Security plans must include training  periodic unannounced drills  and exercises  and must identify employee roles and responsibilities          MORE         CHEMICAL SECURITY  4       Emergency Response Plans         All covered facilities must create an emergency response plan  or update an existing emergency response plan to reflect planning for a terrorist attack scenario  This plan must specifically address the consequences identified in the vulnerability assessment and must be consistent with a site security plan        Compliance         All vulnerability assessments  security plans  and emergency response plans must be submitted to the Secretary not later than six months after the promulgation of regulations  Each owner or operator of a covered chemical facility must certify in writing to the Secretary that the owner or operator has completed a vulnerability assessment  has developed and implemented a site security plan  and has reviewed or is implementing an emergency response plan     The Secretary must approve or reject all vulnerability assessments  security plans  and emergency response plans for facilities in higher risk tiers within one year  and within five years for all other facilities  The Secretary must disapprove of any vulnerability assessment  site security plan  or emergency response plan not in compliance with the provisions of the legislation  The Secretary will conduct subsequent reviews and determinations of compliance on a schedule as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary     For higher risk facilities  if the Secretary disapproves of the assessment  plans  or implementation of the plans  the Secretary may order the immediate closure of the facility  For other facilities  the Secretary may also order the closure of the facility  but only after a process of written notification  consultation  and further time for compliance        Civil  Criminal  and Administrative Penalties         The bill provides for administrative  civil  and criminal penalties      Administrative  The Secretary may impose an administrative penalty of not more than  25 000 per day  and not more than  1 million per year  for failure to comply with an order or directive issued by the Secretary      Civil  The Secretary may bring a civil action in a United States District Court  with penalties of up to  50 000 per day  for failure to comply with an order or directive issued by the Secretary     Criminal  An owner or operator who knowingly violates any order issued by the Secretary  or fails to comply with a site security plan  shall be fined not more than  50 000 per day  imprisoned not more than two years  or both                MORE         CHEMICAL SECURITY  5       Implementation         To ensure effective implementation and compliance  as well as to bolster response planning  the bill directs DHS to create a chemical security office at DHS headquarters  as well as regional offices and area committees at a more local level  At the national level  the Department will facilitate comprehensive planning and resource management  provide a mechanism that facilitates a constant review and improvement cycle for chemical facility security  and coordinate with industry on a strategic level for ensuring and improving security  The regional security offices  to be aligned with the FEMA regions  will oversee facility compliance  conduct large scale exercises  and coordinate with senior state personnel to promote regional mutual aid agreements  DHS is also directed to create areas and assign a Federal security coordinator to oversee an area committee comprised of qualified security and response personnel  including officials from State and local government  chemical facilities and local emergency planning and response entities  The area committee concept is borrowed from the Coast Guards successful implementation of the Maritime Transportation Security Act  MTSA   Area committees will provide enhanced coordination for security and emergency response planning with the local law enforcement and first responders     Protection of Information         In order to keep sensitive information that is provided by chemical sources to DHS from falling into the hands of terrorists  this legislation exempts such protected information from disclosure under Federal Freedom of Information Act  FOIA   and any State or local law providing for public access to information  DHS is required to create confidentiality protocols for maintenance and use of the protected information  This section allows for disclosures under FOIA for approvals  disapprovals  and other orders under this Act  unless the Secretary makes a finding that releasing any of these records would increase the risk to the chemical facility or other facilities  This finding is limited to 6 months  unless the Secretary makes subsequent determinations  This provision does not protect information that is required to be disclosed under other Federal or State law or regulations  This provision does not interfere with federal employee disclosures protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act  and it establishes a secure channel by which members of the public may submit information to DHS about security problems at chemical facilities  Unlawful disclosure of protected information includes civil and criminal penalties      Preserving State s Rights and Local Authority    While this legislation sets a strong Federal standard  it preserves the right of States and localities to adopt chemical security requirements that are more stringent than those in the Federal law  as long as the State or local law or regulation does not actually conflict with the Federal law  In addition  nothing in this act shall preclude or deny the right of any State to adopt or enforce any requirement  including air or water pollution requirements  that are directed at problems other than reducing damage from terrorist attacks
