                                     Maine Senators Snowe and Collins urge passage September 27  2007 Washington  DC         U S  Senators Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch today said there is significant support among Republicans for bicameral legislation to reauthorize the state childrens health insurance program  SCHIP     The State Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act under consideration today maintains all of the key policy provisions of the bill passed by the Senate in August  including a cap on new spending of  35 billion    Grassley and Hatch helped to draft the legislation as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance and Ranking Member of the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care  They said the support of so many leading Republican senators indicates the strength of the bill and the success of the SCHIP program    Supporters said    While some may mistakenly characterize S CHIP coverage as a welfare benefit  what they may not realize is that nearly 90 percent of uninsured children come from families where at least one parent is working  Today  fewer than half of parents in families earning less than  40 000 a year are offered health insurance through their employera nine percent drop since 1997  S CHIP has proved to be both a successful program and a saving grace for millions of American families who otherwise simply could not afford to pay for their childrens health care  Compromise on both sides of the aisle helped us create this program ten years ago and hopefully a renewed sense of bipartisan commitment will help us successfully reauthorize this vital program today  said Senator Olympia J  Snowe of Maine    It is critical that we not let SCHIP expire and that we extend the program to cover additional low income children  I urge my Senate colleagues to approve this vital legislation by a veto proof margin  This program simply cannot be allowed to expire  said Senator Susan Collins of Maine     This bill marries good policy with good health care common sense by funding a vital program for kids and discouraging smoking among our youth  We have found a workable solution to get coverage to those kids in need without over extending the goals of the program  It would be irresponsible of the White House to veto this bill and deny millions of kids their chance at a healthy childhood  said Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon    I am proud to support this important bill  which will provide health insurance coverage to approximately 4 million more children who would otherwise be uninsured  Im glad my colleagues and I were able to put politics aside and do what is right for these children  said Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas    SCHIP is an important program to New Hampshire  providing health care coverage to thousands of lower income children that would otherwise go uninsured  Months ago  I made a commitment to support reauthorization  I followed through by backing the Senate bill in August and will do so again when the final bill reaches the floor  House and Senate negotiators took the right step in rejecting drastic and unacceptable cuts to Medicare in the original House passed legislation  a measure that would have jeopardized millions in funding to New Hampshires hospitals and nursing homes and would have all but eliminated the Medicare Advantage program that provides health care to more than 3 000 New Hampshire seniors  said Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire    New Mexico has a persistent problem with uninsured children  I helped create SCHIP as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act  My commitment to childrens health care remains firm today  and I believe this compromise SCHIP reauthorization bill should be enacted  The program has been a success  The number of children without health coverage has declined but the need for this program remains  said Sen  Pete Domenici of New Mexico    The legislation gets the childrens health insurance back on track by making states enroll low income children and cutting off adult coverage  About half the new money is just to keep the program running for the kids already on it  The rest goes to enroll as many as 4 million new kids  Senator Grassley said                                                                               Browse by
