                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May 20  2005  Memorial Day is a time when the heroism of men and women who served our country is honored  remembered  and celebrated   We should take this time to both remember the service men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending our freedom and those who are today putting their lives on the line for our country       As we remember our nation   s fallen heroes this Memorial Day  I am reminded of the opportunity I had earlier this year to visit the North Africa American Cemetery in Carthage  Tunisia  during a Senate Armed Services Committee trip which included stops in Iraq and Afghanistan   The cemetery is a sacred tribute to the American men and women who lost their lives during the Allied landings in Morocco and Algeria during World War II  as well as during their occupation and in the subsequent fighting that culminated in the liberation of Tunisia   Others died as a result of accident or sickness in North Africa  or while serving in the Persian Gulf Command in Iran         The American Battle Monuments Commission built and maintains the cemetery in North Africa   Created by Congress in 1923  the Commission also maintains memorials and cemeteries in the United States and in the many foreign countries where the United States Armed Forces have served since 1917         The cemetery site in Carthage  covering 27 acres of the plateau that lies between the Mediterranean and the Bay of Tunis  was established in 1948   Construction of the cemetery and memorial was completed in 1960   It is located near the site of the ancient city destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC and lies over part of the site of Roman Carthage   Buried here are 2 841 of our soldiers who lost their lives in the region  including 13 Mainers   Another 35 men and one woman  Shirley Charter  from Maine are listed on the    Tablets of the Missing      Also in this cemetery  in four instances  are two brothers buried side by side   Medal of Honor Recipient Private Nicholas Minue is interred there  as well as Woman   s Army Corps Private Celia Goldberg         The Tablets of the Missing consist of a wall 364 feet long  which includes panels bearing the names of 3 724 of missing soldiers  sailors  marines  airmen  and Coast Guard members   These men and women gave their lives in the service of their country  but their remains were lost  buried at sea  or not identified   At each end of the tablets is this moving inscription  HERE ARE RECORDED THE NAMES OF AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY AND WHO SLEEP IN UNKNOWN GRAVES 1941     45   INTO THY HANDS O LORD   Near the foot of the steps leading down from the forecourt is a pool and figure of honor poised to bestow a laurel branch upon those who gave their lives   The figure   s pedestal bears this inscription  HONOR THEM THAT TROD THE PATH OF HONOR       On the visitor   s building is a quote from General Dwight Eisenhower  HERE WE AND ALL WHO SHALL HEREAFTER LIVE IN FREEDOM WILL BE REMINDED THAT TO THESE MEN AND THEIR COMRADES WE OWE A DEBT TO BE PAID WITH GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR SACRIFICE AND WITH THE HIGH RESOLVE THAT THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY DIED SHALL LIVE        Along the wall are two sculptured figures  MEMORY and RECOLLECTION  the latter holding a book with the inscription PRO PATRIA  for one   s country    Between these figures are oak leaf wreaths on which are engraved the names of the battles on land  sea  and in the air  in which the American forces participated         Next we entered the Court of Honor and chapel   Within the Court of Honor is a large rectangular stone of remembrance and this inscription  adapted from Ecclesiastes 44  SOME THERE BE WHICH HAVE NO SEPULCHRE   THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE   Further inscriptions read in English  French  and Arabic  1941     1945     IN PROUD REMEMBRANCE OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HER SONS AND IN HUMBLE TRIBUTE TO THEIR SACRIFICES THIS MEMORIAL HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   A large map records the military operations of the American Forces and those of the Allies in Morocco  Algeria  and Tunisia from the initial    Torch    landings on November 8  1942 to the Axis surrender on May 13  1943         The simple chapel is lighted by a tall window on the right and a row of lower windows on the left and contains an altar of white marble inscribed with a Biblical quotation and one from Shelley   s ode    Adonais        HE HAS OUTSOARED THE SHADOW OF OUR NIGHT     To the left of the altar are the United States flag and Christian and Jewish chapel flags   The flags of the Infantry  Field Artillery  Air Corps  Armor and Navy Infantry Battalion soar above the pews   Beneath the flags is this prayer  ALMIGHTY GOD  RECEIVE THESE THY HEROIC SERVANTS INTO THY KINGDOM   North of the chapel  down a flight of steps  is a memorial garden with a pool   The plants include latana  poinciana  pink geraniums  and a Jerusalem thorn tree   And beyond is the cemetery       As I walked among this beautiful monument and cemetery  I said a prayer of gratitude to those service men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice       Best wishes to all Mainers as we celebrate Memorial Day   As we enjoy picnics and parades  let us pause to remember those whose sacrifices and service ensured our freedom
