WASHINGTON, DC B U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement in preview of the President’s speech tonight on Iraq:   	“The last thing we need is to be setting timetables on withdrawing our troops. Our troops should leave when Iraqis themselves are capable of running their country and protecting their citizens from the terrorists. A timetable, while it may be politically convenient in the short-term, would in the long-term boost the morale of the insurgents. There will always be those who want to cut and run, but President Bush understands the need to fight and win and that will continue to be his message to the American people. Reports from the field show that progress is being made despite what CNN says.”
