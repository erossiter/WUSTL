WASHINGTON, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined Washington Memorial Airport and local officials to discuss how the airport has spent the federal dollars Bond has secured for the upgrade and expansion projects in recent years and to discuss future transportation issues.    	“Missouri airports are crucial to our state’s future economic success.  In addition, these smaller airports are critical to providing effective intra-state and regional air service,” said Bond.      	Bond stressed that all over Missouri and the nation, smaller general aviation airports are seeing their capacity and aircraft operations increase significantly and these airports need the funding to make the necessary infrastructure improvements. 	     	Washington Memorial is a perfect example, said Bond.  In recent years the region has experienced tremendous business growth, but the Washington, Missouri airport’s limited facilities and small runway became a hindrance to further business development for the city and area.   As a result of federal aviation dollars secured by Bond the airport now has 5000 feet of runway and can accommodate the increased need.      	Unfortunately, the President has proposed a $600 million cut for the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP) in the fiscal year 2006 budget.  Particularly for smaller municipal airports, such as Washington Memorial, these funds are critical in providing reliable basic air service.    	Earlier this month, Bond became the new chairman of the Transportation, Treasury and Housing subcommittee, providing the Senator another platform to both benefit Missouri and shape national transportation policy. Through this new post, Bond will work to restore as much of this critical aviation funding as possible.
