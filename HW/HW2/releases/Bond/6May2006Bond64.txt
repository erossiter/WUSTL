FULTON, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond and Congressman Kenny Hulshof today joined residents, local officials and members of the Kingdom Pilots Association to celebrate the ribbon cutting for the new runway at the Elton Hensley Memorial Airport in Fulton, Missouri.    	“These improvements are an investment in Fulton’s future success, economic prospects and the quality of life for all its families.  Projects like this are a good example of how growth can be a positive thing with the right plans in place,” said Bond.    	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured over $2,000,000 in federal funds for the project in the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  The funds were used for the construction of a new 4,000-ft runway at the Elton Hensley Memorial Airport.     	Bond praised local leaders for their commitment to Fulton and for identifying the runway project as critical to the current and future needs of this growing area.    	“Today marks the culmination of several years of planning, funding, and construction that required the combined efforts of your local leaders,” said Bond.    	As Missouri’s senior Senator, Bond said his job is to help create the conditions for local communities to flourish:  including providing modern transportation options and seed money to jump start distressed areas.       	Bond uses his position on the Appropriations Committee to return the money Missourians send to Washington back to the state to help finance local priorities identified by local leaders who are committed to improving communities like Fulton.
