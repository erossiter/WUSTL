WASHINTON, DC  U.S. Senators Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill today sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary, Mike Johanns, requesting quick approval of Governor Blunts request for an agriculture disaster declaration for the Missouri communities hit hard by winter storms. From January 12  14th, severe winter storms hit the state. Earlier this week the President declared a major disaster for the State of Missouri. If the Agriculture Secretary approves todays request, Missouri farmers and ranchers would qualify for additional disaster funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   In the letter to Secretary Johanns, Bond and McCaskill said, The amount of damage caused by the winter storm is significant throughout the affected area. The heavy ice accumulation has led to structural damage of farm buildings, fences and significant livestock losses. Funds need to be directed to Missouri to assist farmers and ranchers in rebuilding the agriculture infrastructure damaged in this ice storm.   It is our hope that you will grant Governor Blunt's request promptly, to help Missouri farmers and ranchers recover from this disaster. Along with our fellow Missourians, we eagerly await your decision on this request for assistance.   Bond and McCaskill also asked the Agriculture Secretary to approve the request for Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds.
