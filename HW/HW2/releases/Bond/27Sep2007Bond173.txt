U.S. Senator Kit Bond today voted for reauthorization of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).  SCHIP is a valuable safety net for needy children in families who dont have the means to purchase affordable health care. Millions of children receive the vital well-child and preventative care, vaccinations, and emergency care they need to grow, learn and thrive thanks to the SCHIP Program. I am proud of my votes to create SCHIP in 1997 and to reauthorize the program today, said Bond.  Bond emphasized that while he voted for this important program, he disagrees with the funding method to make SCHIP possible.   I have never met a tax increase that I liked. Unfortunately, the SCHIP bill is paid for with a massive, regressive tobacco tax increase that will disproportionately burden low income families. With the number of smokers on the decline, funding an SCHIP expansion with an unstable source of revenue is not a wise plan to protect coverage for children long term. I dont want to make providing health insurance coverage for needy children dependent on increasing the number of smokers nationwide, said Bond.
