WASHINTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he has secured $500,000 in federal funds to expand water treatment capacity in northeast Missouri.   	"Today's funds will go a long way in meeting northeast Missouri’s water needs.  I will continue to work with the community leaders in our efforts to improve the quality of life for families in rural Missouri,” said Bond.  "Clean water is critical to the health of the environment and economy.  I am committed to improving the water quality in Missouri's communities and will continue to deliver federal funds for these important efforts."    	Bond secured $500,000 to help fund the expansion of the Clarence Cannon Wholesale Water Commission Treatment Plant (CCWWC).  The project will expand the existing water treatment capacity from 5 million gallons per day to 7.5 million gallons per day.  It will also include connecting the Macon County PWSD #1 and the city of Wellsville to the CCWWC’s transmission system.    	The CCWWC serves 20 communities and rural water districts in northeast Missouri. CCWWC continues to see growth in demand for clean drinking water each year.  Also, with improvements to area highways a stable water supply to support continuing development is needed.   	Bond noted that in addition to increasing water treatment for northeast Missouri, this project will also require a minimum of three major construction projects, resulting in 50 – 75 construction jobs.    As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured more than $4 million for critical Missouri environmental projects in the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill.  The spending bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon.  Before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
