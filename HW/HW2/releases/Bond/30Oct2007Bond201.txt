KANSAS CITY, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved $10 million in federal funds for the development and construction of low income elderly housing in Kansas City.   AI am pleased to play a part in making good, low income housing a reality that will also serve as an anchor for the continued redevelopment of Kansas Citys urban core, said Bond. By working together, these projects will become a reality, and we will improve the quality of life for many seniors in Kansas City.  HUD approved $5.1 million in federal housing funds for Catholic Charities of Kansas City- St. Joseph, Inc. to construct 47 units of affordable senior housing. The seniors will also benefit from various supportive services, a common activities room with a small kitchen area, office and laundry room.   Additionally, HUD has approved $4.9 million in federal housing funds for Harvest Church, Inc. to construct 47 units for low income senior housing. The three-story building will have an elevator, community room, lobby and laundry room. The funding project is part of their Destiny Towers multi-phased development project.    HUDs Section 202 Program funds supportive housing for very low-income seniors, including the frail elderly, and provides rent subsidies for these projects to help make them affordable.    As the lead Republican on the Senate Committee that funds HUD, Bond is a long-time advocate for the federal dollars and programs needed to help Americans find safe and affordable housing.  Through projects like these we can make our neighborhoods safer for our children and families, and keep our seniors in the communities they love and surrounded by the people who love them, said Bond.  ###
