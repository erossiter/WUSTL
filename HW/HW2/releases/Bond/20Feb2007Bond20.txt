WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice-Chairman of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement regarding today’s Senate cloture vote:               “I am disappointed the Democratic Leader called today’s vote. On such an important issue as the war in Iraq we need to move beyond political posturing. Not only is the resolution non-binding and does not carry the force of law, but today’s vote was an unfortunate attempt to limit the right of Senators to express themselves on the most important issue we face.    	“Clearly, members of the Senate, at a minimum, should have the opportunity to amend and debate not just one resolution decreed by the Democratic Leader, but be permitted full and fair debate consistent with the responsibility and the traditions of the U.S. Senate.   	“While I am not able to vote today because I had a previously scheduled intelligence-related trip abroad, my vote would have been an emphatic ‘no’. In a procedural matter of this case, by not voting, the effect is the same as voting ‘no’ on the cloture petition.               “Unfortunately, the resolution will not only be a message to our troops, but also to our enemies. We will be telling the Sunni terror cells and the Shia militias that America's political will is wavering. We will be encouraging them to hang on, that the United States will not have the political will to outlast them. It will also tell neighboring states in the region, who have told us they will help bring stability to Iraq, that we are not committed to following through to prevent the country from falling into chaos, which would give Al-Qaeda the safe haven it wants. This is the wrong message to send.                “I have expressed strongly my views on this subject on the Senate floor in recent weeks. The proposed resolution will say after unanimously confirming General Petraeus that some in Congress do not want him and our troops to carry through the new strategy.”     # # #
