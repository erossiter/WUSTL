WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged swift confirmation of Judge Michael Mukasey, after meeting with the Attorney General nominee.    Judge Mukasey will uphold the rule of law, protect our civil liberties and ensure our terror-fighters have the information and tools they need to protect our families, said Bond.    Bond criticized some on the left for threatening Mukaseys nomination over a manufactured controversy. Bond, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the bottom line is that the U.S. does not torture. The entire Intelligence Committee has been briefed on the United States interrogation program, including the specific techniques and methods used. Bond emphasized that our nations anti-terror procedures are safe, lawful and necessary to keep American families safe from terror attacks.   Judge Mukasey does not yet have the necessary security clearance to know the details of highly sensitive anti-terror programs, pointed out Bond. The Democrats insistence on asking Mukasey to comment on details he cannot know puts him in an impossible situation - doing so is like asking a judge to give a decision before he has even heard the case, said Bond.   Judge Mukasey does not want an uninformed opinion to put terror-fighters in legal jeopardy, stressed Bond. Declaring certain anti-terror techniques illegal  a prerequisite for confirmation by many Senate Democrats -- could subject terror-fighters to legal actions and sanctions. Bond said declaring specific techniques illegal without knowing the facts and circumstances of each case would be unfair and wrong to those putting their lives on the line to protect U.S. families.   Bond, who has long criticized the media for disclosing sensitive methods and programs, also pointed out that publicly declaring how the U.S. fights terrorists will only help terrorists by allowing them to train against our methods.  ###
