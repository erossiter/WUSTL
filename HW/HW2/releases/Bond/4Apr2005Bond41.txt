CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today met with regional leaders to find out how he can best serve the needs of Missouri from his new post as Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations subcommittee.      “It is no secret that Missouri has some of the worst roads and bridges in the nation–on average up to three deaths occur each day on Missouri roads, and a large portion of these deaths are attributable to unsafe and inadequate infrastructure,” said Bond.  “My job is to listen.  As the new chairman of the Transportation funding panel, I hope to work with local leaders to ensure Missouri receives the resources it needs.”           Senator Bond has hosted roundtable discussions with local officials throughout the state the last two weeks to discuss his new responsibilities and listen to their concerns.            Earlier this month, Bond became the new chairman of the Transportation, Treasury and Housing subcommittee, providing the Senator another platform to both benefit Missouri and shape national transportation policy.             Bond, who has been leading the fight in the Senate to reauthorize a transportation bill, also serves as chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.           As co-author of the new Senate highway bill, Bond told local officials that under the six-year, $284 billion bill passed by committee last week, Missouri will gain a total of $4.96 billion, including an additional $1 billion in new highway funds, a nearly 25 percent increase in overall highway funding.             Bond said Missouri will also see an increase in its return on the dollars it pays in federal transportation taxes. Under the bill, Missouri will receive 98 cents on the dollar, up from 90.5 under current law and up from 76 cents in 1987 when Bond first entered the Senate.      	Bond also stressed that his new Appropriations subcommittee funds the Judiciary and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which he will use to work with local law enforcement to continue the fight against methamphetamine.     	“Missouri law enforcement have repeatedly led the nation in eradicating methamphetamine from our communities.  The task is far from over, however, and with this new assignment I hope to continue to provide important resources for law enforcement to protect Missourians from the scourge of illegal drugs and other crimes.”
