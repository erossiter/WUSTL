KANSAS CITY, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today visited the Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault (MOCSA) to announce funding to help prevent sex crimes and build safer communities in the Kansas City region.    The work that MOCSA does makes a real difference to people in our community and region. MOCSA helps victims of horrible crimes deal with their grief and injury and eventually move on with their lives, said Bond. Thank you for the tremendous work you do everyday. I am pleased to be a partner in your efforts.   As a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured $250,000 for sexual violence prevention and education, child abuse and crisis intervention counseling at MOCSA in the CJS spending bill. Before being signed into law, the bill must first be reconciled with the House of Representatives.   The funds Bond secured will help MOCSA to expand in three program areas: Child Sexual Abuse and Treatment, Sexual Assault Advocacy and Intervention, and Sexual Violence Prevention and Education. Bond stressed that these funds will help meet the growing demand for treatment and expand prevention programs in the region.    Bond praised MOCSA for being there to provide crisis counseling for victims and ongoing support as the victims deal with the aftermath of this crime. MOCSAs mission is to reduce the impact of sexual assault and abuse through prevention, education, treatment and advocacy.     Bond emphasized that the services MOCSA provide are essential. He pointed out that sexual assault is a serious problem in our society. Far too many women and children are victims of assault, said Bond. Organizations like MOCSA help victims deal with scars -- both visible and invisible  that this type of crime leaves behind.    ###
