	WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he is accepting applications for the U. S. Service Academies for the class beginning in 2007.  Nominations to the Air Force, West Point, Merchant Marine, and Naval Academies are available for qualified applicants.   	“The United States Service Academies offer the perfect opportunity to pursue an excellent education while serving your country,” said Bond.  “It takes a great deal of commitment, dedication, and leadership to make it at the academies, but the rewards are well worth the hard work.”   	The first step in the appointment process begins with a request for an application packet from a U.S. Senator or Member of Congress.  Applicants who will graduate from high school in 2007 may apply.  The deadline for requesting an application is November 15, 2006, and all application materials must be received in the Senator’s office by December 1, 2006.   	To make the process as convenient as possible the complete application packet is available on Senator Bond’s website at bond.senate.gov.  Also, applicants may request applications via email from the Senator’s academy coordinator (teresa_poole@bond.senate.gov), or by contacting the Springfield office: 300 South Jefferson, Suite 401, Springfield, MO 65806.   	Nominees are chosen on the basis of personal merit.  Merit criteria include evidence of character, leadership, scholarship, physical aptitude and fitness, goals and motivation.  Students must be between 17-21 years of age, U. S. Citizens and legal residents of Missouri.   	“The Service Academies are a great opportunity for Missouri students and for the nation’s military,” said Bond.  “These students are the military leaders of tomorrow and I urge anyone who believes they meet the qualifications to apply.”   	Interested applicants may contact Bond at the following address:  	 Senator Christopher S.
