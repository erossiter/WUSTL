Fredericktown, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today met with Missouri Department of Transportation and Highway 67 Coalition representatives in Fredericktown to discuss the progress on the four-lane corridor project between Poplar Bluff and Fredericktown.     	“Important groundwork has been laid by the strong partnership working on the Highway 67 corridor.  I look forward to seeing continued progress being made on Highway 67 and supporting Missouri’s efforts to build and improve our infrastructure,” said Bond.    	“Missouri could not have a stronger voice for our state’s transportation needs,” stated Tom Lawson, Chairman of the Highway 67 Corporation.  “His leadership not only led to Missouri getting a fairer share for every dollar sent to Washington, it resulted in more funding to enhance safety features on the Highway 67 four-lane project not included in the original “expressway” plans.    	As chairman of the Senate Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, Bond coauthored the federal highway bill, in which he earmarked $15 million for the Highway 67 four-lane improvement.  Also, Bond secured well over $1 billion in new highway funds for Missouri in the highway bill and $467.5 million for transportation projects statewide in the highway bill.     	The $15 million Bond secured for the project will enhance the “expressway” plans by adding safer features not included in the original plans such as the Highway 34/Highway 67 interchange and the Poplar Bluff to Highway 160 section.    	Bond praised the Highway 67 Corporation, MoDOT, the Corps, and Highway 67 Coalition for their efforts to make the project a reality.  Bond recognized Poplar Bluff and the Highway 67 Corporation for leading the way by committing $60 million over 30 years toward building the “expressway” project between Madison and Butler counties.
