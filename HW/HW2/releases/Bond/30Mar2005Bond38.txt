MEXICO, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined area community leaders and residents to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Advanced Technology Center (ATC) expansion project in Mexico.   	"The ATC continues to serve our region and state in preparing a well trained and ready workforce, which is  key to retaining, attracting, and expanding businesses.  Not only does the ATC help to create jobs, but it provides new opportunity for Missouri working families,” said Bond.  “I look forward to seeing construction completed and new students being served in an enriched learning environment.”    	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond has secured critical federal dollars for the ATC, including $450,000 for the expansion project in fiscal year 2003.  Also, in 1998  Bond helped the center secure a $1 million Department of Education grant, which the ATC used to buy top-of-the-line equipment.   	The Advanced Technology Center is a cooperative effort among the City of Mexico, industry, and higher education institutions, including Linn State Technical College, Moberly Area Community College and the University of Missouri Outreach and Extension.    	The ATC offers a number of Associate Degrees and Continuing Education and Certificate programs to residents in  Mid-Missouri.
