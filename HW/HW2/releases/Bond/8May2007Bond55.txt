Washington, DC – The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, and the Vice Chairman, Senator Kit Bond, announced today that the Committee has adopted its Phase II report on prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq.  The Committee will submit the report to the Director of National Intelligence for classification review.  Following declassification, the Committee will release the report to the public.    The Senate Intelligence Committee released their first report dealing with Intelligence Community failures related to Iraq’s weapons capabilities on July 9, 2004.  The findings and recommendations of that report were an important impetus leading to landmark legislation reforming the United States Intelligence Community.  Last fall, the Committee released reports on two of the five sections of Phase II: 1) the postwar findings about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments; and 2) the use by the Intelligence Community of information provided by the Iraqi National Congress.    ####
