WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, the Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today applauded his Senate colleagues for defeating a Democratic proposal that would have set a deadline for withdrawal of troops from Iraq.   	           “Today the majority of my colleagues voted to support our troops.  I am pleased that the Democrats voted down their own non-sensical, non-binding resolution,” said Bond.  “A political timetable would have signaled to this enemy that the United States Senate doesn't think the terrorists will have to wait too long and would have undercut the very leaders the Senate confirmed as fit to lead our troops.”    	Democratic proposal, S. J. Res. 9, which was defeated late this afternoon, would have restricted the Commander-in-Chief’s ability to direct the use of force, and set a deadline for withdrawal of troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008.     	Bond also praised the overwhelming bipartisan approval of two resolutions affirming the support of funding for troops in Iraq.  S. Con. Res 20 passed by a vote of 82 – 16 and S. Res. 107 passed with a vote of 96 - 2.  Bond stressed that it is critical that the Senate now moves to vote on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which will provide funds for our servicemen and women and their families.    	“I hope that the Democratic leadership will now allow us to take up the Supplemental War bill that will provide much needed funds for our troops in the field,” said Bond.      	Bond pointed out that today’s vote signals the majority in the United States Senate is prepared to give General Patraeus’ plan for a new direction in Iraq a chance for success.  Early signs are positive, said Bond.  News reports a decrease in violence, including significant decreases in bomb deaths and execution-style slayings since Patraeus changed course in Iraq.     	As Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Bond also emphasized that the overwhelming consensus of the intelligence community is that a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous and would empower al Qaeda.  Providing American troops to help the Iraqi’s take control of their government is the best option for a lasting political solution.
