SPRINGFIELD, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined law enforcement and local officials to discuss the proposed  Southwest Missouri Regional Crime Lab that will improve the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases throughout the state.     “Crime labs  provide the evidence police and prosecutors need to prove their cases in court.  Unfortunately, this region depends on a crime lab more than a hundred miles away that is already over-loaded.  A new crime lab in Springfield will be a key weapon for law enforcement to use against criminals and help better protect Missourians,” said Bond.     The current crime laboratory, located in Jefferson City, is over-loaded and ill- equipped to complete timely analysis.  Some cases are backlogged up to 6 to 12 months, causing difficulty in making arrests and prosecuting felony cases.  Despite the fact that Springfield is the third largest city in Missouri and is in the center of the southwest region of the state, there is no full-service crime laboratory in this area.     Local law enforcement and officials stressed that a new, fully-capable laboratory in Springfield will significantly improve the quality of analysis, improve the turn-around time on laboratory cases and improve the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.     The City of Springfield will provide space in the new Police/Fire Regional Training Center for laboratory and office space for the proposed Regional Crime Laboratory.       Bond secured $1.4 million in federal funds for the Training Center in the fiscal year 2002 Commerce State Justice Appropriations bill.  These funds provided police and fire training equipment, classrooms and a computer lab.  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond will also work to find federal dollars for the new crime lab.
