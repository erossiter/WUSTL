Countries such as Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia control the Malacca Straits through which one-quarter of all the shipping in the world passes, and one-half of the petroleum products carried by ocean-going vessels pass. 	“There is concern in the region that China may be building military capability which could be a threat to world peace and security as well as to the United States,” said Bond. “That is all the more reason to prevent excessive China influence or control in Southeast Asia.”	 	Bond also expressed concern over the possible growing influence of radical Islam in the region and called for active U.S. involvement with Indonesia in particular, noting that the growth of the “voice of radical Islam” can be seen in groups such as the Justice and Prosperity Party.  	“There are courageous and determined people in Indonesia fighting to ensure the future of the country as a democracy and one that values the principle of a secular government,” said Bond. “We must remain engaged so that their struggle prevails. The bigger picture requires active engagement with Southeast Asian countries seeking the path of democracy, human rights, and economic freedom.” 	Bond visited Indonesia following the December tsunami and has been calling on the U.S. government to strengthen military-to-military ties with the country. Bond wants to assist Indonesia in building a military that observes human rights and civilian control and which can become a strong U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism in Southeast Asia.  # # #
