JOPLIN, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined city officials and local business leaders to discuss the proposed improvement projects for Joplin’s historic downtown.     “The streetscape project carries with it a momentum that could elevate the city’s ability to reduce vacant store fronts and increase commercial activity throughout the area,” said Bond.  “It is my hope that this project's economic impact will have the ability to help preserve Joplin’s place in history as a regional activity hub for years to come.”   Currently, Joplin’s downtown is experiencing difficulties with building vacancies, low property tax revenues, and blight.  The proposed Joplin project would refurbish the historic downtown district, including both infrastructure and public safety improvements.  This project is part of Joplin’s revitalization plan to create a better investment climate in the downtown area.    Bond stressed that this project is an important step in continuing the downtown revitalization.  He expects the project to simulate employment-oriented commerce that could bring retail stores, restaurants, and other business services back downtown and benefit the businesses already located downtown.    As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee Bond will work to secure federal funds for the project.     Currently, Bond is chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee and he previously chaired the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.  Bond has used these positions  to fund important revitalization programs.  Also in the Senate, Bond has worked to pass critical infrastructure-building bills, including the federal highway bill.
