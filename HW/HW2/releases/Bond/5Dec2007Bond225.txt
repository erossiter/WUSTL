Madame Chairman, thank you for hosting todays markup of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007. This chart here is a diagram of the bills requirements, new agencies and new programs. The first thing one notices is how extremely complicated and far-reaching this proposal is. Rube Goldberg would be proud, as several members will focus upon.  I want to focus upon the red blocks at the top. Unfortunately, they are not just blocks - they represent millions of families, farmers, drivers and workers who will pay higher heating bills, suffer more pain at the pump, and lose more jobs because of this bill.   The bills sponsors themselves admit this bill will cost our families and workers hundreds of billions of dollars. Where will that money go?   It will flow out of the pockets of our families, farmers, drivers and workers at the top here in red, through those pass thru entities in orange, thru EPA and the new Climate Change Credit Corporation in black and out to all of these new government programs and causes here in blue and purple.  Adoption of my amendments will guarantee that these massive new costs do not significantly harm low-income families, farmers, drivers and workers. My amendments will also close loopholes in the international program that leaves U.S. workers at a competitive disadvantage to foreign workers. I also provide for a liability system left out of this bill that is necessary for underground carbon sequestration. I look forward to their debate and adoption.   Thank you.
