Senators ask Defense Department to investigate allegations in consultation with Defense Task Force on Mental Health   Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Kit Bond (R-MO), and Barack Obama (D-IL) today sent the following letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder:     December 7, 2006    The Honorable William Winkenwerder, Jr. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs 1200 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-1200    Dear Secretary Winkenwerder:    A recent National Public Radio (NPR) story detailing the failure of officials at Fort Carson, Colorado to provide adequate treatment for soldiers suffering from service connected mental health problems, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is of grave concern.     We are afraid that statements made about PTSD in the NPR piece by two Ft. Carson-based sergeants embody the misconceptions that must be changed if we hope to ensure the mental health of our country’s brave service members. We were particularly troubled by one sergeant’s claim that those who seek mental health treatment associated with PTSD “don’t want to go back to Iraq and are trying to blame all of their lives’ problems on PTSD.” A second sergeant’s claim was equally troubling. He stated that “PTSD is pretty much like the back door to get out of the military right now.” In fact, both sergeants admitted that they often refuse to allow soldiers under their command to attend mental health treatment sessions for PTSD. It is tremendously problematic that Ft. Carson officials take it upon themselves to make medical determinations without input from mental health professionals.    As you know, PTSD can often be a devastating and life-altering condition that causes significant anguish for service members and their families. While some commanders may have contempt for soldiers who come back from war with PTSD, mental health professionals are best equipped to diagnose and treat soldiers who may be suffering from PTSD. Left untreated, mental health experts agree that the social costs for veterans with PTSD can be very high: unemployment, homelessness, and broken families.    To that end, we respectfully request that you undertake an investigation into the troubling allegations about Ft. Carson in consultation with the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health. We also ask that you provide our offices with answers to the following questions regarding Ft. Carson as soon as possible:   	1.	Have commanding officers or medical personnel given a low priority to mental health treatment for soldiers at Ft. Carson suffering from service connected mental health problems, including PTSD? If so, what steps do you intend to take to rectify this situation?   2.	What is the average wait time (in days) for soldiers at Ft. Carson who have requested their first appointment with a mental health professional, what is the average wait time between the first appointment and the follow-up appointment, and what is the average time spent per session in treatment with a mental health professional?    3.      How many soldiers at Ft. Carson have sought treatment from the mental health unit over the past four years, broken down by year and month, and how many are waiting today?    4.      How many soldiers at Ft. Carson have been diagnosed with PTSD and/or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) related to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom?    5.      Provide a count of all discharges from Ft. Carson for the past four years, broken down by year, and then further sorted by both the type of discharge and the reason for discharge. Of those, how many were ever diagnosed with PTSD and/or TBI?    Soldiers stationed at Ft. Carson, and U.S. military personnel based at all other military facilities, deserve timely access to quality treatment for care related to service related conditions with the full support of the chain-of-command to reduce any stigma associated with a particular form of treatment or injury. You stated in the NPR piece that you make “no distinction between mental and physical health.” We agree about the need to eliminate the stigma associated with PTSD, which is why we urge you to work with us and the Mental Health Task Force to address the troubling reports associated with Ft. Carson and other military medical facilities.    We look forward to your prompt reply.                                      Sincerely,      Barbara Boxer,United States Senator               Christopher Bond,United States Senator     Barack Obama,United States Senator                   Cc:     Francis J. Harvey, Secretary, United States Army Lieutenant General Kevin Kiley, M.D., Surgeon General, United States Army  ###
