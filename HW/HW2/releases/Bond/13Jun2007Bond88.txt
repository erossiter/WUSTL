Senator Praises Decision to Protect Local Jobs WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today praised the decision by the U.S. Department of Interior to keep open the Mid-Continent Mapping Center in Rolla.    This is great news for Rolla and the dedicated USGS workers, said Bond. Most important, USGS will maintain the outstanding capabilities at the Rolla center, which is centrally located near the critical areas USGS has to supervise.    The Mid-Continent Mapping Center employs over 130 skilled men and women. In 2006, the center was scheduled close and be consolidated by USGS to a National Geospatial Technical Operations Center in Denver.    Bond, Missouris senior Senator, has fought against USGS ill-advised plan to close the Rolla plan since 2006.
