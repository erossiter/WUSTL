WASHINGTON, D.C. - - U.S. Senator Kit Bond and Congressman Kenny Hulshof announced today that the YouZeum in Columbia is receiving a federal grant of $742,500.  This grant is funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development‘s (HUD) Economic Development Initiative.   The YouZeum is an interactive science museum that will teach visitors about the human body and healthy lifestyle choices and will encourage young people to consider careers in healthcare.  It is located in a former federal government building in Columbia, that once served as a post office.       "These funds will help the YouZeum reach people of all ages to promote better health and lifestyle choices," said Senator Kit Bond, who as chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, secured today's funds in the fiscal year 2006 spending bill.  "The community is committed to this project and healthy lifestyles for future generations and I am pleased to be a part of the effort."   “This project has been a labor of love for the community, and I am glad that the federal government is able to provide the YouZeum with some of the resources needed for completion,” said Hulshof.  “The YouZeum will educate the public about important health-related issues and will encourage interest in healthcare professions.   “We have made excellent progress and we hope to open the museum in the middle of 2007,” said Dr. James Ritter, YouZeum Chairman.  “We are remodeling an old building, and we have run into some problems.  Nevertheless, we think this is an excellent project for Columbia and the entire Central Missouri area.  This funding is critical for work inside the YouZeum.”   -30-
