WASHINGTON, D.C. -  U.S. Senators Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded a $1,209,545 public assistance grant to repair the National Guard Armory in Pierce City.  The funds will cover the restoration of the armory, including the replacement of the roof, doors, windows, and interior partitions which were damaged or destroyed during the 2003 tornado.       “The damage caused by the tornado in May of 2003 devastated Pierce City,” said Sen. Talent.  “When we toured the area we made a commitment to do whatever we could to help the community rebuild.  Missourians are known for helping their neighbors in times of need.  Sen. Bond and I have worked to make certain the federal government is doing its part to help Pierce City.  With the help of this additional funding, we are looking forward to the full restoration of the Armory.”    “When I toured Pierce City following the 2003 tornados, the damage was unlike any I've seen in all my years of public service.  Today’s announcement of federal funds to repair the Armory is great news.  These funds are one more critical step in this community’s recovery,” said Sen. Kit Bond.     “I am very pleased with this funding announcement,” said Carol Hirsch, Pierce City Mayor.  “We are looking forward to seeing the project come together.”     “We are proud to share this important project because the restoration of the tornado damaged National Guard Armory is crucial to the recovery of Pierce City, Missouri,” said FEMA Acting Director R. David Paulison.    The facility is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and coordination with the State Historic Preservation Office has been completed.  The armory will serve as a storm shelter for residents of Peirce City and a meeting place for community events.
