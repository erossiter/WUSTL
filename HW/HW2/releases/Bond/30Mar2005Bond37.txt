MOBERLY, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today addressed local community and business leaders at the Moberly Kiwanis Club.  Bond talked about recent Senate action and his priorities for the next year, including health care and education goals and his continuing efforts to pass a federal highway bill.    “My job is to listen and I will continue to work with local leaders to ensure Missouri receives the resources it needs,” said Bond.   “Already this year Congress has begun to address some of the many important challenges our nation is facing but there is still much more work to be done.” 	   	Addressing the Moberly Kiwanis Club, Bond stressed that during the 109th Congress he will focus on three important issues that have an enormous impact on the quality of life and well-being of Missourians.  Expanding the Parents as Teachers program, doubling the number of people served in Community Health Centers, and passing a federal highway bill are three domestic priorities on the top of Bond’s list for 2005.    	In addition to outlining his top three domestic priorities for 2005, Bond provided the Kiwanis Club an update on recent Senate action.    	Bond also emphasized the need to support President Bush and the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, like his son Sam, a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps and reform the nation’s intelligence agencies.      Another top priority for Congress, Bond said, is the need to reform Social Security.  Bond told the group that current retirees and anyone born before 1950 will see no change in their Social Security benefits.  However, every system can be improved, and seniors’ knowledge and experience is essential if Social Security is to be strengthened for the future.    	“Times have changed, but Social Security remains the same.  We owe it to our children to change with the times,” said Bond.
