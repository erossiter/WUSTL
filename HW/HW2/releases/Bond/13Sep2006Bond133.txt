	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Kit Bond and Jim Talent today announced that their legislation to name the new courthouse in Cape Girardeau after local hero Rush H. Limbaugh Sr. cleared an important hurdle today.     	“With today’s swift committee action we are one-step closer in our efforts to honor a true icon of the legal community,” said Bond, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  “It is only fitting that the new courthouse in Cape Girardeau, as it nears completion, be named after this beloved local hero.”     	“I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this honor," said U.S. Sen. Talent.  “No one played a more important role during the past century in Southeast Missouri and Cape Girardeau than Mr. Limbaugh.  He was a leader in his community and a leader in the practice of law and the naming of the new Federal Courthouse is a fitting way to remember his contributions to our nation.”   	Just last week Bond and Talent introduced legislation in the Senate to designate the new courthouse in Cape Girardeau the Rush H. Limbaugh Sr. United States Courthouse.     	The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee approved the Bond-Talent Cape Girardeau courthouse proposal today.  Before being signed into law the legislation must pass the full Senate and House.   						###
