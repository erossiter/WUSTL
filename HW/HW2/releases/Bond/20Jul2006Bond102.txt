WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Kit Bond and Jim Talent today announced that they secured almost $7 million in federal funds in the Senate Military Construction spending bill for a Child Development Center on the Ft. Leonard Wood base.    “Being a parent is hard work in any circumstances. But being a parent in the military has its own set of challenges and difficulties,” said Senator Kit Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “Fort Leonard Wood has been a leader in parent education and family support.  The new Child Development Center will allow the base to continue to provide our military families with the assistance they need.”   “Our military families make tremendous sacrifices for their country,” said Sen. Talent a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  “Securing resources for Missouri’s military bases is a priority for me.  These funds will greatly increase the quality of life and moral of our troops and their families by providing them additional childcare services.  I want to thank Sen. Bond for partnering with me in making this a priority in the Senate to benefit our military families in Missouri.”   Bond and Talent secured the $6.9 million in federal funds in the fiscal year 2007 spending bill, which passed the full Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon.  Before being signed into the law the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives version.   	The funds will provide a quality, state of the art Child Development Center for children ages 6-10 years, serving children of military and Department of Defense civilians at the base.  Bond pointed out that the old Center does not meet the current or future demand for childcare services on the base and provides inadequate space for activities.     	In addition to providing much-needed space, the new Center will provide a before and after school program and a full-day program during school holidays and summer breaks.
