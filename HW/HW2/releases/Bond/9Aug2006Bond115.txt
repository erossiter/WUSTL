COLUMBIA, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined local and federal officials to celebrate the groundbreaking of the historic Wabash Station Renovation project in Columbia. These improvements will be an investment in Columbias future success, economic prospects and the quality of life for all its families. Projects like this are a good example of how positive growth can be with the right plans in place, said Bond.   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond was able to secure $2.3 million in federal dollars for the Columbia project. Bond secured the funds for the expansion and refurbishment of the Wabash Station in the fiscal year 2004 Transportation spending bill.   Bond thanked the local leaders for their commitment to Columbia and for identifying projects, like the Wabash Station Expansion and Renovation, that will help meet the current and future needs of the area. He stressed that today marks the culmination of several years of planning and funding that required the combined efforts of Columbias local leaders. Bond also emphasized that as Missouris senior Senator he will work to deliver the seed money to help communities flourish.   I will continue to use my position in the Senate to return the money you send to Washington back home to help finance local priorities identified by local leaders who are committed to improving communities like Columbia, said Bond.   Built in 1910 the old Wabash train station is listed on the National Historic Preservation listing. The station, known as one of the nicest in the area, continues to operate today, serving as an operations and transfer center for Columbia transit.   The funds Bond secured for the project will be used to refurbish the old station, improve the on-site traffic flow, and expand the indoor and outdoor passenger waiting areas. The project is expected to be completed next summer.  ###
