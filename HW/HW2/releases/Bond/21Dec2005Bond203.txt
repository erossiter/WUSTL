WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Senators Jim Talent, Kit Bond and Governor Matt Blunt are asking tough questions in the debate over the need for “manmade” spring rises on the Missouri river.  The Missouri officials have asked Michael Mae, the director of the Columbia Environmental Research Center of the U.S. Geological Survey, to address the science behind the scheduled spring rises as it relates to the survival of the pallid sturgeon.    “As you are aware, it is imperative that sound science form the foundation of all Missouri River biological requirements,” Missouri’s senators and governor said in the letter.  “With that in mind, we respectfully request that you provide answers to the following questions so that we may better understand the status of pallid sturgeon monitoring and recovery efforts.”   In a letter to Michael Mae, the Missouri officials ask: How critical is the 2006 spring rise to the research efforts for the pallid sturgeon and to the survival of the species; is there adequate baseline date to properly evaluate a 2006 “manmade” spring rise; and what are the impacts on research efforts of delaying the “manmade” spring a couple of years?    “It is upon the basis of sound science that Missouri River stakeholders and species will arrive at win-win solutions to such complex issues,” the senators and governor wrote.  “Your role in that process as purveyors of quality science is appreciated.”    The Army Corps of Engineers in October announced plans for two “manmade” spring rises, which they say will help save the pallid sturgeon fish.  However, the plan has the potential to flood farms, communities and private property downstream.    Senators Bond, Talent and Governor Blunt have been leading advocates for a river plan that balances the needs of everyone who lives and works along the river including farmers and property owners.
