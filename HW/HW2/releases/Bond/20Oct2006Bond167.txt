	WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Kit Bond, a life-long Cardinals fan, today confirmed that Carl Levin (D-MI) has accepted his World Series wager.    	Bond, confident that the Cardinals will be series champions, wagered, in the spirit of friendly, bi-partisan competition that the Detroit Tigers would fall to the St. Louis Cardinals.  The Cardinals and Tigers play the first of the seven-game series Saturday in Detroit.   	“For some, the Cardinals’ victory was the season’s biggest October surprise,” joked Bond.  “Missouri might make 2006 the year of the come-back, on the field and off.”   	At stake for Senators Bond and Levin will be dinners for the respective Washington, D.C. staff.  Bond said that when the Cardinals prevail over the Tigers, his staff will be treated to a dinner of Michigan-made Kowalski Sausages and Black Star Farms wine.   	While unlikely, Bond said if the Cardinals should fall to the Tigers, Senator Levin’s staff will be treated to a dinner of Super Smokers St. Louis Style BBQ and Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser.   	Bond stressed that the 2006 series will give the Cardinals a long-awaited chance for revenge over their 1968 loss.   	Kit Bond is Missouri’s senior Senator and is now in his fourth term after having served the state previously during two terms as Governor.  The St. Louis Cardinals have won multiple World Series Championships in their long and distinguished franchise history.  						###
