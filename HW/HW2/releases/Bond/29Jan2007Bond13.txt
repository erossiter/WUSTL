Springfield, Missouri – Missouri Senator Kit Bond and Southwest Missouri Congressman Roy Blunt helped Missouri National Guard Adj. General King Sidwell break ground for the new Aviation Classification and Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD) in Springfield, today. The groundbreaking is for the first phase of a $139.6 million project that will expand the capabilities of the AVCARD building at the Springfield-Branson National Airport. The two Missouri lawmakers worked together in Congress to move the construction of the AVCRAD facility ahead by two to four years.                 “The present AVCARD facility has a space shortage,” Congressman Blunt said. “The new facility will be nearly four times larger.  While the National Guard has added newer, bigger and more sophisticated helicopters, the AVCRAD building has not kept pace. Before maintenance can begin on the newest two-blade and four-blade helicopters, crews have to take the blades off to get the helicopters inside the building, thereby reducing efficiency and adding unnecessary time to repairs.  The larger building will give maintenance personnel the space, equipment and environment to return helicopters back to service in less time.”                 "A modern, well equipped AVCRAD will help our warfighters rebuild and replace worn equipment, while at the same time maintain readiness and preserve limited resources," said Senator Kit Bond.  "This unit not only helps keep the Army and the Army Guard airborne, but they also manage to save the taxpayers millions of dollars while repairing and maintaining equipment."     	The first phase of construction, located west of the existing AVCRAD building, will include excavation, site preparation, utility extensions, storm water system, bulk storage, heated storage building, covered storage building, ground support equipment building, fuel dispensing system and service road.      	Phase II, which is waiting congressional funding, will include the aircraft paint stripping/preparation/x-ray and painting bays, blade shop, aircraft wash facility and chemical treatment bay.  Supporting facilities are road network extension, aircraft taxiways and parking, private vehicle parking, exterior lights, fire protection and security fencing.     	The AVCRAD facility in Springfield is one of only four such aviation depots in the National Guard. The mission of the AVCRAD is to provide aviation repairs and support to a 14-state region.
