According to the Department of Labor, the U.S. economy has created almost 5 million new jobs since 2003, 2 million in the last year alone.  Not only is employment on the rise, so are wages.      “The numbers released today are signs that the economy is responding positively to Congress’ fiscally-disciplined agenda.
