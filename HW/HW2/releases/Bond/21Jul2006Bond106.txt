(WASHINGTON, D.C.) U.S. Senators Kit Bond (Mo.) and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) have asked the President to quickly approve Governor Matt Blunts request for a major disaster declaration for Missouri in response to last nights storm. The St. Louis region was hit last night with one of the worst storms in recent history resulting in the loss of life, dozens of injuries, millions of dollars worth of infrastructure damage and leaving nearly a half a million homes and businesses without power, said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent. We are asking the Administration to quickly approve this request to help provide additional relief for those who are suffering as a result of the storm.   In a letter to the President, Senators Bond and Talent pointed out that the storm damage and extreme heat has created dangerous health hazards for Missourians. The Senators point out that the storm could result in millions of dollars in needed emergency assistance. Senators Talent and Bond requested assistance for St. Louis City and Dent, Iron, Jefferson, St. Charles, St. Louis and Washington Counties. Theyve asked the President to grant the request promptly in order for state and local governments to begin recovering from this disaster.   ###
