 WASHINGTON, DC Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Kit Bond, today commented on the Central Intelligence Agencys review of its Inspector Generals Office.   The CIAs Inspector General does great work examining complicated problems. The Senate Intelligence Committee depends on their work to help conduct our congressional oversight responsibilities, and I will be watching carefully to make sure that nothing is done to restrain or diminish that important office.   The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director, General Michael Hayden, ordered an internal review into the work of the agencys Inspector General (IG). Bond noted that while the Committee is still looking into the matter, he is concerned with the CIAs action.   Bond acknowledged that the CIA Director is entitled to oversee and manage all elements of the Agency, but also stressed that he hopes this is not an attempt to undermine the IGs role.   The CIA has a track record of resisting accountability. Bond cited the personnel accountability boards that were recommended in the CIA IGs 9/11 Accountability Report, portions of which were recently declassified. Then-CIA Director Goss chose not to hold the accountability boards because it would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks.Bond took issue with Gosss decision and interpretation of the IGs report, in which there is not a single case for anyone being taken to task for taking a risk. Quite the opposite, the IGs report only criticizes CIA officials for not adequately performing their duties.    ###
