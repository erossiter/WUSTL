KANSAS CITY, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined General Services Administration Heartland Regional Administrator Brad Scott and other federal officials and civic leaders to celebrate the dedication of Kansas City's new IRS Service Center.   	“This facility is a model for how a public-private partnership should work.  The new IRS Service Center is a tribute to the Kansas City ‘Can-Do’ spirit of determination and cooperation between government and the private sector,” said Bond.    	Bond recognized the number of people involved in making the IRS Service Center project a reality.  He thanked the planners at the IRS, the staff at GSA and the men women who built this grand facility for making today’s dedication possible.   	The IRS Service Center project renovated the historic Main Post Office and constructed a new postal facility in Union Station.  The IRS Service Center's campus consolidated seven locations in the Kansas City area into a 1.14 million square-foot facility.      	Bond, who has worked to shepherd the project through the White House and Congress, stressed that the IRS Service Center is about jobs, revitalization and connectivity.  This project created for construction workers, electricians, engineers and architects.  Also, up to 6,000 IRS workers will eventually work at the new Center.    	The IRS Service Center will make downtown Kansas City stronger by removing blight and connecting areas of strength, Bond pointed out.  With the new Service Center, Crown Center will be connected to the Freight House District and to the future Performing Arts District.     	“The Regional Service Center project is bigger than just the relocation of government employees to downtown Kansas City.  It is a huge boost to our region’s economy,” said Bond.  					###
