           WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond (R-MO) today announced he is co-sponsoring legislation which will significantly increase financial assistance to soldiers, and their families, when they are wounded or traumatically injured.     	“This legislation is crucial in ensuring that we are taking care of the financial needs of our injured soldiers as well as the needs of their families,” Senator Bond said.  “These brave young men and women have risked life and limb in the protection of our   country and we must make every effort to make sure their financial needs are met.”    	The legislation, known as the “Wounded Warrior” bill, would create a new “Traumatic Injury Protection” insurance program that would provide for the immediate payment of between $25,000 and $100,000 to soldiers and their families when they are wounded.                 The traumatic injuries covered by the legislation include blindness, loss of limbs, loss of speech, loss of hearing, paralysis, burns greater than second degree covering 30 percent of the body or face and certain traumatic brain injuries.                 The bill aims to provide an immediate infusion of resources to meet the needs of severely injured soldiers at a time when they and their families need it most. The money would help cover housing, travel and other expenses families incur.     	Administration officials estimate that it will cost service-members about one dollar per month for coverage by attaching a rider to their existing group life insurance program.                The legislation was drafted by Senator Larry Craig (R-ID), chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.
