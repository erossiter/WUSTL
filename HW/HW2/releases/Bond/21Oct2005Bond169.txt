WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $1.25 million in federal funds for key projects in mid-Missouri in the Senate-passed Transportation-Treasury-HUD spending bill.     	 “These critical projects in mid Missouri will provide important economic development, research and historic preservation opportunities,” said Bond.  “As Missouri’s senior Senator, my job is to fight to send Missouri’s hard-earned tax dollars back home.  I will continue to work to make sure my state gets the funds it needs.”    As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured the $1.2 million in federal funds in the fiscal year 2006 spending bill which passed the Senate last night.  Before being signed into the law the bill must be reconciled with the House of Representatives version.    Bond secured funds for the following projects:   *	$500,000 for the Missouri Soybean Association in Boone County.  The funds will be used to purchase test plots for genetically crossing new plants developed at the Life Sciences Center with existing varieties for a number of applications, including developing new medicines.   *	$500,000 for the University of Missouri for Hickman House in Howard County.  The funds will be used to preserve, renovate and improve access to the historic Thomas Hickman House, constructed in 1819 in Franklin.  Franklin was the hometown of the “Kit” Carson and became the starting point for the Santa Fe Trail.   *	$250,000 for the Advanced Technology Center (ATC) in Mexico.  The funds will expand the present facility to accommodate future education and training programs.  ATC programs will help provide a local and statewide highly technical and skilled workforce to existing and future businesses.  Bond has secured more than $1 million for the ATC in previous fiscal years.
