WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced an agreement between the federal government and the State of Missouri, an important step in bringing a new federal courthouse to Jefferson City.      	“Jefferson City needs a new courthouse.  The deadly attacks last spring in Atlanta and other courthouses serve as a tragic warning to the rest of us that we need to improve courthouse security.  Safety and security of the public, judges and law enforcement officers who do business in the courthouse is a top priority,” said Bond.       	Joined by Governor Matt Blunt, Regional GSA Administrator Brad Scott and other officials, Bond announced that today the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the Missouri State Penitentiary Redevelopment Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding, agreeing that the new courthouse will be located on the site of the former Missouri State Penitentiary, at the corner of Lafayette and State Streets.    As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured $5.2 million for the new courthouse in the fiscal year 2006 spending bill.  In addition to the $5.2 million for the planning and design of the new courthouse, Bond previously secured funding for a study of issues related to the Jefferson City Courthouse, which determined the need for a new, safer facility.     	“The effects of the Memorandum of Understanding being signed today will be felt for generations to come.  Long after we are gone, cases will be decided in the courthouse we envision that will have an impact on all of our citizens,” said Bond.
