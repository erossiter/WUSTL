Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Kit Bond made the following statement on Monday on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales:  I thank Attorney General Gonzales for his service and for his willingness to step down and end the distractions at the Department of Justice.  Unfortunately, because of the controversies surrounding the Attorney General, he was unable to take the lead in defending the legal reasoning behind his Department's advice.  I hope the new Attorney General will aggressively support the War on Terror, defend Americans' civil liberties and take an active and public role in explaining the Department of Justice's decisions.  # # #
