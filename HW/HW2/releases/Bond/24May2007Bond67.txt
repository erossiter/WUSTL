WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the Congress-passed Emergency Supplemental bill will provide $3 billion in agriculture relief for farmers and ranchers who have been hit hard by natural disasters.     	“Missouri farmers and ranchers told me they needed relief and I listened,” said Bond.  “While the fight for disaster assistance has been a long one, today is a real victory and will provide much-needed help.”     	A long-time friend to agriculture, Bond was the Republican sponsor of the Congress-passed agriculture disaster package.  Bond was also the most vocal advocate in the Senate for Congressional passage of disaster packages for 2005 and 2006 production years.  Last week, Bond met with President Bush about the importance of this assistance to farmers and ranchers.  Bond pointed out that Missouri’s producers have been hit hard by Mother Nature over the last few years – persistent drought, severe winter storms, and spring floods.   	The $3 billion agriculture disaster package includes language that will provide relief to Missouri farmers and ranchers hit hard by the 2007 ice storms and persistent freezing temperatures.  Producers can choose between 2005, 2006 or 2007 for production assistance.     	In addition to the $3 billion in agriculture disaster relief, Bond was able to secure $40 million to speed recovery for Missourians devastated by the recent floods.  The funds also cover the tornados in Kansas.     Bond emphasized that today’s disaster package will provide much-needed help, but is not the long-term solution.  The 2007 Farm Bills need to improve the safety net for our nation’s farmers and provide a comprehensive national policy.  	Today’s disaster assistance is part of the fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental bill.  The bill has been passed by the House and Senate and will now be sent to the President to be signed into law.
