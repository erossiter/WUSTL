Springfield, Missouri    Southwest Missouri Congressman and House Majority Whip Roy Blunt  and Missouri Senator Kit Bond report the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released $4 million to complete design and planning work on the Springfield-Branson Midfield Replacement Terminal. The funds complete a package of more than $7 million in federal money to "totally design the new terminal building," according to Springfield Aviation Director Gary Cyr.            "Congressman Blunt and Senator Bond worked together to persuade the FAA to release the funds that were included in the 2004 appropriations process," Cyr said. "This is another major step forward in securing a replacement terminal at the Springfield-Branson Regional Airport.  Now we can concentrate on working out the finances for the project."  Estimates put the cost of the new terminal at nearly $150 million.  The Springfield-Branson Regional Airport Board also put a significant investment into the planning process for the replacement terminal.             Congressman Blunt welcome the FAA's decision to release the final planning money. "I know the airport administration has been taking an advanced look at aviation facilities of the next generation in planning these facilities.  The new terminal will provide accommodations and conveniences that will keep pace with the growing demand for air travel in Southwest Missouri."     "Investing in Missouri's infrastructure is key to guaranteeing future economic growth.  These dollars for the second phase of the replacement terminal are critical as Southwest Missouri continues to grow," said Senator Kit Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This terminal will help Springfield-Branson Regional continue to deliver first-class service to the region."
