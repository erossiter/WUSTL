U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the firing of the CIA employee for unauthorized intelligence leaks:    "Ignoring intelligence leaks is something we simply cannot afford to do. I am pleased Director Goss has taken action in this case. As he has said, the damage done by leaks to our intelligence efforts has been very severe.    "We have heard from dedicated CIA employees around the world their great frustration with those who have leaked classified material. These leaks have done irreparable damage to our intelligence gathering efforts, needlessly puts other sources at risk, and makes it so much harder for intelligence officers to get information they need to keep our country safe.     "Our allies don't want to work with us when they can't trust us. This action will help rebuild confidence among our allies and those who will share information with us abroad. It shows that we value them and take these matters seriously.     "I support fully Director Goss's efforts and I hope this serves as a direct warning to other individuals who think they too can play this dangerous game with classified material."
