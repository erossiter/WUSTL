WASHINTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $400,000 in federal funds for a mining study in Mark Twain National Forest.   	“Too often bureaucrats in Washington base decisions that affect families in Missouri and across the country on insufficient information,” said Bond.  “These dollars provide the funds to study the impact of mining in Mark Twain National Forest before the bureaucrats arbitrarily send southwest Missouri jobs overseas.”   	Bond secured $400,000 for a mining study in Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) to be conducted by the United States Geological Survey.  Bond emphasized that this study is needed to collect reliable scientific data prior to making any decisions on future mining activities in MTNF.      	For the 1,800 mining workers in one of the poorest regions of Missouri, and the rest of the nation that relies upon mined lead, this is a critical issue.  Currently, Missouri supplies 90 percent of the nation’s primary lead, which has a number of uses, including car batteries, televisions, computers, computer monitors, and specialty defense hardware.  Without operations in Missouri, the United States will become almost completely dependent upon foreign sources of this vital mineral.     	Bond has secured millions in federal funds for this project, including $750,000 for the study in fiscal year 2005 and made the project a priority again this year, insisting that it is important to continue funding the multi-agency “Technical Team” currently studying the potential impact of mining in the region.     	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured more than $4 million for critical Missouri environmental projects in the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill.  The spending bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon.  Before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
