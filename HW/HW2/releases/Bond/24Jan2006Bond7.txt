U.S. Senators Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Kit Bond(R-Mo.) today announced that they created the Senate Beef Caucus to help protect and boost America's beef producers.    In a letter sent to all 98 Senators, as well as Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Baucus and Bond stressed the importance the new caucus will play for the beef cattle industry, from the rancher, to the processors to the consumer.      "The Senate Beef Caucus will promote and support the beef cattle industry.  Through increasing issue awareness and educating and informing Senate members and staff, we can provide needed assistance to the beef cattle industry," the Senators wrote.    In light of recent events involving U.S. beef both at home and abroad, the Senators felt it necessary to create a caucus of Senators to serve as an advocate for the nation’s ranchers and processors.    "By providing the opportunity to speak as a collective voice and utilizing Congress’ resources to help improve the U.S. beef industry, we can remain internationally competitive as an industry while showing the importance ranchers play in our country," Baucus and Bond wrote.    The Caucus will be co-chaired by both Baucus, the senior U.S. Senator from Montana, and Bond, the senior U.S. Senator from Missouri.     "If you strongly believe in supporting America's beef cattle industry, we urge you to join the Senate Beef Caucus," the letter urged.    Any Senators wishing to participate have until March 1, 2006 to respond.
