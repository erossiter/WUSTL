WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond (R-MO) today issued the following statement regarding Senate approval of Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of Defense.  The Senate voted 95-2 to approve Gates nomination this evening:                “Robert Gates has decades of experience in national security and intelligence matters which will be invaluable in his new position.                 “His task will not be easy, but he is committed to taking a close look at readiness and troop strength and will consult closely with commanders on the ground and with the troops who are tasked daily with implementing U.S. policy in Iraq.                “At his confirmation hearing, Gates emphasized that events over the next year or two in Iraq will shape the Middle East for years to come. I agree with that assessment.                “As the war on terror against Islamic extremists continues, what happens in Iraq will have a profound impact on our success or failure in the broader effort against global terrorism.                  “Gates impressed members of both sides of the aisle with his candor and assured members that he will leave no viable options off the table when it comes to looking at Iraq.”    # # #
