ST. LOUIS, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined a coalition of agriculture, shipping, manufacturing, labor, and environmental groups to celebrate the enactment of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA).          One of the chief functions of government  ignored by Congress for too long  is updating our economic infrastructure, said Bond. Hurricane Katrina and the Minneapolis bridge collapse are extreme reminders of what can happen when we fail to invest in long-term infrastructure development. Now we may finally be able to make some progress on rebuilding our water infrastructure.         Enacted over a Presidential veto, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is finally law. Bond, who has fought for the passage of WRDA since 2002, praised the broad coalition of agriculture, shipping, manufacturing, labor, and environmental groups that made todays celebration possible.      Bond commended his colleagues in both the House and Senate for recognizing the importance of water transportation infrastructure. The House voted overwhelmingly to override the veto of WRDA with a vote of 361 to 54. In the Senate, the vote was 79 to 14. Bond noted that the lopsided nature of the vote shows the strong bipartisan support for renewing and rebuilding our critical water infrastructure.          WRDA authorizes the Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental restoration, and navigation projects. For Missouri, the new law means trade competitiveness, reliable and affordable energy, drinking water, and protection from floods. Bond noted that WRDA also means jobs for our construction crews and other contractors working on these critical projects.          Bond stressed that for farmers who depend on the lock and dam system to move their products, WRDA is critical. The Missouri and Mississippi Rivers are the Midwests arteries to world markets. Unfortunately, the current locks, which were built during the Great Depression, are outdated. The new law includes Bonds provision to modernize the lock and dam system, authorizing $1.95 billion in federal funds for seven new locks.       Bond emphasized that WRDA is an authorization bill. Now that WRDA is law, Congress has the authority to spend money on critical water resources projects, but the money must still be appropriated. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond pledged to use his position to see the projects funded.         ###
