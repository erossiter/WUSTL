WASHINGTON, DC – The Missouri Congressional Delegation today sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and asked for the agency to expedite damage assessments for the counties hard-hit from the recent flooding.    	Severe storms hit Missouri on May 5th, resulting in flooding in communities across the state.  The bipartisan letter, signed by every member of the Missouri Congressional Delegation, requests FEMA to expedite the State of Missouri’s request to begin preliminary damage assessments (PDA) in the affected counties.  These assessments are the first step in the delivery of federal assistance for families and businesses.    	“It is critical that the federal government acts quickly on this request so we can get Missouri homeowners, business owners and farmers the help they need to begin rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,” said U.S. Senator Kit Bond.    	"It is essential that our federal government provide the communities that have affected by the recent flood the resources necessary to get back on their feet," said U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill.    	“Missourians are accustomed to rapidly changing weather conditions.  After years of drought, just a few days of heavy rain this spring has saturated soil and filled area streams and rivers over their banks.  According to the Corps of Engineers, major flooding problems will persist along the Missouri River through the weekend.  I hope that the preliminary damage assessments can begin as soon as possible.  A large number of Missouri’s families and communities have been severely affected, and it is important that they receive the help they so badly need,” said U.S. Representative Ike Skelton.    	"The first few days following a disaster of this magnitude are the most critical in terms of the disaster response.  FEMA's timely response to the flooding in our state will help get a major recovery effort underway to help those who have lost their homes and livelihoods in the last week.  I urge a swift federal response to a grave emergency," said U.S. Representative Jo Ann Emerson.      	"Those impacted by the flood are feeling the pain right now, that's why we should speed up the process as much as we can," Hulshof said.  "It's important to get an accurate assessment of the damage and assist recovery efforts as quickly as possible," said U.S. Representative Kenny Hulshof.    	"Time is of the essence. We need to move quickly so Missourians can develop a plan to get back to normal. We are ready to assist in anyway we can," said U.S. Representative Sam Graves.    	"Communities dealing with rising rivers and flash flooding greatly need FEMA to expedite damage assessments.  Missourians learned the hard way in 1993 that various flooding problems can quickly compound on each other to cause potential disastrous situations.  We must have a thorough assessment and response from FEMA now, and perhaps in the weeks ahead," said U.S. Representative Russ Carnahan.    	"The flooding in our immediate community and in Northeast Missouri remind all of us of the terrible Flood of 1993. I was Mayor of Kansas City during that crisis and since then, we have worked very hard to bring money and resources to address the problem. While our efforts have clearly paid off, this week's rising waters point out there is much work yet to be done. The rivers have always brought our state prosperity, but they also bring danger and destruction," said U.S. Representative Cleaver.    The text of the letter follows.    May 11, 2007   Mr. Richard Hainje Regional Director FEMA Region VII 9221 Ward Parkway, Suite 300 Kansas City, Missouri 64114  Dear Mr. Hainje:              The recent flooding resulting from severe storms on May 5, 2007 rivals the flood of 1995 and has severely impacted the State of Missouri.   Not only have large numbers of acres of agricultural land been affected, but also homes, businesses and highways have become inundated with water.                 It is our understanding that Governor Blunt has asked FEMA to begin preliminary damage assessments (PDA) in seventeen counties, with more to be added later.  We ask that the PDAs be expedited.  It is imperative that the counties, businesses, families and individuals are given assistance in recovering from this devastating flood.                 Along with our fellow Missourians, we eagerly await your decision on this request for an expedited preliminary damage assessment.                                       Sincerely,   Christopher S. Bond 			Claire McCaskill  Roy Blunt 				Ike Skelton JoAnn Emerson  Kenny C. Hulshof 			Sam Graves  Emanuel Cleaver	 		Wm. Lacy Clay	 		Russ Carnahan  W. Todd Akin
