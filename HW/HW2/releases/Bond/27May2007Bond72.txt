ST. LOUIS, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the immigration bill currently before the Senate:Priority one is increasing border security and strengthening enforcement against illegal immigration. I have supported cutting off the flow of illegal immigration with more border barriers, detention facilities and enforcement agents; and we can do more.  I do not support rewarding those who broke the law to get here or stay here, especially with a path to citizenship. Those who broke our laws and flaunted our rules do not deserve the ultimate gift of U.S. citizenship. That is at the heart of amnesty and I oppose it.  Last week I voted to strip the bill of its amnesty provisions. However, that amendment failed. And so at the end of last week, I proposed the next best thing: cut the path to citizenship. My amendment (#1255) strikes at the heart of the bills amnesty provisions by ensuring that we do not award citizenship to the 12 million illegal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.  Millions of legal immigrants have made this Nation great, and more can be allowed to enter this country in a legal and orderly manner. I support legal immigration, but I will oppose efforts to reward illegal immigration, especially with a path to citizenship.  # # #
