WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, the Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement on today’s failure to move forward on the Intelligence Authorization Act.   “I regret that the Democratic leadership would not allow amendments to go forward and used cloture votes to prevent a fair discussion of this important bill.  For this reason, I was forced to vote again against cloture.   “Leading the Majority in the U.S. Senate gives a party many advantages in advancing its agenda.  It also, however, carries with it the grave responsibility to protect the Minority’s right to be heard.  In this regard, the Majority has failed to live up to its responsibility.   “There are several germane amendments which needed to be debated and considered before we voted on this bill which is essential to Congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community.  As I have said many times, I wanted to pass the 2007 Intelligence Authorization bill, but not at any cost.”    	###
