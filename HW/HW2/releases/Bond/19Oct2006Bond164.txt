	CARROLLTON, MO   U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined Carrollton Mayor Sharon Metz and other local officials to celebrate the City’s progress in revitalizing its downtown.    	“It is important that we invest in infrastructure that supports our community and provides opportunity for economic growth,” said Bond.  “Today’s progress shows we can achieve great things by working together toward a common goal.”   	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured $500,000 for the Carrollton downtown revitalization project in the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD Appropriations bill.    	The City has used the federal dollars to add lighting, banners, and planters, fit flag poles into sidewalks, pour stone around light poles, and place power lines underground.  Also, the City purchased a trolley car.  Carrollton is the smallest town in the U.S. to operate a trolley car system.   	Bond praised Mayor Metz and other local leaders for identifying the need to revitalize Carrolton’s downtown and the community for working together to make the project a reality.   	“This kind of support is vital to long term community growth and it is clear that Carrollton is a town in which you should be proud. I am impressed by your local leadership and initiative to tackle projects that will better your community,” said Bond.   						###
