KANSAS CITY, MO - Senator Kit Bond today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has released $6.3 million to the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority for the Troost Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.  “This funding is a testament to the success of the BRT program in Kansas City,” said Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.  “This funding will add a critical link to the BRT program at the KCATA.” The $6.3 million being released by the U.S. DOT under the “Small Starts” program adds to the more than $20 million Senator Bond has secured for the BRT program at the KCATA.  It underscores Bond's continued commitment to Kansas City and local residents who depend upon public transportation.  “We must invest in strong community based projects that benefit our citizens,” said Bond.  “It is fitting at a time when Kansas Citians are facing record high gas prices, that we are able to work together to expand public transit services in the region.”   Senator Bond served Missouri twice as Governor and now continues his service in his fourth term in the United States Senate.   	###
