Senator Announces $200,000 in Funds for Project   	WARSAW, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today commended local officials in Warsaw for their efforts to spur economic development in the area and to make the Joe Dice Suspension Bridge a reality.     	 “It is important that we invest in our infrastructure that supports our community and provides opportunity for economic growth. Today’s celebration is proof that real progress is being made,” said Bond.  “The Joe Dice Bridge is a key part of the larger Warsaw Riverwalk Project. Utilizing Warsaw’s natural assets, the project will help build on efforts to promote the tourism industry in the lake area.”   	At today’s event Bond was joined by Mayor Ken Brown and other local officials.  Bond praised the Mayor and local leaders for identifying the need for the Warsaw bridge project and the community for working together to make the project a reality.       As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured the $200,000 for the Warsaw bridge project in the fiscal year 2007 Treasury-Transportation spending bill.  Before being signed into law the bill must pass the full Senate and be reconciled with the House of Representatives.   	The $200,000 in funding will be used for Phase II of the project which includes painting and lighting of the structure and approach improvements. Phase I, currently in initial stages, includes structure repairs of the deck, steel stringers and hand rail modifications.   	“This funding will go a long way towards insuring the long-term viability of the pedestrian bridge that is an important piece of Warsaw’s history and future,” said Bond.  ###
