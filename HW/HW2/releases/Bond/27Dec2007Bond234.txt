WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today issued the following statement on the assassination of Pakistans former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto:  The tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto was a brutal act of violence and my prayers are with the Bhutto family.
