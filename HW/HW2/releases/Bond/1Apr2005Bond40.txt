	ST. LOUIS, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined St. Louis University President Lawrence Biondi for a briefing on the University’s role as a national leader in biodefense.    “Today SLU plays a major role in protecting the American public against bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases.  I am honored to be a partner in this important effort,” said Bond.  “The work and materials produced here have been used across the country to prepare emergency response teams, physicians, nurses, health administrators, and public health and community officials to respond effectively to a wide range of potential health threats.”    	Since 2000, SLU’s Institute for Bio-Security has been instrumental in medical and public health research as well as providing front line emergency workers with the education and training materials needed for preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation efforts in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other possible public health threats.      	Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has provided critical federal dollars for the Institute, including the initial $1 million that created the Institute in fiscal year 2000.  In all, Bond has secured $4.1 million for the Institute for Bio-Security since its creation.    	In addition to a briefing regarding the Institute for Bio-Security, President Biondi also briefed Bond about SLU’s $80.5 million Research Building project.  The new facilities will allow SLU scientists to further their efforts to cure and treat diseases.  Bond has secured $1.8 million for the project.       	“Your important work continues with the plans to build a new Research Building,” said Bond to the SLU officials.  “This new building will further advance research capabilities here at SLU to better meet the constantly evolving security, technology and research needs.”
