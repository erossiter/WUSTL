WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Kit Bond and Jim Talent and U.S. Representative Jo Ann Emerson (MO-08) today proudly announced that President Bush has signed legislation to name the Farmington Veterans Clinic for World War II veteran Robert Silvey, making it law.  "Bob Silvey worked on behalf of his fellow soldiers to make the Farmington veterans clinic a reality and it is only fitting that a dedicated local hero receive this honor," said U.S. Senator Kit Bond.  "Bob Silvey is an American hero and his bravery is an inspiration to us all," said Sen. Jim Talent, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I can think of no veteran more deserving of this honor than Bob Silvey. I join with Congresswoman Emerson in announcing our support to name the new veterans clinic in Farmington after him."  "I'm very pleased that this important bill has completed the legislative process and become law.  The Robert Silvey Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic will be a permanent reminder of Bob's service to his community, his country, and his fellow veterans.  It is really a neat and exciting honor for Bob, for Farmington, and for our congressional district.  We take service seriously here in the Heartland, and Bob Silvey is a tremendous example of patriotism, sacrifice, and selflessness," said Emerson.    The bill, authored by U.S. Senator Jim Talent, is S. 4073.    -30-
