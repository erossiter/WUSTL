WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement regarding President Bush's State of the Union address:     	“Through his actions and his words tonight, President Bush has shown that American leadership and resolve is the most important and effective weapon to defeat global terror and spread democracy.   “American leadership has resulted in democratic elections in Iraq, a country once dominated by a tyrannical despot, and that same leadership will be needed more than ever to confront emerging threats to our national security, such as a nuclear Iran.     	“No matter the threat, one thing is certain: that without American resolve the enemies of freedom will be emboldened and America will be less safe. President Bush will not let that happen on his watch.    	“Terrorist surveillance programs, such as the NSA program, save lives and the president should use every tool at his disposal. There is no second chance when it comes to intelligence.     	“American leadership will be hampered without good intelligence. President Bush knows this and is determined to protect Americans by following every lead, looking under every rock, and listening to every conversation where terrorists may be planning their next attack.     	“Our strength abroad depends greatly on our strength here at home. We need to continue to focus on growing our economy, making America more energy independent by developing renewable fuels and keeping America competitive in the global marketplace.”
