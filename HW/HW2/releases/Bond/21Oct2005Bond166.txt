WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $400,000 in federal funds for downtown revitalization in Kennett in the Senate-passed Transportation-Treasury-HUD spending bill.    	 “These funds will help create the environment for job growth in Kennett. Downtown revitalization will draw new businesses and opportunities to this community," said Senator Bond.  “As Missouri’s senior Senator, my job is to fight to send Missouri’s hard-earned tax dollars back home.  I will continue to work to make sure my state gets the funds it needs.”     	"We are very pleased with this announcement,” said City of Kennett Mayor Donald Parker.  We appreciate Senator Bond's support for this worthwhile project and look forward to the economic benefits it will bring to our community in the future."	    As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured the federal funds in the fiscal year 2006 spending bill, which passed the Senate last night.  Before being signed into the law the bill must be reconciled with the House of Representatives version.     The $400,000 will be used by the City of Kennett to revitalize the Dunklin County Museum (historic City Hall), which is on the National Register, and for sidewalks, lighting, landscaping, Americans with Disabilities requirements, and awning work along main thoroughfares to the town square.    Bond stressed that the downtown revitalization project will result in a number of positive benefits, including strengthening existing business, creating new job growth, increasing property values and encouraging new business development.
