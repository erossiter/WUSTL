WASHINGTON – Back from a week-long swing through Asia, U.S. Senator Kit Bond today underscored the importance of the region to the future economic and national security interests of the United States.   	Last week, Bond, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, visited Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; and Beijing, China.    	Bond met with both U.S. Embassy and foreign officials to discuss economic and security issues affecting the region as well as ongoing cooperation between the United States, Australia and Japan as a counter to increasing Chinese influence in the region.    	“The security challenges in Asia, primarily those related to North Korea, are immense and require a steadfast partnership between Japan, the U.S. and Australia,” said Bond. “Japan is the military and economic cornerstone of the United States’ interests in Asia. It will be an important ally in the war on terror. Radical Islamists have declared war on the free world.”   	“I believe China can play a constructive and crucial role in the Six Party talks with North Korea. The recent agreement is our best hope,” said Bond.    	While in South Korea and Japan, Bond discussed possible future sales of the Missouri-made F-15 and F/A-18 and made it clear that Missouri is open for business to foreign-based companies. Joining Bond in meetings with executives from a number of Japanese companies was Missouri Economic Development Director Gregg Steinhoff.   	Bond also raised the issue of beef sales in Japan and Korea, personally delivering good Missouri beef to Japanese officials. In addition, Bond met with three members of the Korean National Assembly who are graduates of the University of Missouri Columbia.   	Senator Bond also addressed the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan and China to discuss the U.S. economic relationship with those counties.    # # #
