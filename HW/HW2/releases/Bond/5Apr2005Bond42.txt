WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  today met with John Negroponte, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) nominee, and Lieutenant General Michael Hayden, the nominee for Deputy Director of National Intelligence and current head of the National Security Agency to discuss the status of reforming the nation’s intelligence community.    	“I have confidence in both John Negroponte and Michael Hayden as they are poised to take the reigns of our nation’s intelligence community,” said Senator Kit Bond.  “In addition to the knowledge and experience these two men bring, their ability to steer the intelligence community with strong hands and initiate the much needed reforms will be key to combating effectively America’s enemies.”    	Bond, a vocal advocate for a strong DNI throughout the intelligence reform debate in Congress, encouraged Negroponte to assert his role as the DNI early-on in order to make real reform.      Both Negroponte and Hayden concurred, emphasizing the importance to set precedence as strong leaders early-on, particularly in the areas of tasking and budget powers.    	Expressing his willingness to stay active in the reform process, Bond encouraged the DNI to advise him if continued reform requires a legislative fix.  However, Bond continued to stress that legislatively micro-managing our nation’s intelligence community would be detrimental.    ACongress cannot micro-manage very complex tactical military organizations, but rather should empower a Director of National Intelligence to 'clean house' as he sees fit,” said Bond.      The recently released WMD Commission Report encourages this approach, as has numerous other intelligence-related studies, and Senator Bond's own legislative efforts.
