	WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate in  opposition to efforts to condemn the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) plans to reopen the Canadian border to live cattle.      	“We just heard a defense of protectionism,” said Bond in reference to S.J. Resolution 4.  “Protectionism is the use of scare tactics, the use of unsound scientific information in an attempt to protect our market.  In this case I believe that sound science dictates that it is time to open the border.”	    	  Bond stressed that the United States’ position in the world market is based on the principle that good science should and must prevail.  He cited the alarmism of B.S.E. threats used by U.S. trading partners as an excuse to erect trade barriers to U.S. products as a good example of the negative effects when this principle is rejected.    	“Whether our trade representatives are negotiating exports of genetically enhanced rice or soybeans, meat produced using the most advanced commercial technologies, or as we negotiate reopening of the Japanese beef markets to our own producers, sound science is the best negotiating tool we have against the Luddites,” said Bond.	     	Currently Bond, along with several other Senators, sent a letter to the Ambassador from Japan against their protectionist ban of U.S. beef.  Meeting with Representatives of the Japanese Diet this week he stressed that the U.S. has demonstrated that U.S. beef will be safe and that it is time to open their markets and provide a significant export opportunity to U.S. Cattle producers.     	Senator Bond is Chairman of the Beef Caucus and a member of the informally dubbed “Agriculture Posse.”     	Kit Bond is Missouri’s senior Senator and is now in his fourth term after having served the state previously during two terms as Governor.
