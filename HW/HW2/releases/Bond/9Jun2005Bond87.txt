	WASHINGTON – Calling it a victory for consumer safety, U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that his efforts to protect the safety of consumers who use lawnmowers, chainsaws and other small engine equipment has been passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee.    	“It’s hard to argue against safety,” said Bond. “I’m pleased that opponents finally came to agree that this safety study was needed and that this provision did not affect California’s ability to implement their own emissions requirements.     	“I always believed the critics would come to see that this study was vital to protect the safety of consumers and prevent accidental fires. It just doesn’t make sense to have an 1100 degree catalytic converter three inches from your hand, as you use it in dry grass.””     The Bond-Feinstein language requires the EPA and other federal agencies to conduct a safety review prior to approving new regulations aimed at reducing emissions from small engine equipment.     	Bond said the legislation requires the study to be completed six months after the date the final Interior Appropriations bill is passed later this year and to be conducted by the EPA and other federal agencies familiar with consumer and fire safety, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Fire Administration.
