 KANSAS CITY, MO -- U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the collective-bargaining agreement the United Auto Workers (UAW) and Ford will expand the Missouri plant and create new jobs in Kansas City.   This is great news for Ford, the UAW and Missouri workers and families. I commend Ford and the UAW for reaching an agreement that will bring more high-paying jobs to Kansas City, said Bond.    Bond, Missouris senior Senator, has long pushed Ford to increase investment in Kansas City and has worked to protect manufacturing jobs in state and across the nation. As part of the agreement announced today, Ford has committed to expanding their assembly plant in Kansas City.    The Kansas City plant will receive a new, flexible body shop, which will allow both cars and trucks to be built on the same assembly line. Bond said this development will give the Kansas City plant state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities, allowing the plant to compete globally with all of Fords plants.    Under the new agreement, the Kansas City plant will also manufacture the 2008 launch of the F-150 truck replacement product for the current model. Also, the Escape, Escape Hybrid, Mariner, Mariner Hybrid and Tribute will continue to be built at the Missouri plant. Bond said that in addition, the Kansas City Ford plant will be manufacturing a new product.    ###
