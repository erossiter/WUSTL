WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the President’s nomination of General Hayden to head the CIA:    	“General Hayden is more than qualified for the position of CIA Director. The job of CIA Director is to track down and stop terrorists. That’s exactly what Gen. Hayden has been doing. His exemplary military background and his recent assignment running America’s ‘early warning’ terrorist surveillance system are clear strengths that only highlight the critical intelligence experience that Gen. Hayden brings to the CIA. I look forward to the confirmation process, but see no evidence that Gen. Hayden is anything but highly-qualified for the position.”
