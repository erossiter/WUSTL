WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today said economic reports showing the economy created 138,000 new jobs last month was good news for American families, workers and consumers.     	“This economy continues to grow and create jobs,” said Bond. “Economy activity remains strong and more Americans are going to work each day. In the last three years, nearly 5.3 million jobs have been created.     	“These gains are not by luck or accident. We are seeing the result of tax cuts enacted by Congress that allow families to keep more of what they earn. To keep the economy moving forward, Congress needs to continue to support pro-growth policies and resist raising taxes.”     	Bond said the new April jobs numbers released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, combined with other recent economic indicators, signal a healthy and growing economy.     Today’s report showed the unemployment rate remained unchanged at a low 4.7 percent. Over the year ending in April, close to 2.0 million net new payroll jobs have been created.   Last week, the Commerce Department reported that first quarter growth of the nation’s GDP came in at a stunning 4.8 percent. Consumer spending was up 5.5 percent, the largest increase since 2003, and investments by businesses in equipment grew at the rate of 16 percent, the largest gain since 2000.   Over the last year, Missouri’s economy was among the fastest-growing in the country, Bond said, pointing out that Missouri added 33,900 new jobs and the state’s unemployment rate dropped a full percent from 5.5 percent in March 2005 to 4.5 percent in March 2006.     	“These numbers underscore the resilience of this economy. Despite the economic impact of 9/11, two wars, a stock market bubble and energy price spikes, this economy remains healthy,” said Bond.
