	ST. JOSEPH, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined local business and civic leaders to celebrate the Riverside Road Extension groundbreaking in St. Joseph.             “The improvements to Riverside road are an investment in St. Joseph’s future success, economic prospects and the quality of life for citizens in the region,” said Bond.   	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured $9.6 million for the Riverside Road Extension in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.   	Bond pointed out that Missouri has many infrastructure needs and new roads and bridges are critical to the state’s economic growth.  Since he became Senator, Bond has fought to increase transportation dollars for the state, like the almost $10 million for the Riverside project.     	As chairman of the Senate Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, Bond coauthored the federal highway bill, in which Missouri will receive well over $1 billion in new highway funds.  Bond also secured $467.5 million for Missouri transportation projects statewide in the highway bill.   	Bond thanked the local leaders for their commitment to St. Joseph and for identifying projects, like the Riverside Road Extension project, that will help meet the current and future needs of the area.    	“Today we celebrate a prime example of how a community focused on a project that will pay economic dividends for years to come, and we worked together to make it happen,” said Bond.   						###
