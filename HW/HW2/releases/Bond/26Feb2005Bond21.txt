JEFFERSON CITY, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today pledged to continue his efforts to protect Missouri’s river interests.  Bond made his comments at the Missouri Levee and Drainage District Association Annual Meeting (MLDDA) in Columbia this afternoon.   	“I cannot stress enough how important it has been to have bipartisan urban and rural and unity on River issues,” said Bond. “When we have to fight drought, the upstream states, Washington environmental lawyers and lobbyists, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the inflexibility of the Endangered Species Act, it is critical that we remain together.”    	Since he served as Missouri’s Governor Bond has fought to ensure Missouri’s river needs are met.  Just last year Bond defeated legislative attempts to hold an additional 9 million acre feet of water behind the upstream dams.  As Chairman of the Senate VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond inserted language in the VA/HUD spending bill to prohibit the harmful Missouri River provision from being implemented.     	Bond promised to ensure Missouri recieves sufficient money for Missouri River Recovery in this year’s budget to prevent punitive flow modification measures.  He also said he will continue to work to keep Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation money available.    	Missouri depends on the Missouri River for a number of critical functions, Bond stressed.  Missourians use the river for drinking water, energy production, transportation and environmental protection.     	Kit Bond is Missouri’s senior Senator and is now in his fourth term after having served the state previously during two terms as Governor.
