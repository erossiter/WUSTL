WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the Senate passage of the Energy Bill:   	“The Senate passed Energy Bill is lose-lose for Missouri families feeling pain at the pump. Elections have consequences and one will be higher gas prices this summer.   	“The Senate did nothing to relieve pressures forcing gas prices up by refusing to open up new sources of oil and gas off the U.S. coast, and refusing to help build new refineries to make gasoline or turn coal into diesel fuel.     	“If energy independence is truly a priority, than we must increase domestic supply, period.  Greater production at home will lead to lower prices of gas and less reliance on foreign oil. 	“At the same time, hard-working auto manufacturing workers, in Missouri and across the nation, are threatened with disastrous new auto efficiency standards.  The Senate’s decision to hold trucks to the same economy standard as cars and force them all to achieve 35mpg by 2020 puts in doubt the long-term viability of truck plants in St. Louis and Kansas City, the ability of farmers and tradesman to get the work trucks they need, and families to get the SUVs and minivans they rely upon.  	“Even with lipstick on this guillotine, the mark this bill leaves will be bad.  I was proud to support aggressive but achievable new fuel efficiency standards that would bend auto makers but not break them, and proud of those colleagues who joined me.  Unfortunately, our best efforts were not enough.” 						###
