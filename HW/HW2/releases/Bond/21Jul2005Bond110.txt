WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $400,000 in federal funds for downtown revitalization in Kennett in the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD spending bill.    	 “These funds will help create the environment for job growth in Kennett. Downtown revitalization will draw new businesses and opportunities to this community," said Senator Bond.  "Creating the conditions for economic and job growth is my top priority and I will continue to secure critical federal investments like the funds announced today to make this possible.”    As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured the federal funds in the fiscal year 2006 spending bill, which is expected to pass the full committee today.  Before being signed into the law the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives version.    The $400,000 will be used by the City of Kennett to revitalize the Dunklin County Museum, which is on the National Register, the historic City Hall, and for sidewalks, lighting, landscaping, Americans with Disabilities requirements, and awning work along main thoroughfares to the town square.    Bond stressed that the downtown revitalization project will result in a number of positive benefits, including strengthening existing business, creating new job growth, increasing property values and encouraging new business development.
