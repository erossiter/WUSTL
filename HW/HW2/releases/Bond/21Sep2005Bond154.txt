WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced more than $2.3 million in federal funds to meet public transportation needs in Columbia.    	“An accessible and efficient public transportation system is critical to a growing city like Columbia.  These funds will improve the city’s transportation system and help provide a thriving workface, senior citizens and handicapped who depend upon public transportation,” said Senator Kit Bond.     	Columbia Mayor Darwin Hindman said, “This funding will enable Columbia to provide improved public transportation to all the citizens.  We appreciate the Senator's forward thinking in seeing the need for this investment in our public transportation system.  The value to our citizens is becoming more apparent everyday as we see the increased costs of gasoline.  This funding will also help us preserve and utilize the historic Wabash Terminal Building.  This is another example of the great things Senator Bond is doing for Columbia.”    	Columbia will receive $ 2,346,314 from the Department of Transportation.  The federal dollars will fund the refurbishment and expansion of the Historic Wabash Station which is the main transfer station for the Columbia Transit System.     	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured the funds for the Columbia buses in the fiscal year 2004 transportation spending bill.  Bond serves as chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Transportation.
