WASHINGTON, D.C. -  U.S. Senators Jim Talent and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) today announced they will pursue legislation to protect children from sexual predators.  The Senators’ announcement came after a federal judge overturned the conviction of a child predator in Missouri on a loop hole in federal law.    “These predators pose a deadly threat to our children and must be stopped,” said U.S. Senator Jim Talent.  “We should do everything possible to go after child predators whether they’re lurking around a schoolyard or prowling the Internet.  We plan to explore all options to strengthen federal law in an effort to protect Missouri’s children.”     “Today’s ruling is outrageous and a set back to the prosecution and the effort to keep people off the streets,” said Senator Kit Bond on the judge’s ruling.  “If there is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed in order to protect our children from predators we must act now.  The Missouri Statute is clear and I look forward to bringing another good, common-sense idea from Missouri to Washington.”    Earlier this week a Missouri lawyer was convicted for enticing a teenager on the Internet.  After the verdict was read, a federal judge threw out the conviction, ruling that for conviction, the law requires that a minor actually be enticed, not an undercover law enforcement official, as in this case.    Talent and Bond stressed that this apparent loophole in federal law takes away an important tool from law enforcement officials in their efforts to keep the Internet a safe place for children.    The Senators plan on drafting legislation to mirror current Missouri law, which goes farther to protect children from sex offenders.  By expressly stating that communicating with law enforcement rather than an actual child is not a defense, the state’s enticement and child solicitation laws allow prosecution involving undercover officers.
