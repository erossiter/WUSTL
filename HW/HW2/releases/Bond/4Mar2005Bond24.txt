ST. LOUIS, MO –– U.S. Senator Kit Bond today celebrated the grand opening of 6 North, the region’s first universally designed housing development.    	“Hopefully, we can use this project as a model and spread it across the city, the state and the nation so that other disabled people can be served with the dignity they deserve,” said Bond.  “After four years of a long and challenging journey, I am happy to say finally to the disabled people of St. Louis: welcome home.”    	Bond began working on today’s successful housing development four years ago when he was informed of a crisis affecting the Boulevard Apartments.  The property was in terrible condition and relocating the tenants, who were severely disabled, was not an easy endeavor.  Bond worked with the residents, community and business leaders, housing officials and disability advocates to develop an affordable housing development that would meet everyone’s needs.   	The new development, located in the Central West End, will provide affordable and accessible housing for 80 St. Louis families.  Bond stressed that 6 North’s universal design meets the needs of all people – young, old and disabled.    	As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Bond also worked with HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson to ensure the former Boulevard residents would be able to move into 6 North.    	Bond was joined by Lt. Governor Peter Kinder, Mayor Francis Slay, state and city housing officials, disability advocates and business representatives.	    	Kit Bond is Missouri’s senior Senator and is now in his fourth term after having served the state previously during two terms as Governor.
