COLUMBIA, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $750,000 for the new science center, the YouZeum, in downtown Columbia.    "The YouZeum reaches people of all ages to promote better health and lifestyle choices,” said Bond. “There is wide community support for this project and I am pleased to be part of this effort.”      	“We are delighted to receive these federal funds for the YouZeum,” said YouZeum Board President Jim Ritter, former Superintendent of Columbia Public Schools.  “We deeply appreciate Senator Bond’s outstanding efforts in securing these funds and the historic Federal Building.  He has been instrumental in helping to make the YouZeum a reality.”       Bond secured the $750,000 for the science center in the fiscal year 2006 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill, which passed Congress last week.     	The new science center is expected to reach more than 170,000 Missouri and out-of-state families each year with life changing programs.  The YouZeum offers interactive exhibits, demonstrations and hands-on displays will encourage people to learn more about their own health and to teach their children.  A number of health topics, from smoking to mental health to physical fitness, will be covered at the center.     	Bond stressed that focusing on improving personal health has never been more important than it is now.  Seven in ten American deaths each year are due to chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and some forms of cancer.  One of the biggest contributors to these diseases is obesity.  According to the Center for Disease Control fewer than half of American adults were overweight or obese in the late 1970’s.  The number is now two out of three and among children, the problem is growing quickly.      	Adopting healthier lifestyles is necessary to halt this epidemic.  Bond pointed out that children need to be shown, not just told, that healthy foods and exercise are important, which is where the YouZeum can help.     Bond also thanked the community for their commitment to the YouZeum and healthy lifestyles for future generations.  A popular project, local businesses and individuals raised funds for the YouZeum.
