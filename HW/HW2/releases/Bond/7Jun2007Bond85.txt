WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved more than $4 million in funding for a new digital map of Missouri’s flood hazards.  The new map will help increase Missouri homeowners’ awareness of flood risk and provide the necessary data for floodplain management programs.   “In a world where our televisions are digital, phones are digital, and our music is digital, it only makes sense to have a flood disaster system that is digital,” said Bond. “These new flood maps will increase Missouri homeowners’ awareness of the risk of floods and will help communities be better prepared.”    FEMA will provide Missouri with $4,237,588 to create Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for 16 counties. FEMA uses these maps to determine the flood risk homeowners face.  The flood maps will include new data and improved topography.  The FEMA dollars will fully fund the DFIRM project in Missouri.  The flood risk information presented on the Flood Insurance Rate Map as defined by FEMA is based on historic, meteorological, hydrologic, and hydraulic data, as well as open-space conditions, flood-control works and development.   The Counties included in this digital update include Clay, Crawford, Henry, Howell, Johnson, Laclede, Lafayette, Lawrence, Newton, Platte, Pulaski, Ray, Scott, St. Francois, and Stone Counties and St. Louis City.  New topography will be obtained for Clay, Platte and Scott Counties.  Locally developed topography will also be provided for Lafayette County and St. Louis City.    The project is set to be completed over the next 18 to 48 months.   ###
