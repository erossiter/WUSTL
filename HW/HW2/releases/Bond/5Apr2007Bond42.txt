KANSAS CITY, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today visited the St. Marks Child  Family Development Center in Kansas City where he highlighted the importance of the Centers early learning programs. It is critical that our children have access to early learning programs that put them on track for a lifetime of learning, said Bond.   Today, Bond toured St. Marks facility where he read to children and stressed the importance of early childhood education. Bond praised St. Marks for teaching children the importance of education, the community and how to treat others.   The work going on at St. Marks will pay dividends for years to come. St. Marks is a community asset. This facility is a safe place, a home away from home. A place to play, a place to learn and place where the dedicated staff can show that people care about the well being of others, said Bond.   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond included $750,000 in the fiscal year 2007 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill for St. Marks to expand their early learning programs. Unfortunately, the amounts included in last years spending bills were not included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill passed by the new majority.   The need for additional resources to develop the programs at St. Marks is critical. Bond emphasized that he will continue to work to secure funding for St. Marks in this years appropriations bill.   Bond has long been a strong supporter of early childhood education and parenting programs, such as the Parents as Teachers program which he established as a statewide program when he served as Missouris Governor.   Research demonstrates that the more children know about language and literacy before they arrive at school, the better equipped they are to succeed in reading, succeed in school and succeed in life.
