	PLATTSBURG, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined Mayor James Kennedy and other local officials to celebrate the ribbon cutting for Plattsburg’s downtown revitalization project.   	“The local leaders here in Plattsburg are best suited to identify the current and future needs of this community,” said Bond.  “It is important that we invest in our infrastructure that supports our community and provides opportunity for economic growth.  Today’s celebration of Community Development Block Grant funding for the redevelopment of Plattsburg’s central business district is proof that real progress is being made.”        	The City of Plattsburg received a $400,000 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) in 2005 to make public infrastructure improvements to its downtown.  Additional funding for the infrastructure improvement project was provided by the City of Plattsburg.     	As a long-time supporter of the CDGB program, Bond is also Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the program.  Bond stressed that, while some in Congress do not understand the importance of CDBG grants to small communities, the success in Plattsburg reinforces his belief in the importance of this program to Missouri.  Since Plattsburg started focusing on improving its downtown, the building vacancy rate has continued to decline.   	Bond praised the Mayor and other local leaders for identifying the need to revitalize Plattsburg’s downtown and the community for working together to make the project a reality.   	“Today we celebrate a community rallying together to meet a challenge.  It is about neighbors working toward a common goal to improve their community.  This kind of support is vital to long term community growth and it is clear that this project has that support,” said Bond.    ###
