WASHINGTON – Senator Kit Bond today announced that the BRAC Commission hearing originally scheduled for June 7th in St. Louis has been postponed. No new date has been set at this time.    	“Chairman Principi has shown great leadership in responding to our concerns and concerns from communities across the country,” said Bond. “This will give our community the time it needs to effectively prepare the case against the Pentagon’s flawed recommendations. Given the serious homeland security concerns involved, fair and timely access to the Pentagon’s data is required if this process is to have any credibility.”     	In a phone call late this afternoon with BRAC Chairman Anthony Principi, Principi told Bond that the hearing will be rescheduled at a later date.     	On Friday, Bond and 13 other senators wrote to Principi asking that local communities be given a minimum of two weeks prior to any public hearing to review the underlying data justifying the recommendations, expressing concern that the Pentagon was still withholding key information.     	Senators signing the letter included Missouri Senator Jim Talent and Illinois Sens. Durbin and Obama. The hearing is expected to include the testimony of officials from Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana.
