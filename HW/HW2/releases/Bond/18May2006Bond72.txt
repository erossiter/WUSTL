WASHINGTON – Calling his qualifications and experience impressive, Senate Intelligence Committee member Senator Kit Bond today questioned Gen. Michael Hayden on his vision for the future of America’s premier intelligence agency and called on the Senate to quickly confirm him as the next CIA Director.    	“General Hayden is one of the most distinguished and experienced officers in the intelligence community today,” said Bond. “His qualifications are impressive. Americans want Congress and the President to do everything in our power to prevent another terrorist attack. The Senate should move to confirm Gen. Hayden as soon as possible.”    	During the confirmation hearing today, Bond questioned Gen. Hayden on his vision for the CIA, specifically the need for increased human intelligence, the proper role of covert operations, and America’s terrorist surveillance programs.    	Bond said General Hayden’s military background and his background running the NSA terrorist surveillance program are valuable assets and clear strengths. General Hayden’s background will enable him to improve coordination within the intelligence community, noted Bond.    	“The terrorist surveillance program is legal, it is necessary and it is effective,” said Bond. “There should be no question that General Hayden executed what the best lawyers in our government determined to be fully legal and proper.”    	 “General Hayden was nominated to lead the CIA because of his experience and proven leadership. The job of CIA Director is to track down and stop terrorists. That’s exactly what Gen. Hayden has been doing.”
