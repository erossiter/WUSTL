WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured $1 million in federal funds in the Commerce-State-Justice spending bill to help Missouri in the fight against the state’s methamphetamine epidemic. 	“I am proud to be a partner in this local, state and federal effort,” said Bond.  “The MOSMART program is critical to Missouri’s continued fight to end the state’s meth epidemic.” 	“The Missouri Sheriff Methamphetamine Relief Team (MOSMART) is grateful to hear new funding may be coming our way to continue our fight against meth,” stated John Jordan, Sheriff of Cape Girardeau County.  “We appreciate Senator Bond’s longstanding support for our bipartisan organization and look forward to these new resources for Missouri law enforcement.”     	Bond secured the $1 million in federal funds for the Missouri Sheriffs Methamphetamine Relief Team (MOSMART).  MOSMART has successfully coordinated efforts with regional drug task forces and sheriff departments from throughout the state to fight meth Missouri-wide.   	Recognizing the severity of the state’s drug problem, Bond secured the seed money to start MOSMART in 2000. Since the program began he has secured more than $16 million for MOSMART, including today’s funds.  Bond has long been a strong partner to Missouri’s law enforcement and has used his position as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure millions in federal funds for Missouri law enforcement, anti-drug programs and the state's crimes labs. Bond secured the $1 million in federal funds for MOSMART in the fiscal year 2008 Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill, which passed the full Senate Appropriations Committee today.  Before being signed into the law the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives version.  # # #
