WASHINGTON – With the Defense Department continuing to withhold critical data, Senator Kit Bond, joined by 13 other Senators, today demanded that communities impacted by the BRAC recommendations receive two full weeks to review the underlying data justifying the recommendation prior to any public hearing.    	“If this process is to have any credibility it is critical that communities have time to prepare their case,” said Bond. “The Pentagon has had two years to review this data, we simply are asking for two weeks. We need to know what underlying data is being used to justify this flawed decision.”     	In a letter today, Bond called for a full two-week period to review Pentagon data prior to any public hearing. A BRAC hearing is currently scheduled for June 7th in St. Louis. Senators signing the letter include Missouri Senator Jim Talent and Illinois Sens. Durbin and Obama. The full text of the letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi follows:  	“To date, full justification data for closing or realigning installations still remains unavailable. As stated by the BRAC Commission, The recommendations provided by the DoD are extremely complex and interrelated and will require in-depth analysis and careful attention to detail.  The Commission will follow a fair, open, and equitable process as set forth by statute.”                 “ The failure of the Department of Defense to provide ALL of the justification data used to recommend closing or realigning installations in a timely fashion is anything but “fair, open or equitable.”  The Department of Defense has had over two years to review and collect this data and people associated with the installations selected for closure should have at a minimum two weeks to review the data prior to any BRAC hearings or site visits.  Sufficient time to review this data is necessary to ensure they can make an appeal based on the criteria established by the Department of Defense.                   “We are requesting from the BRAC that each installation recommended for closure or realignment be given the opportunity to review the crucial information used to evaluate its closure or realignment for a full two weeks prior to any BRAC hearing.”  	On Tuesday, Bond, joined by nearly two dozens senators and the entire Missouri congressional delegation, urged the Pentagon to release all information related to the BRAC recommendations.
