Kansas City, MO   Calling it an unacceptable abuse of taxpayer money, U.S. Senator Kit Bond today called on the federal government to find out how over $1 million in federal funds could have been spent to renovate just two Tracy Avenue homes as part of the Beacon Hill development project.    	“The waste of taxpayer dollars will not be tolerated,” said Bond, chairman of the Senate’s housing appropriations subcommittee. “We are here today because this community deserves answers. The recent audit was a good first step, but I have called for a full-scale Inspector General investigation. We must find out what happened and learn how we can prevent this from happening again.”    	Senator Bond, who has requested a complete HUD Inspector General investigation on the restoration, stressed that investigators must find out exactly how much money was spent, what the funds were spent on and whether federal guidelines were followed.      	Bond said that not only do city and federal officials need to investigate how the housing funds were spent, but also must learn what kind of controls HUD and city officials need to put in place to prevent this kind of abuse in the future.     	A recent audit conducted for the city revealed that almost $1.1 million in federal housing funds have been billed or spent for the restoration of just two Tracey Avenue homes. The audit also found that contracts associated with the restoration may have violated federal regulations.     	“We stand in an area of great promise,” said Bond. “Yet the questions that have gone unanswered have tainted this project, the City, and HUD.  “The precious resources that should be used to strengthen neighborhoods, spur economic development and improve our community are being wasted. It is unacceptable and it will not be tolerated.”
