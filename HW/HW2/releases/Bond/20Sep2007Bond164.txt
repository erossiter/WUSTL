WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senators Kit Bond (R-MO) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) today introduced the Trails Act Technical Correction Act of 2007. The bipartisan bill will ensure that property owners are compensated for land taken from them by the federal government under the National Trails System Act  This is a common sense fix that is long overdue, said Bond. This bill will correct a past injustice that deprived Missouri landowners of their rightful compensation.  This legislation will make sure that landowners receive just compensation for their property, McCaskill said. Rails-to-Trails is a great program, but we need to make sure that property owners are treated fairly.  The Trails Act Technical Corrections Act of 2007 is a Senate companion to a bipartisan House bill sponsored by Missouri Representatives Russ Carnahan, Todd Akin, Lacy Clay, Jo Ann Emerson and Sam Graves. The technical bill clarifies the amount of time landowners have to file a claim for compensation, but makes no substantive changes to the successful Rail-to-Trails program. The Rails-to-Trails program converts old railway lines to recreational paths designed for pedestrian, bicycle, skating, equestrian, and light motorized traffic.   In 1992, the federal government established public recreational grounds on property owned by 102 St. Louis County residents. After 12 years of fighting over the amount of compensation due to the landowners, the Justice Department agreed to pay the property owners a total of $2,385,000 for their property, interest and legal fees. However, two days before the U.S. Court of Claims was scheduled to approve the agreement, a federal court issued a decision that changed the date that claims were due, disqualifying the property owners claim. The new bill will ensure that these property owners receive their just compensation.      # # #
