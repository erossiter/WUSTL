WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) to  announce an historic agreement on fuel economy standards, which brings together for the first time Democrats and Republicans, labor and management, domestic and foreign owned automakers.  Bond issued the following statement on today’s agreement:    	“We have heard the call, and we have come together.  For the first time ever we have brought together Democrats and Republicans, labor and management, domestic and foreign owned automakers to support mandatory higher fuel economy standards and more.  	“Together we will increase fuel economy standards, increase clean technology usage, and increase the amount of clean fuels available to consumers.  	“An issue as broad and important to millions of hard-working, middle-class family supporting blue collar auto workers across the nation deserves bipartisan consensus.  That is the kind of lawmaking the American people want and that is what we want to deliver.  	“Our proposal is aggressive but achievable.  It will bend industry but not break them.  It will provide labor with the security they are looking for, and industry with the certainty it needs.  	“Our proposal will provide the environment with fuel standards 30% higher than current levels.  It will protect the environment with no opportunity to lower standards through so-called off-ramps.  	“Our proposal will reduce greenhouse gas emissions through mandated flex-fuel engines or advanced technologies like hybrids and break down big oil restrictions on service stations selling biofuels.  	“Our proposal will provide a fair playing field for all clean vehicle technologies including hybrid and future systems such as plug-ins.  	“The American people want us to come together.  Time and again they have said they want an end to divisive, partisan politics that pit special interests against each other.    	“That is why I am so proud to work with my colleagues for something that will be good for the environment, good for our energy security, and most importantly, good for families and workers from Missouri, Michigan and across the nation.”  	* Details of the CAFÉ provisions are attached.												# # #   BIPARTISAN ALTERNATIVE TO IMPROVE FUEL ECONOMY  A bipartisan approach to improve vehicle fuel economy and protect the environment that for the first time ever brings together Democrats and Republicans, labor and management, and foreign and domestic manufacturers in support of:  	•	Aggressive but achievable mandatory fuel economy standards,  	•	Clean technology requirements for an increasing percentage of vehicles,  	•	Expanded availability of clean fuels for consumers, and   	•	An enhanced federal program that will strongly promote the development of leap ahead technologies.  Specific Provisions of the Amendment Include –   CAFE Mandate  	•	Mandatory 30 percent ramp up of fuel economy standards to at least 36 mpg for cars by 2022 and at least 30 mpg for trucks by 2025 (actual standards set to maximum achievable levels at or above these floors by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) 	•	No off-ramps permitting lower standards         •	Authorizes NHTSA to set attribute-based, multiple model year standards for passenger vehicles, as well as new commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle standards   Mandates for Advanced Technology Vehicles and Flexible Fuel Vehicles   	•	requires each manufacturer to produce (and sell) 50 percent advanced technology vehicles (such as hybrids or clean diesel) or flexible fuel vehicles by 2015 	•	By 2017, at least 10 percent of those vehicles must be advanced technology        •	Provides an even playing field for all advanced technology and flexible fuel technologies         •	Extends credits for flexible fuel vehicles to support greater demand and availability of ethanol and consumer acceptance of these vehicles and then phases out the credit by 2020  Focus on Leap-Ahead Technology 	•	Authorizes increased funding for research, development and demonstration in the areas of advanced batteries, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, clean diesel, diesel hybrids, and flex fuel hybrid technologies, hydrogen storage and fuel cell membranes; as well as cellulosic-based ethanol, and other biofuels, such as biodiesel, to replace conventional diesel fuel    Measures to Spur the Availability of Alternative Fuels and Infrastructure 	•	Prohibits anti-competitive barriers that limit the ability of service station retailers to sell biofuels such as E85 	•	Requires the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study of the feasibility of the construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines  	•	Expands access to alternative fuel refueling stations on federal property
