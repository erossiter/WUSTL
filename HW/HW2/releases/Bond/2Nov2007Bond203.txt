  WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond criticized the White House for todays veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Bond issued the following statement on the Presidents action:   I look forward to the opportunity to override this veto on an overwhelming non-partisan basis. Unfortunately, to those across our country who rely on flood protection, super-efficient port and river transportation, and environmental restoration, this puts an exclamation point on a consistent White House record of hostility.    The White House should know that this bill does not spend $1. Itauthorizes our nations highest-priority projects making them eligible for federal dollars. The breakfast menu is larger, but the breakfast budget is unchanged. To say otherwise is either misinformed or purposefully misleading.   Bond has pushed for WRDAs passage since 2002 and is the author of the lock and dam modernization provision, critical to farmers who depend on the lock and dam system to move their products to market. WRDA authorizes the nations flood control, environmental restoration, and navigation projects.      ###
