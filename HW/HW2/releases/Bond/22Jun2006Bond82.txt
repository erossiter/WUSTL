WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Kit Bond, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today criticized efforts to set a timetable for removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, saying terrorists will no doubt consider these efforts “the best news of the year.”   “The insurgents claim that although time was initially on their side, they now believe that time is on our side because our efforts are starting to make significant gains against them,” said Bond.    “At a time when the insurgents are saying that time is working against them, my Democratic colleagues are introducing a measure to set a timetable for withdrawal in Iraq that will undercut the momentum that the insurgents themselves say we have built in Iraq.”   Bond cited the recently seized insurgent document that states the terrorists in Iraq see the current situation in Iraq as “bleak” for them and outline a desperate media campaign, including a plan to draw the United States into a war with Iran.    “Why would we embolden the terrorists with a timetable for withdrawal at the very moment they are beginning to become demoralized?” asked Bond.    Bond also took issue with remarks by Democratic chief Howard Dean. Dean recently said the GOP was good at sending other people’s children to war. Bond said his son, a Marine, returned earlier this year from a tour in Iraq and is likely to return.   “My son is not wild about going back to Iraq, but he’d sure rather do that than sacrifice all that he and his fellow soldiers have accomplished by leaving too early and inviting chaos,” said Bond.    “Too much has been gained in Iraq and there is too much to lose. We need to finish the job and remain in Iraq until the government is functioning and able to defend itself. That is the only way that the Middle East will be safe, that Iraqis will be safe, and that America will be safe.”   # # #
