	KANSAS CITY, MO - Senator Kit Bond today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has released $5 million in federal funds for Kansas City’s bus and public transportation needs.      	“These funds are critical as we continue our efforts to build an efficient and accessible public transportation system in the Kansas City metropolitan area," said Bond.      	The funds will be used to complete the first phase of the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) development project, also known as the Metro Area Express, or "MAX".  This project will link the north and south regions of Kansas City which will connect the City Market-Riverfront to Union Station/Crown Center locality, and to The Plaza region.  The system will use the current rights of way, will have signal priority at intersections and will run as frequent as light rail.     	Long committed to Kansas City and local residents who depend on public transportation, the $5 million  adds to more than $10 million in federal funds that Bond has secured for Kansas City BRT planning and development in prior years and more than $20 million for KCATA programs.   	“BRT will be an effective and time efficient service that will ensure adequate and convenient transportation service from the downtown area to the Plaza," said Bond. "This system will not only act as a link between two Kansas City regions, it will also serve as a nexus for those who work and reside in those communities."    	As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bond secured the $5 million announced today in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.
