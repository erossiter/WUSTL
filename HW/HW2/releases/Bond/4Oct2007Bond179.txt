 WASHINGTON, DC Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Kit Bond, today issued the following statement on the New York Times story on so-called secret legal opinions on the Administrations interrogation program:   The New York Times article did not surprise me with any new information about the interrogation program. The real surprise uncovered by the New York Times reporters was Steve Bradburys humble beginnings.  Speaking of Mr. Bradbury  he has addressed the Intelligence Committee on numerous occasions and we appreciate his acute legal reasoning and frank assessments.  I did not know the details of the Administrations interrogation program before I took over as Vice Chairman. However, it is my understanding that the then-Chairman and Vice Chairman were briefed.   As a result of my efforts the full committee has now been briefed and is exercising continuing oversight of this important program.  The Senate Intelligence Committee has received the Administrations legal justifications for the interrogation program. Those justifications were critical to our oversight and I believe they are sufficient for assessing the legal underpinnings of the program.  As a lawyer, I understand that releasing legal opinions would have a chilling effect on future policy deliberations and legal advice within the Executive branch. Most of my Senate colleagues usually regard the attorney-client privilege as sacred, and for very good reasons. The President is entitled to that privilege as well.  Continued discussion in the media of particular interrogation techniques enables al-Qaeda to train its operatives in appropriate resistance techniques. ###
