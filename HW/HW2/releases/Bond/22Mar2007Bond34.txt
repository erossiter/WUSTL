WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Kit Bond (R-MO) and Tom Harkin (D-IA) today introduced the National Institute for Food and Agriculture Research Act of 2007.  The bill would boost the federal investment in agricultural research to help keep America’s farmers competitive in the world market and continue providing consumers with a safe, affordable, and nutritious food supply.  The legislation would implement recommendations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Research, Education and Economics task force established in the 2002 farm bill.                  “The ability of U.S. agriculture producers to maintain our world leadership is only as solid as our willingness to commit to forward-looking investments,” said Senator Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that funds the Department of Agriculture.  “This legislation will lay the foundation for tremendous advances in the future and keep American agriculture on the cutting edge,” said Senator Bond.                 “Funding for food and agriculture research has faced significant cuts,” said Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. “To meet the growing demand on agriculture and develop new innovations in renewable energy and other areas we must increase investments in agricultural research.  This bill will help put us back on track to leading the world with the best technology that will keep America’s farmers and food and agriculture sector, and rural communities the most productive in the world.”               The USDA Research, Education and Economics task force found that American agriculture is facing serious challenges, including increased foreign competition, emerging diseases of plants and animals, concerns for food safety and the environment, and demands for renewable energy.  Advances in the life sciences, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular biology, provide the base for new and continuing innovations in agriculture.  Unfortunately, inadequate funding of agricultural research puts American farmers at a disadvantage from foreign competitors and prevents new innovations for healthy food.  In order to address this challenge the task force recommended establishing a National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) at USDA which would supplement ongoing research conducted at the Department.                  Bond and Harkin’s legislation implements the task force’s recommendation by directing the USDA to create a NIFA that provides additional funds for competitive agriculture research grants.  The legislation would provide $3.44 billion in federal funds over the next five years.  The NIFA would be similar to the successful research programs at the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.  NIFA would not replace USDA’s current research, extension, and education programs.     	U.S. Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) are cosponsoring the legislation.
