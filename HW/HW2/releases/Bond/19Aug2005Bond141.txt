MEXICO, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined local business and civic leaders in his hometown, where he provided an update on recent Senate action and current events to the Mexico Chamber of Commerce.      	“There is good news from Washington because the President has signed two comprehensive bills that will have a tremendous impact on the future of our economy, the highway and energy bills,” said Bond.         	 Bond opened his remarks to the Chamber by noting that the attacks in London last month in London are further evidence that the War on Terror is not over.  Our brave troops fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other hot spots around the world are making great progress, although it is not recognized by some in the national media, Bond said.    	Addressing the Chamber, Bond told local leaders that after more than three years of work, his efforts to improve Missouri's transportation system have finally met with success.  As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Senate Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Bond was one of the key authors of the federal highway bill, which was signed into law last week.  A big win for Missouri, the bill provides $1.3 billion in additional highway funding for the state over the life of the five-year bill.  Also, Bond successfully fought to increase Missouri’s share above 98 cents on the dollar. These funds will mean new jobs, increased safety on the nation’s roads and highways, and greater efficiency for shippers and exporters.    	Bond also praised the recently signed energy legislation, which included his amendment calling for a common sense approach to fuel efficiency.  For corn and soybean producers the bill also includes Senator Jim Talent’s renewable fuel standard that will gradually increases the use of these fuels to 8 billion gallons by 2012.  Bond said the legislation is good news for the economy and is key to developing a national, comprehensive energy policy.   	Also, Senator Bond and other small business advocates are working to lower health care costs and help reduce the number of uninsured through Association Health Plans, which would allow small businesses to join together through their trade associations to access quality affordable health insurance, a plan Bond is cosponsoring.    	Bond also promised that he will use his new Appropriations subcommittee to continue the fight against methamphetamine.  In recent years Missouri has become known as the “meth capitol” of the United States.  Bond has secured millions in federal funds for Missouri law enforcement, anti-drug programs and the state's crimes labs to fight this problem.  He also secured the federal dollars in 2000 to begin the Missouri Sheriffs Methamphetamine Relief Team (MOSMART) to combat the meth problem. Since this program began Bond has secured more than $13 million for MOSMART and an additional $1 million for the program in the last fiscal year.
