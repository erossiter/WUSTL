WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he secured almost $20 million in federal funds for critical transportation and housing projects in the St. Louis region.    	 “These critical projects will provide important education and health care, affordable housing and community outreach opportunities in the St. Louis region,” said Bond.  “As Missouri’s senior Senator, my job is to fight to send Missouri’s hard-earned tax dollars back home.  I will continue to work to make sure my state gets the funds it needs.”    	As chairman of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured the funds for St. Louis in the fiscal year 2006 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill.  The final conference agreement on the bill was approved last night and is expected to pass the House and Senate before Congress breaks for Thanksgiving.      	Included in Bond’s announcement today is $5 million for lead abatement in St. Louis.  These funds are focused on primary prevention services for pregnant women and their babies. The program, administered by Grace Hill Community Health Centers, is working to clean and remediate homes in six high risk zip codes, to keep children from being poisoned by lead.  In 2003, Bond challenged Mayor Slay to make the city lead free by 2010 by delivering $15 million in federal funds in the next three federal funding cycles. Today’s announcement will make the third installment of funds, making good on his promise.      Bond was able to secure $19.95 million for the following key projects in the St. Louis region:   *	$5,000,000 - St. Louis Zoo Public Safety and Transportation Improvements Project (with Senator Jim Talent).   *	$5,000,000 for the Grace Hill Neighborhood Health Centers for remediation and lead abatement in St. Louis.   *	$3,000,000 - St. Louis and Garden District Community Transportation Improvement Initiative    *	$1,000,000 - New Haven Missouri River bore project (with Congressman Hulshof)   *	$1,500,000 - St. Louis University Streetscape Improvements	   *	$1, 000,000 - Better Living Communities for capital improvements for Salisbury Park neighborhood housing development in St. Louis    *	$800,000 - Bridgeton Trail/Park	    *	$750,000 - St. Louis Science Center Streetscape Improvements   *	$750,000 - Family Support Services Center for Autistic Children for construction of a Center to serve families with autistic children in St. Charles County	   *	$500,000 - Mark Twain Neighborhood Association for capital improvements in St. Louis   *	$500,000 – Cochran Gardens Redevelopment   *	$150,000 – Covenant House Elderly Demonstration Program to preserve and expand affordable housing for the elderly in St. Louis
