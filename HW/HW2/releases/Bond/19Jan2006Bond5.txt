ST. LOUIS, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court:    “One of the most important roles of the U.S. Senate is providing advice and consent on Presidential nominations to the Supreme Court.     “Today, Senator Talent and I are here to support fully the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Court.    “It is clear to all but the most partisan individuals that Judge Alito’s impressive legal education and professional experience make him eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     “Americans learned two things last week during the confirmation hearings:  One, that Sam Alito is a gentleman and a distinguished legal expert whose deep knowledge of constitutional law is exceptional; and two, that Senators sure do like to hear themselves talk.     “Despite a lot of bloviating by our good friends on the other side of the aisle, Judge Alito answered questions thoughtfully and honestly and reaffirmed his fitness to sit on the court.   “Princeton, Yale Law School, Assistant US Attorney, Assistant Solicitor General, US Attorney and federal judge: Sam Alito’s legal experience is broad and deep.     “In addition, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.     “Samuel Alito is a good man and will make a great Supreme Court Justice.    “It is my hope that the Senate will confirm Judge Alito swiftly with a simple majority vote on the Senate floor as soon as possible.”
