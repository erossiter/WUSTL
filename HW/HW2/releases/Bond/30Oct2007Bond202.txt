COLUMBIA, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he will beef up his official operation in-state. Bond will move his Chief of Staff, Brian Klippenstein, from the Washington, DC office to Missouri.    As I have said many times before, my best ideas come from Missouri. Locating my top staffer in-state will ensure that while Im working for Missourians in Washington itis clear that my focus remains on Missouri, said Bond.   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Bond has been a national leader on a number of important issues, including intelligence, military, foreign policy and infrastructure.    Since Bond served as Governor, however, his first priority has been fighting to build a stronger Missouri  from creating a task force to combat meth, securing funds for roads and bridges, to protecting jobs at plants in Rolla. Bond stressed that todays announcement is another move in his efforts to create the most efficient and powerful in-state operation to serve Missourians.    Kara Smith, Bonds Legislative Director, will be promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff. Kara will run the day-to-day operations of Bonds Washington, DC office.   Brian, a Missouri native from Maysville, grew up on his familys cattle farm. Brian began his Hill career in 1988 as a staffer for Congressman Tom Coleman and joined Bonds office since 1993.    Kara joined Bonds office in 2001 as a Legislative Assistant and later served as Bonds Staff Director on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, Pensions Subcommittee on Aging. A Missouri native from St. Louis, Kara has been on the Hill since 1997, where she started her career with then-Congressman Jim Talent.     ###
