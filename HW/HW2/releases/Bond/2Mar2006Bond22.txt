WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today issued the following statement on the Senate passage of the bipartisan Patriot Act reauthorization:    “September 11th is not so long ago that we should have forgotten what it felt like that day. The results of hamstringing our domestic intelligence abilities are not so distant.  The reasons we passed the Patriot Act have not gone away,” said Bond.  “Fortunately the Democrats’ attempt to block this important and bipartisan anti-terrorism tool failed.   The Patriot Act Reauthorization strikes a balance between national security and personal liberties and most importantly, gives the men and women protecting America the tools they need to keep terror at bay.”    	Bond also hailed the inclusion of Senator Talent’s proposal addressing the meth epidemic:    	“Senator Talent’s proposal is the most comprehensive anti-meth package ever introduced in Congress.  The Combat Meth measure will allow legitimate consumers to have access to the medicine they need, while cutting off the meth cookers from the ingredients they need to cook their poison,” said Bond.
