WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Kit Bond (R-MO) today issued the following statement: This morning I called Sen.-elect McCaskill to congratulate her on her victory and compliment her on a successful campaign.   We had a positive conversation and I look forward to working with her, as we have in the past, to serve the people and the interests of Missouri. My office and top staff will be available to offer any needed assistance to her and her staff during the coming transition.   While the campaign is over, the challenges Missouri and the nation face remain. Whether it is making critical investments in Missouri, creating jobs and keeping the economy growing, supporting policies that protect Americans from the threat of terrorism or succeeding in Iraq, we must work together to get the job done.   # # #
