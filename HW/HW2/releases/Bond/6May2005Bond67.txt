	West Plains, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today met with leaders from the Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) - West Plains Campus and the community to discuss the University's efforts to increase student access to higher education.    	“Here in West Plains, community leaders recognize that one of the best ways to enhance the region’s opportunities and quality of life is to raise the level of education throughout this region,” said Bond.  “Through the innovation and technology of distance learning we will increase student access to higher education.”   	SMSU – West Plains’ officials told Bond that they plan to raise the level of education throughout the region by implementing distance learning.  The proposed project would provide distance learning educational opportunities to allow students to earn a 4 year degree or master’s degree from SMSU-Springfield on the West Plains campus.      	An earlier pilot program for earning a Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education on this campus had very successful results.  250 students participated in the pilot program and 81 percent of the graduates chose to remain in the 7 surrounding counties to work as teachers.      	Traditionally the SMSU-West Plains campus has been a two-year campus where students either completed their degree program in Springfield 60 miles away or earned a two-year associate degree.      	“Enhancing the distance learning capabilities will empower the West Plains campus to continue to improve the quality of life and economic well-being of south central Missouri,” said Bond, who said he will work on behalf of federal dollars for the project.
