ST. LOUIS, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved almost $5 million in federal funds for the development and construction of low income elderly housing in St. Louis.   AI am pleased to play a part in making good, low income housing a reality that will also serve as an anchor for the continued redevelopment of St. Louis urban core, said Bond. By working together, these projects will become a reality, and we will improve the quality of life for many seniors in St. Louis.  AHEPA National Housing Corporation in St. Louis will receive $4,787,000 in federal HUD dollars. The funds will be used to provide a 3-story building with 40 one-bedroom units for the low-income seniors. The building will contain a foyer and lounge area, community room, small serving kitchen. Supportive services to be provided will include transportation, Meals on Wheels, computer training and intergenerational activities with students.   HUDs Section 202 Program funds supportive housing for very low-income seniors, including the frail elderly, and provides rent subsidies for these projects to help make them affordable.    As the lead Republican on the Senate Committee that funds HUD, Bond is a long-time advocate for the federal dollars and programs needed to help Americans find safe and affordable housing.  Through projects like these we can make our neighborhoods safer for our children and families, and keep our seniors in the communities they love and surrounded by the people who love them, said Bond.   ###
