WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today praised the Senate passage of the Port Security Improvement Act, which will strengthen our nation’s land and seaports.     	“Passage of today’s bill is an important step in our continuing efforts to keep Americans safe from radical terrorists,” said Bond.  “This legislation will strengthen and improve security at our nation’s ports.”    	The Port Security Improvement Act unanimously passed the Senate this evening.  Having passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, the bill will now be sent to the President to be signed into law.   	The ports legislation will strengthen the United States’ land and seaports, improve America’s maritime transportation security strategy, and enhance communications between the Department of Homeland Security and key stakeholders.    	Bond stressed that this legislation is a critical to keeping America safe from future terrorist attacks.  Currently, 95 percent of our nation’s overseas trade, worth nearly $1 trillion, enters or leaves through our seaports.  Also, foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approx. 800 million tons of goods that come into our country.  In 2005 alone, more than 11 million containers arrived in the United States by sea and the number is growing.    	The ports bill requires information about cargo be provided before the cargo is loaded on a vessel in a foreign port and shipped to the United States.  The bill adds 50 new inspectors for the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and 750 new customs and borders agents to help facilitate commercial and revenue functions at ports nationwide.     	The bill will also require examination of containers entering the U.S. for radiation and WMD.  By December 2007, radiation detection will occur on all containers entering the U.S. through the busiest 22 seaports.
