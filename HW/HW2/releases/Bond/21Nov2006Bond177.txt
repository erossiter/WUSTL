	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today visited Kansas City to see first-hand the work of local researchers who are developing cutting-edge chemical/biological protection suits for America’s soldiers and first responders.    	“These suits are urgently needed to meet current and future threats to men and women in the military serving abroad in the war on terror and our first responders serving here at home in times of crisis,” said Bond.  “New suits will keep our warfighters on the cutting edge of technology and help them keep us safe from those who wish to do us harm.”     	In September, Bond secured $1.95 million in the 2007 Defense Appropriations bill for GE Energy Systems in Kansas City to research and develop critically needed new chemical/biological protection suits designed to self-decontaminate.   	The chemical/biological protection suits currently being used have significant shortcomings such as limited life-span and limited moisture-vapor permeability, which results in increased heat stress and discomfort, said Bond.    	The goal of the new suits will be to protect against chemical and biological threats, as well as have a self-decontamination capability and a 72-hour wear time. Current suits only offer 24 hours of protection after exposure to chemical/biological agents and do not self-decontaminate.    	The current decontamination process presents a serious operational and logistical challenge as well as a hazard to personnel, said Bond. Biological agents are trapped in the current suits while chemical agents are adsorbed in activated carbon pellets.      	Even after thorough decontamination, suits must be disposed of since there is an unacceptable risk of exposure to trace amounts of chemical/biological agents. In addition, the new suits will be 20 percent lighter and 25 percent more durable than the current suits.
