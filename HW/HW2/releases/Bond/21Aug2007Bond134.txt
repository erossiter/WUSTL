  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Kit Bond and U.S. Representative Jo Ann Emerson (MO-08) today announced a National Emergency Grant of over $1.3 million to assist workers recently laid off from the Briggs  Stratton plant in Rolla. Initially, $536,000 will be released through the Missouri Division of Workforce Development to the Central Ozark Private Industry Council, Inc. and the grant will cover an estimated 430 former employees of Briggs  Stratton, Affinia Brake Parts in Cuba, Missouri and AMF Billiards and Games in Bland, Missouri.  When this many workers lose their jobs through no fault of their own, it affects our whole community. This funding will enable our dedicated, skilled Southern Missouri workforce to brush up on skills and training so they can find employment in other sectors of our economy. I'm pleased by this encouraging support from the U.S. Department of Labor, and I hope it eases the transition for affected families in Southern Missouri, said Emerson.  U.S. Senator Kit Bond said, Job loss is devastating for workers and the families they support. The retraining money from the Labor Department is welcome news for all those affected. Missourians have a strong work ethic, and with new skills will be up and running in new jobs very soon.  Funds from the grant may be used for transportation, training, test materials, core and intensive services leading to individual re-employment plans, and comprehensive assessments.  ###
