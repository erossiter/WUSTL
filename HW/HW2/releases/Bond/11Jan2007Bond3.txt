WASHINGTON – At the first hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence this year, U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice-Chairman of the Committee, today said that the United States faces threats from across the globe from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and urged the Iraqi government to step up to the plate and take control of their country.   	“The preeminent conflict of the last generation was with one monolithic superpower, namely the Soviet Union,” said Bond. “Today, we face a myriad of enemies united primarily by militant ideologies infested with hatred for America and the freedoms, hopes and opportunities we represent.”   Bond said that while radical Islamism is festering in areas in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa there are also serious threats from North Korea and Iran, both forging ahead with their pursuit of nuclear capabilities.    The committee today heard testimony from top officials from the CIA, DNI, FBI, DIA and State Department. Among those testifying today were CIA Director Michael Hayden and the Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte.   	On Iraq, Bond said the key to President Bush’s plan is the participation of the Iraqis.    	“I agree that we should give Iraqi officials as much support as possible for them to gain control of their country,” said Bond. “But it is time for the Iraqis to step up to the plate or we will have to consider other options.    	“America has sacrificed greatly to give the Iraqis this historic opportunity for democratic rule and they must seize the day. The Iraqis must understand our commitment, while firm, is not in perpetuity.”    	Bond added that he looked forward to working with Chairman Rockefeller on critical issues this year such as the 2007 Intelligence Authorization bill, intelligence reform oversight and examining intelligence operations.
