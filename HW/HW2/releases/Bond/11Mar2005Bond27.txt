WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is sending the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City $497,050 in federal dollars for the Buck O'Neil Research and Education Center in the historic 18th & Vine District.     	"This project is a fitting tribute to Buck O’Neil’s legacy.  Not only will the new education center enhance the Museum it will also expand educational opportunities for our children in Kansas City," said Bond.  "The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum is a tremendous asset for our community.  The museum tells the story of great Americans who overcame tremendous adversity and fulfilled their dreams." 	    	In 2003 when the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum announced its plans to create the Buck O’Neil Center, Bond pledged his support to secure federal funding towards the project.  He secured the funds announced today in the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD appropriations bill.  Bond is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds HUD.    	The Buck O'Neil Research and Education Center will house the collection and study of written material and artifacts that document the history of the Negro Leagues and the cultural history of the area.  Additionally, the facility will provide an educational setting for literacy and entrepreneurial programs for children in the community.     	The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum hopes to locate the Buck O'Neil Research and Education Center in the former Paseo YMCA.  According to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, the Negro National League was founded by Andrew "Rube" Foster, six Negro League baseball officials, five sportswriters from black newspapers and an attorney at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City in 1920.
