WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today criticized the Senate Judiciarys proposal to revise U.S. intelligence surveillance law. Bond stressed the bill will not provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies the tools they need to intercept terrorist communications.   This bill would gut our critical terrorist early warning system, said Vice Chairman Bond. The only bill that will protect American civil liberties without hand-cuffing our terror-fighters was approved on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Intelligence Committee.   Earlier this year the Senate Intelligence Committee voted out a bipartisan bill to update the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The agreement brokered by Bond and Chairman Rockefeller with members on the Intelligence Committee, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the Department of Justice will give our intelligence operators and law enforcement the tools needed to conduct surveillance of foreign terrorists in foreign countries planning to conduct attacks inside the United States or against our allies.    Bond noted that it is clear that the Senate Judiciary Committee did not consult with the Department of Justice or Intelligence Community when drafting their bill. The Judiciary Committee bill was voted out on a strict party line vote of 10  9. Bond stressed that the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee bill is the legislation that will allow us to capture timely foreign intelligence about terrorists plotting to attack our homeland.  ###
