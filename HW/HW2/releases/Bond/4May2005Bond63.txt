ST. JOSEPH, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today met with local leaders to discuss continued growth in northwest Missouri and the importance of the St. Joseph levee project and the Missouri Air National Guard to the community.    	“The mission of the Air National Guard is critically important to the protection of St. Joe, our state and our nation,” said Bond.  “Also, this levee is critical for the continued existence of the Air National Guard in St. Joe and for the economic vitality of the city.”           Today, at the Missouri Air National Guard Headquarters, Bond joined leaders of the Missouri Air National Corps, members of the Corps of Engineers and St. Joseph city officials, where he praised the progress being made in northwest Missouri.  He cited the current expansion at Missouri Western State University, which will attract new businesses to the region, train workers in upgraded and technological skills, and help expand existing businesses.  Bond also stressed that the possibility of floods in the area make plans for expansion -- businesses, education or the Air National Guard --  difficult.  In order to plan for expansion and prepare the community for floods, it is critical to develop a sufficient level of protection.  The St. Joseph levee project is the key to this plan, Bond said.    As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and as one of the authors of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), Bond pledged his efforts to secure funding to complete the feasibility study and to begin pre-construction engineering and design for the St. Joseph levee.      Also, Bond emphasized the importance of the Missouri Air National Guard to St. Joseph and the surrounding community.  The Air Guard, including the Rosecrans Airport, contributes much to the community, and Bond said he will work to ensure their continued presence in St. Joseph.
