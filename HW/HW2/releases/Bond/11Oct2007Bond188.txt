COLUMBIA, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today joined Mayor Darwin Hindman and City Manager William Watkins to celebrate the grand re-opening of the Wabash Station in Columbia.   These improvements are an investment in Columbias history and future, said Bond, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that funds the Department of Transportation. Wabash Station has a long and proud history as the central rail transportation hub for Missouri. It is fitting that Wabash Station is again being used as a transportation hub.   As then Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Bond secured $2.3 million in federal funds for the Wabash Station renovations in the fiscal year 2004 Transportation spending bill. The funds helped the City of Columbia to expand the Wabash Station, repair its limestone interior, refurbish the roof, expand the passenger waiting room, and add office space, a new covered passenger platform and bicycle parking area.   Mayor Hindman said, The Wabash station renovation is exciting for Columbia, it not only preserves a wonderful historic landmark but it turns it into a modern transfer center that will greatly improve our public transportation system resulting in efficiencies and a beneficial impact on many lives. This project would not have occurred without the outstanding leadership and support of Senator Kit Bond.   The Wabash Railroad Station opened in 1910 and served as a central rail transportation hub for Mid-Missouri. Originally one of the most alluring stations in the area, a decline in passenger numbers ended passenger service in 1964. Freight service continued until the late 1970s, when a decline in the freight business forced the owners to abandon the station. The Wabash Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and purchased by the City of Columbia in 1982. ###
