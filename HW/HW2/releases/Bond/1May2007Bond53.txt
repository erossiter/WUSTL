WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today stressed the importance of the United State’s terrorist surveillance program in preventing future terrorist attacks.  Bond also noted the need for updating the old law to meet current and future technology needs.   Bond made his statement following the Senate Intelligence Committee’s hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Modernization Act of 2007. 	“The tools authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) are among the most important our government has to protect America from terrorists and other threats to our national security.  Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies face constant challenges in keeping pace with rapidly changing technologies.  Congress must do its part by ensuring that the tools provided in FISA are compatible with these technologies.     	“Today’s hearing provided valuable evidence of the need to modernize FISA without delay.  Congress must act quickly on the FISA legislation proposed by the Administration.” 						# # #
