SPRINGFIELD, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that he is accepting applications for the U. S. Service Academies for the class entering in 2007.  Nominations to the Air Force, West Point, Merchant Marine, and Naval Academies are available for qualified applicants.   	“The United States Service Academies offer the perfect opportunity to pursue an excellent education while serving your country,” said Bond.  “It takes a great deal of commitment, dedication, and leadership to make it at the academies, but the rewards are well worth the hard work.”    	The first step in the appointment process begins with a request for an application packet from a U.

The deadline for requesting an application is November 15, 2006, and all application materials must be received in the Senator’s office by December 1, 2006.    	“To keep the process as convenient as possible the complete application packet is available on my website,” said Senator Bond.  “Applicants can obtain the forms from my website, request them via email from my academy coordinator, or contact my Springfield office.”   	Nominees are chosen on the basis of personal merit.  Merit criteria include evidence of character, leadership, scholarship, physical aptitude and fitness, goals and motivation.  Students must be between 17-21 years of age, U. S. Citizens and legal residents of Missouri.   	“The Service Academies are a great opportunity for Missouri students and for the nation’s military,” said Bond.  “These students are the military leaders of tomorrow and I urge anyone who believes they meet the qualifications to apply.”   	Applications can be found on Bond’s website at  http://bond.senate.gov, be requested via email from academy coordinator Teresa Poole at teresa_poole@bond.senate.gov, or contact Bond at his Springfield office:   				Mailing: 	Senator Christopher S.
