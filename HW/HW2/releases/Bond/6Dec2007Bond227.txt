 WASHINGTON, MO  U.S. Senator Kit Bond announced today that President George W. Bush has nominated Judge Stephen Limbaugh to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.   Stephen Limbaugh is a top quality judge with the character, experience and dedication to the law we need in our courts, said Bond. I urge my colleagues to confirm him as soon as possible.    Bond praised Judge Limbaughs long record of experience. Currently, Limbaugh is a Judge on Missouris Supreme Court, where he has served since 1992, including a two-year term as Chief Justice. Judge Limbaugh has also served on the 32nd Judicial Circuit of Missouri, as a Prosecuting Attorney in Cape Girardeau County, and a partner in a private practice.     Only the President of the United States is vested with the authority to nominate formally candidates for federal posts, like judgeships, to the Senate for confirmation. However, by custom and practice, the President usually accepts and defers to recommendations for important federal posts from the leader of his party in each state, like Senator Bonds recommendation of Judge Limbaugh.   Bond stressed that he was pleased to recommend Judge Limbaugh to the Administration for consideration, and that President Bush has now chosen to nominate him for this important job.   Judge Limbaugh grew up in Cape Girardeau, where he still resides and is a well respected member of the community.     ###
