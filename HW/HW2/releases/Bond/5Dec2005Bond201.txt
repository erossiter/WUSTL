KANSAS CITY, MO – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today visited the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) to announce more than $16 million in federal funds to improve the city’s public transportation system.     	“Public transportation plays a critical role in a successful and thriving community.  People who cannot afford cars or prefer to leave them at home can access public transit to get to work, to go shopping, to eat out, or to visit the doctor,” said Bond.  “The KCATA not only provides this vital service for the health of our community, they also provide a critical component to the long-term economic growth for the region, which is why I am pleased to be able to announce an additional $16 million to help them continue their important work.”    As chairman of the Senate Transportation, Treasury, and HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Bond secured $16.15 million for the city’s public transportation system in the subcommittee’s fiscal year 2006 spending bill, recently signed into law by the President.     	The Kansas City Area Transportation Authority's (KCATA) will receive $12.3 million to fund phase II of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project, also known as the Metro Area Express, or "MAX”.  Bond was instrumental in securing more than $10 million in funds that made Phase I possible, which now links the north and south regions of Kansas City, connecting the City Market-Riverfront to Union Station/Crown Center locality, and to The Plaza region.      	KCATA will receive an additional $3.85 million in this year’s spending bill for bus maintenance, upgrades and the purchase of new vehicles.   	Long committed to Kansas City and local residents who depend on public transportation, today’s $16-plus million adds to the more than $30 million Bond has secured for Kansas City BRT planning and development and KCATA programs in previous fiscal years.
