	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Kit Bond and Jim Talent announced that their legislation to name the new courthouse in Cape Girardeau after local hero Rush H. Limbaugh Sr. passed the Senate last night tonight.     	“Rush Limbaugh Sr. was much-loved by the local community and well respected by his peers.  I am pleased the Senate acted tonight to honor a true icon,” said Senator Kit Bond, who has secured more than $55 million in federal funds for the Courthouse.     	“I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this honor," said U.S. Sen. Talent.  “No one played a more important role during the past century in Southeast Missouri and Cape Girardeau than Mr. Limbaugh.  He was a leader in his community and a leader in the practice of law and the naming of the new Federal Courthouse is a fitting way to remember his contributions to our nation.”   	Earlier this month Bond and Talent introduced legislation in the Senate to designate the new courthouse in Cape Girardeau the Rush H. Limbaugh Sr. United States Courthouse.     	Before being signed into law the Cape Courthouse legislation must pass the House of Representatives.  Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson introduced the companion legislation in the House.  					###
