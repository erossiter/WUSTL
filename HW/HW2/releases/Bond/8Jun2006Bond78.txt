WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kit Bond, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the death of terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi:   	“This is a very good day in the war on terror. The end of al-Zarqawi marks the beginning of a new era for Iraq.  	“The forces of terror in Iraq have lost their leader. Though insurgent violence will no doubt continue, today’s news is a significant blow to al-Qaeda operations in Iraq and worldwide. This is another clear indication of the progress we are making in Iraq.  	“Another sign of progress is that Iraq has completed forming its government, naming today three key ministers for defense, national security and interior affairs.   	“Al-Zarqawi’s goal was to foment division and chaos in Iraq among the different factions. He did this through terror and murder and is responsible for countless deadly attacks on American troops and innocent Iraqis, including attacks on mosques. The world will not mourn his loss.  	“We should all commend the determination of our fine men and women in the armed forces who took this killer out. American forces never let up on hunting this murderer down and now the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq is dead.”  # # #
