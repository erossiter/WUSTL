ST. LOUIS, MO - U.S. Senator Kit Bond today provided an update on recent Senate action and his 2005 legislative priorities to the Jefferson County Kiwanis Club in Festus.  Bond talked about current events and his priorities for the next year, including health care and education goals and his continuing efforts to pass a federal highway bill.    	“My job is to listen and I will continue to work with local leaders to ensure Missouri receives the resources it needs,” said Bond.  “Already this year Congress has begun to address some of the many important challenges our nation is facing but there is still much more work to be done.” 	    	Addressing the Kiwanis Club, Bond stressed that during the 109th Congress he will focus on three important issues that have an enormous impact on the quality of life and well-being of Missourians.  Expanding the Parents as Teachers program, doubling the number of people served in Community Health Centers, and passing a federal highway bill are three domestic priorities on the top of Bond’s list for 2005.     Bond, who serves as chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee as well as chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations subcommittee, led the fight in the Senate to reauthorize a transportation bill.  Under the six-year, $284 billion Senate bill, Missouri will gain a total of $4.96 billion, including an additional $1 billion in new highway funds, a nearly 25 percent increase in overall highway funding.              Also, Missouri will also see an increase in its return on the dollars it pays in federal transportation taxes. Under the bill, Missouri will receive 98 cents on the dollar, up from 90.5 under current law and up from 76 cents in 1987 when Bond first entered the Senate.          Bond also stressed to the local Kiwanis Club the need to support President Bush and the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Bond praised his colleagues for passing the President’s supplemental request, which will pay for a number of vital priorities, including military and intelligence operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the War on Terror, new equipment, improved health care for our troops and enhanced survivor benefits.      	Another top priority for Congress, Bond said, is the need to reform Social Security.  Bond told the group that current retirees and anyone born before 1950 will see no change in their Social Security benefits.  However, every system can be improved, and seniors’ knowledge and experience is essential if Social Security is to be strengthened for the future.    	“Times have changed, but Social Security remains the same.  We owe it to our children to change with the times,” said Bond.
