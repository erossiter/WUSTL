WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Kit Bond today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor approved more than $1 million in federal assistance for workers, businesses and communities who were hurt by the closure of key military facilities in St. Louis and Kansas City.          The Commissions decision in 2005 to close key facilities in St. Louis and Kansas City were not in our military, or nations, best interest. Todays funding is a critical step in helping these communities recover from that loss, said Bond.          The U.S. Department of Labor will provide a $1,040,969 National Emergency Grant to the Missouri Division of Workforce to help workers, businesses, and communities impacted by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). The grant will assist St. Louis and Kansas City communities. The funds will be used to implement an effective workforce investment system response to the 2005 BRAC closures and will provide access to employment and training service.          In 2005, Bond testified before the Commission on behalf of Missouris military installations. Bond criticized the Commission for their recommendations to close Missouris Lambert Field, the Human Resource Center (HRC) facilities in St. Louis, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) center in Kansas City. Bond, who voted against BRAC, stressed that the Commission refused to take in to consideration the impact their recommendations would have on Missouri communities, overall homeland security principles and cost savings.          As Co-Chair of the Senates National Guard Caucus, Bond also spearheaded efforts to bring the Guards concerns before BRAC. He criticized the lack of coordination between the Air Force and the Air National Guard as the Air Force developed its Future Total Force strategy, which became the basis for many of the BRAC recommendations.
