Kansas City, MO   Senator Kit Bond announced today the United States Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration has approved $1.8 million for infrastructure improvements for the Freight House District redevelopment in Kansas City.   The local redevelopment plans expect to create at least 200 new jobs within the District.   “The progress in downtown Kansas City is creating jobs, economic development and true excitement for the residents of our community,” said Bond.  “This investment will help provide the critical infrastructure needed for future development and job creation in the area.”    The Freight House District project includes upgrades to the separate storm and sanitary sewer systems, replacing undersized water lines, reconstruction of streets, reconstruction of sidewalks, and installation of lighting and crosswalks in the District.  The Freight House District, along with the IRS Service Center Project and the Crossroads District have created an economic rejuvenation for the area surrounding Union Station.       “It is my job to work on behalf of the local leaders who are on the ground making a difference in their community,” said Bond.  “This investment will help the local efforts expand economic opportunities in the region.”       The planned improvements will address local flooding that has affected the area for many years.   The flooding has negatively impacted local restaurants and buildings, while hindering future development.  According to local officials, plans call for 600,000 square feet of residential, commercial and retail space with an investment of approximately $60 million.
