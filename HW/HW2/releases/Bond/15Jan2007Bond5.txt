Cape Girardeau, MO – Calling him the “conscience of a nation”, U.S. Senator Kit Bond today remembered the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King.  Bond planned to attend the Humanitarian Luncheon Benefit held in Cape Girardeau in honor of the civil rights leader today, but was unable due to the winter storms that hit Missouri this week.     	“It is important to remember again the legacy Dr. King left us,” said Bond. “It is a strong, deep legacy that keeps challenging America to live up to its promise to all its citizens, regardless of their color, religion or background.”      	Bond said Dr. King served as the conscience of a nation falling short of its full promise.       	“Dr. King’s challenge to America was powerful because it was simple,” said Bond. “He demanded equality for all. He demanded equality under the law, equality in the courts and equality in the schools.”     	Bond also remembered his early days as a young lawyer in the mid-1960s clerking for Judge Elbert Tuttle on the Fifth Circuit Court in Atlanta.     	From that position, Bond was able to see first–hand some of the heroes who were tested during the civil rights movement. The 5th Circuit dealt with many civil rights issues, Bond noted.     	In Judge Tuttle’s obituary, it was said “Under Tuttle’s leadership, the 5th Circuit became a trailblazing court that transformed the bare-bones decision of the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision into a broad mandate for racial justice.”    	“Like Dr. King, Judge Tuttle stood up for what was right, in the face of opposition, at a cost to him personally,” said Bond. “These courageous men and others who followed them helped break down racial barriers and helped Americans achieve their dreams regardless of their color or background.”       	“Even nearly 40 years after Dr. King’s tragic death, we still have more work to do to get where we need to be,” said Bond.
