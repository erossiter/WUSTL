WASHINTON, DC – U.S. Senator Kit Bond today sent a letter to the President asking for quick approval of the Governor’s request for a disaster declaration for the Missouri communities hit hard by recent storms.    From January 12 – 14, 2007, severe winter storms hit a number of Missouri communities.  Today, Governor Matt Blunt requested a disaster declaration for the 34 hardest-hit counties in the state.      Bond stressed that approval of today’s request will help state and local governments begin recovery from this winter disaster. The text of the letter is attached.   ###   January 15, 2007   The Honorable George W. Bush  President  The White House  Washington, DC 20005   Dear Mr. President:        Governor Matt Blunt, on January 15, 2007, requested an expedited disaster declaration for the State of Missouri as a result of the winter storm which moved through Missouri January 12 through January 14, 2007.   I urge your speedy approval of this declaration request, and of the additional counties expected to be added to the list needing assistance.               The Governor has requested 34 counties in the disaster request.  The I-44 corridor running from Oklahoma to Springfield to St. Louis was the hardest hit.  The amount of damage caused by the winter storm is significant throughout the affected area.  Large amounts of debris resulting from the storm have hindered life safety actions, utility restoration and transportation.  As a result, Governor Blunt has determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that an effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments.               It is my hope that you will grant Governor Blunt's request promptly, to help state and local governments recover from this disaster.  Along with my fellow Missourians, I eagerly await your decision on this request for assistance.                                                                 Sincerely,                                                                  Christopher S. Bond
