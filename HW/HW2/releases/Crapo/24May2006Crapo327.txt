 WASHINGTON  D C     Idaho Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo highlighted a recent study by the Dartmouth Atlas Project that looks at the cost to care for patients with severe chronic illnesses compared with the results for patients   The study found that Medicare could save 30 percent on chronic illness and actually improve medical care                    In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt  Idaho Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo highlighted a recent study by the Dartmouth Atlas Project  www dartmouthatlas org  that looks at the cost to care for patients with severe chronic illnesses compared with the results for patients   The study found that Medicare could save 30 percent on chronic illness and actually improve medical care   According to the Project   s website     The focus of the new study is the care of Medicare beneficiaries with one or more of twelve chronic illnesses that accounts for more than 75  of all U S  health care expenditures  Among people who died between 1999 and 2003  per capita spending varied by a factor of six between hospitals across the country      The report concluded     Almost one third of Medicare spending for chronically ill is unnecessary      Improving care could also lower costs                     Craig and Crapo noted that the report listed Idaho as one of states with the lowest expenditures for Medicare patients with chronic illnesses   While one might initially consider this a negative  the report documents that the states with the lowest expenditures  number of doctor visits  etc  actually had better outcomes for the patients                    In the letter  the Senators wrote     Our home state of Idaho had the lowest expenditure rate in the nation at just over  23 000 per patient compared with New Jersey  which had the highest  at nearly  40 000 per patient       What is most interesting and worthy of attention in our judgment is the fact that neither the higher per patient expenditures  nor the increased physician visits were associated with any improved outcomes for Medicare patients  In fact  just the opposite appears to be the case   The report found that    greater use   appears to be associated with worse outcomes  poorer quality and lower satisfaction                        The Senators go on to point out that Medicare is the largest entitlement expense of the federal government  and is expected to only become larger  stating that Medicare is set to     saddle the next generation of Americans with a fiscal challenge that will necessitate draconian cuts in all federal programs or a massive tax increase                     The Senators end the letter asking the Secretary to use this report to take bold action on Medicare reform  focusing efforts on promoting good health and on    evidence based medicine with strong performance and accountability standards to ensure the best outcomes for all patients
