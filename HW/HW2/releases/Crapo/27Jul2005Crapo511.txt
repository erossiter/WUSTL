 Washington  DC     Citing an immediate concern with the scheduled expiration of millions of acres under Conservation Reserve Program  CRP  contract between 2007 and 2010  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry  Conservation  and Rural Revitalization  held a hearing today to discuss the long term direction of CRP  including how to deal with expiring contracts and reenrollments and the effect of the CRP on rural economies     The Conservation Reserve Program is the United States    largest conservation program both in acres enrolled and dollars spent   Enrolling in CRP is voluntary and offers payments to landowners and farmers for taking highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land out of production for 10 to 15 years   Some witnesses who testified at today   s hearing praised the program for providing habitat for species as well as support for landowners   Others raised concerns that retiring land in rural  largely agricultural communities is negatively impacting local economies by resulting in fewer farmers and farm supply businesses in those areas     CRP has been credited as a major tool for the restoration of threatened and endangered species across the U S   including salmon and the sharp tailed grouse in Idaho   During  the hearing  Crapo expressed the importance of developing tools to quantify the benefits of conservation programs        I have often said the Farm Bill contains some of our most important environmental programs     said Crapo      The CRP program  like other conservation programs  has helped producers protect wetlands  water quality and wildlife habitat  while meeting environmental standards   It is important to periodically review these programs to ensure that they are meeting the goals that they are intending to and benefiting farm communities        The U S  Department of Agriculture has received more than 5 000 comments regarding how to address the number of CRP contracts expiring and other CRP related issues   The department   s Farm Service Agency  FSA  is currently analyzing all public comments and expects to announce policy and procedures regarding CRP re enrollment later this year   Last week  the FSA announced it would extend some contracts for one year
