 Island Park  Idaho     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo will join with a partnership of nearly a dozen work group members on Wednesday to announce plans to restore access to pristine Yellowstone cutthroat trout spawning habitat above Henry   s Lake   Crapo and the work group  which includes local Boy Scouts  the Henry   s Lake Foundation and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition  will announce a construction project to replace culverts that have blocked Yellowstone cutthroats from moving into spawning beds for several years        News conference   Wednesday  August 10th  at 11 30 a m  Mountain  At the Targhee Culvert  located one half mile north of the junction of U S  Highway 20 and Idaho Highway 87         For interested media  video and digital pictures of the event will be available  please contact Lindsay Nothern at  208 870 1800 for details       The flow of water into Henry   s Lake through the culverts on Targhee and Howard Creeks has eroded the streambed below the culverts and blocked fish movement  making it necessary to net and transport fish around the blockage   Board members of the Henry   s Lake Foundation  local Boy Scouts  Fish and Game staff  and many volunteers annually make repeated efforts to move the fish into spawning habitat   Notably  Targhee Creek alone accounts for about 70 percent of the naturally spawned cutthroat trout in Henry   s Lake          These Yellowstone cutthroats are the same fish that fed members of the Lewis and Clark expedition     Crapo said      Some groups have expressed concern about Yellowstone cutthroat trout with regard to the Endangered Species Act   We all well know that water and endangered species issues can become extremely difficult and divisive   It is appropriate that we would celebrate the Corps of Discovery   s 200th anniversary with a project that will go a long ways toward preventing such problems for these important fish             It is also important to note the considerable effort led by the Idaho Transportation Department  the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the Henry   s Lake Foundation to successfully adapt to this situation     Crapo concluded      In crunching what could have been seven year construction plan into an expedited one year project  they have been adaptable to a changing need and that will contribute greatly to the success that will come once the culverts are replaced with a bridge   I am encouraged that government agencies with plans and programs already in place were able to collaborate with interested groups and come up with a flexible solution to a problem          Crapo and the group have worked to replace the culverts with a new bridge span over Targhee Creek   The bridge will restore a natural free flowing streambed  allowing the fish to migrate normally  The plan has the backing of work group members including the Idaho Transportation Department  Idaho Fish and Game  the Greater Yellowstone Coalition  U S  Forest Service  Natural Resource and Conservation Service  Henry   s Fork Foundation  and the High Country Resource Conservation   Development   Construction on the bridge will start after Labor Day with a planned finish later this year
