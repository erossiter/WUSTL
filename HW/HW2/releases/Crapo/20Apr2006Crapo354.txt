 Washington  DC     A proposal to merge the mail distribution center in Twin Falls with the one in Boise faces opposition from the Idaho Congressional delegation  In a letter to the United States Postal Service  USPS   the delegation expressed concern over the economic impact of the proposal  timely mail delivery and service availability for the people who rely on the Twin Falls Center        The proposal would reassign or transfer 30 35 employees from the Twin Falls Pioneer Station mail processing center to the Boise facility or other postal responsibilities in the Twin Falls area   Closing the center  which process between 50 000 80 000 pieces of mail for 30 post offices daily  could affect the timeliness of mail delivery to the area         Senator Mike Crapo said     Twin Falls is a leader in economic development in the state and closing this center could hinder that progress   Government should be doing all it can to help foster economic growth rather than hindering it   Not only does this center provide efficient mail delivery  but it does its part in allowing area post offices to provide quality service to customers in the Magic valley          Senator Larry Craig said     The Magic Valley is one of the fastest growing regions in Idaho  so the need for high quality mail services will only increase in the future   Moving the Twin Falls processing operation to Boise would be very shortsighted and a big blow to the area economy   We want to ensure the Postal Service recognizes that and considers some alternatives          Congressman Mike Simpson said   It is my hope that the United States Postal Service will listen to our request and keep the Twin Falls Pioneer Station open  The station provides a service that is imperative to residents  not only in Twin Falls  but to all of the surrounding rural areas in the Magic Valley
