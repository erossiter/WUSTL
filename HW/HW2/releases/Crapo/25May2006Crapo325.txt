 Washington  DC     Nearly two years of negotiations culminated today with unanimous Senate passage of legislation to provide regulatory improvements in the financial services industry   The measure  authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  brings regulations up to date and in line with current technology and practices   S  2856  The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006  is a bipartisan bill that was unanimously approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month   Crapo  a member of the Committee  has been the Senate leader in prompting reforms in the financial services industry that will ultimately improve customer services      In heralding the passage  Crapo said     This bill is a balanced approach that carefully guards the safety and soundness of the financial services system  protects the interests of consumers  and reduces the burden of compliance with a host of laws that add unnecessary costs to the delivery of financial services to the American public   The regulatory burdens imposed on the financial services industry have grown over time   Some of these requirements have become obsolete or unnecessary  This legislation will lessen the regulatory burden  so banks  thrifts  and credit unions can better serve their customers and communities          Over the last two years  Crapo has led the Senate Banking Committee has held three hearings with numerous witnesses to move from the general objective of creating reform to specific proposals that achieve this result   Among the provisions included in the bill are       1  Regulation B Relief   The Securities and Exchange Commission   s  SEC  proposed Regulation B has sparked broad opposition from Members of Congress  the Federal banking agencies  and the banking industry   If implemented in its current form  Regulation B would force banks and thrifts to push out traditional banking activities such as custodial and trust services to securities affiliates or discontinue such services altogether   The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 directs the SEC to consult with and seek the concurrence of the federal banking agencies in implementing the exceptions to the definition of broker under Section 201 of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act     GLBA       In addition  it specifies that no rules previously issued by the SEC on this subject  including Regulation B  shall have any force or effect   If any Federal banking agency objects to the SEC   s final rule  it may seek review of the rule in the D C  Circuit Court  with deference granted to neither the SEC nor the Federal banking agency         2  Development of Simplified Model Privacy Forms   This section directs regulatory agencies to develop a model privacy notice to satisfy the requirements of GLBA that is succinct  comprehensible and enables consumers to compare privacy practices among financial institutions   A financial institution that elects to provide the model form developed by the agencies would be deemed in compliance with the disclosures required under Section 503 of GLBA       3  Collateral Modernization   This provision allows the Treasury Department to determine the types of securities that may be pledged in lieu of surety bonds and requires that the securities by valued at current market rates   This improved regulatory flexibility will allow banks to offer their customers options to meet pledging requirements  reduce administrative costs  and free up capital for more efficient uses such as lending  investments or dividends to shareholders       In addition to these items  the bill also contains items that provide relief for community banks and credit unions   For community banks  these items include provisions that        direct the Federal banking agencies to review the call report every five years to delete items that are no longer relevant       increase asset size eligibility for an 18 month exam cycle for well rated  well capitalized banks from  250 million to  500 million       increase the exemption from the management interlocks restriction from  20 million in assets to  50 million  and       eliminate duplicative oversight and disparate treatment of savings associations under the federal securities laws by providing the same exemptions for savings associations that are currently available to banks with respect to investment adviser and broker dealer activities      For credit unions  the bill includes provisions that        allow credit unions to negotiate for nominal land rents on military installations       increase the current 12   year maturity loan limit for credit unions to 15 years       allow credit unions to provide basic check cashing and wire transfer services to anyone in their field of membership  and      update the
