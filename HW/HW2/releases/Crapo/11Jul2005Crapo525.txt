 Washington  DC   Five Idaho schools will have twenty five U S  Senate computers for the coming school year  courtesy of Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and the Senate  Computers for Schools  program   The program helps public schools take advantage of current technology by channeling excess federal computer equipment to public schools           Technology training and computer skills are a vital part of our education system   Crapo said    In a rapidly changing job sector  these skills are increasingly necessary to thrive in our economy   Placing these computers in Idaho schools gives students access to a vital tool  and better prepares them to compete and contribute to a complex job market         The following schools  selected based on need using Title 1 criteria  will each receive five computers        Kamiah High School   Orofino Elementary School   Avery Elementary Junior High School   Lake Pend Oreille School District   Bonners Ferry High School   Avery Technology Director Dale Johnson said   Our students and teachers need these computers to learn skills  for Internet research  as well as for learning in math  reading  science and social studies   Technology tools in their hands have a huge impact on the quality of learning and teaching that takes place in our schools  and we are very appreciative of this kind donation         Orofino Schools Superintendent Al Arzen said   Our school greatly appreciates these computers and thanks Senator Crapo for all his hard work in securing these for our students and teachers         The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1997 authorized the Senate to participate in the program  which allows the U S  Senate Sergeant at Arms  SAA  to transfer educationally useful surplus equipment to public schools   The computers  which the Senate no longer uses due to routine equipment upgrades  remain in excellent condition and are ideal for use in public schools        The SAA notifies Senators on a seniority basis of eligibility and provides a list of public schools in each state who have registered and can participate in the program   The SAA  in conjunction with UPS  ships the computers to the selected schools   The schools that were allocated computers this year will receive them before school begins this fall   Schools interested in participating in the program may register on the General Services Administration website at  http   www computers fed gov
