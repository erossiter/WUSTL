 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said recent debate in our nation   s capitol reflects once again the power of the U S  Constitution  which turns 219 years old this week   September 17th is generally regarded as Constitution Day  but Crapo noted the entire week provides a good opportunity to reflect on how relevant our governing document has been over the more than 200 years it has been the benchmark of individual freedoms and liberty     Crapo worked with Idaho schools and the Idaho Department of Education to distribute informational packages about U S  civics  including information about the Constitution   He also spoke with students about the issue and devoted time during his monthly    Capitol Watch    program to promote study of the Constitution   The packages went to every high school in the state to commemorate Constitution Day        This past year  we   ve heard much about the    constitutionality    of programs or actions taken by the Administration or Congress   Just in the past six months  people have put the constitutionality question to a number of legislative actions  executive orders and administrative rules     Crapo said        These national conversations eventually return to one standard  our Constitution   One entire branch of our government is devoted to interpreting the Constitution  making decisions about whether our laws   instruments of stability  safety and order   are allowed by our government   s founding document   And  perhaps most remarkably  the Constitution has withstood the test of time and massive change in our society and way of life   In 217 years  we have transformed from a predominately agrarian  isolated economy and society  through the industrial revolution to a world of computers and the phenomenon of high speed instantaneous worldwide communication  accessible to most anyone in the developed and developing world                                            Our Constitution gives us tools to apply the tenets of a free society to daily governance  and orchestrates the administration of the rule of law   Our freedoms are guaranteed precisely because we adhere to this rule of law  and is why our Constitution remains entirely relevant today     Crapo added      I can think of no more compelling reason to celebrate the birthday of our Constitution
