 Washington  DC  Late Thursday  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted in favor of H R  6  the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  commonly referred to as the Energy Bill  The bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of 86 8  The Senate amended the House version of the bill  which was passed on December 6     The Senate amendment strikes a tax package that would have increased taxes on domestic oil and gas producers to pay for incentives for renewable power  energy efficiency  electric vehicles and other technologies  Senator Crapo strongly supported the incentives for alternative energy resources  many of which he championed through he Finance Committee  but opposed paying for those incentives by increasing taxes on domestic oil and gas producers     This is not an either or proposition  Crapo said  We must address the growing energy demand of our country with both a firm and long term commitment to promoting investment in alternative energy sources such as wind  solar  geothermal and nuclear power with increased incentives  research and development  However  we must do this while maintaining strong domestic production of more traditional energy resources such as oil  natural gas  and coal based electricity  I remain hopeful that we can work to achieve this with an energy tax bill in the current Congress  As we all see daily when filling up our cars and paying our electric bills  we are facing real and increasing constraints on our energy supply and it is resulting in higher energy costs by the day  We simply cannot meet those needs by decreasing conventional energy production in the US  which would further our dependency on foreign energy supplies and dramatically increase costs for the gasoline and electricity we use every day     The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 would      Increase corporate average fuel economy  CAF  or automobile mileage standards  standards for cars and light trucks by about 40 percent to reach 35 miles per gallon by 2020the first increase of fuel efficiency standards in 32 years     Expand the national biofuels mandate to up to 36 billion gallons annually by 2022     Increase building and appliance energy efficiency standards     Senate leadership also removed a provision from the bill that would have forced all states to generate 15 percent of their power from renewable energy sources     The bill now heads back to the House of Representatives  If it passes the House  without amendment  it will go the President for signature
