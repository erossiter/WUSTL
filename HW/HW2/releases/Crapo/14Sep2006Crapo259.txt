 Washington  DC     On a vote of 98 to 0  legislation overwhelmingly passed by the U S  Senate today to upgrade port security is a reflection of the Senate   s ongoing commitment to improve security conditions for all Americans  while protecting the needs of our trade dependant economy  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo  a member of the Senate trade and export committees  says Senators are working on the real security and economic needs of our ports in reasoned trade and travel conscious ways        There is much debate over what the provisions to improve port security will look like  and this legislation seeks to make the necessary security and commercial improvements at U S  ports that homeland security experts have outlined     Crapo said      Toward this end  Idaho has a big role to play   I have great hopes that Idaho State University   s Idaho Accelerator Center and the ongoing research there will play an important part in our port security future        Crapo noted that the measure would require radiation detectors to be used on cargo entering the U S   increase security procedures for port employees  establish new security grants for ports to upgrade infrastructure  and develop a comprehensive approach to improving the security of the trade flows through our nation   s facilities   He also said that effort could one day include the fruits of research conducted in Idaho        ISU has people working full time on federal research that includes homeland security and port security studies on devices that could one day help us to see inside shipping containers like those sent to our ports   For this and for many reasons  the debate about port security is healthy for our nation and healthy for Idaho        The bill  H R  4954  the Port Security Act  must now be reconciled with the House passed version before it can be presented to the President for his signature
