 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo released the following statement regarding the upcoming regulatory relief legislation mark up later this week           Today marks the culmination of many months of hard work to bring industry  regulators  consumer groups and other interested parties together on a measure that will provide regulatory relief for financial institutions   The Senate Banking Committee will hold a mark up on The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 on Thursday morning  and I am pleased with the result           Nearly two years ago  we started with a long wish list of reforms advocated by various groups    That list has been winnowed down to 70 items that will reduce the regulatory burdens faced by industry and passed along to consumers   Among the most significant reforms are        Reg B relief   This section directs the SEC to consult with and seek the concurrence of the Federal banking agencies in implementing rules under Section 201 of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act   In addition  this section specifies that such rulemaking shall supersede any existing proposed or final rules issued by the SEC   Reg B has sparked broad opposition from Members of Congress  the Federal banking agencies  and the banking industry  Reg B  if implemented in its current form  would lead to the very result that Congress sought explicitly to avoid  i e   the establishment of a burdensome regulatory maze that would  lead banks and thrifts to stop offering these products to their customers    Section 101    Collateral modernization   This section would protect taxpayers    interests by allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the types of securities that may be pledged in lieu of surety bonds  and require that the securities be valued at current market rates   Additionally  the improved regulatory flexibility will allow banks greater options to meet pledging requirements  freeing up capital for more efficient uses such as lending  investments  or returning capital to shareholders    Section 901     Monetary policy provisions   Two sections deal with monetary policy and will enhance the Federal Reserve   s ability to efficiently conduct monetary policy   These provisions allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at Reserve Banks  and grant the Federal Reserve greater flexibility in setting the reserve requirements for depository institutions    Sections 201 and 202     Development of model privacy forms  This section directs the agencies to finalize a proposal to make privacy notices to consumers more readable and understandable    Section 728       It has been a rewarding challenge to work on this issue for the last eighteen months   Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes have been terrific to work with on this issue as we tried to reach consensus   It has been important to me to bring together the reforms that will make a difference to the industry   Since the House has already passed a regulatory reform bill  it has been my goal to get to conference with legislation passed by the Senate before the end of the 109th Congress   With the measure now slotted for mark up  we should be able to reach that and get legislation signed into law before the year is out           A copy of the section by section of the measure accompanies this news release        Section by section Analysis of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006      Section 101      This section directs the SEC to consult with and seek the concurrence of the Federal banking agencies in implementing rules under Section 201 of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act   In addition  this section specifies that such rulemaking shall supersede any existing proposed or final rules issued by the SEC       Section 201      This section authorizes the payment of interest on balances held by depository institutions at a Federal reserve bank       Section 202      This section provides the Federal Reserve with greater flexibility to set the ratio of reserves a depository institution must maintain against its transaction accounts  allowing a zero reserve ratio  if appropriate       Section 301      This section permits a national bank to provide in its articles of association which method of electing its directors best suits its business goals and needs     a national bank could choose whether to allow cumulative voting  which is mandated by the current law       Section 302      This section provides more flexibility than current law to a national bank to pay dividends as deemed appropriate by its board of directors   Consistent with safety and soundness  the amendment retains the current requirements that OCC approval is necessary if the dividend exceeds a certain amount   These same dividend approval requirements also apply to State member banks except the FRB and not the OCC is the approval authority       Section 303      This section gives the OCC the same removal authority as the other banking agencies to remove an institution affiliated party  IAP  from the banking business         Section 304      This section deletes references to two obsolete provisions regarding capital requirements  but would make no changes to the requirements that a national bank cannot reduce its capital unless approved by two thirds of its shareholders and by the OCC  technical amendment        Section 401      This section amends the definitions of bank and applicable regulatory agency to include expressly savings associations and the OTS  respectively  thereby subjecting such associations to the same investment adviser and broker dealer registration requirements as banks        Section 402      This section eliminates a cap on the valuation of purchased mortgage servicing rights at 90  of fair value and thereby permits savings associations to value PMSRs  for purposes of certain capital and leverage requirements  at more than 90  up to 100  of fair market value  if the banking agencies jointly find that doing so would not have an adverse effect on the insurance funds or the safety and soundness of insured institutions  consistent with section 475 of FDICIA  as amended by section 1208 of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000  Pub  L  No  106 569        Section 403      This section expressly

loans to 15 years       Section 503      This section expands current check selling and cashing authority to persons eligible for membership  and allows Federal credit unions to receive EFTs for anyone eligible to become a member       Section 504      This section redefines regulatory capital to address unintended consequences of impending FASB rule change   The new FASB rule would apply purchase accounting to credit union mergers with the unintended result that the merging credit union   s capital would not flow forward as capital to the combined continuing credit union  pre merger    retained earnings     capital  becomes post merger    acquired equity     not capital     To follow both the new FASB rule while still allowing the capital of both credit unions to flow forward as regulatory capital and thus preserve the incentive for desirable credit union mergers  the redefinition of regulatory capital for purposes of prompt corrective action is necessary         Section 601      This section repeals the requirements that       executive officers of banks report to their board of directors indebtedness to other banks       each bank must update its report of covered loans to executive officers as of each report of condition  and      executive officers and principal shareholders report to their board of directors  loans from correspondent banks       Section 602      This section provides parallel investment authority for banks and thrifts to participate in both bank service companies and thrift service companies  while preserving existing activity limits and maximum investment rules  as well as the roles of the Federal regulatory agencies with respect to subsidiary activities of the institutions under their primary jurisdiction        Section 603      This section permits banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System to count as reserves the deposits in other banks that are    passed through    by those banks to the Federal Reserve as required reserve balances   Nonmember banks already are able to use such pass through reserve accounts         Section 604      This section directs all federal banking agencies to conduct a review of

the examination cycle provision from  250 million to  500 million       Section 606      This section eliminates the requirement that the responsible agency request a competitive factors report from the other Federal banking agencies   It also requires the responsible agency to request a report from the Attorney General and provide a copy of the request to the FDIC  when the FDIC is not the responsible agency        This section also exempts merger transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates  which are generally accepted as not presenting any competitive issues  from competitive factors review by the Attorney General and other banking agencies and the post approval waiting period       Section 607      This section provides that when a depository institution submits information to a Federal  State  or foreign bank regulator as part of the supervisory process  the institution does not waive any privilege it may claim with respect to that information       Section 608      This section clarifies that conversions  which result in more than one bank  would continue to require deposit insurance applications from the resulting institutions  as well as review and approval by the appropriate Federal banking agency   In addition  the amendment would clarify that no applications under the Bank Merger Act would be required for such conversions       Section 609      This section exempts certified public accountants from compliance with the disclosure requirements of section 503 a  of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act       Section 610      This section increases the small depository institution exemption limit under DIMIA from  20 million in assets to  50 million in assets   Unless the institutions have less than  20 million in assets  DIMIA currently prohibits a management official of one institution from serving as a management official of any other nonaffiliated depository institution or depository institution holding company if the institutions or an affiliate of such institutions have offices that are located in the same MSA   The amendment would increase this exemption threshold to  50 million in assets         Section 611      This section allows depository institution subsidiaries of an FHC to engage in cross marketing activities with portfolio companies that are held under the GLB Act   s merchant banking authority to the same extent as such activities are currently permissible for portfolio companies held under the GLB Act   s insurance company investment authority         Section 701      This section provides greater consistency in Federal law governing how much time is available to challenge the determination by the OCC to appoint a receiver for a national bank by expressly providing for a 30 day period for a party to judicially challenge a determination by the OCC to appoint a receiver for a national bank         This section amends the Bank Conservation Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide greater consistency regarding the time an insured depository institution has to challenge the appointment of a receiver       Section 702      This section clarifies the discretionary authority of the Federal banking agencies to enforce  1  any condition imposed in writing in connection with any action on any application  notice  or other request  or  2  any written agreement between the agency and an IAP  particularly those in which an IAP or controlling shareholder agrees to provide capital to the depository institution  without showing unjust enrichment or limiting recovery to 5  of the institution   s assets at the time it became undercapitalized   Also  this section clarifies existing FDIC authority as receiver or conservator to enforce written conditions or agreements   This section eliminates the requirement that the insured depository institution receiving the transfer be undercapitalized at the time of the transfer         Section 703      This section clarifies the scope of cross guarantee liability to include all insured depository institutions commonly controlled by the same company       Section 704      This section clarifies that authority to prohibit golden parachute payments includes nonbank holding companies  as well as depository institution holding companies       Section 705      This section amends the Change in Bank Control Act to clarify the bases for which change in control notices may be disapproved and to expand the bases for extensions of time for consideration of certain notices raising novel or significant issues         Section 706      This section permits the Board to waive the attribution rule in section 2 g  2  of the BHC Act  12 U S C  1841 g  2   in appropriate circumstances   This attribution rule currently provides that  for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act  a company is deemed in all circumstances to own or control any shares that are held by a trust  such as an employee benefit plan  for the benefit of the company or its shareholders or employees       Section 707      This section gives all Federal banking agencies the same discretionary authority as the FRB has to share confidential supervisory information       Section 708      This section clarifies that the appropriate Federal banking agency may suspend or prohibit individuals charged with certain crimes from participation in the affairs of any depository institution and not solely the insured depository institution with which the institution affiliated party is or was associated   This section further clarifies that the section 8 g  remedy may be imposed even where the institution with which the individuals were associated ceases to exist   The proposed amendment also allows the appropriate Federal banking agency to suspend or remove an individual who attempts to become involved in the affairs of an insured depository institution after being charged with a crime involving dishonesty or a breach of trust and clarifies the standards and process for issuing a suspension or removal order in situations where an individual terminates his or her affiliation with one depository institution after being charged with a crime  but then becomes or seeks to become affiliated with another           Section 709      This section provides that a Federal banking agency may not be compelled to disclose information received from a foreign regulatory or supervisory authority if public disclosure of the information would violate the laws applicable to that authority and the agency obtained the information in connection with the administration and enforcement of Federal banking laws or under a memorandum of understanding between the authority and the agency   This section also provides that such information would be exempt under FOIA  but does not authorize an agency to withhold information from Congress or in response to a court order       Section 710      This section extends the prohibition to include noninsured national and State member banks and uninsured offices of foreign banks  but the OCC would have authority with respect to noninsured national banks and Federal branches and agencies and the FRB with respect to noninsured State member banks and State branches and agencies         This section prohibits a person convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty  breach of trust or money laundering from participating in the affairs of a bank holding company  other than a foreign bank  or an Edge or Agreement Corporation without the consent of the Board   The amendment also would provide the Board greater discretion to prevent convicted individuals from participating in the affairs of a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company       Section 711       This section would           Underscore authority of the State regulators for the institutions that they charter  i e     home    State regulators        Require both the home and host State bank supervisors to exercise authority in compliance with the applicable cooperative agreements  thus encouraging coordination among the States       Unless otherwise provided in a cooperative agreement  allow only a home State to assess supervisory fees on the banks it charters       Authorize the host State supervisor  upon written notice to the home State  to examine for compliance with applicable host State laws subject to the terms of any applicable cooperative agreement with the home State    Replaces a blanket authorization for the host State supervisor to examine for compliance with host State laws without regard to the home State supervisor        For the purposes of safety and soundness supervision  clarify that the chartering State is the primary State supervisor and limit host State supervisors to the express terms of any applicable cooperative agreement   However  host States may act unilaterally and examine the branch of an out of state State bank if that bank is determined to be    troubled     i e   a 4 or 5 CAMELS rating        Authorize a host State supervisor to enforce applicable host State law  subject to the terms of any cooperative agreement and with written notice to the home State supervisor       Section 712      This section authorizes the Treasury Secretary to appoint one or more individuals within the OTS to serve as OTS Acting Director

a notice or an order   This section also makes a parallel amendment to the FCU Act       Section 716      This section amends section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to clarify authority to enforce conditions imposed in connection with a notice  including a change in control notice   Section 206 of the FCU Act has parallel sections to portions of Section 8 of the FDI Act   It also amends the FCU Act in the same manner as the FDI Act       Section 717      This section amends section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide each of the other three appropriate Federal banking agencies with express authority to enforce conditions imposed in writing in connection with the approval of an institution   s application for deposit insurance       Section 718      This section requires the consent of the receiver or conservator before a party to a contract to which the depository institution is a party could exercise any right or power to terminate  accelerate  or declare a default under any contract  or to obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of the institution or affect any contractual rights of the institution       This section also requires the consent of the receiver or conservator before a party to a contract to which the credit union is a party could exercise any right or power to terminate  accelerate  or declare a default under any contract  or to obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of the credit union or affect any contractual rights of the credit union       Section 719      This section amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to define an FDIC request for FICO scores as part of its preparation for a resolution as a permissible purpose  enabling the FDIC to obtain FICO scores by contacting credit reporting agencies and to obtain current consumer credit reports       This section amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to define a NCUA request for FICO scores as part of its preparation for a

    This section directs the agencies to finalize a proposal for a uniform simplified privacy notice to satisfy the requirements of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act       Section 801      Background   Over five hundred State or district attorneys across the country operate pre trial diversion programs for alleged bad check offenders so that those individuals can avoid criminal prosecution if they voluntarily participate in these programs   These programs have been in operation for over twenty years   The programs typically require restitution to the harmed merchant  a class designed to discourage the writing of bad checks in the future  and the payment of a fee to cover the class and the administrative burden on the State or district attorneys  The average restitution rate of those that participate in these programs is below 5  nationally  and in some states  such as Maryland  is approximately 1    While the contact between the State or district attorneys and the alleged offenders incidentally involves restitution to the harmed merchants  the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  FDCPA  does not apply to these activities due to its state actor exemption       In some instances  however  the State or District attorneys contract with private entities to help administer these programs and several lawsuits have been filed contending that the private entities are in violation of the FDCPA   This provision amends the FDCPA to exempt those entities provided they comply with the safeguards outlined in the provision         Section 901 a  adds a new Section 818 to the FDCPA   Section 818 a  authorizes State or district attorneys to establish bad check pre trial diversion programs and enter into an administrative support services contract with private entities to administer the programs  The private entities are required to operate under the direction  supervision  and control of the State or district attorneys and in the course of performing their duties must         A  comply with the penal laws of the state in which they operate     B  conform their activities to the terms of their contract and the directives of the State or district attorney     C  not exercise any independent prosecutorial discretion     D  contact alleged offenders only as a result of a determination by the State or district attorney that there is probable cause of a bad check violation under State penal law and that contact with the offender is appropriate  and where the alleged offender has failed to pay the bad check after demand for payment has been made as required by state law     E  communicate in writing a clear and conspicuous statement that the alleged offender may dispute the validity of alleged bad check violation  and assert via a crime report that the alleged bad check was actually stolen  forged  or related to identity theft or some other fraud  and    F  charge only fees in connection with the services that have been authorized by the contract with the State or district attorney       If the alleged offender disputes the validity of the allegation under 818 a  E  and notifies either the private entity or State or district attorney in writing within 30 days after demand for payment has been sent  then restitution efforts have to be halted unless the State or district attorney or their authorized employees determine there is probable cause to believe a crime has nonetheless been committed  In that instance  restitution efforts can continue       If the private entity complies with these requirements  it shall not be considered a debt collector as defined by Section 803 6  of the FDCPA  15 U S C  1692  with respect to its operation of the pre trial diversion programs under the contract it has entered into with the State or district attorney       Section 818 b  excludes from the programs checks that involve        1  a postdated check presented in connection with payday loans or similar transactions where the payee knew the issuer had insufficient funds when the check was written     2  a stop payment order where the issuer acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to stop payment    3  a check dishonored because of an adjustment to the issuer s account by his or her financial institution without notice to the issuer of the adjustment    4  a partial payment check where the payee had accepted that form of payment previously    5  a check issued by a person who was incompetent or not of legal age to issue checks  or   6  a check issued to pay an obligation arising from a transaction that was illegal in the jurisdiction of the State or district attorney       Section 818 c  defines  State or district attorney  and clarifies that the term  check  has the meaning given in Section 3 6  of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act   A  bad check violation  is defined by the applicable state criminal law in each instance  provided  as required by state law  that the alleged offender received written or oral notice from the payee or holder that payment was received by the drawee financial institution       Section 901      This section makes statutory changes to 31 U S C  9301 and 31 U S C  9303 that would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the types of securities that may be pledged in lieu of surety bonds  and requires that the securities be valued at current market rates         Section 1001      This section requires a study by the Comptroller General on the volume of CTRs filed with the Treasury  including  if appropriate  recommendations for changes to the filing system        Section 1002      This section requires a study by the Comptroller General on the cost and overall regulatory regime of the financial services industry
