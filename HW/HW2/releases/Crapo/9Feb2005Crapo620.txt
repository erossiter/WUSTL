 Washington  DC     Secretary Mike Johanns has responded to concerns of Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and the rest of the Idaho delegation by delaying a provision of a U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  rule that would have allowed for the importation of beef product over 30 months of age    The U S  border has been closed to imports of cattle and some beef products from Canada following the discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  BSE  in Canada   However  on Dec  29  2004  USDA released a final rule that would place Canada in the minimal risk category for BSE and would provide for the resumption of trade of cattle less than 30 months of age and boxed beef over 30 months of age          Crapo spoke with Johnanns about the situation during a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing and the Idaho delegation also wrote to Secretary Johanns on February 2  2005 expressing concern with the rule and the contradictory provision of the rule that would prohibit the importation of cattle more than 30 months of age while permitting imports of meat from these same animals   Secretary Johanns responded today by delaying this provision           It is inconsistent to ban cattle over 30 months of age while allowing in boxed beef over 30 months of age  and this provision is detrimental to beef producers and the cattle industry as a whole     said Senator Crapo      I appreciate that Secretary Johanns understands our concerns and has agreed to delay this detrimental portion of the rule   Work still remains to regain our beef export markets  but this is certainly a step in the right direction         FOR INTERESTED MEDIA   A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
