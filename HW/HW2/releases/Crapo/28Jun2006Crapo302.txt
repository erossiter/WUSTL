 Washington  DC    An outdated phone tax is one step closer to elimination  said Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  after the Senate Finance Committee  on which he sits  approved a measure today to end the excise tax on local phone service      This measure was approved after the U S  Treasury Department announced last month it would repeal the excise phone tax on long distance service    That move retroactively refunded the past three years of the three percent long distance tax  but congressional action is required to eliminate the local excise tax   Excise taxes were first imposed in 1898 as a tax on wealthy individuals as phones were considered a luxury item   The revenue from the tax was originally used to fund the Spanish American War         Congress needs to do its part in following Treasury   s repeal of the long distance excise tax by eliminating the excise tax on local service     Crapo said      Our tax laws need to be compatible with our technology age   The long distance excise tax removal was a start to catch up with technology and this measure will end this unnecessary tax          Crapo is an original co sponsor of the legislation approved today by a voice vote   It now goes before the full Senate for further consideration
