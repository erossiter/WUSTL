 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  who recently returned from visiting soldiers in Baghdad and Fallujah  Iraq  said the news of the death of 19 year old Specialist Carrie French of Caldwell is especially tough to take because she was just beginning her adult life   French  an ammunitions specialist with the 116th Brigade Combat Team  died Sunday when her vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb        Crapo sent his sympathies to French   s family and friends in Idaho   He issued the following statement regarding her untimely death         I am deeply saddened to hear about the death of Specialist Carrie French   My heart goes out to her parents and all the families who have lost loved ones during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan   When someone so young dies  the only comfort that can be drawn is that she made the ultimate sacrifice for her country  to protect all of us in the war on terrorism             When I was recently in Iraq  I personally saw what a tremendous job our troops are doing and the positive difference they are making in the lives of the Iraqi people   It is not always reported this way  but I want Carrie   s parents to know that she not only left her mark on the State of Idaho and the United States  but her spirit will long live in the lives of Iraqi children who will now have the opportunity to attend school  or Iraqi youth who will have opportunities to follow their dreams without the oppression of having their choices made by a cruel dictator             Carrie and all our military members will be part of the new constitution in Iraq and the birth of a democracy  while preventing further acts of terrorism against the citizens of the United States   I hope that this knowledge will bring some measure of comfort to Carrie   s parents   They will always have my sincere appreciation for her service to our country
