 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo told colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee  today that the deal to transfer operations of some U S  ports to a United Arab Emirates firm should be delayed and raises red flags for overall oversight regarding such transactions   Crapo noted his opposition to the February agreement under which Dubai Ports World  a state owned business in the United Arab Emirates  purchased Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company  a British firm  which currently runs the operations at six of the largest U S  ports  New York  New Jersey  Baltimore  New Orleans  Miami and Philadelphia       The proposed transaction would affect management of the ports  Security at all of the ports will continue to be managed by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the U S  Coast Guard  But many in Congress  including Crapo  are concerned   Today   s hearing of the Banking Committee was intended to review the transaction   It had been reviewed and approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   which is made up of 12 representatives of different federal departments and agencies  The president may reverse or approve CFIUS decisions   The Treasury Department chairs CFIUS  which reviews foreign purchases of U S  firms for their national security implications        Frankly  it   s hard to understand why the 45 day review and the more thorough process was not initiated with regard to this transaction from the outset     Crapo said      And then it   s hard to understand why  when the issue became one of public concern  there was so much resistance to a 45 day review and to taking the time to have the extra thorough scrubbing of this issue that the public  my constituents  and I think the vast majority of the American public are asking for        While Crapo said many are mindful about potential legislation to stop the transfer of port terminal operations to Dubai owned DP World  Congress should  at minimum  use the issue to reopen how such transfers in general are overseen by the legislative branch          I agree with my colleagues who have said that if the security of the United States is compromised by this transaction  the transaction should be stopped     Crapo said      A much larger issue faces the committee  though  and that is how we in the Congress are going to deal with the transactions of this type that we face relating to our security in the future  the question of process   I  for one  believe that it   s very evident that the process needs to be fixed        A satellite feed of Crapo   s remarks relating to the port deal and security issues is available  1 45 p m  Mountain Time   12 45 p m  Pacific Time C Band AMC 1 Transponder 20 Vertical Downlink 4100 Audio 6 2 6 8
