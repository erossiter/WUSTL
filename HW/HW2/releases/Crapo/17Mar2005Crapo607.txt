 Washington  DC     Idaho stands to see large increases for highway and mass transit funding under two separate votes by the Senate Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and fellow members of the Senate Banking Committee today approved legislation which could more than double funding levels for Idaho mass transit projects from Fiscal Year 2003 levels      The measure  if unchanged by the full Senate and House  would net Idaho nearly  71 6 million for mass transit projects over the six year life of the bill   The previous bill totaled  33 5 million   The total for all states is  51 billion      Members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee used language authored by Crapo and Committee Chairman James Inhofe  R OK  last session to help set authorization levels for highway projects   The transportation reauthorization bill  known as SAFETEA  or the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  has been kept alive through stop gap votes dating back to last session when Crapo was a member of the Committee   This week  language similar to that inserted by Crapo last year was used as the Committee passed the six year reauthorization good through Fiscal Year 2009           The last numbers we had coming to Idaho for road and bridge work was about  1 3 billion and  if this bill follows through to passage by the full Senate and House  Idaho may get close to  1 57 billion     Crapo said      I applaud Chairman Inhofe   s efforts to build on the plan we started last year which ensure rural states will maintain their federal funding levels   We must now build on those efforts to get this bill approved by the full Senate         The bill provides  191 billion for maintenance and improvement of the nation   s roads and bridges over the 2005 2009 period   The transit vote by the Banking Committee would be inserted into the overall SAFETEA bill during debate by the full Senate later this year
