 Washington  DC  Tax experts today reaffirmed to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo that the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  forces debilitating financial effects on American taxpayers  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing today  witnesses told Crapo and others on the committee that the so called stealth tax hit four million taxpayers in 2006 and  in just three more years  is projected to affect 34 percent of those who file income tax    The Alternative Minimum Tax is truly a stealth tax  It sneaks up on taxpayers  unfairly assessing exorbitant tax liabilities that are disproportionate to income  said Crapo  Those who choose to have children or live in a state that imposes high taxes can be subject to this onerous tax  And  having children and living in a state with higher taxes are not typically construed as tax avoidance strategies  If the most recent temporary fix is not extended  exemption amounts will be  45 000 for married couples and  33 750 for most other taxpayers  The IRS estimates that  in 2006  the average AMT filer owed over  6 000 more than they would have under the regular tax code   Crapo continued  Were witnessing exponential AMT growth  In 2006  four million taxpayers were projected to owe taxes under this alternative tax structure  In 2007  the AMT will affect 23 million taxpayers  The AMT continues to be fixed temporarily  but a long term solution hasnt been implemented  For a number of years  Ive co sponsored legislation to repeal this increasingly onerous and unfair tax  Im pleased that opposition to repeal has significantly faded  but any fix that Congress agrees to should not include tax increases to act as offsets  This tax was never intended to apply to the vast majority of taxpayers who are now forced to pay it  Its an unnecessary tax that requires no offset  just rightful and immediate repeal  Taxpayers should not have to pay because Congress has been dragging its feet on this issue   Crapo noted that the AMT is not indexed for inflation  In 1969  the exemption amount was  30 000  designed to prevent wealthy taxpayers from avoiding tax liability  If indexed for inflation today  the exemption amount would be  165 000  Instead of targeting the super wealthy  the AMT targets middle income taxpayers and is projected to apply to 89 percent of married taxpayers whose Adjusted Gross Income  AGI  falls between  75 000 and  100 000 and who have two or more children  The National Taxpayer Advocate office calls the AMT the poster child for tax law complexity  The IRS reports the following 2005 Idaho tax statistics    11 543 filers were subject to the AMT  Of these    150 had an AGI under  50 000    897 filers  counting married filers as one filer  making less than  100 000 were subject to the  AMT
