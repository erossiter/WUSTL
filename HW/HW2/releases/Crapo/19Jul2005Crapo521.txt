 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo commended the President   s choice of D C  Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John Roberts for the Supreme Court today and anticipates an evenhanded and speedy process in confirming him to administer justice under the Constitution          John Roberts is a great choice for a Supreme Court nomination  as he brings a breadth of experience both in private practice and public service and has demonstrated a strong ability to correctly interpret the Constitution     Crapo said      Judge Roberts was confirmed by voice vote to the D C  Court and the Senate can now look forward to confirming him with full confidence             This is one of those rare and important processes that involves all three branches of government  Now that we have a nominee  I hope that the Senate can move forward with the confirmation process in a timely manner  one that provides for an up or down vote before the Supreme Court goes into a new session in October   As we learn more about Judge Roberts  he should be treated with respect and dignity through the process   This is an important task for the Senate and I pledge to do what I can to encourage and facilitate a timely discussion and confirmation          The Roberts nomination will now go to the Senate Judiciary Committee for initial consideration and then to the full Senate for final confirmation
