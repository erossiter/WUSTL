 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring S  420  the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act   This bill  introduced by Senators Jon Kyl  R Arizona  and Bill Nelson  D Florida   would make the repeal of the estate tax  sometimes referred to as the death tax  permanent   Congress and the President must act to prevent a sunset clause scheduled for 2011 from ending the tax cuts passed in 2001        Crapo said the estate tax unfairly singles out the economic engines that drive economic recovery such as small businesses and farmers      The estate tax may be the most unfair tax on the books     said Crapo      This tax makes it cheaper for the owner of a small family business to sell it rather than pass it along to his or her children   Without Congressional action now  estate tax rates will immediately return to their pre 2001 levels in 2011  after a one year full elimination in 2010   These farmers and business owners need certainty in the tax code now so they can make the proper planning decisions for their own future as well as their families  future           Crapo noted that farm families are among the hardest hit      Ninety four percent of all agricultural products sold come from family farms   Unfortunately  in the 1990s  twice the number of farm estates paid death taxes compared to other estates   Paying taxes as high as 47 percent seems to leave little incentive to pass the farm on to your children           Crapo added the small businesses most affected by the estate tax create two thirds of new jobs in the U S  and comprise well over half the workforce   He pointed to studies predicting the elimination of the estate and gift taxes could create 275 000 new jobs by 2010           Our economy is improving  in part because of the tax reform package Congress passed in 2001   Now is the time to make permanent responsible tax reform that creates economic activity     Crapo added      Ending this onerous tax is a good effort to move reform along  The estate tax has been around since 1916 and was never intended to create the consequences on jobs and family businesses it has           As a member of the Senate Finance Committee  Crapo will be one of the first senators to vote on tax reform proposals  which are first proposed and debated in that committee
