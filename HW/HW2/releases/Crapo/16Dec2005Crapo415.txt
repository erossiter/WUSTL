 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted today to invoke cloture on debate of the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005  which would allow the Senate to vote on extending expiring provisions in the law   The Act contains provisions that will expire Dec  31 unless the Senate approves an extension   Cloture is a Senate procedure requiring 60 votes that allows the Senate to end debate on an issue and move to a vote on the actual bill   Because the cloture vote failed on a vote of 52 47  there will not be a vote on passing the reauthorization measure at this time   Following the vote  Crapo issued the following statement        The PATRIOT Act was first enacted to protect Americans against terrorism     said Crapo      This revised version meets that goal while protecting our privacy and civil liberties   The tools this bill provides are necessary to winning the war on terrorism and keeping that fight off our soil   I have spent many hours reviewing and discussing this legislation and ultimately made the decision to support the bill   Because I respect the many Idahoans who have taken the time and effort to share their objections with me  I want to take this opportunity to explain why I came to my decision           I voted for the PATRIOT Act in 2001  which overwhelmingly passed both houses of Congress   In 2003  I joined with the Idaho Congressional delegation to sponsor the original SAFE Act with the goal to refine  not reject  the PATRIOT Act            Today I supported this reauthorization measure because it contains many of the refinements from the original SAFE Act   It maintains the necessary tools for intelligence and law enforcement  but it enacts important safeguards to prevent these tools from being used for unintended purposes   After discussing the operational results of the Act with Attorney General Gonzales and others and reviewing the oversight work performed by the Judiciary Committee  it is clear there are no documented cases of infringement on the civil liberties of law abiding Americans allegedly threatened in this bill   At the same time  we have seen no terrorist attacks on U S  soil since September 11  2001   I concluded  with the inclusion of these improvements  that I should vote to continue to protect Americans from terrorist threats and provide additional safeguards to protect against any threat to civil liberties        Provisions in this reauthorization that would protect Americans privacy and liberty  but weren   t included in the original PATRIOT Act include         The Department of Justice will be required to destroy any confidential information that is not relevant to an investigation but is received in response to a subpoena or warrant      Warrants issued under an open ended delayed notice status now have a 30 day notice period to the subject of the warrant      To further protect against    fishing expeditions    or improper targeting by field agents  any agent specifically requesting library  medical  gun or educational records must first get the personal approval of the Director of the FBI  the Deputy Director or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security  before getting approval from a judge      Those seeking a warrant for roving and wiretapping must justify a specific target for the warrant and also notify the court issuing the warrant within 10 days after the beginning of surveillance      It guarantees recipients of business records requests the right to consult legal counsel and to judicial review      The bill requires two separate audits to be done on National Security Letters and business records used by the FBI      It allows recipients of National Security Letters to consult legal counsel      The measure includes a new sunshine provision on National Security Letters  requiring annual reporting     Crapo continued     The PATRIOT Act has generated significant discussion and debate across our country  and I have heard from many Idahoans who are concerned about the effect of the Act on their lives and liberty   The sunsets placed in the original legislation give Congress another opportunity to debate and discuss the Act   It is critical that we deal with facts and address legitimate fears based on these facts   This bill addresses these concerns and  thanks to sunsets placed in it  this debate will occur again in four years   It is my sincere hope that  at that time  we will again be able to say that the lives and constitutional liberties of the American people have been protected  thanks to the refinements we have made to the PATRIOT Act
