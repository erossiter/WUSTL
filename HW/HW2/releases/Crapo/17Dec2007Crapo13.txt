 Washington  DC  Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo requested today that prohibitions that keep law abiding citizens from transporting and carrying firearms on certain public lands be removed  In a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne spearheaded by Crapo and signed by 46 other Senators  Crapo cited regulations by the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service as infringing on constitutional rights of individuals  He also pointed out that other federal agencies have deferred to state law regarding firearms on lands under federal management     Federal Regulations known as 36 CFR 2 4  applicable to the National Park Service  and 50 CFR 27 42  applicable to the Fish and Wildlife Service  prohibit individuals from possessing a firearm on lands managed by those agencies  The prohibition extends to those with valid concealed weapons permits  Other federal land management agencies  such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service  allow firearms to be transported and carried on these lands in accordance with the laws of the host state     These regulations infringe on the rights of law abiding gun owners  who wish to transport and carry firearms on or across these lands  Crapo said in the letter  We support an exception to these regulations to allow law abiding citizens to transport and carry firearms consistent with state law where the National Park Service sites and the National Wildlife Refuges are located  These inconsistencies in firearms regulations for public lands are confusing  burdensome and unnecessary     The letter expressed that such regulatory changes would respect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners  while providing a consistent application of state weapons laws across all land ownership boundaries     I am pleased to have such a large and bipartisan number of Senators who have joined me in signing this letter and standing up for Second Amendment rights  Crapo said
