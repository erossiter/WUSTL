 Washington  DC     State  county  and local leaders could see new funding to deal with issues related to the illegal entry of criminal aliens into the U S  under legislation supported by Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig   The U S  Senate today approved  by unanimous consent  a measure that would reauthorize and more than double funding authority for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program  SCAAP   Crapo led an effort last year to alert county sheriffs throughout Idaho about the program known as SCAAP and invited many of them to come to Washington  DC  for training and seminars regarding the program          It is proper for the federal government to increase the assistance to states and municipalities as we deal with illegal immigration activity     Crapo said      Federal dollars pay to secure our borders  but illegal aliens who do enter the country may become the financial burden for counties and local taxpayers should they become incarcerated   This program  if fully funded  will offer increased help to address those concerns           SCAAP is a critical resource that supports Idaho s state and local law enforcement in locking up illegal aliens who commit crimes in our communities     Craig said     I m pleased the Senate agreed to renew and increase the funding for this program  to better meet the federal government s responsibility for controlling illegal immigration        Authorization for the SCAAP program expired last October   The Senate today authorized spending up to  750 million for reimbursement for Fiscal Year 2006  increasing to  950 million by Fiscal Year 2008  a figure that is more than double the  305 million  appropriated enacted  for Fiscal Year 2005       SCAAP reimburses counties for correctional officer salary costs for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens for at least four days   Idaho received  699 690 from the SCAAP program in 2004
