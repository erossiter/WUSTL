 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo today called for an increase in federal resources to stop the flood of illegal methamphetamine crossing U S  borders and getting to rural states like Idaho  Crapo  during a speech on the Senate floor this week  said a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented that Idaho has one of the highest rates of methamphetamine use in residents age 12 and older     Crapo noted rural states like Idaho have fewer law enforcement and educational resources to fight meth and called for increased funding for federal programs like the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act  Combat Meth Act      He noted the fallout of meth use hits innocent victims  even infants  According to Idahos Department of Health and Welfare  the number of children in foster care increased by 40 percent between 2002 and 2006  Crapo said during his floor speech  Approximately 3 000 children enter foster care in Idaho every year  the majority of them are children of meth addicted single mothers  Our children are the unwitting and helpless victims of this menacing drug epidemic      Crapo said he is working with Idahos educators to create public service announcements aimed at discouraging meth use  He credits the Montana Meth Project  an awareness campaign from a neighboring rural state  with reducing adult meth use by as much as 70 percent     Crapo also announced the passage of an amendment that will allow Native American Tribes from Idaho and other states access to new federal funding sources to fight meth  The amendment is part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Bill  Crapo and his staff have worked with Idaho tribal members about the need for resources to fight meth in large  sparsely populated areas     Still  Crapo said law enforcement efforts must be maintained to stem the tide of a drug that is now largely produced south of the U S  border  He credited efforts by the Mexican government to stop the manufacture of the drug  but noted the enormous profits margins that meth brings will keep the pipelines for the illegal drug growing  He said continued funding for law enforcement efforts  coupled with a strong message to keep children from experimenting with meth  can be key to combating the problem     Integral to fighting methamphetamine in our communities is educating our children  Crapo said  To that end in Idaho  Ive partnered with the Idaho Department of Education Safe and Drug Free Schools program and issued a call for high schools across my state to create public service announcements that seek to educate other students about the dangers of methamphetamine abuse  on the model of the highly successful Montana Meth Project  Getting our youth involved directly in this outreach and education effort will reduce the potential for methamphetamine use     Crapo concluded  Considering the growing international methamphetamine epidemic  its in our nations interest to remain very active in cooperative endeavors such as those in which the State Department  the U S  Drug Enforcement Agency  and the Department of Homeland Security are currently involved  These successful programs deserve continued funding in order to stop the supply of meth coming into our neighborhoods and Tribal communities
