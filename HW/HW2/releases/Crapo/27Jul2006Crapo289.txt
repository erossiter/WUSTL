 Washington  DC     The success of federal farm conservation programs in enhancing the environment may depend in part on the availability of technical assistance for producers  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo is chairing a Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry  Conservation and Rural Revitalization hearing today on the use of third party technical service providers in carrying out agricultural conservation programs          The Farm Bill is one of the most important environmental laws we have and it provides a significant investment in agricultural conservation programs     said Crapo      These programs provide incentives for conservation and result in environmental benefits  but knowing how to achieve these benefits can require expertise that spans a wide range of scientific disciplines          Crapo says the hearing is aimed at ensuring producers have the technical assistance they need to better address issues related to water  soil  air quality  endangered species  crop nutrients and other areas   To that end  representatives of the U S  Department of Agriculture and several agricultural conservation organizations will address the subcommittee during the hearing  They include Sara Braasch  West Regional Assistant Chief for the Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS   James Chapin  Director of the Western Region for the Association of Consulting Foresters  Gene Schmidt  a Member of the Board of Directors for the National Association of Conservation Districts  David Goad  Deputy Director of the Arkansas Game   Fish Commission  and Doug Wolf  a member of the Board of Directors for the National Pork Producers Council       While the 2002 Farm Bill substantially increased conservation program funding  staffing levels at the NRCS and other agencies may not have been sufficient to provide all the technical assistance required to deliver the level of funding   The hearing  beginning at 10 00 a m  in Room 328 A of the Senate Russell Office Building  will examine the use of technical service providers  TSPs  to increase technical assistance and how those providers are certified and funded  plus the methodology used in the program
