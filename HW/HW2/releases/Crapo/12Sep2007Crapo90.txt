 Washington  DC  The Senate Finance Committee today approved legislative language written on the federal delivery and funding of health services for Native Americans  including language in the underlying bill authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  to establish an Office on Indian Mens Health  Crapo and other members of the Finance Committee completed mark up of the Medicare  Medicaid and CHIP Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007     This legislation helps set goals for federal agencies assisting with Indian health programs  including programs to promote  train and place health care professionals at Native American facilities  Crapo said  As is the case with all health programs  preventive actions can reduce the number of people who get sick or suffer advanced illnesses  Thats why I am pleased the bill includes language that will facilitate modernization of disease prevention and behavioral health programs     The portion of the bill addressed today in the Finance Committee included provisions to ensure Native American access to federal health programs such as Medicare  Medicaid and the CHIP  Childrens Health Insurance Program   These programs are a significant source of funding for health care delivered to Indian people  Over the past decade  the Native American population has grown but federal funding has not kept pace  as a result  Medicare and Medicaid have played an increasingly important role     The bill now must be considered by the Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions before going to the full Senate
