 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is seeking administrative improvements and potentially legislative changes to the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB  to make it work better for students  teachers  and schools   Crapo wrote U S  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings seeking relief for state leaders who fear the federal guidelines are not flexible enough          President Bush s sweeping education reforms included in the No Child Left Behind Act have had measurable positive effects on many students across the country  and I support the law s objective   Crapo wrote to Spellings    However  given time to observe the implementation of the law  it is now appropriate to review opportunities for needed improvements to the underlying program   After conferring with a number of organizations in my state and at the national level  I have identified concerns that seem common to various stakeholder groups   In response  I have collected a list of recommendations for workable  common sense modifications to the law   These provisions preserve the major focus on student achievement and accountability and  at the same time  ensure that schools and school districts are accurately and fairly assessed   I request that you comment on the extent of your existing authority to address these desired changes through regulations and your willingness to issue such regulations        Among the reforms Crapo is seeking is the ability of local school districts to be able to offer supplemental services to students before they are mandated to offer transfers to other schools   Crapo also says the mechanism to label a particular school in  need of improvement  should be refined to make sure student groups surveyed for that determination remain consistent from year to year       In addition  Crapo encouraged the Secretary to continue to expand efforts to integrate measures of student growth in determining Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP   the standards used to measure a school s progress under NCLB   This change is designed to more accurately measure student and school achievement   Crapo also advocated for flexibility regarding disabled or other students with learning handicaps in determining how they factor into AYP            I have discussed these issues with Idaho teachers  school board members  and school executives who agree some changes are needed   Crapo concluded    There are changes we can make administratively and some we may have to pursue with targeted reform measures in Congress   Either way  we will continue to strengthen the process to make sure it works for students while continuing to push for classroom excellence from the local and state level       Read the statement from the National School Board Association on Senator Crapo s efforts regarding No Child Left Behind                The Honorable Margaret Spellings  Secretary  Untied States Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20202      Dear Secretary Spellings       As a father and a legislator  I am committed to advocating for public education in Idaho and throughout the nation   Ensuring that every child receives a good education is one of the most important and commonly held goals of parents  teachers and local  state and federal governments   President Bush s sweeping education reforms included in the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB  have had measurable positive effects on many students across the country  and I support the law s objective   However  given time to observe the implementation of the law  it is now appropriate to review opportunities for needed improvements to the underlying program        Your recent statements concerning your planned efforts to review provisions within the law and to provide maximum flexibility to the states and local school districts are very encouraging   I was pleased to hear of your pilot program incorporating growth models into the basic AYP measurement system   This approach would ensure that schools that are clearly making progress in enhancing student achievement are given the credit they deserve   I look forward to reviewing the results of this demonstration         I also support consistency in the implementation of the law so that each state will have the same advantages as other states in assisting children to succeed   As you know  there are concerns in the education community about NCLB  and I support efforts to make meaningful  effective changes to it   I am committed to working both legislatively and administratively to increase flexibility for states and local school districts under NCLB         After conferring with a number of organizations in my state and at the national level  I have identified concerns that seem common to various stakeholder groups   In response  I have collected a list of recommendations for workable  common sense modifications to the law   These provisions  which are explained below  preserve the major focus on student achievement and accountability and  at the same time  ensure that schools and school districts are accurately and fairly assessed   I request that you comment on the extent of your existing authority to address these desired changes through regulations and your willingness to issue such regulations       First  in the initial year a school is determined to be  in need of improvement  a district should be able to offer supplemental services to students  rather than offering transfer options   In addition  these services should be targeted to only those sub populations shown to have caused the designation   If the same sub population continues to be in need of improvement for a second year  transportation and school choice would begin   This targeted approach would allow districts to use resources to improve student achievement which are currently used to transport students to other locations        I am encouraged by recent changes made by the Department to AYP calculations for disabled students   Currently  there is a 1 percent cap on how many profoundly disabled students can take a test based on alternate standards and have their proficiency scores counted toward AYP   Additionally  there is a separate 2 percent cap on students who have some cognitive disabilities who can take tests based on modified standards and still have their scores counted for AYP   I suggest that a student s Individual Education Plan  IEP  team be given greater authority in deciding the proper type of assessment for a disabled child   Specifically  allowing the IEP team to determine whether a child should take a test based on alternate standards or one based on the same standards as other children would take into account the special needs and challenges facing this population   In addition  it would give families and teachers those closest to the student more influence in the process   I applaud recently proposed regulations to this end  but note that the 2 percent cap may continue to prove difficult for students  administrators  and IEP teams             Another area of concern is certain school choice provisions   Currently  school choice options begin to be applied once a school is labeled in need of improvement regardless of which subgroups caused this designation by not meeting annual measurable objectives   This means that sanctions are often imposed upon schools when different groups or different indicators are involved from year to year   A sensible approach would be to apply sanctions only when failure to make Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  is due to annual measurable objectives not being met by the same subject and group for two consecutive years   This would ensure that efforts are focused on those students truly in need of the most help   Some states have already been given the authority to implement a somewhat similar approach for determining AYP for local educational agencies  LEAs  and schools   All states should have this option            As you know  the current participation requirement for testing of Idaho s children under NCLB is 95    Creating a participation range of 90  to 95  would provide flexibility for those unfortunate situations where districts have little to no control on student attendance due to parents who pull their children out of testing programs  long term illness  or unusual patterns of attendance        Currently  due to NCLB reporting requirements  students are routinely identified in more than one sub group when calculating AYP   This approach results in an over representation of students that may fit into more than one reporting category   I suggest granting states and local school districts the authority to calculate AYP for a student belonging to more than one group subgroup in a manner that would not exceed a total count of  1  for any such student   Thus  the student would be accurately and fairly measured in proportion to the total school population             Again  I would appreciate hearing your comments on these proposals   I would very much appreciate a prompt response         We all have a responsibility to promote successful  meaningful public education for America s children   Thank you for your leadership on this issue   I look forward to working with you to ensure that the important objectives of NCLB are achieved       Sincerely       Mike Crapo  United States Senator
