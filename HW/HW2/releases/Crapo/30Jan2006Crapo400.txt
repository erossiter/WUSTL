 On January 19  as NASA launched the  New Horizons  probe to Pluto  we felt very proud that Idahoans played such an important role in the mission   Nine years from now when we receive images and scientific information from the outermost planet in our solar system  the power that sends this information back to Earth will come from a plutonium powered battery built by our own Idaho National Laboratory  INL           As was the case with the plutonium powered Cassini mission to Saturn  in deep space there is simply not enough sunlight for solar or any other power source to be practical   For a solar panel to generate enough electricity that far from the sun  the array would have to be 6 430 square feet  about the size of a football field                    Several historic aspects of this mission should be particularly interesting to Idahoans   New Horizons is the fastest manmade object ever   The Apollo missions took days to reach the moon  but New Horizons traveled past the moon in less than 10 hours   Fittingly  the plutonium fuel that is powering the instruments on our first mission to the last unexplored planet was named after the planet itself   Pluto was discovered in 1930  and although plutonium was discovered in 1941  its discovery was not announced until after World War II because it was part of the Manhattan Project                     The mission to Pluto is one of the most important exploration missions NASA has ever undertaken   In traveling there  New Horizons could provide invaluable information about how our solar system was formed   The lessons learned will have a huge impact on our understanding of the universe                    With goals so lofty  it is comforting to know that scientists and policymakers alike have been unwavering in their support of deep space research  even as skeptics continue to oppose progress of any kind and view any risk as too much  no matter what humanity stands to gain                      Opponents of the INL s role as a preeminent nuclear energy laboratory may never find anything good to say about the non weapons nuclear work performed in Idaho   Even a plan to consolidate all of the plutonium space battery work in Idaho  rather than scattering it among national labs across the country  is something that skeptics oppose                      Thankfully  the Department of Energy  DOE  and the Idaho Congressional Delegation have remained steadfast in our insistence that the plutonium battery programs be consolidated at one site  the INL   Currently  the material to encapsulate the plutonium 238  Pu 238  is fabricated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee   These are then shipped to Los Alamos  New Mexico  where the Pu 238 is purified and encapsulated   Finally  the capsules are shipped to INL for assembly as a space battery                    Consolidation of this program at the INL reduces the number of sites and people handling the Plutonium 238  reducing risks of all kinds   Through modifications to Idaho s Advanced Test Reactor  ATR   materials for the space batteries can be produced  refined  packed and assembled all at one laboratory  which means improved security and efficiency  and in the end  lower costs as well                      The ATR is the most versatile nuclear test reactor in the world   Throughout its four decade history  the reactor has been used to test commercial and Navy fuel for safety purposes   Today the reactor can be used to produce medical isotopes  and it will be a critical resource in supporting the development of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant in Idaho   Upgrades and replacements of reactor components result in essentially a new reactor every ten years or less  keeping the reactor on the cutting edge and available for evolving missions to support nuclear power research of all kinds        Supporting NASA s mission to Pluto is exactly what we and the DOE had in mind when we designated the INL as this country s lead laboratory for nuclear energy  and it follows in Idaho s proud tradition of providing safe nuclear energy technologies for more than half a century   Idaho can be proud of our undertaking to ensure safe nuclear power throughout the United States  the world  and now for the exploration of deep space         30
