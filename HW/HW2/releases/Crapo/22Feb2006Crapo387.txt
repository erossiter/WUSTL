 Boise     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo told members of the Idaho Senate and House this morning that efforts both in Idaho and nationwide are leading to meaningful improvements for both the environment and the economy that will ultimately benefit both species and private property owners under changes in the Endangered Species Act   During remarks today to the Idaho House  Crapo noted his appreciation for the Idaho legislators    unanimous approval of House Joint Memorial 16  passed by the House just prior to his speech   HJM 16 backs Crapo   s efforts to improve the ESA        We are starting to get more and more successes in this country with collaborative decision making     Crapo said      We are trying to find the common ground  rather than the battleground  over the Endangered Species Act      Crapo said his bill to improve the Act  S  2210  the Collaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act  CRESA   seeks consensus driven solutions by collaborative groups   Landowners willing to help species would be rewarded with tax credits and a guaranteed partnership on recovery efforts          It authorizes and opens the door for states and local communities to get involved with the management of species actions before species are listed as endangered     Crapo said      We can start working to get ahead of the game with the local people who know the issues and how to best manage the species      He added his CRESA bill also would prioritize species recovery efforts  focusing on those most in need and avoiding lengthy court fights costing valuable tax dollars     He said the evidence that collaborative decision making is working ranges from agreement on the Idaho memorial passed today to local efforts such as those on sage grouse recovery which have avoided listings in Idaho   Crapo said a round of recently completed negotiations to protect ranching and the environment of Owyhee County under the Owyhee Initiative are also proof collaboration is working and that it is the best hope to end    gridlock    under present laws        We have far too many laws that are punitive in their impact  and which generate conflict between various interest groups over environmental management     Crapo told the Idaho House      The result is instead of working out solutions  we fight   We can do better
