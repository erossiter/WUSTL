 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pennsylvania   are discussing the need to expand upon a plan to compensate Idahoans and others exposed to radiation from atomic tests during the middle of the last century   Crapo has introduced legislation to include Idahoans for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  RECA  but agrees recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to reform RECA must also be included in Congressional action on the Idaho bill       Crapo maintains his bill  S  998  could be expanded to address both compensation issues and RECA reform  The senators    talks are aimed at finding a way to compensate Idahoans and others affected by radiation exposure  as suggested by the NAS study   To that end  Crapo and Specter agreed to work together to address the findings of the NAS report  which recommended including all individuals who may have been exposed to fallout under current compensation programs  regardless of geography   Both Senators also agreed to involve White House officials in the discussions        There are areas in my native Idaho that have demonstrably higher incidences of thyroid dosage of radiation than any other county currently covered by RECA   It seems unconscionable to me that people living in these areas are not currently eligible for compensation     Crapo said      Those affected are not asking for special treatment  they are simply asking for fairness   As R  Julian Preston  Director of the Environmental Protection Agency   s Environmental Carcinogenesis Division stated     To be equitable  any compensation program needs to be based on scientific criteria and similar cases must be treated alike   The current geographic limitations are not based on the latest science        Specter said     I appreciate the Senator   s interest in this issue and recognize that he has legislation pending in Congress to address the needs of affected Idahoans   I say to my friend and colleague that I will work with him to identify necessary improvements and to respond to findings contained in the NAS report   I also urge the Administration to work diligently to help those still in need           FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   If you encounter any difficulties with the system  please contact Susan Wheeler at the above number   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
