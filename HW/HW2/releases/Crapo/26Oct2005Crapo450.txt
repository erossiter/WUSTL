 Washington  DC    A budget bill that trims government spending  cuts the deficit  and creates efficiency within federal programs while addressing the needs of Katrina victims was approved today by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and fellow members on the Senate Budget Committee      The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act is slated to save more than  39 billion over five years and will reduce federal spending to meet the goal of cutting the deficit by half  which is already down by more than  90 billion since last year          The federal government must curb spending now or our children and grandchildren will be left to pay our bills  leaving them to be faced with economic instability     Crapo said      It is imperative that we act now  With the money that will be needed for reconstruction in the Gulf region  funding needed for our troops to fight the war on terrorism  and our other obligations to the American people  it is critical to take action now and curb government spending   that is what this budget does        The budget reconciliation package  which meets and confirms spending limits agreed to by the Senate in the 2006 Budget Resolution earlier this year   will now go to the full Senate for further consideration   The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to show fiscal restraint on mandatory spending  which currently accounts for 59 percent of all federal spending   Programs classified as mandatory spending programs are not subject to the annual appropriations process  and are thus on autopilot   It is for this reason that the reconciliation process was created  so that Congress does have a tool to target out of control spending
