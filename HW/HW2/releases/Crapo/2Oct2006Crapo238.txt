 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo issued this statement tonight regarding the passing of former Idaho Representative Helen Chenoweth Hage   Crapo served with Chenoweth Hage in the U S  House         There will never be another public servant in Idaho like Helen   I served alongside her in the House of Representatives and worked on many issues with her  from fighting federal mandates in North Idaho to fighting for our military at Mountain Home and Gowen Field        Idahoans have lost a true champion for smaller government and personal freedoms   Helen brought Idaho into the national spotlight   She stood tough on the issues and spoke out often  even after she left the House        I will miss her and I know Idahoans will miss the leadership and courage she brought to Congress   She set the bar high for all of us who work in public service   My thoughts and prayers go out to all of her family and extended family members
