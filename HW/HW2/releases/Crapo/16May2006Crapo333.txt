 I agree with the President that America must be both a welcoming and lawful society  Comprehensive immigration reform can fulfill those needs and I welcome that debate back into the Senate   We must secure our nation   s borders   I   m encouraged that the President is going to commit the necessary manpower and technology  including the National Guard  to assure that illegal entry into our country is stopped   Our borders must be brought under control and these tools will help us build the foundation for a workable guest worker program        However  I remain opposed to granting an advantage toward gaining citizenship to those who have illegally entered the country   Granting amnesty in this way creates further incentives for illegal immigration and is unfair to those who follow the law   The United States needs a guest worker program that provides employers with a reliable and legal system to provide jobs for guest workers  This must be done while ensuring that Americans have the first right to available jobs  I will work with my Senate colleagues to try to craft a sensible immigration policy that meets these criteria
