 Washington  DC     A bipartisan effort to update and strengthen the Endangered Species Act  ESA  takes a large step forward with assistance from U S  Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho  and Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas    Crapo and Lincoln have partnered to write legislation that will address several areas of the ESA   Crapo and Lincoln are co chairing a working group in Congress that is coordinating its efforts with the appropriate committees of jurisdiction in the Senate and U S  House of Representatives   In February  Crapo joined Senator Lincoln Chafee  R Rhode Island   who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries  Wildlife and Water  Representative Richard Pombo  R California   who chairs the House Resources Committee  and Representative Greg Walden  R Oregon  to announce a bicameral effort directed at the same goal     Crapo  who has already gathered several Republican supporters  said     Congress has been examining the ESA for ten years and is ready for a breakthrough that maintains protections and improves recovery for species   This can only be done with commitments from all parties involved  collaboration and cooperation are essential for this effort to be successful   I am pleased that Senator Lincoln has joined with me in this effort   We will continue to seek partnerships with other Senators and Congressmen who share the principles that are directing our legislative efforts   I am committed to resolving long standing issues with ESA so the law works better for species and for people           In looking at the ESA and the issues surrounding it  I am convinced that it can be improved     Lincoln said     All parties involved recognize the value of biological diversity  and I believe solutions can be found that will better protect species without hindering the rights of landowners  Senator Crapo and I along with many others will work hard to find workable and common sense solutions that will move us in the right direction        The five issues under consideration are               Incentives   Draft language will provide positive incentives including direct payments to landowners for their commitments to conservation               Commitments   The commitment to recovery must be as serious as commitments to protection   We have worked hard over the first 30 years of the Act to protect species   We must build on that with more progress toward recovery               State roles   State government can play a stronger role   Involving states involves more wildlife professionals and access to existing relationships with landowners  both of which enlarge the team of people promoting recovery               Critical Habitat   Habitat is critical to wildlife  but the Critical Habitat provisions of the Act need reform   Our goal should be to protect and improve habitat in the most effective way possible               Science   Just as habitat is fundamental to wildlife  science is fundamental to how we care for wildlife   Science must be credible  reliable  and subject to independent review to provide a more open process for contentious decision making     Additionally  Crapo and Lincoln agree that any bill to update the Act must build trust and confidence among the members of Congress  state and federal agencies  and interest groups in the private sector   They said     We will listen to all interests  work to create win win solutions and draft legislation thoughtfully   The solutions that have worked on the ground will provide the foundation for what we propose to write into law   Our goal is to spark and sustain more active recovery for listed species by working cooperatively with landowners   In doing so  we believe that this will reduce conflict and bring more recovery results        At present  Crapo and Lincoln have not specified a time frame for introduction of the measure  which is still being drafted   They intend to introduce the bill in the 109th Congress
