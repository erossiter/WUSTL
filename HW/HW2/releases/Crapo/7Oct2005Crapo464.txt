 Washington  DC     By modernizing an outdated provision in the tax code  the cost of doing business could be lowered for farmers under a bill co sponsored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of both the Senate Agriculture and Senate Finance Committees   The measure  introduced by Senator Jim Talent  R Missouri   provides farmers and manufacturers with an equitable depreciation schedule for farm equipment        Agricultural production is vital to Idaho   s economy     Crapo said      Farming requires high capital investments in equipment in order to operate   Farm equipment is generally run for many hours of intense usage  typically from sunrise to sunset during harvests  and often for two or more crops annually   This bill provides a better match with actual farm equipment use patterns  that  in turn  will benefit our farmers and equipment manufacturers and dealers in Idaho        Under current provisions of the tax code  which have largely not been updated since 1962  farmers must carry a new piece of farm equipment on their books for seven years   On the other hand  construction equipment  which has a similar useful life span  can be depreciated over five years   Newer farm equipment allows farmers to operate more efficiently  more safely and in a more environmentally responsible way   By bringing parity to the tax code  farm equipment can be depreciated after five years of operation instead of seven    For example  under current tax provisions  the yearly allowed deduction for a combine  which costs between  200 000 and  300 000 when purchased new  would be between  29 000 and  43 000 over seven years   Under the new law  the farmer would be allowed a depreciation deduction of between  40 000 and  60 000 over five years   These figures are for illustration only  actual depreciation would depend on the taxpayer   s actual status
