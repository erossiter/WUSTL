 Washington  DC     With more than 2 100 pages  the President   s Fiscal Year  FY  2008 budget proposal was delivered to Capitol Hill today   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Budget Committee  will be involved all month in committee hearings on various aspects of the budget   Building on successful efforts to cut the deficit in half over the last three years  this year   s budget projects a  61 billion surplus in 2012        Over the next few weeks  the Budget Committee will be looking very closely at the proposed budget     Crapo said      The President   s budget submission signals the beginning of several months of intense planning and negotiations regarding the federal spending plan for the coming fiscal year   Congress now must determine how best to support the goal of balancing the budget by 2012 as well as keeping the pro growth tax policies that have provided the foundation for sustained economic growth and job creation   We will need to ensure that spending restraint is exercised and that we do not fall back on ill advised tax increases and more spending   Congress has to address the long term challenges posed by mandatory spending in programs like Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security           As I review the budget and participate in the hearings over the next few weeks  Idaho priorities will also be foremost for me     Crapo said      This budget needs to ensure that we address the needs of our military troops as well as veterans   It also needs to strongly support nuclear energy programs  particularly research and development funds for the Idaho National Laboratory   The budget should maintain important federal funding for crime victims   It should take steps to make certain that our public education system keeps our students competitive in key math and science areas  and that students who want to pursue a college degree can afford to do so   With the new farm bill on the horizon  the budget also needs to provide sufficient funding for reauthorization and accommodating new initiatives for agriculture   I will continue to carefully review the budget and work with my colleagues to ensure that the federal government funds are being appropriately and fairly distributed         The Senate Budget Committee sets spending priorities for the upcoming year  and evaluates the projected economic impact of those expenditures   The Senate Appropriations Committee then follows through with decisions on what will be spent on specific programs  within the limits set by the Budget Committee
