 Washington  DC    The U S  Forest Service and other federal agencies would be blocked from charging Americans higher fees to access their public lands under legislation introduced today by two prominent Western lawmakers    Idaho Senator Mike Crapotoday joined Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D Montana  in introducing the much anticipated Fee Repeal and Expanded Access Act of 2007  S  2438     The bill would revoke authority given federal agencies  with the exception of the National Park Service  in 2004 to institute new fees and increase existing fees at campgrounds  trailheads  and other public areas     Specifically  the bill repeals the 2004 passed Federal Lands Recreational Enhancement Act  sometimes called the recreational access tax  and reinstates legislation dating back to 1965 that limits the use of fees on public lands     Baucus  a long time critic of the fees  said the current system amounts to double taxation     Americans already pay to use their public lands on April 15  Baucus said  We shouldnt be taxed twice to go fishing  hiking  or camping on OUR public lands  It just doesnt make any sense  Thats why Mike and I are going to fight like the dickens to get this bill passed     The senators noted that both the Montana and Idaho State Legislatures passed resolutions to repeal FLREA     Crapo said  As an outdoorsman and legislator  I have always supported fair and reasonable access to our nations public lands  Mandatory user fees for access to many of those lands limits accessibility to those who can afford the cost and results in a pay to play system that is unacceptable  I also fully recognize that we need to adequately fund recreation activities on federal lands and will continue to fight in Congress to make sure the funding needs of our public lands management agencies are met      Debates have flared up in communities across the West as fees began to rise after the 2004 bill was passed  Baucus said he hopes his bill will help resolve those disputes     Kitty Benzar  president of the Western Slope No Fee Coalition  hailed the bill  Baucus worked closely with Benzar as well as the late Robert Funkhouser  who recently passed away  in crafting the legislation      This bill will bring an end to a failed experiment that has for 10 years burdened Americans with a double tax and kept them away from public lands they have always enjoyed  Benzar said  I applaud this bipartisan effort     The Baucus Crapo bill would      Repeal the FLREA     Reinstate the fee authorities established by the 1965 Land and Water Conservation Act     Reinstate the National Parks Pass system     Cap the amount that can be charged for entrance to national parks
