 WASHINGTON  D C    This evening  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo joined fellow Idaho Senator Larry Craig in supporting a multi year proposal to restore funding for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act   The provision  offered today by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden as an amendment to the supplemental appropriations measure  H R  1591   includes help for rural schools  counties and communities by extending the county payments for one year and reauthorizing the program for five years  providing almost  5 billion through 2012       Today  Crapo issued the following statement to support the effort to resolve the critical situation currently facing rural Idaho communities        Mr  President  I rise today in support of the funding provided in the supplemental appropriations legislation for continuation of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act  and the five year reauthorization of the program through the Wyden amendment   Counties and school districts across this country are poised to cut much needed jobs and services without this continuation   Many of us have heard the urgent calls from constituents   The message has been clear    Please help us    And  I m proud to answer that call by supporting this reauthorization           For example  Idaho s Fremont County is one of the counties across the State and nation that has been faced with a dire situation   Fremont County is looking at not only eliminating road and bridge services but also students would be impacted by a loss of nursing services for students  playground and safety equipment at elementary schools  library books  and continuing education instructions          Ideally  management of our forested land would generate the revenue necessary to assist with services in cash strapped communities with large amounts of federally owned land   Unfortunately  that just hasn t been the case for some time   We must continue to work to remove impediments to forest health and productivity   However  in the meantime  Congress must commit the resources necessary to ensure that rural communities across this country do not have to forgo road maintenance  close libraries  and make cuts to children s education   Anything less is unacceptable          The legislation before us today would respond by fully funding PILT through 2012 reauthorizing Secure Rural Schools through 2011  reauthorizing the valuable Resource Advisory Committees  RACs   and phasing down the payments over time   I urge other Senators to join me in supporting this amendment that fulfills the responsibility to these communities that shoulder the local cost of the public lands we all enjoy
