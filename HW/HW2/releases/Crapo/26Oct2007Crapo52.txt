 Washington  DC  More than 250 Idaho students have downloaded applications for nominations to U S  military academies from Idaho Senator Mike Crapos website  The strong interest follows Academy Day presentations in Boise and Coeur dAlene earlier this month  Crapo reminds interested Idaho students that applications for nominations to four of the nations military academies must be submitted by Wednesday  October 31  2007  to be considered for the class entering in 2008  Every year  Crapo nominates selected Idaho students to the following  the U S  Air Force Academy  Colorado Springs  Colorado  the U S  Merchant Marine Academy  Kings Point  New York  the U S  Military Academy  West Point  New York  and the U S  Naval Academy  Annapolis  Maryland  Interested students need to submit an application and references and meet certain scholastic requirements  This year  students have used the Internet to download their application materials  Crapo said  There are just five days left before the Wednesday  October 31st  deadline  and students need to turn those application materials into my office by then in order to receive consideration for the upcoming class  Idaho has a strong tradition of sending outstanding students to our nations military academies  which have some of the highest academic standards and programs in the country  I expect that this years field of applicants will continue that practice and Idaho will once again be represented by some of our finest students in our military academies  Students may apply to both U S  Senators and the U S  Representative from their congressional district as well as the Vice President of the United States  The names of students nominated by Crapo will be forwarded to each service academy  Decisions about final appointments are then made by the individual institutions  Those wishing to apply for a nomination to the next class  entering in 2008  should visit Crapos website to download an application at http   crapo senate gov services academy_nominations cfm or contact his military representative  Linda Norris  at  202  224 0851 for more information  Applications must be submitted no later than October 31  2007
