 Washington  D C   Congressional members from Idaho  Wyoming  and Montana sent a letter today to the Director of the National Park Service  encouraging her to continue to allow winter public access to Yellowstone National Park by the means of snowmobile use     As residents of the Intermountain West we share a love of the outdoors and the beautiful lands our region offers  the Delegations wrote in the letter  As such  the preservation of our national parks is something we are deeply concerned about  We recognize that these parks require skillful and careful management to ensure that future generations will experience these national treasures     The three state Delegations agree that some of the nations most valued possessions are the nations parks  By allowing reasonable  managed snowmobile use  the public will also be able to enjoy these treasures in the winter months     The text of the letter follows     Dear Director Bomar     We are writing to convey our concern for the continued public winter access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and the John D  Rockefeller  Jr  Memorial Parkway     As residents of the intermountain west we share a love of the outdoors and the beautiful lands our region offers  As such  the preservation of our national parks is something we are deeply concerned about  We recognize that these parks require skillful and careful management to ensure that future generations will experience these national treasures    While we are obligated to preserve these parks for future generations  we feel there is also an obligation to the current generation to allow access to these public lands  We believe that reasonably managed snowmobile use  which allows the public to enjoy some of our nation s most valued possessions  can be consistent with the goals of conservation and preservation  Therefore  we strongly encourage the Park Service to maintain a significant level of oversnow access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and the John D  Rockefeller  Jr  Memorial Parkway     We fully recognize this is a complex issue  We appreciate the efforts of the Park Service thus far  and look forward to working with you on this important matter
