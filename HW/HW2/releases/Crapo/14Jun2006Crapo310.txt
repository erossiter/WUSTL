 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says Congress now has a roadmap to achieve and maintain a balanced federal budget   If adopted  the legislation which was introduced in the U S  Senate this afternoon  will stop the threat of excessive debt that could plague future generations of Americans   Crapo  a member of the Senate Budget Committee  joined with Senate leadership and 12 other Senators today to announce the Stop Over Spending  S O S  Act        Americans understand that spending is out of control in Washington     Crapo said      Wasteful spending in our federal budget must be addressed as one of our nation   s highest priorities   This legislation will give us the process in Congress by which we can get a handle on this critical issue        Crapo credited Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg  R  New Hampshire  with authoring the plan that mixes both spending controls and ways to maintain them   Some of the provisions of the S O S bill include a line item veto tool that allows a President to target wasteful spending  ask that it be rescinded  and send it up to Congress for expedited consideration    The measure would essentially balance the budget by 2012 by adding procedures to automatically slow the rate of growth for mandatory programs if Congress fails to meet deficit reduction targets     The bill also reinstates statutory caps on discretionary spending and creates a point of order against direct spending that will be triggered when the Medicare program is projected to become insolvent  in seven years or less    Due to skyrocketing health care costs and an aging population  Medicare is projected to be the first of the large entitlement programs to become insolvent   Finally  the bill seeks new studies to stop government waste and examine the impending entitlement crisis  including a BRAC type commission that would examine government programs and spending patterns and make recommendations for savings and improvement      Crapo noted the present system puts too many spending programs on auto pilot      We have processes in place today that make it hard to balance the budget and maintain fiscal responsibility   We must make sure we create a system of maintaining the budget that will enable us to give our children and grandchildren a shot at the American dream rather than leaving them with debt they cannot handle at the federal level        Crapo joined fellow Idaho Senator Larry Craig  Chairman Gregg  Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tennessee   and others to announce the S O S legislation during a news conference on Capitol Hill this afternoon   The legislation will be considered in the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday
