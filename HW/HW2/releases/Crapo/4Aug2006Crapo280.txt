 Washington  DC     A major provision  authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  to reduce the regulatory and financial burdens on pension plans and their beneficiaries was included in the pension reform conference report  H R  4  passed by the Senate last night   Crapo   s amendment package lifts investment restrictions that could result in an increase in retirement income for those who belong to pension plans   The pension reform package  which has already passed the U S  House  cleared the Senate last night on a vote of 93 to 5  it now goes to the President for his signature   H R  4 makes permanent the pension improvements enacted in the Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001  including increased contribution limits for individual retirement accounts  IRAs  and 401 k  plans   In addition  the bill makes permanent the    Savers    Credit    of up to  2 000  which is set to expire at the end of 2006       Crapo originally secured a scaled back amendment package as the Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005  S  1783   which passed the U S  Senate last November  but he worked to expand the code modernization as the bill was debated within a joint House Senate conference   The expanded reforms provide a much needed update to the Employee Retirement Security Income Act  ERISA  and Internal Revenue Code by removing the dated prohibitions on several commonplace trading practices   Crapo   s amendment allows pension plans to take advantage of changes in the marketplace to diversify investment opportunities  allow trading to be carried out more efficiently and better diversify investment portfolios       Specifically  the provision provides relief for pension plan managers from restrictions on bonding  block trading  electronic trading  foreign exchange transactions  accounting for plan assets  cross trading  service provider exemptions  and time issues involved in trading   By lifting these restrictions  pension holders will be faced with fewer costs  which often translate into a higher  more secure pension payout       Crapo said     The vast majority of pension plans invest in very stable securities  however  with a small portion of assets   generally around 5 percent  many plans pursue more active  skill based investing  plans should have this choice   While the provisions may sound complex  it really comes down to allowing choice and flexibility  lower costs  and greater efficiency to the market          These days  distinct lines of separation between banking  insurance  and the securities markets no longer exist   But the laws that govern pension plans haven t been seriously reformed in 30 years  despite the many changes in the way pension plans invest and in the types of firms that provide services to pension plans   To put it simply  these ERISA rules hinder pension plans    ability to invest in rather commonplace markets using standard trading techniques             As the lines of separation between banking  insurance  and securities become increasingly intertwined  reform is necessary   By allowing diversification of investment opportunities and more efficient securities transactions we are enhancing returns for the participants in these plans and ensuring pension promises are kept     Crapo concluded      ERISA has not been revisited for more than 30 years and I appreciate the leadership of Chairmen Enzi and Grassley and House Majority Leader Boehner in moving this legislation this year   This provision will encourage greater participation by pension plans in the marketplace and provide more secure retirements for regular American citizens
