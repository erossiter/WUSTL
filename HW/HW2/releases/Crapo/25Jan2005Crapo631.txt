 Washington  DC     Spurred by yesterday   s decision by the U S  Department of Commerce to revise duty calculations  Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig are calling on U S  and Canadian officials to step up talks that could resolve a long running dispute over Canadian lumber imports into the United States   Both senators joined with Senator Max Baucus  D Mont   in a colloquy made a part of the Congressional Record in asking Canada to abide by numerous World Trade Organization  WTO  and North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  panel decisions that confirm Canada is dumping lumber into the United States at below fair market price       In over two decades  Canadian officials have not gotten the message  at least not in a way that takes  that this problem will not be resolved by Canada   s investing hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees on more than 30 Washington law firms to circumvent U S  laws in countless appeals to the WTO  to NAFTA panels and to the U S  courts    several more were filed just this month   And it will not be solved by the cottage industry that has grown up in Canada to mount PR campaigns in the United States     Senator Craig said     Craig continued     The U S  timber industry vigorously supports the Administration   s view that the unfair Canadian lumber problem could most appropriately and productively be resolved through negotiations    although perhaps there just ought to be permanent duties in place   Some vested interests in Canada prefer endless litigation  probably based on misguided advice that this will be productive from those who have made a living defending Canadian subsidies        Senator Crapo added     The problem remains that the market is grossly distorted by Canadian unfair trade practices  Absent termination of or an offset to the unfair practices the U S  timber industry will be severely impacted by subsidized and dumped Canadian imports   We in the Congress have been assured that those responsible in the Administration will not allow this further injury to our industry to occur      Both Crapo and Craig called on the Canadian government to amend its lumber trade practices and return to actions that continue the strong international relationship between the U S  and Canada
