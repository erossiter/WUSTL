 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo visited with Idaho soldiers in Fallujah  Iraq  as he completed a tour of the Middle East  Russia and the Baltic States this week   He says that the most remarkable observation about his stay in Iraq is the progress that U S  soldiers and advisers are making in successfully turning over many military and security functions to Iraqi soldiers and police         We were using mostly U S  and multi national troops just a year ago     Crapo said via telephone from London  England on route back to the United States      Now there are 168 000 military and police forces who are Iraqi and the U S  and multi national forces are playing a supplemental role in day to day security         Crapo traveled via helicopter and ground transport from Baghdad to Fallujah where he met with two Idaho Marines  Corporal Justin Erickson of Coeur d   Alene  now stationed in North Carolina  and Lt  Corporal Damie Tom of Blackfoot   Crapo said that the soldiers told him they were receiving enough equipment and support  but are concerned about the perception of their mission back home         We should be proud of the service of our soldiers     Crapo said      They are doing tremendous work and great progress is being made   They wanted me to tell folks back home that the U S  military and the people of Iraq are taking significant steps forward toward independence         Crapo told Iraqi leaders  as well as Jordan   s King Abdullah whom he met in Amman  that progress for Iraq means sticking to political timetables and an election process      I told them I want to be sure there is no delay in the August 15th timeline for setting up a new Iraqi constitution   A referendum vote on that constitution would follow on October 15th  followed by new national elections for political leadership in December   Staying on schedule will promote the integration of many factions into the national system rather than into the insurgency   If we delay  I am afraid the movement forward may slow down   I can   t overemphasize how important this is         Crapo visited Iraq  Jordan  Russia  Latvia  and the Ukraine during the trip with Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell  R Kentucky  and Senator James DeMint  R South Carolina    The visits were part of a congressional tour inspecting U S  security and diplomatic operations in the Middle East  Russia  and the Baltic States       Crapo met with Latvian President Vaira Vike Freiberga in Jurmala  and with Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko in Kiev for briefings on the former Soviet states    progress toward free society and a market oriented economy   He came away    impressed with the political and economic reforms and the will of the people to seek freedom      The relationship between the former Soviet states and Russia was also discussed during a visit with officials from the Russian Foreign Ministry at the Kremlin inside Moscow         Despite a long and difficult process  the Iraqi people are like their neighbors in Russia and the Baltic States in that they are relishing new freedom and do not want to deviate from the path they have set upon     Crapo said      Americans have a role to play here by assisting with infrastructure and security   In Iraq  they don   t even have a banking system   It   s a cash economy if you can imagine that   We will have to pursue this course to prevent terrorism and other actions from being exported to the U S          Crapo   s telephone conference from London as well as pictures of the Crapo and Delegation   s visits with Idaho troops and with dignitaries during the trip are available on Crapo   s website at http   crapo senate gov or through Crapo   s communications offices at the numbers listed above
