 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring a new bill closing an existing loophole in federal legislation that restricts access to drugs used in the manufacture of illegal methamphetamine  Crapo  who requested more federal help in the fight against meth last month on the Senate floor  says some retailers are avoiding compliance with federal laws that restrict the sale of the ingredients used to produce meth  He is co sponsoring S  2071  the Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act  introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein  D California  and Jon Kyl  R Arizona      Awareness efforts like the Idaho Meth Project and law enforcement efforts by police and drug agents will surely fail unless we stop meth at the source  Crapo said  While the vast majority of retailers are on board with efforts to restrict access to the ingredients of meth  not all are in compliance  This law addresses the compliance issue with those few retailers     Crapo  as a member of the Senate Finance Committee  heard testimony from federal Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  officials that some retailers are failing to comply with reporting standards concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine  The DEA has placed restrictions on the sale of the over the counter ingredients because they can be used to produce meth     The new legislation tightens reporting standards by requiring that distributors of these products sell only to retailers who comply with those standards  It also requires retailers to restrict mail orders of the drugs and certify that their employees are aware of and comply with the federal laws governing such sales     We must be aggressive at the source of meth  whether it is coming across the border or being manufactured in a neighborhood meth lab  Crapo added  Keeping it off the streets and away from Americans is an essential ingredient in the war against meth abuse
