 Washington  DC    The strong turnout and endorsement of the Iraqi constitution by the Iraqi people brought praise from Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  who spent time in late June in Baghdad and Fallujah  and noted great progress among Iraqi security forces along with the formation of democratic rule to the country           The people of Iraq are sacrificing for the spread of democracy within their country and are defending it with pride     Crapo said      While I was in Iraq  I had a brief opportunity to meet with one of the drafters of the constitution and understand that reaching democracy in Iraq will certainly face challenges  but future Iraqi generations who will live under this constitution will be able to live in a country of freedom    In that short meeting  it was evident to me that the light of freedom and democracy burns brightly in Iraq as its citizens struggle to overcome the obstacles confronting it   During my visit  I saw Iraqis taking charge of their own affairs  securing their cities and neighborhoods  and this constitution is a clear sign of Iraqi independence   I look forward to the time that is growing ever closer when American and international assistance is no longer necessary in Iraq        Parliamentary elections under this new constitution are expected to take place on December 15th
