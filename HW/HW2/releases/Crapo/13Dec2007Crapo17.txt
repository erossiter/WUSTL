 Washington  DC  Under legislation passed by the U S  Senate  experienced pilots will no longer be grounded under an arbitrary age limit rule  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  H R  4343  the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act  passed the Senate by unanimous consent and will now be sent to the President for his signature  Crapo supported the measure  and also co sponsored similar legislation  S  65  in the Senate  which was championed by Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe  an active commercially rated pilot     This is a victory for our nations most experienced pilots  who are now suffering under the current age standards  Crapo said  Estimates are that every day  the Age 60 Rule results in the loss of five experienced pilots  This measure instructs the FAA to end this discriminatory rule immediately and to allow American pilots to fly until age 65  Unions and companies are still allowed to establish benefit agreements so that pilots can still retire at age 60 if they wish to do so  As long as a pilot can pass the FAA Medical Certification  they should be allowed to continue to fly  More experienced pilots result in safer passengers in our countrys airlines  and thats important to everyone who uses airline transportation     In 1959  the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  adopted the Age 60 Rule  It has faced increasing criticism that the rule has no scientific evidence to support it  In November of 2006  the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted a new international retirement standard of age 65  which brought increased scrutiny to the FAAs Age 60 Rule  The new international standard resulted in foreign pilots being allowed to fly within U S  airspace while American pilots of the same age have been denied the same right
