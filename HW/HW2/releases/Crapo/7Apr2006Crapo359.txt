 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says the proper balance has not yet been achieved in immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate  and expresses frustration with Senate Democrats holding up debate and votes on amendments to improve the legislation   Crapo says that while he supports the border security measurers considered on the floor of the Senate  disagreement remains over how to address illegal immigration        We must have the ability to secure our borders in order to enable a sensible guest worker program and national security   We have agreement on border security issues  but the Senate remains sharply divided over amendments related to amnesty and the reform of guest worker programs     Crapo said      A key principle of sound immigration policy is not rewarding illegal entry into the U S  through amnesty  While compromise legislation proposed in the Senate is a step in the right direction  more must be done to ensure that illegal immigration is not rewarded        I am hopeful that the Senate can work to pass meaningful legislation that does not reward illegal immigration through amnesty  includes strong border security and enforcement  and ensures that American citizens have the first right to available jobs     said Crapo
