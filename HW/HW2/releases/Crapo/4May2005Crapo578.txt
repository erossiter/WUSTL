 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo wants to keep a billion dollar fund for Crime Victims untouched by other federal government programs   The estimated  1 2 billion in the Crime Victims Fund is used in part in a federal program to assist victims of domestic violence       Crapo has alerted his Senate colleagues to a proposal to remove the money from its designated purpose and has co authored a letter seeking Senate support to keep the money where it is   Crapo will discuss the fund on Thursday at the renovation ceremony at the Nampa   s Family Justice Center        Crapo and Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vermont  have written fellow Senators because the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  has proposed removing money in the Crime Victims Fund so it can be used as general revenue   Crapo argues that Congress in 2000 capped the fund for the very purpose of stabilizing support for domestic violence victims  and that the present recommendations by OMB go too far          More than 4400 agencies  including many women and children in Idaho  benefit from this fund authorized under the Victims of Crime Act  VOCA      Crapo said      This money comes into federal coffers from those who commit domestic violence and other crimes and from forfeitures and other assessments   With federal dollars at a premium  I strongly reject efforts to take private dollars away from such a necessary program and I am convinced the Senate can head off this effort            When we had Senator Crapo speak before the National Network to End Domestic Violence convention in Washington  DC  he made a commitment before all of the advocates in attendance that he would stand up and fight to retain our VOCA dollars     said Sue Fellen  Executive Director for the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence     He has kept his word and we support his leadership on a national level regarding VOCA  This funding is critical for Idaho  our shelters and our programs             The absence of VOCA will result in a permanent failure of society to assist victims in recovering from the traumatic effects of crime and the resulting injustice     said Diane Blumel  Executive Director for the Idaho Coalition on Domestic Violence and Victims Assistance      We applaud and commend the accomplishments of Congressional leadership  particularly Senator Crapo  in supporting victims of crime and opposing this rescission          The Crapo Leahy letter will be sent to Senate appropriators seeking their support   As of last count  29 Senators had signed the letter seeking to keep the VOCA funding where it is      Click here to view the letter   pdf  180 kb    To directly link to this news release  please use the following address   http   www crapo senate gov media newsreleases release_full cfm id 237202
