 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts need increased treatment and attention regarding traumatic brain injury  TBI   This type of injury has been described as the signature wound of the recent Mideast conflicts because of the use of roadside bombs and other explosive devices that have been unique to the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan     My staff and I have spoken with hundreds of veterans suffering the effects of concussive injuries  such as those that are the result of roadside explosions  Crapo said  The Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Act directs the Veterans Administration to develop individualized recovery and treatment programs for this specific type of injury     Last May  a Pentagon task force warned that the military health system is overburdened and not sufficient to meet the needs of troops suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  PTSD  and other psychological problems  Several VA hospitals and treatment centers did not have workers trained in elements of closed head wounds such as PTSD and TBI  and this legislation seeks to address those issues     Crapo notes that TBIs are more prevalent in these wars due to better armor that men and women are wearing in combat  as well as better medical attention in the field  He says  while many more lives have been saved than in previous wars  there is now an increase of wounded vets  Scientists suggest that the number of soldiers returning with TBI is due to increased awareness  but also that many soldiers who suffered a TBI in previous wars may have died in combat     Ive been in close contact with the families of a number of Idaho veterans and families with concerns about the debilitating effect of traumatic brain injury  Crapo added  Im pleased to support this important legislation  along with my colleague Senator Craig  that aims to address some of the challenges to diagnosis  treatment and long term care of our wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan     The legislation  S  1233  was originally introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii   the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  It would authorize  3 million annually through 2012 to address traumatic brain injury research and treatment  and requires the Secretary of Defense to report back to Congress on the findings
