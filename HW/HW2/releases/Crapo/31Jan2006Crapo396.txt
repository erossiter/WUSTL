 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo released the following statement regarding the President s State of the Union Address this evening         The President addressed some very tough issues tonight and I commend him for the courage to do so   He offered explanations for terrorist surveillance and reiterated the goals and progress our military is achieving in Iraq   He also clearly laid out the concerns that face the United States if we were to simply pull our troops out of the Middle East        On the domestic front  he tackled the economic concerns that many of us share   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee  I am particularly interested in the Administration s budget proposal which will be unveiled next week   Tonight the President talked about reducing or eliminating dozens of ineffective and wasteful programs   I hope we can work together to make government effective and efficient   Entitlement spending is one of the most challenging issues that we will face as Baby Boomers turn 60   In the Senate Finance Committee  where I also serve  we will take up the concerns dealing with Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid   This spending is only going to increase as more Americans reach the appropriate age and it will be useful to have a commission to examine the full impact of Baby Boom retirements        I agree with the President s assessment on tax cuts  particularly capital gains and dividends   While I expect a continued full debate over making the tax cuts permanent  it is obvious that they have already played a role in economic growth   One example is the qualified tuition deduction for students   Congress must pass the reconciliation bill currently pending in the Senate  or this deduction will no longer be available to the many families who need it in order to afford a college education        The rising cost of health care will hit every American and I agree with the President s assessment that this must be dealt with   As a long time advocate of telehealth measures  I was pleased with his support of electronic health information technology   Health savings accounts are also a measure that can make a difference for individuals and small businesses         Lastly  the President s commitment to affordable energy was heartening   Without a strong commitment to research and education  we will not be able to meet our ever growing energy needs   With this speech tonight  the President has clearly outlined his goals for the next year and I look forward to working with him and other members of Congress to put together programs and legislation that will keep America strong
