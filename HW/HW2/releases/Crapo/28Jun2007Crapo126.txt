 Following the Supreme Courts refusal last week to hear two cases relating to multiple layers of tax on multi state businesses  today U S  Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho  and Charles E  Schumer  D New York  announced legislation that would relieve impacted businesses from the burden of double taxation  which results from a varying mix of state tax laws  At issue is whether companies  in addition to being taxed in the state where physically located  should also be subject to business activity taxes where they solicit business or have customers  even if they do not have employees or physical location in the state     The Schumer Crapo legislation  known as the Business Activity Tax Simplification Act  BATSA   codifies the physical presence standard  which is common practice for the imposition of sales and use taxes but not for income taxes  This bill would thus eliminate one type of double taxation and its resulting chilling effect on interstate commerce     Businesses should not be punished with double taxation simply because their products reach beyond state borders  said Schumer  At a minimum  this is a huge administrative burden  In the worst case scenario  these differing state tax treatments will drive businesses to states with more favorable laws  Either way  the effect on commerce is debilitating     Crapo said  This effort by a large number of states to impose business activity taxes based on economic presence has the potential to open a Pandoras Box of negative implications for businesses  Without clarification by Congress  states will be free to enact revenue raising nexus legislation and policies that  by definition  will not and cannot take into account the national impact of such activities     In recent years  states that impose taxes based on economic presence have caused widespread litigation and stifled commerce  With a dizzying maze of state and local tax rules  some enacted by legislatures and others imposed by state revenue authorities and upheld by state courts  simplification is desperately needed  according to Crapo and Schumer     The legislation will have positive benefits for companies big and small  For smaller businesses facing different taxing standards in different states  BATSA would eliminate costly litigation and administrative issues  For larger companies that have customers throughout the country  the legislation creates clarity and reduces the likelihood of double taxation  For the states  the bill creates a uniform taxing standard that permits them to compete on a level playing field for business activity and jobs  while establishing a predictable and relatively easily discernable tax base     On June 18  2007  the Supreme Court denied certiorari in two cases that challenged the constitutionality of taxing companies with no physical presence in a state  making the Schumer Crapo legislation even more necessary  In addition to ignoring the tax imbalance  the courts inaction has emboldened at least one state to introduce new legislation that would allow it to levy taxes on based economic presence  and states could follow suit if Congress doesnt act  notedboth Senators    In short  this is no longer a theoretical discussion  Schumer said  I believe that Congress has a duty to prevent some states from impeding the free flow and development of interstate commerce and to prevent double taxation     The Schumer Crapo legislation updates current law by codifying the physical presence standard  requiring a business to have a physical presence  such as employees or property  in the state before it can be subject to state business activity taxes  The bill establishes a bright line standard that will eliminate any confusion for both state tax administrators and businesses as to the circumstances under which businesses are subject to state business activity tax  BAT   Under BATSA  mere economic activity  such as in state customers  would be insufficient for a state to impose income and other business activity taxes on out of state businesses  Firm guidance on what activities can be conducted within a state that will trigger that states taxing power will provide certainty to tax administrators and business  reduce multiple taxation of the same income  and will reduce compliance and enforcement costs for states and businesses alike
