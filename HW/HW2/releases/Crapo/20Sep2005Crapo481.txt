 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo co sponsored a bill today to protect rural schools by more fully addressing the challenges posed by federally imposed school transfer requirements   S  696  the Rural School Geography Act  takes rural concerns into account by not requiring local education agencies to provide a student with the option to transfer to another school if providing the option is impractical due to  the distance to be traveled  a geographical barrier or hazard  or an unusually high cost of travel   Under the No Child Left Behind  NCLB  act  rural schools or districts that do not meet Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  requirements must transfer students to other schools or districts  regardless of the distance to be traveled  geographic barriers  or burdensome cost          In education policy  one size does not fit all and it   s important that local and state officials have the ability to make the educational choices that are best for each community     Crapo said      While children should not be forced to attend schools that are not making the grade  there needs to be flexibility for local officials to allow for the reality of the distance between schools and districts in rural areas   That distance is usually much greater than in urban areas   Unfortunately  current regulations do not address this situation in rural states   This mandate could put severe financial strain on schools that may already be struggling   Transporting a student over long distances to an alternative school leaves a student with less time for homework  extra curricular activities  family  and work   This legislation makes school transfers a matter for local leaders to decide  rather than leaving the decision to officials in Washington   It is my hope that none of Idaho   s schools face this situation  nonetheless  the federal mandate must recognize the rural distances involved and provide for the best solution for the student           In Idaho  only 33 school districts out of over 100 have more than one elementary school     said Sherri Wood  President of the Idaho Education Association      Idaho students will have to travel long distances to attend another school   As a parent  I want what   s best for my child   An arrangement that has a child on a bus for long periods of time just to get to and from school is not conducive to a positive educational experience   We appreciate Senator Crapo   s co sponsorship of this bill  as it will be a positive change to NCLB for the benefit of Idaho   s students  parents  and teachers
