 Washington  DC   In a Senate Finance Committee briefing this morning  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo noted that the state of Idaho is doing nation leading work in managing the complexity and inevitable start up problems associated with the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit   Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Administrator Mark McClellan addressed Crapo and other Finance Committee members regarding the program  which began a few weeks ago        Leavitt and McClellan noted that more than 40 000 seniors are signing up for the prescription benefit every day   They also addressed concerns with states being reimbursed for drug costs that are not paid for by the Medicare drug plans   McClellan has indicated that Medicare will cover any gap between the prescription drug plan payment and the actual cost incurred by the state   In addition  states will be reimbursed for drug costs for beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare as well        Following the briefing  Crapo said   This prescription drug benefit is the most significant change since the inception of Medicare and it is only expected that trouble spots would arise   While many of the problems were anticipated  a few were not and we are fixing them   I am pleased that Secretary Leavitt and Administrator McClellan have been working to address each of the problems   Overall  the State of Idaho has done a great job in educating and enrolling Medicare beneficiaries into the program   We must make certain that the problems with co payments  computers  and delivery that have been cropping up throughout the country are addressed and that seniors are able to access quality health care and drug benefit coverage   We should not let these problems overshadow the fact that every day there are folks who are paying far less for their medications than they were before   I am particularly heartened that Idahoans have found ready resources for questions and problems that have arisen for them         For seniors who are experiencing problems or have questions  please call 1 800 MEDICARE  633 4227  or the Idaho s Senior Health Insurance Benefit Advisors Program  SHIBA  at 1  800  247 4422  Information is also available on the Internet at http   www medicare gov pdphome asp and http   www doi state id us shiba shibahealth aspx        FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
