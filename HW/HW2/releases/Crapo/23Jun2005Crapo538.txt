 Washington  DC     The Idaho congressional delegation is pleased with the Interior Department   s announcement today that Idaho counties will receive  15 8 million in Payment In Lieu of Taxes  PILT  from the federal government   That is up 4 percent from the previous year and represents a significant boost to local county coffers      Elmore  Cassia and Blaine counties each will receive over  1 million in PILT funds   Each one of the 44 counties in the state will receive funds   A copy of the full list of payments to Idaho counties accompanies this news release      The delegation said     In a state like Idaho  where so much of the land is owned by the federal government  PILT funds provide a much needed offset to counties   Rural counties have infrastructure needs and must pay for essential services like law enforcement  schools  and firefighting   When a large portion of the county is exempt from taxes  that makes funding those efforts very difficult   Today   s announcement of the 2005 PILT funds for Idaho and other states is very welcome   We are also very pleased that the funds will be available before the end of the month  which will be in advance of the end of the fiscal year for many counties         The PILT payments should be sent out on or about June 24  2005   The funds have been used to help improve local schools  water and road systems   The funds are collected by Interior Department for commercial and recreational activities on federal lands   In 2005  the Department will collect nearly  13 billion for such activities   The payments are made for federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management  the National Park Service  the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  the USDA Forest Service  Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation water projects and some military installations
