 Many Idahoans can relax now that April 15 has come and gone   Another season of complicated forms and confusing instructions is behind us  for another nine months  at least        Taxes aren   t the most exciting topic of conversation  but they affect us in a fundamental way   The President   s newly formed Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform has finished its first phase of examination of the existing tax system   The panel held public meetings in seven major cities across the United States over the past three months and solicited public comments at its website  www taxreformpanel gov   My position on the Senate Finance Committee allows me to review solutions recommended by the panel   solutions to many problems that plague our system     The panel has articulated what we already suspected   We   ve come a long way from the original purpose of federal taxes which is to fund the operations of government   Funding should be shouldered by all in a fair  simple and broad based manner   Currently  the sheer complexity of the tax code costs Americans  1 000 per family annually when tax preparations costs are averaged out    Money magazine asked 50 tax professionals to calculate a theoretical family   s taxes   Fifty different calculations for the tax bill resulted  ranging from  12 500 to  35 000   The correct tax  according to the accountant who    created    the family  was  23 000        Families have access to 15 common tax benefits   These have 14 different provisions to reduce benefits above specified income levels that  in turn  contain nine different income definitions   Another provision  the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  was created to prevent high income individuals from utilizing tax loopholes to avoid taxes   It was never indexed for inflation and when the temporary income adjustment expires at the end of this year  the number of AMT taxpayers will increase 800 percent   This means that the 6 000 Idaho filers subject to the AMT in 2003 could reach 50 000 in 2006   Under current law  married taxpayers filing jointly with two children whose combined income exceeds  67 000 will be subject to AMT next year  regardless of whether they itemize or take the standard deduction      It isn   t breaking news to individuals and business owners that this complexity and uncertainty adversely affects investment and resource allocation decisions  inhibiting overall economic growth      Prioritizing and trimming tax laws is complex  but the bottom line is this   taxes are money that hard working Americans pay to fund projects that support the public good   As such  the burden should fall to everyone in an equitable manner  Common investment in the public good dictates that the way a fair tax is determined should be straight forward enough for the average taxpayer to understand   Predictability and stability in the tax code will promote savings and investment and grow our economy  benefiting everyone       Our income is our property and government must protect our right to do with it what we choose   James Madison said as much in 1792  and the last time I checked  the Constitution under which authority he was speaking is the same one we have today     A just security to property is not afforded by that government  under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species  where arbitrary taxes invade the domestic sanctuaries of the rich  and excessive taxes grind the faces of the poor  where the keenness and competitions of want are deemed an insufficient spur to labor  and taxes are again applied  by an unfeeling policy  as another spur  in violation of that sacred property  which Heaven    kindly reserved to him  in the small repose that could be spared from the supply of his necessities         WORD COUNT   592
