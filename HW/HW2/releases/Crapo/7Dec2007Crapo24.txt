 Washington DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says the Senate vote approving a temporary one year fix to the problems created by the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  is a long overdue first step  but now a vote is needed to repeal the tax completely  Crapo is a sponsor of legislation to repeal the tax  which is now hitting middle income Americans  something it was not intended to do     This most recent vote will  for this year  prevent an unexpected tax increase on thousands of Idahoans  Crapo said  I appreciate the acceptance by Senate leadership that it is not good policy to raise taxes on the American people to offset the  50 billion the government was never intending to collect in the first place     It is now up to the House to follow suit and approve this bill without tax increases and get it to the President as soon as possible  Crapo added  Ultimately  a permanent fix is needed  It is not good policy to kick this can down the road from one year to the next  The AMT should be permanently repealed     Crapo  who serves on the Senate Finance Committee  has been a strong voice for repeal of the AMT  which was implemented in the mid 1960s to prevent a handful of wealthy Americans  fewer than 200 nationwide  who had used loopholes to legally avoid paying any taxes  It is estimated that as many as 90 000 Idahoans could face the AMT for 2007 if the fix is not enacted  Congressional leadership has not expressed any intention to repeal or index the AMT
