 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas  have introduced bipartisan legislation to bring needed reforms to the No Child Left Behind  NCLB  education bill  The legislation  S  1913  the No Child Left Behind Enhancement Act  comes after Crapos and Lincolns offices have consulted with education leaders  school board members and interested citizens from their respective states on what kind of reform is needed for NCLB to work better     The NCLB legislation has brought improvements in student performance  but at the same time there have been unintended problems created by the legislation  Crapo noted  Idaho educators  parents and administrators told me that many of the provisions in the original legislation didnt account for specific challenges faced by states like ours  That is why it is necessary to make revisions that will give Idaho and other states more flexibility to use additional methods to gauge student progress  that set up more rational policies for tutoring and other supplemental services  that will make it easier for students with disabilities or language difficulties to be fairly tested and assessed  and that ensure schools have the special education teachers they need to help their students  We all want our children to receive the best education possible  and I will continue to push for reasonable  realistic improvements that will benefit Idahos students as well as many others throughout the nation     While we all support the intent of No Child Left Behind  we also need to look at ways to better address the needs of our schools and to ensure that we provide our children with the knowledge and training they will require for the future  Lincoln said  During my educational tour  I had the opportunity to hear from teachers  administrators  parents  and students about what aspects of the policy work and what changes are needed as we move toward reauthorization  The bill Senator Crapo and I have introduced would implement many of the recommendations we have heard from our constituents and would give schools the flexibility and the tools they need to help students succeed while maintaining accountability measures     Crapo noted with NCLB up for reauthorization this year  a bipartisan bill is the best way to find agreement on reforms in a divided Senate  The new bill is similar to one Crapo introduced last January  but now addresses special needs areas more specifically  The bill is supported by numerous Idaho teachers  administrator  and school organizations     Among the new provisions in the bill is language allowing flexibility in hiring special education teachers  Many school districts report a shortage  The bill also gives local school districts more input into the selection of supplemental service providers  who can provide tutoring assistance to children in the district  Currently  districts have little or no say in determining the qualifications of those providers     The bill will be referred to the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee for consideration  No hearing date has yet been set
