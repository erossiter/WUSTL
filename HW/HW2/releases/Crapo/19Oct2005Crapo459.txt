 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  will offer an amendment today during the Committee   s markup of agriculture reconciliation legislation to reallocate nearly  1 billion from reauthorizing the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  The amendment would restore proposed reductions in funding for conservation  commodity and research programs       The MILC program  which expired at the end of September  was originally included in the 2002 Farm Bill   The program has already cost taxpayers more than  2 billion  with only a small group of dairy farmers benefiting   Crapo is bringing the amendment because of concerns raised in meetings with Idaho dairymen as well as many others through the agriculture and conservation communities   Additionally  reauthorizing the MILC program to benefit a small number comes at the expense of many other commodity  conservation and research programs that are vital to agriculture as a whole   Currently  an extension of the MILC program is included in the 2006 Agriculture Budget Reconciliation measure         As Congress works to fund hurricane relief efforts and extend vital tax relief for teachers  students  small businesses and middle income families  it is necessary that we stay the course on budget reconciliation     Crapo said      However  reauthorizing MILC through budget reconciliation at the cost of  998 million is effectively being done at the expense of other farm  conservation  and research programs   Farm families are working to stay viable in the wake of extreme weather conditions and soaring fuel prices  and they should not have to face reduced payments and pared down conservation and research programs simply to reauthorize an ineffective program        Specifically  Crapo   s amendment  which is co sponsored by Senator Pat Roberts  R Kansas  and Senator Craig Thomas  R Wyoming   would return  615 million to commodity programs through a decrease in the 2 5 percent reduction in producer payments to 1 28 percent and a decrease in the sugar forfeiture penalty from 1 2 percent to 0 66 percent   Additionally  the amendment would return  333 million to conservation programs by eliminating the  129 million reductions to the Conservation Reserve Program  CRP   the  104 million reductions to the Environmental Quality Incentives     Program  EQIP  and decrease by  100 million the reductions to the Conservation Security Program  CSP    The amendment would also restore  50 million to the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems program         Conservation programs have been instrumental in assisting producers and landowners with meeting environmental goals while enhancing and contributing to wildlife habitat  and the agriculture industry is working hard to compete successfully on a global market     said Crapo      These programs that assist farmers with competing successfully and continuing to be good stewards of the land should be properly supported        The Agriculture Budget Reconciliation legislation that is before committee today will go to the Senate Budget Committee  where it will be bundled into a comprehensive budget reconciliation package before going to the Senate floor in the coming weeks   The committee also previously stated the reconciliation package will not include a previously proposed reduction of  547 million from the food stamp program
