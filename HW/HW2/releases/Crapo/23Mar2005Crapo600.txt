 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  co Chairman and founder of the Congressional COPD  Cardiopulmonary Obstructive Disease  Caucus  applauded the decision from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS  to add smoking cessation counseling and coverage for its beneficiaries   Smoking cessation products will be covered under the new Medicare drug benefit program starting next year if they are prescribed by a physician           Too many of our Medicare dollars are being spent to treat illnesses created or exacerbated by the smoking habit     Crapo said      These illnesses could be much more effectively treated through preventative measures   Since the bulk of Medicare spending goes to such diseases  this change will end up saving money and improving the lives for those seniors who want to quit smoking   Since its formation  the COPD Caucus made this issue one of its priorities   I am pleased that CMS has responded to this concern and taken another step toward improving the health and lives of seniors           Under the decision announced  a Medicare beneficiary must have an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use   Such illnesses would include cardiovascular disease  lung disease  weak bones  blood clots and cataracts   Seniors who take medications for diabetes  high blood pressures  blood clots and depression are also eligible because tobacco use reduces the effectiveness of the medications used to treat those conditions          It is estimated that nearly 10 percent of Americans 65 and older smoke cigarettes   Approximately 300 000 of those will die annually from smoking related disease        The final Medicare decision is available on the CMS website at https   www cms gov coverage
