 Washington  DC     With five years of collaborative work backing him  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo today introduced wide ranging legislation that could set a standard for future public lands management   The Owyhee Initiative Implementation Act will end decades of public lands conflict in  southwestern Idaho and establish a path for future management of that area   Ranching will continue  traditional uses are preserved  water rights are protected  wilderness is designated and a path to the future is set forth          This is a unique opportunity to set the standard for collaborative decision making     Crapo said      The Owyhee Initiative is a model for solving public lands management issues   This legislation enjoys far reaching support because of the strong and unified group of landowners  conservationists  ranchers  tribal leaders  Air Force personnel  environmental groups  sportsmen  off road enthusiasts and locally elected leaders who have negotiated a path forward that meets everyone   s principal objectives            On behalf of this extraordinary group of people  I seek Congressional approval of this collaborative effort  which was built from the ground up by those who live on and use the land in Owyhee County  to resolve land use conflicts   I am proud to be a part of this effort and I pledge to do everything in my power to move it swiftly through the Congress and to the President   s desk for his signature     Crapo added       Principal features of the legislation include             Development  funding and implementation of a landscape scale program to review  recommend and coordinate landscape conservation and research projects                   Scientific review process to assist the Bureau of Land Management          Designation of Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers                   Release of Wilderness Study Areas                     Protections of tribal cultural and historical resources against intentional and unintentional abuse and desecration         Development and implementation by the BLM of travel plans for public lands                    A board of directors with oversight over the administration and implementation of the Owyhee Initiative       Crapo continued     This can   t be called a ranching bill  a wilderness bill  an Air Force bill or a Tribal bill   It is a comprehensive land management bill   Each interest received enough to enthusiastically support the final product  advocate for its enactment and  most importantly  support the final objectives of those with whom they had previous conflict   There will be opposition  but it will come from a few principal sources   those who simply oppose wilderness designation  those who don   t want livestock anywhere on public lands  and those who do not want to see collaboration succeed   While I respect that opposition  it is better to move forward with this joint effort that manages the conflict and the land rather than exploits the disagreements          The Owyhee Initiative Implementation Act will preserve public lands ranching for future generations   Motorized access is assured on more than 9 800 miles of roads and enhanced on private lands   The Act designates 517 000 acres of wilderness and releases 199 000 acres of Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use   The Act also designates 386 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers while protecting all water rights   The Air Force will continue to train pilots in the area   The cultural resources that are of spiritual significance to the Shoshone Paiute Tribe are protected            Crapo   s involvement with the Initiative began in 2001 when the Owyhee County Commissioners asked him to help mediate discussions that could lead to a collaborative agreement regarding public lands management in the county   He met several times with members of the Initiative work group  which reached final consensus on the agreement   s language late last month   Crapo announced the agreement to the Owyhee Cattlemen   s Association annual meeting in Silver City last weekend       Crapo concluded his floor statement by thanking the Initiative work group and others involved in the process over the last five years      I would like to recognize and thank the diverse cast of those people who have been the real engine driving this process   This process truly benefited from the diversity of these groups and their willingness to cooperate to reach a common goal of protecting the land on which they live  work  and play           The Working Group included
