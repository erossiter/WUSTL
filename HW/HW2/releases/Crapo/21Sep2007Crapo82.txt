 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapos groundbreaking legislation to update the Endangered Species Act took a key step toward becoming law today  The legislation  the Endangered Species Recovery Act  S  700   cleared the Senate Finance Committee as part of a larger measure  the Habitat and Land Conservation Act  Crapos bill provides tax incentives for private landowners to improve habitat for endangered and threatened species     Support for this consensus approach to species recovery has been growing since Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas  and I first introduced the legislation in December of 2005  Crapo said  We now have 22 co sponsors  Democrats  Republicans and Independents  which include the Senate Majority Leader and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee  The language for ESRA was not amended and I am pleased to see it combined with related species recovery efforts as we move the legislation through the Senate     The package approved today by the Finance Committee has a companion bill in the House  H R  1422  which is before the House Ways and Means Committee  Under the legislation  landowners including farmers and ranchers would receive tax credits for participating in species recovery efforts     Endangered species recovery will accelerate as a result of this legislation  and it involves a lot more people in species recovery efforts  Crapo said  Over 80  of endangered species live on private land  encouraging private property owners to be part of the solution in assisting those species is essential  This legislation addresses that fact by encouraging landowner cooperation to avoid conflict and provide real results for species recovery by providing needed habitat  The support of more than a hundred interest groups and so many Senators demonstrates we can break through the gridlock that has stalled needed legislation for species recovery  Todays action is a victory for the collaborative work between our office and Senator Lincolns with Finance Committee leadership  as well as the many conservation  natural resource and other groups who have lent their support and expertise to this legislation     Groups with wide ranging interests and coalitions have endorsed the measure  including  The National Wildlife Federation  American Farm Bureau  Environmental Defense  National Association of Conservation Districts  National Stone  Sand  Gravel Association  Defenders of Wildlife  Ducks Unlimited and many others have contributed to the legislative effort     Crapo says the program could enlist more than two million acres of private land in species recovery efforts by offering tax credits  The provisions are modeled after many voluntary programs in the Farm Bill
