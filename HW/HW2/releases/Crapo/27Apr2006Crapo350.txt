 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln introduced the bipartisan Forest Service Partnership Act  which will improve the ability of the Forest Service to work cooperatively with local communities and others to improve conservation results   Crapo  who chairs the Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry  Conservation and Rural Revitalization  authored the bill to advance the enactment of cooperative legislation that better enables federal agencies to work collaboratively and efficiently      The Act gives the Forest Service permanent authority to work with other federal agencies  communities  tribal governments  and the private sector on conservation projects   Among its various benefits  the legislation would allow park visitors to purchase health and safety items in remote Forest Service locations  permit joint facilities and research publications  This type of partnership allowed for the construction of a new channel on Granite Creek near Lake Pend Oreille   That allowed for trout habitat restoration on six miles of stream        Collaboration is essential to achieve conservation success and to ensure the access and services for people visiting our national forests     Crapo said      This bill will increase federal efficiency and involve communities and private citizens to best meet conservation needs on our lands   Ultimately all park visitors will benefit through better services and accessibility   We must remove obstacles that stand in the way of this cooperative work and this bill aids in doing just that        In FY2005  the Forest Service entered into more than 3 000 cooperative agreements  including partnerships in Idaho  and this legislative partnership would permanently allow those cooperative agreements rather than having to be reauthorized by Congress each year   The partnerships also allowed for more than  70 million of multi source funding to be used on projects aimed at conservation efforts
