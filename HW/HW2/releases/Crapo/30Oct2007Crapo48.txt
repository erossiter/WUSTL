 Washington  DC  The U S  Senate has approved an Amtrak rail passenger service spending bill that will likely result in a renewed effort to return service to southern Idaho  if the U S  House agrees  Idaho Senator Mike Crapos amendment including Idaho specific language about returning Amtrak was approved as a part of the full bill  which passed on a vote of 70 to 22     Idahoans are contacting our offices and showing overwhelming support for returning Amtrak service to southern Idaho  Crapo said  We now have approval by the U S  Senate and the written commitment by Amtraks president that he will come to Idaho  hold meetings  and discuss passenger service with Idahoans     Crapos amendment approved in the Senate bill seeks to ensure Amtrak fairly considers rural communities not well served by passenger rail transportation  It would reduce from two years to one the time frame under which Amtrak must study returning the route to Idaho  and it requires Amtrak to use the same methodology to make decisions about the Pioneer Route that it uses on all service decisions     Now the vote goes to the House  but it appears Idahoans  and communities in Idaho  Oregon  and other Western states will have a chance to make their voices heard regarding passenger rail trains as a transportation alternative in the West  Crapo said     Last week  Crapo received a letter from Alex Kummant  President and CEO of Amtrak  In the letter  Kummant states I will make it a personal priority of mine to visit your home state and learn firsthand of the opportunities that exist in Idaho and other western states for expanded intercity passenger rail service  Amtrak served Boise  Shoshone  Pocatello  and other cities with the former Pioneer Route
