 Washington  DC     Idaho residents must continue to work together to find solutions to ongoing water issues or risk the threat that the federal government or interests from out of state will step in to override local interests  warned Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo spoke by satellite this morning to attendees at the Idaho Statesman and Andrus Center   s    Troubled Water    conference at Boise State University         The federal government now offers the    carrot and stick    of landowner incentives and water regulatory authority under laws like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Water Act     Crapo said      But the federal government has also recognized state water authority   Proactive planning must continue so that states retain water control     Crapo said      With the drought  we will see increasing pressure regarding water allocation issues   We must focus on collaboration and consensus driven decisions at the local level  which can then be brought to the Congress for ratification         Crapo held water talks between irrigators and salmon advocates in September 2003   He has also spearheaded collaborative efforts related to elk recovery  the Owyhee Initiative  and  most recently  reducing litigation and improving recovery efforts under the Endangered Species Act        He said locally driven consensus planning improves state water control issues before the Congress      The dynamics surrounding the close voting margins in the United States Senate mean that the proposals with the most success will come from local collaborative efforts agreed to by all sides of an issue   The more we can agree at the local level  the better the chance that local agreement will survive a vote in a divided Senate     Crapo added      Crapo also commented briefly on his efforts to improve the ESA in response to questions from participants at the conference   He said a bipartisan coalition of both the U S  House and Senate are working to reduce litigation which robs resources that could better be spent recovering species   Crapo noted the group is focusing on what is politically and legally achievable to repeat the problems of lawsuits which stop progress under the ESA      To directly link to this news release please use the following address  http   crapo senate gov media newsreleases release_full cfm id 236665
