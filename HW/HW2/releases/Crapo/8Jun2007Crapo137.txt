 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo applauded today s announcement by the U S  Department of Homeland Security to permit U S  passport applicants to travel while their applications are being reviewed   Under new regulations  travelers by air to and from countries in North America must have a valid passport         Crapo noted his office has received many calls from Idahoans concerning delays in receiving their passports   Many of those who called received assistance that ultimately led to successful travel plans  but applications for passports have risen as high as one half million per week  creating a severe backlog        Allowing those who have applied for passports the ability to show an official receipt and keep their travel plans is a common sense solution to dealing with the backlog of applications   Crapo noted    Even so  I still advise travelers to plan far ahead for when they might be traveling outside the country and will need a passport to do so   I encourage the Department of Homeland Security to continue to work with affected travelers to meet their travel documentation needs        The changes permit travelers to produce a State Department receipt  showing they have applied for a passport  along with government issued identification for airline travel to and from Canada  Mexico  the Caribbean and Bermuda   Destinations outside those areas still require a passport       The changes will remain in effect until the end of September   The rules do not affect Americans driving across the borders contiguous with the U S  or traveling by sea  Those travelers may need passports by January of next year         For more information  contact Crapo s web site at http   crapo senate gov   Citizens with existing passport applications can also obtain proof of application on line at http   travel state gov
