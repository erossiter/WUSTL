 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted today to confirm Alberto Gonzales as the U S  Attorney General   The final vote in the U S  Senate was 60 to 36   Gonzales most recently served as White House Counsel to President Bush         Today   s vote has been the focus of much protest and media reporting  and I fully reject the characterization that the vote is about the issue of torture     Crapo explained      Like the President and Alberto Gonzales  I condemn torture and my record in Congress is clear in my support of promoting human rights abroad   Alberto Gonzales is eminently qualified for this position  his entire professional life has demonstrated a respect for and a devotion to the rule of law   Much has been said in the media about his alleged remarks regarding torture  but his record is clear   he has clearly  consistently and forcefully stated that he does not condone torture   He has further stated that he would  as Attorney General  prosecute those who engage in torture          Crapo also noted that reports that Gonzales authored a 2002 memorandum that stated that certain acts were not    torture    are inaccurate   According to the Office of Legal Counsel  the memo was not authored by Gonzales and contains the Justice Department   s interpretation of the torture statute  not Gonzales         Furthermore  there is nothing in that memo that changed the President   s directive that detainees be treated humanely     Crapo said      Judge Gonzales has made it clear as well that he does not consider anyone  including the President  to be above the law   Throughout the confirmation hearing process  he has been consistent and measured in his responses  even in the face of heinous allegations   Alberto Gonzales    confirmation as the U S  Attorney is a remarkable achievement and I expect his service to our country will be outstanding                    FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
