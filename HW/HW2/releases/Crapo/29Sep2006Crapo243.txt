 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring a Senate bill that moves up the shipment of spent nuclear waste from Idaho to the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada   One of the provisions of the bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R New Mexico  would put Idaho waste stored at the Idaho National Laboratory on a fast track for transfer to Yucca   Under the measure  shipments could come years earlier than a 1995 court mandated deadline of 2035   The legislation  S  3962  was introduced earlier this week in the U S  Senate  with Domenici and Idaho senior Senator Larry Craig as its chief sponsors       This bill is another step to ensure interim waste stored in Idaho is moved out as soon as possible     Crapo said      Storing spent waste in Idaho and at reactor sites around the country is ill advised when we have a national repository created by Congress to house it   Chairman Domenici and Senator Craig are to be commended for their work in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to target Idaho waste for accelerated removal and resume construction at Yucca Mountain       The Nuclear Waste Acceleration to Yucca  NU WAY  legislation instructs the Department of Energy  DOE  to move ahead to build a surface storage facility at the Yucca Mountain repository site at the same time it files its license application for the repository   It authorizes the DOE to begin moving defense fuel and waste to the repository as soon as the permit is received   It further authorizes DOE to begin moving civilian nuclear waste under certain conditions and accelerates those shipments by more than five years     Congress approved Yucca Mountain as the national repository for spent nuclear fuel in 2002   Planning delays and opposition have slowed the opening of the site   Crapo said the measure would not only speed up the removal of waste from Idaho  but also could bring resurgence in the creation of nuclear power sources to meet the nation   s energy demands
