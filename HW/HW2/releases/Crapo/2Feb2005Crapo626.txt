 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo praised President Bush   s State of the Union address this evening  saying that the President has set a blueprint for his second term that will ensure a better  stronger country for future generations         With the State of the Union and Inaugural addresses delivered just days apart  President Bush has had an important opportunity to lay out his domestic and foreign policy goals     Crapo said      Tonight he clearly set forth an ambitious agenda that will touch the lives of Americans for generations   Without a doubt  the Social Security system needs to be addressed  and I agree with the President that we must confront this problem now   It is imperative that we continue building on the economic momentum we have seen in the last few years   Americans should have the opportunity to keep more of what they earn and we must also find ways to reduce ever burgeoning federal spending         Regarding foreign policy  the tribute given to our men and women in the military was very important   So many have made the ultimate sacrifice and we still have many thousands of Americans in harm   s way   Events in the past few days have demonstrated how important freedom is to others in the world  not just to Americans  and it is my hope that we as a country will stand behind our military forces and stand as a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world         One of the greatest challenges we will face as Congress takes a look at the President   s agenda is the intractability that has been encountered in recent years   We simply must look beyond partisan goals and find common ground as Americans   It is imperative that the Members of Congress recognize that partisanship will not serve the American people   I look forward to a spirited  full debate about these issues as we move through the 109th Congress
