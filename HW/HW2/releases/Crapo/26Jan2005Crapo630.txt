 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted with the majority today as the U S  Senate confirmed the first four members of President Bush   s second term Cabinet   Crapo supported Secretary of State designate Condoleezza Rice because of her strong background and career in foreign policy both in and outside of government and says Rice also brings other qualities for consideration  saying she offers continuity at the U S  Department of State   Additionally  Crapo says Rice stands out as a successful role model for women and minorities          President Bush has had an outstanding Secretary of State in Colin Powell and there are not many people who could replace him  making Condoleezza Rice an excellent choice     Crapo said      Dr  Rice has been an architect of our National Security Strategy and a central player in the war against terrorism   She has already served three Presidents and has worked extensively in Middle East policy  as well as with Russian and Chinese relations          Crapo added     Dr  Rice has won the trust of the President  his staff  and many of us in the Congress  Her work and success have made her a role model for leadership among women and minorities in the federal government   For these reasons  and many others  I expect her to be overwhelmingly accepted by members of Congress as she begins her work as Secretary          Crapo also voted today to support three other nominations from the White House   He supports new Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman   s call to prioritize a national energy policy      I am renewing my call that energy policy revisions be made a high priority in the President   s second term and before this Congress   I look forward to working with Secretary Bodman on these energy priorities and am confident he will be a strong advocate for energy research  such as the nuclear research planned in Idaho at the Idaho National Laboratory     Crapo said       Crapo had already voted to support incoming Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee  of which he is a new member this session   He also supports incoming Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson      I have long respected Mike Leavitt   s leadership as the former governor of Utah and as EPA Administrator  and I am confident Jim Nicholson will bring the energy we need at a critical time at the Department of Veterans Affairs     Crapo added
