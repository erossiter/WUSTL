 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted against S  2611  the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006  in the Senate today  citing concerns with incentives for further illegal immigration  high costs  and the substantial burden that the legislation would place on hard working Americans to fund the bill          It is understandable why many would want to immigrate to America     Crapo said      America is a land of opportunity and freedom and represents those ideals to many throughout the world   However  in order to maintain the strength of this country  we must uphold our laws   I have been very concerned about the amnesty provisions included in this measure and ultimately could not support the bill  even though there are some good provisions in it           It is a contradiction to try to curb illegal immigration by providing a path to citizenship for millions of people who entered the country illegally     said Crapo      Granting amnesty instead rewards those who broke the law at the expense of those who are attempting to enter our country through legal channels   This will only create incentives for further illegal immigration        The legislation  which passed the U S  Senate by a vote of 62 to 36  permits all illegal immigrants and future foreign workers who enroll in the temporary worker program to be placed on a pathway to citizenship   Additionally  it provides exemption from immigration caps to the spouses and children of those in the U S  illegally who would be eligible for permanent residency under the legislation        A temporary worker program ought to be focused on employment  and not an expedited path to citizenship     explained Crapo      Guest workers should be allowed to apply for citizenship under our existing immigration laws  however  they should be required to get in line with everyone else who has followed the law      Crapo supported an amendment to define the temporary worker visa in the bill as an access to employment in the United States  not permanent residence or citizenship   However  the amendment failed to get the votes necessary to be added to the bill     Additionally  the legislation would substantially increase the federal deficit   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate bill will increase federal spending by  54 billion in the first ten years alone          As American families are dealing with high fuel prices and other costs  I could not vote for such a drastic burden on taxpayers that would add billions of dollars to a huge federal deficit     said Crapo      This has to be done a better way        Senate budget rules provide for any member to challenge legislation that increases federal spending by  5 billion in any 10 year period beginning in 2016   Crapo supported Senator Wayne Allard   s  R Colorado  unsuccessful budget point of order challenge to the immigration legislation     Crapo maintains that the backbone of solid immigration policy is securing the nation   s borders  He supported an amendment offered by Senator John Ensign  R Nevada  to authorize President Bush   s plan to utilize National Guard troops at the border and an amendment offered by Senator Jeff Sessions  R Alabama  to provide 370 miles of border fencing   Both amendments passed   These measures would be added to the numerous resources authorized in the bill to secure the land borders  and enforce internal immigration laws   Crapo supports these measures  but does not want to see them undermined by amnesty provisions also in the legislation     Additionally  Crapo was an original co sponsor of the Northern Border Prosecution Initiative  NBPI   which is included in S  2611   The Initiative  modeled after the successful Southwest Border Prosecution Initiative  provides reimbursements to state and local governments along the northern border for costs these jurisdictions incur in disposing of federally initiated referred cases      The NBPI will be a valuable resource to law enforcement officials in North Idaho  and I am pleased that it was included in the legislation     Crapo said     Crapo supports a workable guest worker program that ensures Americans have the first right to available jobs and provides employers with a reliable  legal system to employ guest workers   Such a system can provide a temporary legal status for those currently in the U S   but the program should not include a path to citizenship and should focus on employment          There has been a lot of talk about the need to secure our borders     said Crapo      It is time that the talk ends  and the work to accomplish this task begins   In order to get control of the illegal immigration situation  illegal entry into our country must be stopped   Getting our borders under control will better enable a workable guest worker program        The Senate has debated the immigration bill for the past two weeks   In total  44 amendments have been offered  with 27 receiving Senate approval   Approximately nine days of debate have been spent on the measure in the last two weeks        Unfortunately  several amendments that would better shape this legislation into something more reasonable for this nation have been defeated throughout this process     Crapo concluded      I am hopeful that House and Senate conference on the bill will produce a better crafted bill   The bottom line is we could do it better  and we should do it better   This nation deserves more        The measure now moves into a conference committee with H R  4437  the Border Protection  Antiterrorism  and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005  which passed the U S  House of Representatives on December 16  2005     FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio
