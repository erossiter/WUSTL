 Washington  DC     As the Senate Finance Committee continues work on preserving and protecting Social Security  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has joined with several colleagues on legislation that would prevent Social Security surpluses from being used for anything except Social Security   The bill     Stop the Raid on Social Security Act of 2005     will be introduced on Thursday by South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint along with Senators Rick Santorum  R Pennsylvania   Lindsay Graham  R South Carolina   Tom Coburn  R Oklahoma  and Crapo   It creates personal    lock box    accounts for the funds  preventing them from being used for other federal purposes      The measure stops Social Security surpluses from being spent on other government programs and ensures that the funds  which amount to over  790 billion from 2006 2016  are used only to pay for Social Security benefits   It does not create any changes for present or near retirees or to disability benefits   It allows private accounts to be set up for individuals born in 1950 or later  workers may opt out if they do not want to set up such an account      Crapo said     It   s a matter of being honest with the American people   This legislation does not aim to address the looming solvency issue  but before we can tackle such a monstrous problem  folks need to know that the government is not going to keep spending their money   I   ve heard from many Idahoans who are concerned about the Social Security program and I want to make certain that we have an open dialogue that includes all the possible solutions to preserving Social Security   We should not be cutting benefits or raising taxes   We need to get a better return for our investment in Social Security and this measure would be a small step in providing just such an opportunity
