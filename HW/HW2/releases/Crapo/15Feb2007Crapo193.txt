 Washington  DC   A federal clearing house for health issues related to men could become reality under legislation introduced today by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   The Men s Health Act would improve public awareness and education from federal sources by creating an Office of Men s Health at the Department of Health   Human Services  HHS    The creation of this office mirrors services already available for women through the Office of Women s Health   Representative Vito Fossella  R New York  will sponsor similar legislation in the U S  House        Crapo has long pushed to improve awareness of men s health issues   A two time prostate cancer survivor  he set up health awareness and testing booths offering free or reduced cost services during state and county fairs in Idaho   Crapo noted that men overall have a shorter life span than women  fail to get regular medical check ups  and often ignore health related problems        Simply stated  this legislation can save lives   Crapo said   While an Office of Men s Health is not in itself a cure all  it will assist men to focus on many health problems that can be treated successfully if diagnosed early   In addition  it will help save individual and government resources by helping to prevent costly diseases and conditions   Prevention and early detection can only happen with increased public awareness  something the proposed office can provide          For the past five years  I have sponsored health awareness booths at local fairs in Idaho  and it never stops surprising me how many men are brought into the booths by their wives and girlfriends   he added   Men need to be better educated and more responsible about their own health  not reliant on the women in their lives to be vigilant for them          The health disparity between men and women of all racial and ethnic backgrounds continues to exist in terms of health and mortality   said Scott Williams  Director of Professional Relations and Public Policy for the Men s Health Network  a health advocacy group based in Washington  DC    Now more than ever steps are needed to improve on these numbers   Establishing an  Office of Men s Health  is the logical place to start        Statistics show that educating men and their families about the importance of early detection can save lives   Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the U S  among men   An estimated 230 000 men will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone  and approximately 30 000 will die      The following statistics according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  reveal the importance of creating an Office of Men s Health          Men do not seek medical help as often as women   Studies show that women are 100 percent more likely than men to visit a doctor  have regular check ups and obtain preventive screening tests for serious diseases        Men are significantly less likely than women to recognize the health benefits of fruits and vegetables  such as their role in reducing the risk of many cancers  heart disease  high blood pressure  and diabetes        Men had a total cancer death rate that was 1 5 times higher than women  men  238 9 per 100 000  women  163 1     o Prostate cancer accounts for 33 percent of all cancer cases   o Men had a lung cancer death rate that was 1 8 times higher than women  men  73 2 per 100 000  women  41 6     o Men had a colorectal cancer death rate that was 1 4 times higher than women  men  23 7 per 100 000  women  16 7         Men had a cardiovascular disease  CVD  death rate that was 1 5 times higher than women  men  297 4 per 100 000  women  197 2         The HIV AIDS death rate was 3 0 times higher for men than for women  men  7 4 per 100 000  women  2 5         The life expectancy for males at birth was 5 4 years shorter than for females  male  74 5  female  79 9 years        The all causes death rate for males was 1 4 times higher for men than for women  men  1013 7 per 100 000  women  715 2
