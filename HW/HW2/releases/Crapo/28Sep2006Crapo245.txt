 WASHINGTON  D C      The Idaho Congressional Delegation expressed outrage Wednesday at U S  District Judge James Redden   s decision that no use of water in Idaho   s Snake River     neither our economy nor our way of life     is as important as complying with his interpretation of the Endangered Species Act  ESA        Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo  and Congressmen Mike Simpson and C L     Butch    Otter  said in a joint statement that they would take whatever action is necessary and possible to turn back this explicit threat to Idaho   s water and future        Redden   s decision could lead to the dewatering of millions of acres of irrigated land in the name of salmon recovery  much as an earlier ESA decision did to Oregon   s Klamath Basin in 2001  That would ruin the economy and individual livelihoods in rural communities throughout southern Idaho           We have said it before and we will say it again  let there be no mistake  We will protect Idaho s water and the Snake River Basin Agreement at all costs     Craig said     Yesterday s decision has more to do with establishing a personal judicial legacy than saving a species   This court continues to ignore the big picture and all the factors that are in play   We re not makin  biscuits here  so just adding water isn t the answer             I will carefully analyze this ruling but must say I have never believed that court action will resolve this regional issue  As I have stated before  I will aggressively defend the SRBA  which remains the only durable agreement that deals with anadromous fish recovery flow augmentation and of course  reasonable electricity rates     Crapo said     This ruling signals a clear threat to the potential for a long term solution and undermines the efforts undertaken so far to meaningfully address this issue             Judge Redden   s decision will harm electricity ratepayers  agricultural producers  small communities and businesses in the Pacific Northwest while providing limited  if any  benefit to salmon recovery efforts     Simpson said     Decades of experience with the Endangered Species Act has shown us that court imposed solutions most often cost average Americans dearly while doing very little to improve a species    chances for survival             I won t let this judge s desire to play God with Idaho s water destroy our state   Otter said   Rulings like this only polarize the issue and force folks to dig in their heels  That helps nobody  least of all the fish          Redden said he will not be bound by congressional approval of the Snake River Basin Adjudication Agreement  SRBA   which authorizes the U S  Bureau of Reclamation to provide 487 000 acre feet of water from Idaho   s upper Snake River to augment downstream flows for salmon migration       If the Fisheries Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration determines in a new biological opinion that more flow augmentation is needed to restore endangered and threatened salmon runs  the judge cited his    broad latitude    in ruling that nothing in the SRBA would prevent him from ordering more Idaho water shipped downstream          Federal Defendants    position appears to be inconsistent with the Supreme Court   s admonition that the ESA reflects Congress    explicit    decision to require agencies to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered salmon        Redden wrote     The Supreme Court made clear the language  structure  and history of the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the    primary missions    of federal agencies
