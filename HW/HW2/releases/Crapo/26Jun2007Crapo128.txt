 WASHINGTON  D C   Today Idaho Senator Mike Crapo asserted that an employee has a right to privacy and free choice in the workplace by voting against the Employee Free Choice Act  H R  800  The bill  which would do away with an employees right to a private ballot in union organizing elections  failed to move forward in the Senate by a vote of 51 to 48  60 votes were needed     Employees should have the right to private ballots when deciding whether or not to join a union  Crapo said  This bill takes that right away by replacing it with a card check process that would be public to the employer  the union and other employees  The right to conduct elections by secret ballot is one of the most fundamental democratic rights we as Americans hold  In the workplace  a secret ballot is critical to ensure fair decision making that is free from coercion or intimidation     Under current law  employees can choose to join a union through a private ballot election certified by the National Labor Relations Board  NLRB   H R  800 would displace this system with the card check process  Under this process  a labor union is recognized as the representative of workers once it presents authorization cards signed by fifty percent plus one additional worker in any bargaining unit  The bill would also increase penalties imposed on employers for unfair labor practices     Protecting workers rights is vital  but this legislation fails to accomplish this goal  Crapo said  Ultimately  this measure would be detrimental to workers  employers and the economy and would restrict Americas ability to compete on the global scale
