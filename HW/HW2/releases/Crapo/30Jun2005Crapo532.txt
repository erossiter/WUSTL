 Washington  DC   Citing a recent U S  Supreme Court ruling that could cause private property owners to forfeit their land or buildings for economic reasons to government entities  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo quickly signed on to a bill seeking to stop such actions   The  Protection of Homes  Small Businesses  and Private Property Act of 2005  was introduced yesterday by Senator John Cornyn  R Texas          This ruling takes the takings clause and stretches it too far   It is clearly not what has been intended in the law with respect to eminent domain actions and must be corrected   Crapo said    The Private Property Act is a good start          Last week  the U S  Supreme Court issued a 5 4 ruling that government may seize the home  small business or other private property of one owner  and transfer that same property to another private owner  simply by concluding that such a transfer would benefit the community through increased economic development      Crapo said the ruling seems counter to the traditional principle that the Founding Fathers intended the Constitution to provide private property rights against government seizure and other unreasonable government interference   The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution specifically provides that  private property  shall not  be taken for public use without just compensation          Crapo pointed out the Fifth Amendment thus provides an essential guarantee of liberty against abuse of power of eminent domain  by permitting government to seize private property only  for public use    But he said last week s court ruling concluded that a government initiated transfer of private property from one private owner to another is constitutional because it would benefit the community through increased economic development       Crapo says the bill  S  1313  would clarify the government s exercise of power of eminent domain to be limited only for public use    Public use  would not include economic development under the legislation   The bill regards takings by the federal government  but encourages states to consider similar action     I have heard from a number of Idahoans very opposed to this court ruling   Crapo said   Hopefully this legislation can pass Congress quickly and be signed into law by President Bush
