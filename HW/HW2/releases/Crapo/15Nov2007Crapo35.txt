 Washington  DC  Using Internet and telephone technology  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo hosted his first statewide iTownHall meeting  The hour long meeting  held Wednesday evening  involved more than 4 000 Idahoans and is now posted on the Senators website  http   crapo senate gov  for anyone who would like to listen to the event  There is also a link to allow people to sign up for future iTownHall meetings     It was an outstanding opportunity to use this technology to hear from Idahoans on issues that matter to them  Crapo said  The Senate schedule frequently keeps me from visiting Idaho during the work week  Personal responsibilities or travel requirements may keep Idahoans from being able to participate in town hall meetings that I may hold in the state  This technology leaps right over those barriers  and brings the town hall meeting right into your own living room  I was very pleased with the first iTownHall and hope to host more in the future     Just prior to the beginning of the iTownHall meeting  phone calls were placed to individuals in Idaho who have previously contacted Crapos office  Those who answered the phone were given the opportunity to participate in the call  All participants were able to listen live to the entire conversation between Senator Crapo and each Idahoan who was able to ask a question  During last nights meeting  Crapo took more than a dozen questions from Idahoans and received 50 voice mail messages from those who were not able to speak with him directly during the call  The issues included in last nights questions were Medicare and prescription drugs  entitlement spending  nuclear energy  veterans  education  Iraq  immigration and fuel costs
