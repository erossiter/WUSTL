 Washington  DC     Taxpayers will no longer need to pay an outdated  century old tax on long distance phone service  thanks to an announcement by the U S  Treasury Department that it will refund the collection of the 1898 telephone excise tax on long distance service   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo praised the move as one of many Senators encouraging the Internal Revenue Service to stop collecting the tax          Refunding taxpayers the  60 on an outdated tax on long distance is a good first step  but they shouldn   t still be paying this tax in the first place     Crapo said  The action by the Internal Revenue Service on the long distance tax means taxpayers can file paperwork to recover a return of the  30 to  60 dollars they have paid this year       The long distance tax was established to help pay for the Spanish American War and was intended as a luxury tax   Repealing the tax will save taxpayers and cost the government about  10 billion this year
