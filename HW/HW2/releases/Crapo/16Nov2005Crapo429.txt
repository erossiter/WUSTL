 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo supports the tax reconciliation measure passed by the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday evening  but says that he will fight to extend existing federal tax cuts on capital gains  dividend income  and other investments   Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance Committee  voted in favor of the tax and investment measure that passed on a 14 6 vote in committee   Crapo plans to continue to press for an extension for the lower rates on capital gains and dividend investments and has gained the support of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist in the effort         The bill passed by the Finance Committee does not go far enough to stop tax increases from returning to haunt Americans     Crapo said      I am heartened that Majority Leader Frist agrees we must extend these tax rates and I join him in the belief that extensions on capital gains and dividend tax relief can be revived in conference committee negotiations with the House   It is too easy as well as inaccurate to claim that these tax cuts will further increase the deficit   The numbers show that although these specific taxes were cut in 2003  federal revenues increased by  270 billion in 2005      Crapo says investment tax rates of 15 percent on capital gains and dividends must be extended for another two years in the reconciliation bill  they are presently slated to end in 2008      Crapo continued     There is no question that the economy is growing  both in Idaho and the nation   That has resulted in new jobs and revenue creation   Maintaining lower taxes and cutting spending will spur economic growth and lower the deficit   Now is the time to continue job creation and business growth by signaling to investors that conditions will stay positive   I am sure hardworking Idaho families saving for the future and Idaho seniors who rely on investment income to maintain their standard of living in retirement appreciate this commitment as well    Hard working Idahoans and others should not be surprised by tax increases if the Congress fails to address extending these tax rates   Moreover  people don   t only look to the next year when making investments for the future   We must act now to assure those who make investments today that they will not face a stealth tax increase when they cash out those investments in the future         Crapo voted to approve the overall Tax Relief Act of 2005  saying it prevents millions of middle class Americans  including more than 25 000 in Idaho from being unfairly hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax   The bill also prevents the elimination of the tuition deduction for students  the successful small business expensing provision  the Research and Development tax credit  as well as the tax deduction for teachers who purchase classroom materials out of their own pockets   The measure also contains a number of important tax provisions aimed at helping to rebuild the economy in the Gulf Coast states damaged by this year   s hurricanes   Many of these provisions are targeted at replacing damaged housing  infrastructure and businesses      Since the tax relief measure was enacted in 2003  the country has had eight straight quarters of economic growth greater than three percent   In addition  the tax relief provisions allowed seven million seniors to save an average of  1 230 on their 2004 taxes      FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at www senate gov src radio crapo
