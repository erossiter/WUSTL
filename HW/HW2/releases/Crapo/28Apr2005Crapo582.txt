 Washington  DC      The Idaho congressional delegation reacted today to the long awaited release of the National Academies of Sciences  NAS  report on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  RECA    The report  released late this afternoon  makes a series of recommendations for Congress that could lead to a nationwide  science based expansion of the RECA   The delegation concurs with the report   s conclusion that the present RECA program is not equitable and that any future program should be based on the principle that    like cases are treated alike      While the report did establish that a science based approach would likely result in few successful future claims  it suggested that Congress establish the probability level that would determine eligibility for compensation under a new nationwide program           The NAS has put together a comprehensive review with conclusions and recommendations for Congress regarding the RECA program     Senator Mike Crapo said      It recognizes that effects from radiation fallout are not limited by arbitrary political boundaries   something Idahoans already knew   The report presents a challenge in that it recommends drastically altering the RECA program as it is currently configured   That recommendation does not offer the immediate relief sought by Idahoans   This report s release marks the beginning of a new chapter for this issue and I remain committed to assisting those in Idaho who deserve compensation           Senator Larry Craig said     The Report affirms my contention that winds know no political boundaries   Limiting eligibility to certain counties is unwise   Idahoans deserve an opportunity to be considered for compensation   So  I will support Senator Crapo in an effort to assist Idahoans who were harmed by the fallout from nuclear weapons testing               For Idaho s downwinders  this report is a mix of both positive and disappointing news     said Representative Mike Simpson      While the report clearly states that any new effort to expand RECA must be more equitable than the current program  it also seems to indicate that a new science based  nationwide program would establish a more restrictive standard for awarding compensation  The Committee has clearly produced an exhaustive analysis of the program and I commend them for the work they put into this report   I also want to commend my colleague  Senator Mike Crapo  for his strong leadership and commitment to this issue   I look forward to learning of his intentions and working with him on this important issue           Representative C L     Butch    Otter said     Government must be accountable for the damage it does to any of its citizens  wherever they live  However  this report provides some hard scientific realities about the basis for compensation in Idaho and nationwide  While those realities may be difficult for Idahoans to accept  I m grateful for the work that s been done to establish the facts and give voice to the concerns of our people  Idahoans who believe they were hurt as a result of our government s actions continue to deserve our advocacy in this process  and I appreciate Senator Crapo s leadership in that regard           The report was prepared by the National Research Council of the NAS and was due to be reported to Congress no later than June 30  2005   The full 372 page report is available on the National Academies of Science   s website  http   www nationalacademies org   Click here for audio of Mike s Reaction to NAS Report on April 28   mp3     To directly link to this news release please use the following address   http   www crapo senate gov media newsreleases release_full cfm id 237049
