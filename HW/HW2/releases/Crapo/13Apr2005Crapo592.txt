 Washington  DC     During a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee today on the United States     Central America   Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said U S  sugar producers made a compelling case that they will be harmed by CAFTA   Crapo said he takes that threat seriously and that it adds to his concerns over the CAFTA proposal           Our trade agreements have to achieve mutually beneficial trade     Crapo said      Through current law  CAFTA countries have enjoyed duty free access to the U S  market for most of their agriculture products   The same is not true for U S  farmers and ranchers who want to sell to Central America   While I commend our trade negotiators for the effort put forward to remove restrictive trade barriers  through this agreement our negotiators may have gained much needed market access for some commodities while harming another     sugar             Crapo objects to provisions in the agreement that would allow increased sugar imports   Critics warn those imports could destroy the market for U S  producers and interfere with the sugar program provided in the Farm Bill  The Farm Bill presently requires U S  producers to keep close to one million tons of sugar in storage  but producers argue the one million tons presently stored may be dumped onto the world market if CAFTA is approved   Some studies say that would collapse sugar prices by more than 40 percent and put thousands of farmers out of business   Sugar production is one of Idaho   s leading industries             While there are questions on the level of impact that CAFTA will inflict on the sugar industry  there is no question that there will be an effect     Crapo added      Our farm families and communities deserve better than that   So little has been explained about how the alternative forms of compensation provided for in the agreement to protect the domestic sugar program would actually work   Nor would there be any guarantee to the sugar industry that this provision would be utilized   The sugar situation points out what makes well intentioned trade agreements fail           To directly link to this news release  please use the following address   http   crapo senate gov media newsreleases release_full cfm id 236339    FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions  You can also access the actuality through the Internet by clicking here
