 Washington  D C   Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D Washington   Ron Wyden  D Oregon  and Mike Crapo  R Idaho  successfully included language in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution that is a critical first step to defeating an administration proposal to increase the rates of Bonneville Power Administration  BPA  consumers  Murray  Wyden  and Crapo  all members of the Senate Budget Committee  have been supported in their efforts by a unified  bipartisan delegation of Northwest Senators  On February 9th  eight Northwest senators wrote to Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman to express their opposition to the BPA provision and pledge their commitment to work to defeat it       The Budget language inserted by Murray  Wyden  and Crapo sets the stage for a workable legislative solution to block the administration s proposal  The language mandates that the Senate Budget Resolution will not assume any savings from the administration proposal and also assumes funding to accommodate legislation blocking the proposal  The harmful administration proposal redirects approximately  646 million in projected BPA revenues over the next five years to accelerate payment to the U S  Treasury   ultimately resulting in a rate hike for BPA consumers        The administration proposal would also chip away the Northwest s access to low cost power which has been a key part of the region s economic growth   The proposal is the latest in a long line of attempts by administrations of both parties to harm the Northwest s cost based hydropower system  BPA  a hydropower system  is the largest power wholesaler in the Pacific Northwest  supplying an estimated 45 percent of the region s power  The proposal also comes as Northwest ratepayers continue to recover from high power costs resulting from the Western energy crisis  That crisis increased regional wholesale electricity rates by 46 percent       Additionally  the administration proposal to accelerate debt payment circumvents an ongoing regional dialogue about the future of BPA  That discussion  which includes many regional stakeholders  concerns how to best maximize the value of BPA  By injecting this federally mandated proposal  the administration is undermining a careful process of collaboration that has been developed in the Northwest         I led this effort in the Senate Budget Committee because I know that the last thing Northwest residents need is higher energy prices   said Senator Patty Murray  D WA    Congress rejected this effort last year  and I am confident we will prevail once again  It is time for the administration to take this off the table for good so that BPA consumers can have peace of mind knowing that future rates will not be subject to meddling by the federal government          The Administration keeps trying to use Northwest consumers like a  pay day loan  program for the Treasury   said Senator Ron Wyden  D OR    Accelerating payment of BPA s debt to the Treasury may put dollar signs in the eyes of Administration officials  but we will not stand by while ratepayers in Oregon and other Northwest states are forced to pay higher rates as part of some quick cash scheme           I am glad that the Senate Budget Committee has again supported the rights of BPA ratepayers in Idaho and throughout the Pacific Northwest by explicitly rejecting this plan   said Senator Mike Crapo  R ID    Our region has worked carefully to ensure that BPA s rates are more stable  predictable  and affordable  yet  this proposal would have undermined that progress and raised consumer rates up to 11          Today is good news for the Western states   said Senator Max Baucus  D MT    By working together we successfully fought back rate hikes that would have hurt rural states  I was proud to work together with Senator Murray to protect rural electric customers         Nothing unites the Northwest delegation like slapping OMB s hands when they try to dip into the BPA cookie jar   said Senator Larry Craig  R ID         This proposal is simply a thinly disguised rate increase   said Senator Gordon Smith  R OR    The Northwest delegation remains united in our opposition to policies that will raise rates for BPA s customers         The BPA rate hike didn t belong in the federal budget this year  just like it didn t belong there the year before or the year before that   said Senator Maria Cantwell  D WA    Yet again  the bipartisan Northwest delegation has come together to oppose the president s plan  The Northwest has managed our own energy resources successfully for over 70 years and the president really ought to come up with a new plan to pay down his own deficit  To keep electricity affordable and help our economy grow  I m going to do every thing I can to keep control of our energy resources right here at the regional level         These rate hikes are a bad idea for rural states like Montana   said Senator Jon Tester  D MT     I was glad to work with my colleagues to protect rural electric customers in Montana and throughout the West
