 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo joined Senator Ron Wyden  D Oregon  in spearheading efforts to extend the deadline for federal assistance for ranchers and farmers affected by drought  fires and other disasters this year  Wyoming Senators Mike Enzi and John Barrasso  both R Wyoming  are working with Crapo to build Republican support in the bipartisan effort started by Wyden and Crapo     Crapo  Enzi  Barrasso and other Senators signing the letter to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee say the deadline for disaster assistance for this season should be moved to the end of the year to better accommodate those affected by drought and fires this summer  The original deadline was the end of February     Unfortunately  this deadline leaves many agriculture producers who have experienced economic losses during this turbulent year without a safety net  wrote the Senators  Such timely assistance makes a significant difference in the lives of farmers  ranchers  and rural communities     The February deadline was established in legislation passed earlier this year that included veterans health care and Hurricane Katrina assistance  A similar request has been made to appropriators in the U S  House of Representatives     Its impossible to predict when Mother Natures wrath will strike  but disaster assistance for those truly in need should be more certain  noted Jennifer Ellis  a rancher from Blackfoot  Idaho and the 2008 Idaho Cattle Association president  We appreciate Senator Crapos and the Idaho Delegations efforts to extend an arbitrary eligibility deadline that is preventing Idaho producers from getting some badly needed disaster assistance     In Idaho  it has been a difficult year with the scale and impact of wildfires and the dry conditions  Crapo said  We want to do all we can to ensure producers get the assistance necessary to remain successful despite the significant challenges faced throughout the year     Wyoming agriculture producers all around the state are hit hard year after year due to drought  Extending a deadline is the least we can do to help agriculture producers get through the hard and dry times  said Enzi     Barrasso said  It is important to help our farmers and ranchers stay in business through these hard times  Every one of Wyomings 23 counties has received a disaster designation due to drought conditions this year  I will fight to extend disaster assistance that responds to the conditions in our state
