the absence of environmental issues and encroachment at MHAFB   Craig stated     Without question  our pilots benefit from    joint    training       realigning Mountain Home to a single aircraft wing erodes critical in place combat training synergies not found elsewhere       By making Mountain Home Air Force Base  and other bases around the country  a single flying unit  I fear we may be making decisions that will cost us more money in the long run to perform    joint    training                         Idaho is best situated for its current roles and missions and presents the nation with its greatest strategic opportunity to expand while maximizing joint and coalition training opportunities at the lowest and most convenient cost to U S  taxpayers                       Idaho Senator

      Mr  Chairman  Commissioner Coyle  Commissioner Hansen  and Commissioner Bilbray  it is a pleasure to be with you today and have the opportunity to share with you my perspectives on community support for Mountain Home Air Force Base and the economic impacts resulting from realignment changes to the base        Since 1942  Mountain Home Air Force Base has been an important part of the State of Idaho and the local community of Mountain Home   This long partnership has flourished in a state that is very patriotic and proud of its military missions and heritage         Mountain Home is the quintessential military town with an unprecedented level of support for their base   Driving through town  the pride they feel is evident at every corner from the banners stating    Home of the Brave     to the American and POW flags flying in support of military personnel   With the current deployments  there are signs of support everywhere  especially the yellow ribbons blanketing the town from the back of cars  to windows of businesses and homes  to being posted on the utility poles along the main streets of town         The City of Mountain Home has long been a supporter of the base and its missions   Mayor Joe McNeal  the City Council  all of whom are present here today  and the residents of the city keep the base and its mission in mind in their duties to ensure they speak with one voice         The town and the base are inseparable from each other   Many of the town   s 13 000 residents are retired Airmen who continue their support for the Air Force by working at the base or volunteering to help support it in various way   Nearly every business offers military discounts and much of the town   s workforce is made up of military spouses    The community understands the strain that the deployment schedule puts on the military member and their families   They provide a strong recreation program  school system  library and many other services supporting the families   During deployments  they are ready to support the families in any manner needed          The community shows its support of the base in many ways   Each September for the last 45 years  the community has organized Air Force Appreciation Day celebrations   The celebrations include the largest parade in the state  which marches proudly down the town   s main street  American Legion Boulevard   Air Force Appreciation Day attracts over 10 000 supporters   Every two years  the Chamber of Commerce Silver Wings of Idaho Committee partners with the base to provide a world class air show for this region   These events are invaluable to the local economy       Quality of life in Mountain Home is second to none for military personnel   The consistent high level of support for the military by the community is the best aspect for most Airmen   The town is less than thirty miles from a major metropolitan area   There is very little crime   There is no smog or traffic   Outdoor recreational opportunities abound   Families can feel safe   Your child can leave his or her bike in the front yard  and it will still be there in the morning   Airmen and their families stationed at Mountain Home love where they live       Infrastructure  The City has been working hard toward a strong and prosperous future for the base   With a steady annual growth rate and the anticipation of the possibility of new missions and growth to the base  the city committed to an upgrade of sewer and water systems   These upgrades are expected to accommodate the next 20 years of growth   Other recent upgrades undertaken by the city include doubling the size of the library and computer lab  expanding the city   s firefighting capabilities  and a new junior high school   The City has undergone a significant increase in housing in the past eight years including 1 000 new homes and 400 new rentals        The local Chamber of Commerce and businesses play a vital role in the support of the base with the Mountain Home Military Affairs Committee  which recently celebrated its 25th year   The committee provides an important link between the community and the base and ensures constant communication between the two      The strong support for the base doesn   t stop at Mountain Home   The State support can be seen in the dollars that the Idaho Department of Transportation has spent with a new 4 lane highway from the City of Mountain Home ten miles to the main gate of the base   The State Legislature has also issued a Joint Memorial of Support for the airbase which was sent to the President        The State has supported a strong higher education program on the base   The educational infrastructure is used not only for military personnel and their dependants  but also for local community students   In addition  the state offers in state tuition rates for active duty military that might maintain their legal residency in another state       Economic Impact  The Department of Defense   s recommendations to the BRAC Commission included realignment at Mountain Home Air Force Base   If realignment is approved in its current form  it would result in a net loss of 538 military personnel  31 civilian personnel at the base and 305 jobs indirectly affected   The economic impacts of such actions would be immediately apparent in a small community like Mountain Home   For example  the loss of 538 military personnel represents 12  of the total personnel at the base  That loss represents payroll of over  20 million that would vanish from the small local economy   More importantly is the impact of    Boom to Bust    due to actual implementation of the proposed plan         While Mountain Home is a supportive and growing community  the turbulence of losing almost nine hundred jobs could upset this balance   One lost military position in a small  tightly knit community such as Mountain Home has a greater tangible and intangible effect than one lost in an urban community   We must ensure careful planning in the schedule for realignment so the effects on this small community can be minimized   The ideal scenario would be for the BRAC Commission to deny the move of the F 16s and F 15Cs from Mountain Home Air Force Base under BRAC and then for the Department of Defense to make the move in coordination with the arrival of a new weapon system or mission and accompanying personnel   During this process  we must remember to keep an eye on the future   As Senator Craig and I have demonstrated  Mountain Home is well positioned for future missions and weapons systems       BRAC and the Community  Idaho   s preparation for the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure has been to prepare for the future   At every level  we have worked toward the modernization and sustainment of Mountain Home Air Force Base   Preparing for BRAC has been a long term  grassroots effort from the local citizens and elected officials of Idaho   Mountain Home did not need to hire the work done  so many Idahoans volunteered to help that it truly became a community effort   I am proud to be a part of that effort       Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience with the overwhelming community support that Mountain Home offers   In my twenty plus years of public service  I have never experienced anything quite like it   Between the incredible community and state support  the lack of encroachment and environmental issues  the state of the art training range  and the willingness of the community to do whatever it takes to aid the base in any mission it is given  Mountain Home Air Force Base is prepared to grow and continue to play an integral role in the future of the defense of the United States         Thank you Mr  Chairman  and members of the Commission  for your time this morning   Now Governor Kempthorne will present the strategic and Homeland Security importance of Gowen Field and BRAC s impact on its mission
