 WASHINGTON  D C    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo today expressed his concerns for the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 budget resolution passed this afternoon by the Senate   Crapo  who sits on the Senate Budget Committee  voted against the measure  both on the Senate floor and in Committee          The numbers in this budget resolution simply don t add up to good policy   Crapo said    It dramatically increases federal spending and makes hardworking Americans foot the bill   In recent years  we have seen the pro growth tax policies work   Americans have more money in their pockets  and our economy is thriving  putting us easily on track to eliminate our budget deficit in five years   By adding more debt and more taxes  the budget resolution will only reverse these positive trends          Possibly the most egregious shortcoming of this budget resolution is that it makes no attempt to address unsustainable growth in entitlement programs   The baby boomer generation is rapidly approaching retirement age  and the cost to our government  to our children  will be phenomenal        The President proposed a modest  70 billion reduction to Medicare s rate of growth  which only would have affected the wealthiest 5 percent of seniors   The long term benefits of these modest savings would be exponential   By saving just  70 billion from Medicare now  we could eliminate  8 trillion from the 75 year Medicare unfunded liability  a full 25 percent of the  32 trillion long term liability we are facing in Medicare          Unfortunately  this budget resolution passed by the Senate today does not even include one dollar in savings for entitlement programs such as Medicare   Instead  in Medicare alone  this irresponsible budget leaves our children and grandchildren with a  32 trillion liability and no way to pay for it         Simply put  we must address these problems now  in this Congress  and not put it off to future generations           Specifically  the FY 2008 Budget Resolution             Fails to extend all of the tax relief Republicans have passed  imposing a more than  700 billion tax increase over the next five years  the largest tax increase in U S  history        Causes  2 4 trillion in new debt       Increases non defense discretionary spending by approximately  150 billion over the next five years        Relies on closing the  tax gap  to provide as much as  300 billion a year in revenue  an amount that is both grossly overstated and impossible to collect  and       Makes no attempt to reduce entitlement growth  leaving Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid on a path to bankruptcy                FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
