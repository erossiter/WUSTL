 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo tonight voted against S  2754  the State  Foreign Operations Appropriation Act  saying the vote is on principle to protest a rushed  wrong and irresponsible way to fund the federal government  Crapo noted the measure is one of the most expensive and largest bills to come before the Senate and was being rushed through to a vote in less than 48 hours  The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 17  with one Senator voting present     Crapo said it is obvious to all taxpayers that the Senate has not allowed for the time to adequately review the contents of a bill running more than 3 400 pages  He said even a cursory review shows the legislation contains language which reduces our commitment to secure our borders and contains budget maneuvers and emergency designations to run spending billions of dollars above agreed levels while critical Idaho initiatives such as fighting methamphetamine and domestic violence are cut  Crapo  a member of the Senate Budget Committee  said Congress must allow for a more careful spending process     Shouldnt we be able to cast an informed vote on one of the largest spending bills ever  H R  2764 is a sad testament to Congresss inability to draft and pass responsible federal funding legislation  Im very disappointed that critical funding for drug abuse education efforts  crime victims and  more specifically  victims of domestic violence has been stripped from this bill     Idaho will lose more than ten percent of Victims of Crime Act Funding  money  incidentally  which is paid by perpetrators of crime  not American taxpayers  We are going backward  not forward  with preventative efforts to stop domestic violence  Furthermore  funding for programs that help victims of sexual assault in 15 cities in Idaho and a program that has helped thousands of Idaho schoolchildren learn of the dangers of Internet predators was eliminated during the conference process on this omnibus spending bill     Justice Assistance Grants have been significantly reduced  The Office of National Drug Control Policy Youth Anti Drug Media Campaign was significantly cut  which jeopardizes important anti drug and  particularly anti meth education efforts for Idahos youth  Although I have supported many  many projects in this bill  in my view  victims of domestic violence and our at risk youth are the clear losers in this legislation  Because of these shortfalls and my overall distaste for the rush behind this effort  I have to vote against the bill
