 Washington  DC     Mutual fund shareholders can look forward to more profitable  long term investing and a more secure retirement thanks to a bipartisan bill introduced today by Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho   Tim Johnson  D South Dakota  and Jim Bunning  R Kentucky    The bill would allow shareholders who automatically reinvest distributions to keep more of their own money working for them longer by deferring capital gains taxes until they actually sell the investment        The bill remedies an unfairness in the tax code that makes saving difficult for middle income Americans   Currently  shareholders in taxable mutual funds are subject to yearly capital gains taxes even if they sell no shares and simply reinvest capital gains distributions back into fund shares   Under the Generating Retirement Ownership Through Long Term Holding  GROWTH  Act  investors in mutual funds would be treated like investors in individual stocks and would pay capital gains taxes only when they sell the investment          The government needs to do more to help Americans prepare for retirement and the tax code should help  not hinder  the process     Crapo  a member of both the Senate Finance and Banking Committees  said      American families have historically low savings rates  The GROWTH Act provides a better tool to grow long term retirement investments and this bipartisan legislation will be a step in doing everything we can to promote sound investing and preparation for retirement savings          The GROWTH Act would immediately help the more than 30 million Americans saving for retirement in mutual funds outside of employer plans and or IRAs         Private savings are crucial to economic independence at retirement  and mutual funds represent a huge portion of the savings held by American workers   In South Dakota  there are nearly 267 000 mutual fund shareholders with more than  20 billion in assets   This bill will encourage workers to automatically reinvest and get workers to think about the long haul by contributing to national savings and building up their own retirement nest egg     Johnson said  a member of the Senate Banking Committee      I am pleased to work with Senator Crapo on this legislation to encourage secure retirement savings         Companion legislation for the GROWTH Act was introduced in the House  H R  2121  earlier this year
