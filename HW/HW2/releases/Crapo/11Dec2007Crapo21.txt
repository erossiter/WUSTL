 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  chairman of the Senate Republican Capital Markets Task Force  says an initial public offering  IPO  report released today reinforces the need to strengthen the competitive position of our capital markets  The report  prepared by the Financial Services Forum  cites a number of factors that have created difficulties for U S  companies  Those include  a larger and more liquid capital markets overseas  a litigation environment in the United States perceived as being unfriendly to companies  regulatory burdens such as Sarbanes Oxley  high listing fees on U S  exchanges  and the costs associated with reconciling foreign accounting practices with U S  standards  The report compiled responses from executives at 334 companies based in the U S   United Kingdom  Germany  France  India  China and Japan  who have either gone public since the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act  considered going public in the U S   or de listed in the U S     Crapo said  American dominance over global capital markets is threatened  and we need to take action to ensure that we maintain our international financial advantages  This report is just the latest one to underscore these looming difficulties  Todays survey makes clear that if we are going to reverse the recent trend of more companies turning to overseas markets to raise capital we are going to have to address litigation reform  reduce onerous regulations  and allow foreign companies to report financial information using International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS      The SEC should be commended for recently approving the use of IFRS accounting standards by foreign companies listed in the U S  and being committed to strengthening our capital markets global competitiveness  Crapo noted  It is my hope that this survey will add to the recent momentum to strengthen the competitive position of our capital markets     The challenge we are facing is that the U S  capital markets are losing their competitive edge in intensifying global competition  A key measure of competitiveness  one particularly relevant to the growth of new jobs  is where new equity is being raised  that is  in which markets IPOs are being done  In 2006  more capital was raised through IPOs on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange than on the NYSE and Nasdaq combined  Additionally  the U S  market share of mega IPOs  those over  1 billion  has declined from 57 percent in 2001 to 16 percent last year  Crapo concluded
