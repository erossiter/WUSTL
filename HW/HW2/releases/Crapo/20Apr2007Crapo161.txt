 Twin Falls   The U S  Postal Service has dropped plans to shift some mail processing functions from Twin Falls to Boise following opposition expressed by Idaho s Congressional Delegation   Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson had questioned the cost savings the Service was citing as a reason for studying such a move        Both the Boise and Twin Falls markets service more than a third of Idaho s total population base   the Delegation noted    This large segment of Idaho s population counts on expedient delivery of the mail which it now currently enjoys and operational changes could put that delivery record in jeopardy        The original proposal would have merged the mail distribution center in Twin Falls with the one in Boise and resulted in the transfer of up to 35 employees who handle between 50 000 and 80 000 pieces of mail daily from 30 post offices in the region   The Delegation wrote the Postal Service last year and expressed concern over the economic impact of the proposal  timely mail delivery and service availability for the people who rely on the Twin Falls Center        The Postal Service notified the Delegation today it has ended its study of the issue   It indicates that  there are currently no significant opportunities to improve efficiency and or service through consolidation of mail processing operations at the Twin Falls Post Office   So  no significant changes will be made at this time
