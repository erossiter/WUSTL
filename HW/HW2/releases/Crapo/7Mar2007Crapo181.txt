 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is reintroducing his Owyhee Initiative Implementation Act today amidst meetings in Washington  DC with leaders from Owyhee County  the Shoshone Paiute Tribes  conservation groups and federal management agencies   Crapo says the Owyhee Initiative process remains a model for resolving controversial land management issues in Idaho and around the nation        The Owyhee Initiative should succeed because the cost of doing nothing  of maintaining the status quo  is unacceptable and irreversible   Crapo said   The Owyhee Canyonlands and its inhabitants deserve to have a process of conflict management and a path to sustainability   The need for this path forward is particularly acute given that this area is an hour s drive from one of the nation s most rapidly growing population centers   The Owyhee Initiative protects water rights  releases wilderness study areas and protects traditional uses        Crapo said he was particularly pleased to be joined in today s reintroduction announcement by members of the Owyhee County Board of Commissioners  representatives from the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club and several leaders from the Shoshone Paiute Tribes  whose homeland straddles the Idaho Nevada border   Kyle Prior  Chairman of the Shoshone Paiute Tribes  says passing the Owyhee legislation is critical to preserving Tribal culture in Owyhee County    This legislation is very important to the cultural resources for the Tribes as we are the ones who have kept the history of the land and have an understanding of it   Prior said   Through this measure  we will be able to protect our tribal culture and heritage in ways that those who do not have the same background would not be able to do   It has been a great experience to be part of the Work Group and help to put together legislation that will have such long lasting effects on our lands and people        The Owyhee Initiative is the product of nearly six years of collaboration by a large work group comprised of county leaders  off road users  sportsmen  conservation groups  ranchers  the U S  Air Force  Shoshone Paiute Tribes and others   The Act establishes a board of directors to assist with land management decisions and utilizes a scientific review process   Seventy three percent of the county is owned by the federal government   The Act would preserve existing economics and culture  It establishes 517 000 acres of wilderness and releases existing wilderness study areas and creates 384 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers while respecting state water rights and preserving river and land access for outdoor enthusiasts and sportsmen       Grant Simonds  Executive Director of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Association and an Initiative Work Group member  said   After five plus years of negotiations both inside and in the field  which included hunters  motorized recreation interests  ranchers and conservationists  about 30 miles of road mapped by hunters are proposed to be closed  More than 500 miles requested by hunters will remain open to all  by law  Access is recognized in this legislation through a number of cherry stem  wilderness corridor and wilderness boundary four wheel drive roads that have and will continue to be utilized by all public land users  Ninety percent of the wilderness areas will be within one to two miles of a road  An additional eight rights of way across private lands plus twelve new public access points across lands that will be purchased or traded to become public lands were also negotiated by the work group    A multiple use trail system and public lands travel plans are also envisioned under the Initiative       Other Owyhee Work Group members note the benefits for wildlife under the Initiative    This legislation helps guarantee that bighorn sheep  pronghorn antelope  sage grouse  and other wildlife will continue to thrive in the spectacular Owyhee landscape of Idaho while at the same time supporting local communities and a healthy economy   said Lou Lunte  an Initiative work group member who represents The Nature Conservancy        Crapo says an earlier introduction for the Owyhee Initiative this year will help the chances for passage    We ve done our homework   This is a bill that has come together after literally thousands of hours of work by people from all different perspectives   Because we ve done our homework  we will have support from the very areas that in the past have generated conflict over this kind of legislation   Each interest got enough to enthusiastically support the final product  advocate for its enactment   and most importantly  support the objectives of those with whom they had previous conflict          To directly link to this
