 Innovation lies at the heart of the American penchant for successful enterprise  as evidenced in our energy history   In 1859  Americans were feeling a financial pinch from the cost of whale oil   Used for lamps and lubricants at the time  whale oil was becoming increasingly unaffordable   A Pennsylvania company became interested in extracting  rock oil  from the ground   When the company was seeking financial backers for its proposed drilling project  historians note that one banker scoffed   Oil coming out of the ground  pumping oil out of the earth as you pump water  Nonsense    Although the first well was drilled a year later  demand for  rock oil  in the United States didn t really surge until the invention of the automobile early in the twentieth century         Over the past 30 years  technology creating renewable energy from wind  solar  nuclear and agriculture byproducts has increased in sophistication and application  and steadily decreased in cost   Since that time  the federal government has encouraged renewable energy development  efforts that have resounded strongly in rural agriculture based communities   Still  as recently as 2005  biomass renewable energy production accounted for only 2 8 percent of the total energy production nationwide   Now is the perfect time to apply a full court press to renewable energy research and development  with the agriculture community  once again  leading the way           Congress is working on reauthorizing the Farm Bill  I serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee with jurisdiction over this reauthorization   This bill will provide an opportunity to build on valuable programs for research and development of biofuels and better support agriculture s role in renewable energy   Proposals  such as the Administration s proposed  1 6 billion in new funding for renewable energy research  development and production will be helpful as we seek ways to enhance energy use of agricultural products   In 2005  the USDA concluded that 1 3 billion dry tons of biomass could be harvested annually from U S  forest and agricultural land without negatively impacting food  feed and export demands   This biomass could produce enough ethanol to replace 30 percent of current U S  petroleum consumption       To promote innovation  the government can continue to provide incentives expanding agricultural participation in energy development   Ethanol production is exploding  but challenging market factors are becoming apparent   rising corn prices affect corn products used for livestock feed and human consumption   To counter this  Idaho is one of the states leading the way in the development of cellulosic ethanol   This week  the U S  Department of Energy announced  80 million in federal funding toward the construction of a cellulosic ethanol plant near Shelley   Breaking down wood chips  switchgrass and agricultural waste into cellulosic ethanol creates an energy productive  waste reductive cycle   We can research growing non food agriculture products for energy  in Idaho  products that can be grown considering the paucity of water and the variety of growing regions throughout the state   Potential energy sources must be evaluated for supply capacity  energy efficiency  market accessibility  available infrastructure and intellectual resources   Idaho meets or exceeds these criteria in many regions         Legislation such as the 2002 Farm Bill  Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004  Energy Policy Act of 2005  and the upcoming farm bill and energy tax legislation in the Finance Committee are continuing to improve the climate in which we produce renewable  environmentally responsible and home grown energy    Our agriculture community plays an essential role in this process of development and production   It s important that we act not like the banker who couldn t imagine oil coming out of the ground  but like Edwin Drake  who devoted time  resources and risk to finding solutions to energy challenges 150 years ago
