 Washington  DC     Today the Senate Budget Committee held its first in a series of hearings to kick off the Fiscal Year  FY  2007 budget process   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Budget Committee  questioned the Acting Director of the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  about the budget and the economic outlook for the country        Our country faces significant budget challenges  and the Budget Committee has a tremendous responsibility to tackle this     Crapo said      We must take a long term view of the proposals that will come before the Committee in the budget season and recognize that short term fixes will not provide stability and security for many worthy government funded programs          There is a strong case to extend tax relief  especially capital gains and dividends   I have long held that tax reductions result in economic growth and figures from recent CBO reports prove that the 2003 tax cut really paid for itself   CBO originally estimated capital gains revenues would total  125 billion in 2004 and 2005  with a  27 billion drop in capital gains revenue due to the tax cut   However  the actual receipts were close to  30 billion more  not less   That means that instead of a drop in revenue as projected by CBO  there was actually an increase   This is undoubtedly the result of more investment  more job creation  more economic growth  and therefore higher tax receipts          Congress also must address entitlement spending   The pressures that will soon face Medicare  Medicaid  and Social Security as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire may overwhelm the resources available   The financial future of our country and the stability of our economy for future generations depend on Congress    willingness to confront these challenges   It will not serve our country well to only give lip service to budget deficit reduction          With yesterday   s final vote in the House  we have taken a modest first step in slowing the rapid growth in mandatory spending   Next week  the President will deliver his budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2007 and I look forward to working with like minded Senators as we take further steps to enact pro growth tax policy and continue to control the explosive growth of mandatory spending
