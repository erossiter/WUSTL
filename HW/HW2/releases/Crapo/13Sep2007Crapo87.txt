 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo issued the following statement tonight concerning President Bushs address to the nation and testimony this week from General David Petraeus on future U S  military operations in Iraq     I have reviewed the testimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and am impressed with their fortitude under both political and personal attack from some who may have already prejudged the outcome of the surge     Their testimony was enlightening and shows some very encouraging signs that the security and political situation in Iraq may be turning a corner  With so many of our men and women in uniform bravely on the frontlines  we should take special care and consideration in fully reviewing the upcoming report and progress in meeting the goals of our mission there     I thought the President struck the right chord tonight with his speech  The President s plan forward recognizes the realities on the ground as well as the strains on our fighting forces  We all want our troops home as quickly as possible  but we must do this in a safe and orderly process that leaves the situation in Iraq as secure as we can make it and doesn t leave behind a launching point for terrorist attacks on us or our allies  I took special notice that the President mentioned a return on success that shows a redoubled commitment is the surest path to more American troops coming home     Our men and women in uniform deserve to know that we in Congress are as strongly behind them as they are in fighting to protect our national security     Crapo has not received a copy of General Petraeus official report in its entirety and does not believe it appropriate to comment on the contents of the report until he has a chance to study them thoroughly
