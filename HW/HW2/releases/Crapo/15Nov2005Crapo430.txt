 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says the intense planning and cooperation between local  state  and federal agencies to develop recovery plans resulting in the transfer of management of Yellowstone grizzly bears sets the stage for even more rapid recovery efforts of species   Crapo  who soon plans to introduce legislation to enhance the Endangered Species Act in the U S  Senate  said grizzly numbers in the Yellowstone ecosystem are so high that bear management could have been turned over to state control five years ago        The success of grizzly bear recovery and of the wolf populations as well  shows the partnership between the federal and state management is the future of endangered species recovery     Crapo said      Further recovery of these species will be reliant on the partnership of local landowners and agencies  incentives  and conservation measures to maintain the habitat for bears and other threatened and endangered species   These actions will be safeguarded by the legislation I will introduce to continue to ensure the ESA works in the way it was intended   The people on the land and in the agencies are keys to recovery efforts  not the gridlock we have seen in the courts over recovery actions
