 Washington  DC   Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho  and Chuck Schumer  D New York  have included an amendment to S  761  the America COMPETES Act  to call attention to challenges facing U S  financial markets   The first part of the amendment highlights findings that U S  capital markets are losing their competitive edge in the face of intensifying global competition in initial public offerings  IPOs   over the counter  OTC  derivatives  securitization  and traditional lending   The second half of the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate about what steps should be taken to bolster the competitiveness of this essential sector of the U S  economy   S  761  designed to improve America s commitment to education and technology  was approved by the Senate on a vote of 88 to 8        The challenge we are facing is that U S  capital markets are losing their competitive edge in intensifying global competition   Crapo said    A shrinking proportion of international companies are listing shares on U S  stock exchanges and the fast growing OTC derivatives market is growing more rapidly elsewhere   This problem is well documented and it is time that we take a more aggressive approach to addressing America s competitiveness on the world s financial markets         America s financial centers  particularly New York  are in great danger of losing their international pre eminence   Schumer said    If we continue on with the status quo  within the next ten years we will go from being number one  to becoming a marginalized regional market   spelling disaster for New York  and for all of America  The effects of a decline in our financial sector would be felt in across our economy  We cannot ignore the growing competition we face from abroad  and we ve got to make changes so that our financial centers remain competitive  This amendment takes a critical first step toward restoring our competitiveness         This situation poses an ongoing risk to our economic growth  technology innovation  and educational advantage as a nation   Crapo added    Our efforts should be on all of our lending  trading  and investment banking areas   finding more skilled individuals and balanced and effective legal representation and guidance   This amendment expresses a sense of the Senate that these financial areas are indeed critical to U S  competitiveness on the world market        Crapo said studies and statistics note that the declining position of the U S  financial market goes beyond the natural evolution of the world market to more controllable issues that can be easily addressed   As an example  he points to a study of initial public offerings  IPOs  which shows U S  offerings down two thirds since 2001 while European offerings expanded by 30 percent during the same period          IPOs are critical to our economy because when a company goes public  it creates capital   and that means jobs and investment opportunities with great potential payoffs   Crapo noted    The risk taking exemplified by IPOs is in the most important sense the critical fuel of a market economy       Crapo says the Crapo Schumer amendment calls on the Congress  the President  regulators  industry leaders and other stakeholders to increase attention and oversight on financial policy matters as well as better coordination between federal and state financial regulatory agencies to avoid conflicts         Among the specific recommendations the amendment seeks are           Congress  the President  regulators  industry leaders  and other stakeholders should take the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent position of the United States in the global financial services marketplace         The federal and state financial regulatory agencies should  to the maximum extent possible  coordinate activities on significant policy matters  so as not to impose regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on innovativeness with respect to financial products  instruments  and services  or that impose regulatory costs that are disproportionate to their benefits  and  at the same time  ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the United States capital markets continues to promote and protect the interests of investors in those markets          Given the complexity of the financial services marketplace today  Congress should exercise vigorous oversight over federal regulatory and statutory requirements affecting the financial services industry and consumers  with the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic implementation of existing laws and regulations  while ensuring that necessary investor protections are not compromised       Crapo and Schumer received letters of support regarding the amendment from several financial groups including the NYSE Euronext  NASDAQ  American Bankers Association  the Business Roundtable  United States Chamber of Commerce  Financial Services Forum  Investment Company Institute  International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association   More information on the Crapo Schumer amendment and the America COMPETES Act is available on Crapo s
