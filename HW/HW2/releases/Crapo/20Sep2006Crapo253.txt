 Washington  DC     A new federal report released today shows that Idaho had the nation   s third largest jump in over the year percent increase for payroll employment   The numbers released by the U S  Department of Labor show Idaho with a 4 4  increase for the year  trailing only Nevada  5 3   and Arizona  4 6          The Mountain West  and Idaho in particular  remains the strongest area of job growth in the nation     noted Idaho Senator Mike Crapo      Our continued economic growth shows the tax relief and our nation   s monetary policy are working   Interest rates have held steady and we are working to maintain this pro growth tax policy and to prevent any tax increases that would lead to a slowing of the economy        The Labor Department report offers an August to August look at the national economy and job creation   Idaho   s unemployment rate of 3 3  continues to rank well below the national average of 4 7    Idaho   s rate is down nearly half a percentage point in the last year  from 3 7  to 3 3         We are finally seeing the expected seasonal decrease in gasoline prices and the Federal Reserve is holding the line on interest rates for consumers   In the past 12 months  1 7 million jobs have been created nationwide   While some of our rural areas continue to experience difficulties  I am hopeful this upswing in job creation will continue to spread across Idaho and America     Crapo concluded
