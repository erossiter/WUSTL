 Washington  DC     Today   s announcement to begin the delisting process for wolves in Idaho should be viewed as a success story  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo  who plans to reintroduce legislation encouraging increased landowner involvement in recovering endangered species  the Collaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act  or CRESA   says the wolf decision now allows Idahoans to get involved in completing the delisting process   In the previous Congress  Crapo   s bill  S  2110  was the Senate   s only bipartisan effort to improve the ESA  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas  was the original co sponsor on the measure        The reintroduction of wolves was  and is  controversial and emotional     Crapo said      When Idaho takes over day to day wolf management  people  wolves  other affected species and livestock will find the right balance   I  along with the other members of Idaho   s Congressional Delegation  asked the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service to look at what Idahoans have accomplished regarding the recovery of wolves   The conclusion is that the introduction of wolves in Idaho is a biological success   It is important to continue operating the existing program in a responsible manner for both people and the species   I am confident that the State of Idaho and the Nez Perce Tribe will professionally manage wolves and assure long term success that has much broader  if not unanimous  public support        Crapo urged Idahoans to offer constructive feedback to ensure a smooth transition from federal to Idaho control      Input from around the state and recent science point to one conclusion  The key to success in the de listing process is moving from federal to local control and placing wolf recovery in the hands of state experts   I am pleased that Idaho has wolf management authority from the USFWS   My goal is to see wolves delisted in Idaho
