 Washington  DC  The Senate Republican Capital Markets Task Force  led by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  sent a letter today to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell reporting to him the Senate should not increase tax rates on carried interest and publicly traded partnerships in order to offset tax legislation that may come before the Senate in the remaining weeks of this years session  The letter included the signatures of20 members of the Task Force and was sent in response to the passage of H R  3996  the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007  by the House on November 9  Late Thursday  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid attempted to bring the bill to the floor for consideration but Senator McConnell objected to Reids request  which would not have given Senators the opportunity to strike these proposed tax increases     Republican economic policies such as cutting marginal tax rates and reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends have produced tremendous growth in our economy  members of the Task Force said in the letter  Rather than building on the proven success of these tax policies  H R  3996 goes in the opposite direction by increasing taxes on capital formation     The creation of the Senate Republican Capital Markets Task Force was suggested by Crapo in order to advise the Republican Caucus on U S  business competitiveness issues with a specific focus on capital markets  McConnell constructed the Task Force earlier this year and called on Crapo to serve as Chairman  It has held a series of roundtable meetings with key stakeholders in the sector of carried interest and publicly traded partnerships over the past several months     Coming out of these meetings  Crapo reports that making fundamental changes to laws affecting the taxation of partnerships would curtail the pooling of capital  ideas and skills causing a reduction in entrepreneurship and risk taking  He also reports that significantly raising taxes on capital formation in the United States will increase the cost and decrease the availability of capital to businesses throughout the country  This could severely handicap a vibrant and growing part of the U S  economy  Finally  Crapo reports that virtually every Western European nation taxes carried interest as a capital gain and there is a risk of a loss of U S  intellectual capital to London or other jurisdictions     International competition for capital is a driving factor for business  the letter continues  The last thing we should do is put American businesses at a disadvantage by increasing taxes on capital formation driving investment dollars away to other markets
