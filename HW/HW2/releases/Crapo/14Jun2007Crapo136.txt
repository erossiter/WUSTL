 WASHINGTON  D C   Today Idaho Senator Mike Crapo joined North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad in introducing bipartisan legislation that would provide tax benefits for farmers by updating the depreciation schedules for farm equipment  The bill addresses an injustice in the tax code that spreads the tax benefit of farm equipment over seven years  even though average machinery has a life span of only five years     It is time to fix this outdated system to reflect modern needs in our agricultural community  said Crapo  who serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture committees  This bill will help improve agricultural productivity in Idaho and throughout the country and will help our producers maintain competitiveness in the industry     Under the current system  many farmers end up keeping out of date machinery just to avoid the tax penalty associated with updating their farm equipment  Crapo continued  By shortening the deprecation period to five years  this bill enables farmers to invest in equipment that operates more efficiently and safely  boosting farm productivity and income     Currently  if a farmer purchased a  100 000 tractor  he or she could deduct the cost of the tractor over a seven year period  This system is called depreciation  However  with advances in agriculture technology and intense usage of farm equipment  the realistic life span and utility of farm machinery is only five years     The rules governing tax depreciation schedules for farm equipment have remained mostly unchanged since the 1980 s when the Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986  In previous tax reforms  tax laws for farm equipment were not examined separately as they were for construction equipment  Thus  although the current depreciation systems for construction equipment and farm equipment are structured the same  construction equipment has a five year depreciation schedule  and farm equipment has a seven year depreciation schedule     This legislation will be referred to the Senate Finance Committee  where Senators Crapo and Conrad both serve
