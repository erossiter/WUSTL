 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo introduced legislation today to include pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation as a covered Medicare benefit   Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas  joined Senator Crapo as an original co sponsor   If passed  this legislation would end the decade long debate between providers  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  and the various fiscal intermediaries responsible for reimbursing for these services          Currently  there is no specific reference to pulmonary or cardiac rehabilitation services in the Medicare statute   While pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation programs generally are often considered a covered service by Medicare under the    incident to physician services    clause  the absence of a national coverage policy decision has limited access to necessary care and lack of reimbursement in many instances             Pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation is recognized as the standard of care for chronic lung disease and has proven effective in lowering inpatient stays and even removing the need for certain kinds of surgery     said Senator Crapo      The fact that our healthcare providers have gone so long under such intermittent and provincial rules is a testament to the diligence in their profession and desire for effective patient care   Now is clearly the time for a national  comprehensive Medicare policy   our seniors and their providers deserve the enactment of this legislation               In Arkansas  thousands of patients with heart and lung disease use cardiac rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation programs   said Senator Blanche Lincoln     Our legislation will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive consistent access to this necessary care             Supporters of this legislation include the American Association for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation  American Association for Respiratory Care  American College of Chest Physicians  American Hospital Association  American Thoracic Society  and the National Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care  National Home Oxygen Patients Association
