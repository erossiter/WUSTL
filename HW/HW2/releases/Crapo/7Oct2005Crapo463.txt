 Washington  DC     Idahoans who rely on Medicaid for health care will have another option under legislation introduced by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   The Medicaid Health Opportunity Account Act takes the concept of health savings accounts and provides it to Medicaid recipients on a voluntary basis   Crapo introduced the bill in the U S  Senate this week  it is a companion to H R  3757  which was introduced in the U S  House of Representatives last month     The measure sets up a 5 year  10 state demonstration program that will provide health care savings accounts for Medicaid eligible individuals and families   The program will be voluntary and open to low income families and children as well as low income individuals who are not disabled or elderly   The accounts will be funded using federal and state contributions and will not exceed  2500 individual and  1000 child yearly   The funds can be used for medical care services that include diagnosis  treatment  and prevention as well as transportation costs for such services   They can also be used for long term care services and insurance purchase   Florida and South Carolina have already drafted waiver proposals to allow a similar plan   The legislation introduced in Congress would give states the ability to bypass the red tape of the waiver process   If approved  states would apply to be part of the pilot program  the Department of Health and Human Services would select the participating states        This concept will benefit low income Medicaid eligible families by allowing them to make their own health care decisions and giving them more flexibility in those choices     Crapo said      Too often Medicaid forces patients to use services at a higher cost and it does not allow the patient to be a discerning medical consumer   Patients are frequently limited in their choice of services and providers   By using the health savings account model  those who are eligible will have the same opportunities to choose their medical care   At a time when we are all watching federal spending  this is a good effort to improve health care options and save money for those who are eligible for Medicaid
