 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has launched an aggressive push to return passenger railroad service to southern Idaho  Crapo today filed an amendment to S  294  a bill to fund Amtrak now being debated on the Senate floor  that amendment will strengthen an effort already in the bill to return the former Pioneer Route across southern Idaho in several ways     Crapos amendment will ensure that Amtrak uses the same new methodology to determine whether to reinstate passenger rail service along the Pioneer Route or along segments of that route as is used on all Amtrak routes  It also requires the new methodology to consider the transportation needs of communities that are not well served by Amtrak  and it reduces from two years to one the time frame under which Amtrak must study returning the route to Idaho     This push is far from over  but we have made substantial progress in the likelihood we can bring back the trains  Crapo said  For the first time  Amtrak has given Idahoans a written commitmentone that promises to visit the state and meet with Idahoans  I am pleased that the effort toward restoring Amtrak service to southern Idaho is receiving support  and look forward to bringing this issue to the full Senate later this week     Last week  Crapo received a letter from Alex Kummant  President and CEO of Amtrak  In the letter  Kummant states  I will make it a personal priority of mine to visit your home state and learn firsthand of the opportunities that exist in Idaho and other western states for expanded intercity passenger rail service     The Senate resumes debate this week on S  294  the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007  authored by Senator Frank Lautenberg  D New Jersey   Crapos amendment is likely to be considered this week     Amtrak discontinued passenger rail service between Seattle to Chicago  commonly known as the Pioneer Route  in 1997  The route went through Boise  Twin Falls and Pocatello  Amtrak service has continued through Sandpoint  in Idahos Panhandle  on a northern route from Chicago to Seattle     The letter from Amtraks president to Senator Crapo accompanies this news release
