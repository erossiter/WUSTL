 Washington  DC     During a news conference on Capitol Hill this afternoon  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo joined with several other Senators to set the record straight on the terrorist surveillance program authorized by the President   The National Security Agency  NSA  has come under fire for a program of surveillance targeted at al Qaeda and related groups     Crapo said     The NSA has been conducting a highly classified program that is an important tool in protecting Americans  but this program has been mischaracterized repeatedly as an assault on the civil liberties of ordinary Americans   This is simply not the case   this program is narrowly focused aimed only at international calls and targeted at suspected terrorists and related groups   This program is consistent with the Constitution   s protections of civil liberties   It is important to remember that such terrorist surveillance requires maximum speed and agility so that appropriate law enforcement can move quickly to protect Americans   All the courts that have decided this issue have concluded that the President has the inherent authority under the Constitution to protect Americans from attack   I look forward to the upcoming Judiciary Committee hearings on this matter and anticipate that the hearings will further educate Americans that their civil liberties are not at risk because of this surveillance
