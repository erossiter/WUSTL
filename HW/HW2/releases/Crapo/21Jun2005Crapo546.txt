  CRAPO  VOCA FUNDS REMAIN INTACT FOR CRIME VICTIMS March letter helps prevent diversion of funds for other purposes   Washington  DC     A Senate subcommittee today protected the special designation of a crime victims fund by rejecting an Administration proposal to place the dedicated funding into general revenue   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo applauded the decision today by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science to retain the Crime Victims Fund   In March  Crapo and Patrick Leahy  D Vermont   along with 27 other Senators  sent a letter to the subcommittee  requesting that the Crime Victims Fund not be rescinded and be allowed to remain intact        This is a significant step in protecting victims and victims    services     said Crapo      The Crime Victims Fund was set up using money collected from fines and forfeitures resulting from federal crime   Idaho   s crime victim assistance programs receive significant financial support from these funds  as do many other states    programs   These are not taxpayer dollars  rather  they are the compensation paid by criminals rightfully returned to those who have been victimized   It is only appropriate that the funds remain for the purpose for which they were intended   I have heard from Idaho domestic violence prevention groups and others who have been very concerned about the possible loss of funding   It is with great relief that I have welcomed today   s subcommittee action   I will continue to push to make sure the diversion of funds does not happen        The House has already rejected the Administration   s proposal to move the funds into the general fund    Crapo has worked closely with the committee to ensure that the funds remained available for crime victims and services directed to helping them   The Senate Appropriations Committee will take up the legislation on Thursday before reporting it to the full Senate for action
