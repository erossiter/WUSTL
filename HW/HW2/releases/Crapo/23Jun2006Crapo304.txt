 Washington DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Banking Committee  strongly supports a court decision to invalidate the controversial Security and Exchange Commission  SEC  hedge fund rule   The U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit today vacated and remanded the SEC hedge fund rule requiring registration by advisers to unregistered hedge funds that passed the SEC Commission 3 2 on October 26  2004   Shortly after the rule was adopted  litigation was brought against the SEC challenging the agency   s authority to issue the rule               I agree with the Court that the SEC rule is arbitrary  a significant departure from the current regulatory framework  and lacks statutory authority   I am glad that the Court affirmed the concerns of many of us in Congress that the SEC never adequately explained the basis for its dramatic re interpretation of its statute     Crapo said        While the SEC is an independent agency  it does not have     nor should it have     the authority to make law where Congress never intended   Further  it must not be encouraged to issue regulations that are beyond its authority   There is ample work for the Commission to do within the confines of its jurisdiction and I hope that it will now focus on the enforcement and implementation of those statutes and that it will also utilize its resources responsibly     he concluded
