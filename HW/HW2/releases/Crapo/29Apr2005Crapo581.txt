 Washington  DC     A  2 6 trillion budget outline approved last night by both the House and Senate is a good starting point towards moving the federal government back into the black  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo  a member of the Senate Budget Committee  says the most important element of the budget outline is a renewed effort to slow the growth of government which will be paid by future generations        I support this effort because it reflects a move to cut spending and curbs the appetite of some who want to continue the tax and spend mode in Congress     Crapo said      This budget outline proposes to cut the deficit in half in less than five years and it caps discretionary spending   Most importantly  it continues the tax policies that have set the economy back in a growth mode following the 9 11 terrorist strikes and the resulting dip in the stock market        The conference report passed the Senate last night on a vote of 52 to 47  it passed the House on a vote of 214 to 211 earlier on Thursday   The budget resolution does not require the President   s signature and will now serve as a guideline for the appropriations work underway in Congress
