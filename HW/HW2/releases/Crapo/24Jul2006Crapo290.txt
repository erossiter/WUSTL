 Washington  DC    Waterfowl hunters and stamp collectors buying a Federal Migratory Bird Duck Stamp this year will now have the ease and convenience of purchasing that stamp electronically after a bill  sponsored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  Co Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen Caucus  passed the House today   The bill was approved by the Senate last December and will now go to the President for signature          The bill  which was introduced by Crapo last year  will create a three year pilot program in 15 states that will enable the purchase of the federal migratory bird stamp online   Hunters are required to purchase the Duck Stamp annually  which generates revenue to acquire national wildlife refuge lands  to hunt federally designated migratory birds   Several states already have electronic systems to purchase hunting licenses  but none have electronic methods to purchase the Duck Stamp         The Duck Stamp has generated more than  670 million for waterfowl conservation since its inception and has been used to acquire approximately 5 million acres of land for the National Wildlife Refuge System   The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service estimates one third of the nation s endangered and threatened species find food or shelter in refuges established using Federal Duck Stamp funds             Hunters are early risers and by allowing the purchase of the Duck Stamp electronically  sportsmen will be able to spend more time enjoying nature and less time waiting for stores to open or in line to purchase their Duck Stamp     Crapo said      Additionally  the Duck Stamp provides millions of dollars annually for wetland habitat preservation efforts and I   m pleased that hunters and stamp collectors will now have a more convenient method of buying the stamp and contributing to one of the most successful conservation programs ever initiated             The program allows hunters to purchase stamps over the phone or Internet  giving immediate access to a verification number that is valid immediately   That number will be replaced by an actual paper stamp  which the buyer will receive in the mail   This can dramatically reduce the time and effort for hunters to get in the field   Both sportsmen and stamp collectors wishing to buy the stamp at a store or post office will continue to have that option available          Director of Public Policy for Ducks Unlimited  Vaughn Collins said   Waterfowl hunters have contributed over  600 million to habitat conservation over the past 71 years with their purchase of the federal Duck Stamp   The ability to buy an electronic Duck Stamp should make it easier for hunters to acquire their annual Duck Stamps  and that will be a positive step for wetland conservation        FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov in the Radio Links
