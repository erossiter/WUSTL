 Washington  DC  In the waning hours of this years congressional session  the U S  Senate passed legislation to deal with some of the issues currently confronting Medicare  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over Medicare  supported the package  but warned that the fix is only temporary and additional Medicare issues must be addressed in the coming year  The measure  S  2499  cleared the Senate by unanimous consent late Tuesday afternoon  The bill will now be considered by the U S  House of Representatives    Under the measure  funding for the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  will be extended 15 months to March 2009  The bill replaces the scheduled 10 1 percent pay cut for physicians who treat Medicare patients with a 0 5 percent increase until June 30  2008  The bill also contains six month extensions of rural and low income subsidies     This is a temporary fix  but one that moves us forward on Medicare issues  Crapo said  I am pleased that the compromise was achieved without cutting payments for oxygen patients or reducing funding to important programs such as Medicare Advantage  Idahos children will benefit through the extension of the SCHIP funding  and Idaho doctors who see Medicare patients will see a slight increase in their reimbursement rates  We need to do all we can to make sure that quality health care is reaching all segments of our society  and this compromise bill achieves that  albeit on a temporary basis  I look forward to continuing work on these and other critical Medicare issues next year
