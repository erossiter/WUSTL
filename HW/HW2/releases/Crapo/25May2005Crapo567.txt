 Washington  DC     Idaho   s Congressional Delegation has written the head of the Federal Aviation Administration asking her not to close the control tower at the Boise Airport from midnight to 5 00 a m   Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo  and Congressmen Mike Simpson and C L     Butch    Otter  wrote FAA Administrator Marion Blakely  warning the proposed move  for apparent cost cutting reasons  puts pilots and passengers in danger and could cause economic losses related to commercial traffic flying into Boise at night        Your proposal would force the pilots to land at an airport while controlled off site from another location with imperfect knowledge of ground conditions in Boise     the Delegation members wrote      The risk associated with this is unacceptable        The Delegation members pointed out many commercial flights routinely arrive in Boise after 11 00 p m  and that delays could push those arrivals past midnight  when no one would man the air traffic control tower in Boise   The FAA  citing costs  wants to regulate air traffic from an alternative site outside of Boise        To close the control tower at the airport would represent a serious safety hazard to the flying public as well as cause economic harm to the State     the Delegation members said   They noted many businesses  such as the U S  Mail  Federal Express  and the United Parcel Service often land their planes in Boise after midnight  and that those companies could choose to change plans if the Boise Tower is not manned 24 hours a day
