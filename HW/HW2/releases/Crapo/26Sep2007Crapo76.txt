   Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo released the following statement regarding Senator Larry Craig     I support Senator Craigs decision to remain in the U S  Senate  He  like every citizen facing allegations  deserves to be able to fully defend himself  Senator Craig has demonstrated outstanding leadership and tireless service to the state of Idaho for nearly three decades  Idahoans deserve to continue to benefit from Senator Craigs experience and expertise  I look forward to continuing to serve with him in representing Idaho in the U S  Senate
