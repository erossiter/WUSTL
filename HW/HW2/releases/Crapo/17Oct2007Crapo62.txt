 Washington  DC  Close to 90 000 Idaho families may be facing an unexpected tax if Congress doesnt act quickly to end an outdated federal income tax  In a news conference on Capitol Hill today  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said that the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  is now threatening tens of millions of middle income Americans  The tax  created in 1969 to stop a handful of wealthy individuals who were legally avoiding paying any taxes  was not indexed for inflation  as a result  millions of middle income taxpayers are now affected  Crapo warned that if Congress doesnt act now  the stealth tax will reach into increasingly more taxpayers pockets each year it remains in effect     This tax is out of controlin the last tax year  2005   just under 10 000 Idaho families and individuals were subjected to the AMT  but that number will explode to close to 90 000 for this tax year  Crapo said  That scenario is repeated throughout the country  in each state  with similar explosive numbers  The failure to repeal the AMT means that more than  50 billion in payments and penalties will be collected from middle income Americans  which was never intended to happen  Idaho families with an adjusted gross income of  20 000 may find themselves unexpectedly facing the AMT  We cannot wait one more year to repeal this onerous tax     Crapo serves on the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees and writes tax policy  He has joined with committee leadership in sponsoring legislation to permanently repeal the AMT  S  55   At todays news conference  he was joined by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Kentucky   Finance Committee Ranking Member Charles Grassley  R Iowa  and Senator Gordon Smith  R Oregon  to push for immediate action on the bill  They echoed Crapos message that repeal must come this year  and that pay go rules should be waived so that other taxes are not increased as a result of the repeal  Finance Chairman Max Baucus  D Montana  is the lead sponsor of S  55  which was introduced on January 4  2007     The Finance Committee should act immediately on this AMT repeal measure  which has already been introduced and endorsed by the Chairman so that we can provide the certainty that middle income Idahoans and Americans deserve  Crapo added  Many people dont even know theyll be liable for this tax  The average tax liability they will face may be between  3 300 and  5 800  We need a permanent fix to this problem     The AMT was originally enacted after Congress discovered that 155 taxpayers making over  200 000 legally paid no taxes at all  Congress originally estimated that the AMT would only affect one in 500 000 taxpayers  In 2001  approximately 2 million people were subject to the AMT  including many Idahoans  The number of people nationwide threatened by the tax is expected to grow to 35 million by the end of the decade if no action is taken     To directly link to this news release  please use the following address    http   crapo senate gov media newsreleases release_full cfm id 285492
