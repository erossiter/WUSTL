 Washington  DC     Idahoans can look forward to continued lower taxes  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said  after President Bush signed the tax relief reconciliation measure today       The bill  which was drafted  reviewed and approved through the Senate Finance Committee on which Crapo sits  will notably extend tax relief on capital gains and dividends and prevent nearly 25 000 Idaho seniors and middle class families from unknowingly being hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax        By enacting this important measure  we have successfully prevented an untimely and unwarranted tax increase which could have halted the strong and solid growth we are seeing in our economy and job market     Crapo said      This extension of the 2003 tax cuts has resulted in nearly the highest receipts received by the federal government while allowing American citizens to keep more of their own money   This is sound  responsible fiscal policy and I   m pleased with this accomplishment        While this measure was in a Senate House Conference Committee  Crapo led a letter to the conferees  which was signed by 19 additional senators  urging them to include the two year capital gains and dividends extensions that is now part of this law
