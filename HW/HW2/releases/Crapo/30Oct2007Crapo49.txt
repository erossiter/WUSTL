 Washington  DC  The effort to return passenger rail service to Idaho may get its best shot in a decade this week  according to Senator Mike Crapo  Crapo has successfully attached the Idaho related amendment to an Amtrak funding bill  S  294  now being debated by the U S  Senate  The amendment was approved by unanimous consent on Monday evening     The Crapo amendment will set parameters on how Amtrak evaluates a return of the former Pioneer Route across southern Idaho in several ways  It forces Amtrak to fairly consider rural communities not well served by passenger rail transportation  It would reduce from two years to one the time frame under which Amtrak must study returning the route to Idaho  and it requires Amtrak to use the same methodology to make decisions about the Pioneer route that it uses on all service decisions     Now we have both legislative language and a written commitment from Amtraks president to come visit Idaho  meet our residents  and work toward restoring Amtrak service to southern Idaho  Crapo said     At his request  Crapo received a letter last week from Alex Kummant  President and CEO of Amtrak  In the letter  Kummant states I will make it a personal priority of mine to visit your home state and learn firsthand of the opportunities that exist in Idaho and other western states for expanded intercity passenger rail service     Amtrak discontinued passenger rail service on the Pioneer Route from Portland through Boise  Twin Falls and Pocatello almost a decade ago after losing money on the service  Amtrak service has continued through Sandpoint  in Idahos Panhandle  on a route from Chicago to Seattle
