 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Senators Ken Salazar  D Colorado  and Pat Roberts  R Kansas  today introduced the Family Farm and Ranch Act of 2007 in an effort to protect farmers and ranchers from onerous federal estate taxes  The bipartisan bill outlines specific language protecting family farms and ranchers from the duplicate taxation dilemma presented by estate  or death  taxes     While my top priority continues to be the outright elimination of the death tax  this legislation is a good step that will protect many hard working people in American agriculture  and I am pleased to be an original co sponsor  Crapo said  What is most important is we keep pushing to end the double taxation standard that death taxes represent     The Family Farm and Ranch Act of 2007 takes into account the fact that land values for farm land have skyrocketed in recent years and that many farm and ranch families face having to sell their assets to deal with taxes if there is a death in the family  The legislation recognizes the importance of family run operations and seeks to keep them in business     Under the bills provisions  a farmer and rancher would pay no estate tax as long as the following conditions are met     In the past eight years before the decedents death  the decedent or a member of his or her family owned the farm or ranch for a cumulative period of at least five years      In the past eight years before the decedents death  the decedent or a member of his or her family must have been actively involved in the management and operation of the farm or ranch for a cumulative period of at least five years      The decedent of a member of his her family must be using the land for farming ranching purposes on the date of death and the decedent must be a U S  citizen     Other provisions state that half of the decedent or familys income must be derived through farming ranching or that the qualified farm or ranch lands comprise 50  of the decedents gross estate  Small  family owned businesses  farms and ranches are some of the hardest hit by the death tax  Crapo added  This is a crippling  unfair tax upon those small businesses  farms and ranches upon which our economy so solidly rests  and it should be abolished
