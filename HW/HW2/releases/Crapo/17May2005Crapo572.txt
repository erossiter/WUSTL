 Washington  DC     Farmers and agricultural interests will benefit by a tax exemption in hauling farm goods after harvest under language Idaho Senator Mike Crapo got included in the transportation spending bill approved today by the U S  Senate   The exemption would lift a 12  excise tax on certain truck mounted bulk beds  many of which are manufactured in Idaho   The bulk beds are used for hauling crops such as potatoes  sugar beets  onions  and grain        A 2003 study indicates this egregious excise tax was directly responsible for a 40  decline in truck equipment sales in Eastern Idaho     said Crapo  who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over tax issues      This tax brought an economic loss of around  2 7 million in the eastern part of our state alone and forced producers to purchase equipment from Canada to avoid paying the tax   I inserted language in the transportation bill to eliminate it  but we will have to make sure the language is carried through to the conference committee on the final legislation        Crapo called the changes a win win situation      It benefits not only the manufacturers and employees of the companies making these truck beds in Idaho and elsewhere  but also the farmers growing the produce and those hauling it to market     he added     Over the years  there have been conflicting rulings from the IRS as to whether or not these bulk beds are subject to the excise tax  The current governing ruling from the IRS  which has been in effect since 2001  is that the bulk beds are subject to the excise tax  The majority of bulk beds sold in the U S  are manufactured in Idaho      Crapo   s language clarifies that certain truck mounted bulk beds used for hauling farm crops are exempt from the federal excise tax on heavy trucks and trailers   Many of the operations which manufacture such truck beds are located in Idaho   s Bannock  Bingham  and Power Counties
