 WASHINGTON  D C      Today  the U S  Senate is expected to vote on an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution  introduced by U S  Senators Jim DeMint  R S C   and Mike Crapo  R Idaho   that would allow the Senate to create a reserve fund to protect the Social Security surplus          We are about to have a moment of truth in the United States Senate     Senator DeMint said     Seniors constantly tell me that if Congress would just stop using the Social Security surplus as a secret slush fund  the retirement system wouldn   t be in the crisis that it currently faces  This amendment is about honest accounting and restoring trust with seniors  It is outrageous that we are robbing from retirement funds to pay for wasteful spending  and I urge my colleagues to join me in stopping this abuse            A vote against this amendment means you support the raid on Social Security  Anyone opposed to this amendment is part of the problem     said Senator DeMint     After today  every senator will be on record whether they oppose or support the raid  This is not about personal accounts  it   s about whether you believe Social Security should be saved or allowed to wither on the vine            The late Senator Moynihan once characterized the raid on the Social Security surplus as embezzlement   and that   s indeed the case     said Senator Crapo      The DeMint Crapo proposal is a basic and much needed first step to put an asset base behind Social security obligations   How can we stand for fiscal discipline before making this simple gesture   When Social Security surpluses begin to shrink in 2010  the impact on the budget will be massive   2010 is within this year   s budget window   we need to be preparing for this day              Opening up the Social Security debate again may be painful  but the pain to taxpayers in future years will be unbearable and we owe it to our children and future generations to ensure retirement benefits will be there when needed     said Senator Crapo      The current Social Security system allows Congress to spend the Social Security surplus on other government programs   Including interest  Congress has raided  1 7 trillion from Social Security since 1985   The surplus now only consists of IOU   s stacked in a vault in West Virginia that can only be paid back by raising taxes or cutting spending      The DeMint Crapo Amendment to Stop the Raid on Social Security would allow the Senate to pass legislation with the following requirements                 Social Security surpluses must be used to help pay for future benefits               That it make no changes to the benefits of those Americans born before January 1  1950                That it provide a voluntary option for younger Americans to obtain legally binding ownership of a portion of their benefits
