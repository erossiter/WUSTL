 Washington  DC   A new plan to slow federal spending  address long term budget threats and find solutions to the issue of automatic increases in entitlement programs is being supported by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and colleagues in the U S  Senate   The  Stop Over Spending  S O S    Act is similar to an effort to curb spending last session  but this year s effort features a bi partisan commission aimed at exploring ways to deal with programs like Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid which are headed for insolvency        Thanks to the tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003  revenues to the Treasury are at historic levels  while the American people are also able to keep and invest more of their own money   Crapo said    The focus now should be on addressing the government s appetite for more spending and the growth of entitlement programs  which threaten our long term budget picture   The budget conference report passed by the Senate last week busts the spending caps we had in place and provides for the largest tax increase in history   Crapo added    This is why the Stop Over Spending bill is a much needed compliment to our already successful pro growth tax policy        Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Judd Gregg  R New Hampshire  is the lead sponsor of the S O S  Act   Crapo  also a member of the Budget Committee  is an original co sponsor of the bill   He says excessive debt damages the economy and will plague future generations of Americans        The measure would essentially balance the budget by 2012 by adding procedures to automatically slow the rate of growth for mandatory programs if Congress fails to meet deficit reduction targets   It also reinstates statutory caps on discretionary spending and creates a point of order against direct spending that will be triggered when the Medicare program is projected to become insolvent  in seven years or less    Due to skyrocketing health care costs and an aging population  Medicare is projected to be the first of the large entitlement programs to become insolvent          This framework will establish a commission to research spending issues  reinstate spending caps and target wasteful spending   Crapo added    The S O S  bill will bring needed accountability and reform to federal spending   It could bring a balanced federal budget in the short term and provide the necessary tools to maintain that balance in the long term
