 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says a decision by U S  trade officials to exempt certain imports of ski and snowboard pants from China from import limits will benefit ski areas and clothing distributors   Crapo wrote the U S  Secretary of Commerce and U S  Trade Representative  USTR  on behalf of Idaho companies such as Sturtevants Mountain Sports of Sun Valley  Scott USA  Smith Sport Optics  Inc   Precision Mountainwear  Tsunami and Sun Valley Ski Tools  asking for an exemption in trade restrictions that could affect foreign produced ski clothing  particularly ski and snowboard pants       Ski and snowboard pants were included in broader safeguards imposed on imports of trousers from China   The quotas were designed to remedy trade disruption concerns   However  there is minimal U S  production of ski and snowboard pants   Therefore  the restrictions could have hurt Idaho based businesses and resorts  which rely on overseas clothing production and U S  based sales of skiwear  After repeated meetings with USTR and Commerce officials  the U S  trade officials granted the request by the ski industry  Crapo and other senators     Crapo noted unnecessary restrictions on imported ski clothing could hurt some of Idaho   s leading industries   ski resorts and ski clothing distributors      There are several Idaho companies that distribute winter sports apparel   The import restrictions limiting ski clothing imports from China could have had an unintended impact on those businesses in Idaho     Crapo noted      If the Commerce Department had not acted to exclude ski and snowboard pants from the trade restrictions  it might have resulted in the product not being available for skiers        The action from the U S  Trade Representative and Commerce Department comes as welcome news to Idaho ski clothing manufacturers and distributors       I   m pleased Senator Crapo has acted in support of this important issue     as imported outdoor apparel is critical to my customers and my business     said Rob Santa of Sturtevants Mountain Sports of Sun Valley
