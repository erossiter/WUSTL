 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is announcing legislation to end an unintended tax that could hurt up to 90 000 Idahoans this year  and prevent a major tax increase on all Idahoans in the next five years  The AMT Repeal and Tax Freedom Act is being heralded by Crapo and the bills main sponsor  Senator John Ensign  R Nevada  as a way to encourage greater economic growth by maintaining lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends  The bill also abolishes the unfair Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT      The AMT was never meant to affect the middle class  and up to 90 000 Idahoans could be punished if this legislation is not passed  Crapo said  This bill also makes permanent the current lower income tax rate structure we enacted in 2001  If Congress does not act  the income tax rates for all Idahoans will go up in 2011     Crapo noted the AMT was originally drafted in the late 1960s to make sure no one avoided paying federal incomes taxes  Because the AMT was never indexed for inflation  more and more middle class taxpayers are now becoming ensnared by it     This bill has a double benefit of ending the AMT and stopping future tax increases for all Americans  Crapo added  The legislation maintains the maximum tax rate of 15 percent on long term capital gains and dividends  More than 20 percent of Idaho taxpayers report capital gains income or receive dividends  If we do nothing  taxes will go up for Idaho families investing for their childrens future and for Idaho seniors who rely on dividends to supplement their retirement income     Crapo also noted Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has warned that the holdup of any action on the AMT could potentially delay tax returns next year  Other original co sponsors of the AMT bill are Senators Pat Roberts  R Kansas   Jim Bunning  R Kentucky  and Gordon Smith  R Oregon
