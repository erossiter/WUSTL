  Security is a component of everyday life that one spending time in Washington  D C  gets accustomed to   Metal detectors  police vehicle barriers and heavily armed police officers become strangely commonplace after awhile   In some ways  it   s just as easy to become complacent when it comes to personal security in Washington as in many parts of Idaho where the threat seems  less   And that   s the point   on the surface  our nation   s Capital is a logical target  but terrorists also see schools  malls and public transportation in rural areas as high value targets    For this reason  all Idahoans must remain vigilant   We are gifted with freedom  but with that freedom comes the reality of the unknown and the responsibility to be aware of our surroundings and on guard against those who would do us harm                   September is National Preparedness Month   The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and the American Red Cross have teamed up on a public awareness campaign encouraging Americans to prepare for emergencies and disasters   The message of preparedness is nothing new to our country  but threats are much more specific and the possibilities of what type of disaster could befall us are more clearly defined than in the past   The good news is that with more information about specific threats  we have the ability to hone personal and community preparedness for these events                  DHS and the Red Cross recommend that families keep a set of supplies that will last for three days in case of an emergency   This    kit    should contain food  water  battery powered flashlight and radio and first aid supplies   Water is especially important  and a gallon per day per person is the recommended amount for consumption and sanitation   Sick and elderly individuals may require more   Food should be non perishable and require little or no water in preparation                  A major part of being prepared is having a plan   Local calls don   t always work in the immediate vicinity of a disaster  so it   s important to have an out of town contact with whom the entire family can check in   Every family member should have coins for a payphone and a pre paid phone card   Families should make a contact plan and have a centralized meeting place with one or two back up meeting places   It   s also a good idea to research emergency plans for places where you and your family spend time during the day such as work and school   Know the type of disasters or emergencies that are likely in your community   Your local Red Cross chapter will have this information                   Another valuable resource available for Idahoans is the Citizen Corps   These volunteers dedicate time and energy to become informed about being a safety and rescue resource in an emergency   Citizen Corps was launched in January 2002  under the USA Freedom Corps Initiative   Idaho is at the forefront of the Citizen Corps movement and currently boasts a State Council  seven county councils and the Nez Perce Tribal council       In particular  Idahoans are involved in the Community Emergency Response Team  CERT  Program  which trains people in basic disaster response skills  such as fire safety  light search and rescue and disaster medical operations  The primary reason for CERT training is to give people the decision making  organizational and practical skills to offer immediate assistance to family members and neighbors while waiting for help      As you prepare for the many things that fall brings such as school  harvest and winter  it is important to be prepared for the unthinkable   Supplies and a plan will significantly reduce panic and chaos in the event of an emergency   For more information  please see the link for    Ready gov    at my website  http   crapo senate gov         WORD COUNT  600
