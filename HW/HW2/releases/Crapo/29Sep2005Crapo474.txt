 Washington  DC    Judge John Roberts was approved by the Senate today   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted in favor of his confirmation as the 17th Chief Justice in a vote of 78 22          John Roberts was a superb nomination for Chief Justice of the United States and I am pleased the Senate was able to act in a timely and fair way to confirm him today     Crapo said      I personally met with Judge Roberts prior to his Senate hearings and he has proven that he will rule based on law and not legislate from the bench   It is my hope that the Senate can act in the same way with the President   s next nomination to replace Justice Sandra Day O   Connor         Chief Justice Roberts will begin serving as the nation   s 17th Chief Justice when the Supreme Court begins its new session on October 3rd   The President is expected to name his next nominee to replace O   Connor  who has indicated she will stay on the Court until her successor is confirmed  within the coming days
