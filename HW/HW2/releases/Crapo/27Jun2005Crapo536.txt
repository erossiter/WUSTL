 Washington  DC     The world is a safer place for Americans and many of their neighbors around the globe thanks to the interrogation work being done at the Guantanamo Bay detention site in Cuba  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo was part of a five senator delegation in Cuba on Sunday to personally investigate how prisoners are being treated by U S  military personnel        These are the worst of the worst     Crapo said of the detainees      There is a reason they are there   They must be kept under control or they will kill more Americans      Crapo said out of 70 000 persons detained during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts  only 520 are kept in Cuba   He described the Guantanamo detainees as terrorism trainers  bomb makers  recruiters for Al Qaeda  and suicide bombers that must be detained because of the information they are offering  which he said has already saved American lives      Crapo said the only evidence of physical injury was what the detainees had brought on themselves      In some cases  detainees had lost limbs  not because they were abused  but because they were building bombs they intended to use to blow up Americans        Crapo noted that contrary to allegations  detainees at Guantanamo have better medical care  housing arrangements  and access to legal help than other prisoners from earlier world conflicts   None of the detainees  he said  fits the model for treatment of prisoners of war set under the Geneva Convention because they attack civilians  are not part of an organized army and do not wear uniforms   He added the living conditions  including air conditioning in some cases  were even better than what U S  troops face in Iraq and Afghanistan         If anyone is being abused  it is not the detainees   It is the young men and women of our military who are being threatened     Crapo said during a speech this morning on the Senate floor      These charges of abuse appear to be a great irony because the abuse is in the reverse   Our military members are threatened  harassed  and abused by detainees at Guantanamo        Crapo was joined by Senators Jim Bunning  R Kentucky   Johnny Isakson  R Georgia   Ron Wyden  D Oregon  and Ben Nelson  D Nebraska  for an extensive tour covering the Guantanamo complex   He noted that    Camp X Ray     a largely open air detainment area  had been closed for three years  yet media coverage still shows prisoners outdoors  something Crapo said is no longer happening
