 Washington  DC   Job creation  low unemployment rates and a surging economy can all be traced back to events four years ago  which lowered tax rates on investment  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Crapo was part of an event on Capitol Hill this morning marking the four year anniversary of legislation  which lowered tax rates on capital gains and dividends   He has introduced legislation  S  502  to make the tax reductions permanent   Representative Eric Cantor  R Virginia  is introducing a similar bill today in the U S  House         Since Congress lowered the tax rates on capital gains and investment to 15 percent and five percent for lower income brackets  our economy has grown by more than three percent annually compared to just one percent before the bill was passed   noted Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over financial issues    This tax relief is encouraging investments  and we have created more than 7 8 million jobs   Unemployment is at 4 5 percent  down from six percent in 2003   Idaho s unemployment rates are even lower        We are still awaiting the final conference report on a budget blueprint  but it appears the majority party wants to authorize  150 billion in new spending over the next five years and set a pathway for the tax relief we had approved to be eliminated   Crapo added    This would be a big step backwards  and it must be stopped   It is clear that tax relief has spurred the economy  created new jobs and cut our federal deficit in half   Continuing this tax relief must be a priority   This tax relief is not just for the rich   I am reminded of an Idaho Falls retiree from the old Ma Bell phone company  who told me she considers those regular dividend checks to be the source of her  birthday and Christmas money  for her grandchildren   If not for the elimination of the double taxation on dividends  she would not be able to be nearly as generous to her grandchildren        The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 was passed four years ago this month   It lowered the tax rates on capital gains and dividends to 15 percent  5 percent for lower income taxpayers  falling to zero percent by 2010    Crapo was asked to participate in today s event marking the anniversary of tax relief because he is the lead sponsor in the Senate of the legislation that will make permanent the 2003 rate reductions on capital gains and dividends
