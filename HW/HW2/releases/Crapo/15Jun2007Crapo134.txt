 WASHINGTON D C  Today Idaho Senator Mike Crapo praises Senate approval of a resolution designating June 11 17  2007  as National Mens Health Week  The resolution  which Crapo introduced in May  passed by unanimous consent last night in the Senate  Crapo  a two time survivor of prostate cancer  is a champion of mens health initiatives and has pressed for the creation of a federal office for mens health to promote public awareness and better coordinate existing research  Crapo serves on the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over many federal health issues and is recognized as a congressional leader on health care issues     National Mens Health Week is an opportunity for us as a nation to focus on some of the critical health issues facing men today  Crapo said  Unfortunately  men are all too often apathetic when it comes to getting the medical help and treatment that they need  In fact  studies have shown that men are 100 percent less likely to visit the doctor than women  Even with improvements in medical technology  men continue to have a shorter life span than women  and of the ten leading causes of death in the country  men lead women in all ten categories     Early detection and preventive efforts are key to reversing these alarming statistics  With Fathers Day just around the corner  it is my hope that National Mens Health Week will empower men and their families with increased awareness and access to important health information  Taking proactive steps to get necessary treatment and care can ultimately lead to longer life spans  fewer hospital visits and lower health costs faced by taxpayers and employers     In February 2007  Crapo also introduced legislation  S  640  that would establish an Office of Mens Health at the United States Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   to mirror the already existing Office of Womens Health  The bill is currently pending in the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  Additionally  Crapo is a leader in promoting free or reduced cost health screenings at Idaho fairs and other events throughout the state     Each June since 1994  National Men s Health Week is celebrated in 45 states and hundreds of cities  localities  public health departments and health care facilities     The following statistics reveal the importance of increased awareness for mens health issues   All ten of the ten leading causes of death  as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  affect men at a higher percentage than women  Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in men aged 15 to 34  and  when detected early  has a 95 percent survival rate  Between ages 45 and 54  men are 3 times more likely than women to die of heart attacks  Men die of cancer at almost 1 5 times the rate of women  The likelihood that a man will develop prostate cancer is 1 in 6  statistics show an estimated 230 000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone and approximately 30 000 will die  and Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific antigen  PSA  exams and blood pressure screens  in conjunction with clinical examination and self testing for problems such as testicular cancer  can result in early detection and increase the survival rates to nearly 100 percent   In addition to his work on the Senate Finance Committee  Crapo has been recognized and awarded by several prominent health care advocacy groups and has also served as founder and Co Chairman of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  COPD  Caucus and the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition
