 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo issued the following statement after the U S  Senate voted against cloture on S  470  the Iraq Resolution Bill  regarding military troops in Iraq   The final vote was 49 yeas to 47 nays  60 votes were needed to end debate  invoke cloture    Crapo was among those who voted to permit full debate to continue        Matters of war deserve full debate  It was distressing to learn that Senate procedures were being manipulated to preclude a full debate on what may be the most important issue ever to come before a Congress   war   In fact  the efforts to limit discussion and consideration of different proposed resolutions in order to ensure a certain outcome undermine the significance of the issue   Thankfully  today   s vote ensures that debate will continue in the Senate   It assures that we have an opportunity to debate all the ideas about what message to send to our military troops as well as the American public and the world   While each Senator may differ considerably from the next regarding our nation   s strategy in Iraq  we owe it to the public to have a full and open debate followed by votes that will provide direction for our country  not just political posturing   We should ensure that a number of differing positions are considered        For success in Iraq  it is imperative that all branches of government work together toward a common goal   Non binding resolutions that seek to convey the sense of Congress have a role in the functioning of our government   But I fear that without a full and fair debate some of the Iraq resolution proposals serve primarily to show deep divisions in Congress and the U S  government during wartime   This is not a message that I am willing to send while service personnel are engaged in their missions   We must remain united in our support for our men and women in uniform as they carry out their duties  and those troops deserve to have various proposals to be debated on the U S  Senate floor        My vote today against cloture should not be misunderstood   This is a very important debate  one that should be fair and open   It is my desire to find an appropriate strategy regarding our nation   s continued involvement in Iraq   The vote in the Senate today tried to end that discussion prematurely  and my vote against cloture registers my objections to the way this debate has been handled
