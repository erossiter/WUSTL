 Washington  DC     Idaho native Sheri Garmon will do more to advance her cause for compensation for victims of radiation exposure than she will ever know  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   Garmon  an Emmett native who pushed to have Idahoans included a national radiation compensation fund  died last week of complications related to cancer   At the request of Representative Kathy Skippen  Crapo is sending a statement to be read at Garmon   s funeral on Thursday      In the statement  Crapo recalled meeting Garmon at an Emmett rally in September of last year  after she had been diagnosed with cancer      What most astonished me was the way Sheri was able to continue to keep a positive outlook  to focus on her future and that of her family   She dedicated what was left of her life to working toward a goal   I told her and many of you on that day back in September 2004 that I resolved to join that fight   I have kept my word to Sheri and will continue to work to achieve her goal to get Idahoans recognized under the compensation programs for radiation exposure victims       Just a few days ago  I had the opportunity to speak one more time with Sheri   This time she had entered the hospital for what was probably the last time   And  yet  the same spirit she exhibited last year was evident  if not stronger   When I offered solace and prayers for her condition  she showed confidence  hope and a fighting spirit   She reiterated her desire for more time to use to help move forward on legislation that will compensate Idahoans who were affected by the nuclear testing so long ago        Crapo has introduced S  998  a bill to make Idahoans eligible for inclusion under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  RECA    The fund assists those who prove exposure to government caused radiation fallout   Garmon feared she was among those victims     Earlier this month  Crapo wrote the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to seek expedited action on S  998   This week he added two more letters seeking legislative action  including a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  HHS   asking RECA reforms be put forth in policy decisions as legislative changes are considered   Crapo said while the sweeping changes in RECA contemplated by a National Academy of Sciences  NAS  study released earlier this year are studied  Idahoans should not have to wait to be included in the existing program      The pressing needs of currently afflicted Idahoans should not have to wait while Congress works to establish a new mechanism to administer assistance     he wrote in a letter to HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt this week
