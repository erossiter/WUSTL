 Washington  DC     Enlisting more people in conservation efforts by offering incentives to private landowners is a key component of an ESA improvement bill introduced today by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln   Crapo  R Idaho  and Lincoln  D Arkansas  have co chaired a bipartisan working group on ESA issues which produced the legislation introduced today       S  2110  the Collaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act  CRESA   focuses on additional participation by landowners and states to recover species   It also  for the first time  introduces incentives such as tax breaks and conservation banking provisions   Conservation banking is a concept that encourages voluntary conservation efforts and partnerships and has been used successfully in several states   The bill allows the federal government to prioritize its resources to get funding to the species most in need  while incorporating local input on recovery plans and species recovery teams        We must decrease the conflict inherent in present efforts to speed recovery     Crapo said      Collaboration and incentives offered to property owners will be a faster route to recovery of species than litigation in the courts   CRESA allows for innovation  flexibility  and the collaborative involvement of many parties  which have proven to be more effective in recovering species            This is a constructive  bipartisan effort to update a 30 year old law which has increasingly slowed the recovery of endangered species     Lincoln said      By encouraging greater involvement between land owners and environmentalists  it is my hope that we can minimize litigation and enhance recovery        Crapo and Lincoln say CRESA has groundbreaking incentive provisions   The proposed tax incentives will reward landowners who help recover species   The conservation banking provision is an innovative market program that allows landowners to profit from conservation efforts through use of conservation credits   Additionally  there are regulatory incentives for landowners who voluntarily contribute to recovery with simpler procedures and through Farm Bill programs   This bill makes it easier for landowners to do recovery work for species        The tax provisions mean CRESA may receive a hearing next year before the Senate Finance Committee   Crapo and Lincoln are both members of the Finance Committee        We   ve seen amazing things happen in Idaho  in Arkansas  and in California to name just a few   We   ve seen landowners  conservationists  local  state and federal agencies come together  figure out a workable plan and set about to do the business of recovering species   These plans are tried and true   they work and they need to have the strength of the law behind them     Crapo concluded
