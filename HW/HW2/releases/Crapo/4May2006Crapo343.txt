 Washington  DC     Months of negotiation and effort paid off this morning for Idaho Senator Mike Crapo as the Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved legislation he authored regarding regulatory relief for the financial services industry   Crapo  who is a member of the Banking Committee  has spent month working on regulatory reform  an issue that has plagued the financial services industry for many years   The Financial Service Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 will now be referred to the full Senate for further action   The U S  House of Representatives passed regulatory reform legislation last year     In his opening statement at the mark up this morning  Crapo said     After many months of negotiations and discussion with regulators  industry  consumer groups  and other interested parties  we now have a bill before us that will provide important regulatory relief for financial institutions   This legislation is a compromise for all sides and doesn   t let the    perfect    stand in the way of what is possible    There are issues on both sides of the aisle that Members have foregone in an effort to support our desire to get a bill signed into law this year   It is my hope that we will be able to continue in this bi partisan manner on the floor and avoid amendments that will delay passage        Idaho   s financial services industry applauded Crapo   s work on this issue   Over the last two years  Crapo has painstakingly gathered information from regulators  industry groups and consumer groups regarding current regulations affecting the financial services industry   Many were concerned with outdated regulations and the inability to recognize technology advances     Gavin Gee  Director of the Idaho Department of Finance  who testified in support of regulatory relief legislation at a March hearing before the Senate Banking Committee  chaired by Senator Crapo  stated      Senator Crapo   s outstanding leadership on financial services regulatory relief in the U S  Senate has produced much needed legislation  which we fully support  that will benefit Idaho and all financial institutions and their customers   We thank Senator Crapo for his significant work and primary leadership role in this effort and urge Congress to act quickly on this very important legislation        Idaho Credit Union League President CEO Alan D  Cameron said     I commend Senator Crapo for taking on the challenge of providing regulatory relief to credit unions and others in the financial services industry and for crafting a bill that presents a fair compromise in a nonpartisan manner   This bill will help credit unions in their continuing effort to reach out to and serve people in their communities who may not now have ready access to mainstream financial services      Idaho Bankers Association President CEO Dawn Justice said     The Idaho Bankers Association owes Senator Crapo a great debt of gratitude for his tireless work on the Regulatory Relief bill   It was a contentious issue with many competing interests and the Senator  in his usual way  was successful in negotiating some of the toughest compromises  The bill is a great step in the right direction for the banking industry  as it attempts to eliminate out dated  needless regulation   The burden of new regulation is immense  so it was extremely important that an effort be made to remove some of the regulation that no longer served a purpose
