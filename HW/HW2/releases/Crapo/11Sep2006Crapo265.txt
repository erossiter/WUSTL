 Washington  DC     A newly released General Accountability Office  GAO  report says that species recovery under the Endangered Species Act would be improved with changes  and Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says his CRESA bill  Collaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act  S  2110  offers some of the needed solutions   Crapo introduced the CRESA bill last December with Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas    He was one of the members of Congress who requested the GAO to review the success of the ESA        What the GAO found in large part was that the creation of habitat and agreement on effective and timely restoration plans are what is most critical in recovering species     Crapo said      Those issues are also what is central to the CRESA bill   an effort to build collaboration around recovery plans and create more habitat by offering incentives to private landowners   The creation of habitat on private lands presents a major opportunity to accelerate species recovery   The CRESA approach as supported by the GAO report  will build cooperation  trust  and increase positive results for species in trouble        A central feature of the CRESA bill is the participation by landowners and states to recover species  CRESA would improve recovery plans to gather more information about the species and provide incentives to government and private landowners to carry the plans out   It would also allow the federal government to prioritize its resources to get funding to the species most in need  while incorporating local input on recovery plans and species recovery teams   Crapo has discussed improving the ESA on the Senate floor and has met with Senators on both sides of the aisle and in differing committees to gather input on the CRESA bill   He noted it remains the only bipartisan legislative measure introduced to offer meaningful improvements to the ESA  The CRESA bill was endorsed earlier this year by the Idaho Legislature and grants states more input into species recovery efforts        More and more people are agreeing we need to put our efforts into on the ground collaborative work and not into arguments and lawsuits   The result will be better for people and better for species     Crapo added     The full GAO report as requested by Crapo and his colleagues is available at  http   www gao gov
