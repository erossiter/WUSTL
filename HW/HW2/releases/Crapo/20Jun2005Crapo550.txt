 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  commended Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns for the U S  Department of Agriculture   s  USDA  announcement today to terminate the proceedings to establish a marketing order for hops grown in Washington  Oregon  Idaho and California            This proposed marketing order would have had a significant impact on Idaho hop producers     said Crapo      Throughout the course of these proceedings  I have appreciated the USDA   s careful consideration of how this order would affect the industry   Idaho hop growers have been unified in their opposition to the proposed order  and I commend them for their diligence in delivering their clear  centralized message every step of the way that they do not support the adoption of the proposed hops marketing order          In reaching the decision  the USDA noted several problems with the proposed hop marketing order   No need for the order was demonstrated  no positive economic impact on the industry could be identified  and there was no determination that the benefits and costs associated with the proposed marketing order could be allocated equitably       Crapo  who has worked with the USDA and Idaho hop growers to ensure that Idaho hop producer   s concerns with the proposed marketing order have been addressed  sent a letter to Secretary Johanns in May to express his opposition to the proposed order and explain Idaho hop producer concerns   In the letter  Crapo stated that he did not want to see the establishment of a marketing order that would erode the U S  hop industry   s ability to compete in the global market          Today   s announcement is the best possible outcome for Idaho hop producers  who have been contesting this proposed order for more than two years     Crapo said      Now  they can continue to produce high quality hops without the cloud of this marketing order hanging over them
