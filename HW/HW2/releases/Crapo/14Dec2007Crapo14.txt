 Washington  DC  Under legislation passed today by the U S  Senate  Idaho seniors will be able to continue to access the equity in their homes  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  The U S  Senate passed S  2338  the Federal Housing Administration  FHA   Modernization Act of 2007  which included Crapos amendment to permit FHAs reverse mortgage program for seniors to continue  Absent the action by Congress  the program would have been halted  Crapo  who serves on the Senate Banking Committee which has jurisdiction over housing issues  voted in favor of the measure  which passed on an overwhelming vote of 93 to 1     The Senate took an important step today in advancing legislation to modernize FHA programs so that they can be better tools for lenders to use in serving the housing needs of American families who are not served or are underserved by conventional markets  Crapo said  Modernizing the FHA enables it to play a larger role in strengthening the mortgage markets  while offering borrowers a safe and fair mortgage alternative     The FHA Modernization bill would increase access to FHA insured loans at a time when many people need to refinance loans to remain in their homes  While safeguarding American taxpayers  the legislation provides certain relief by lowering some down payment requirements  allows FHA to keep up with marketplace changes  and includes Crapos provisions to permit FHAs reverse mortgage program for seniors to continue and flourish  The FHAs reverse mortgage program enables senior homeowners to remain in their homes and financially independent by converting part of their home equity into tax free income  The seniors are able to do so without having to sell their home  give up their title  or take on a new monthly mortgage payment     Crapo continued  I am especially pleased that this legislation removes the statutory cap on the number of reverse mortgages that FHA can insure and will prevent the possibility of future program disruption  The programs rapid growth created a near crisis in 2005 when concerns arose that the cap was being reached and the program would be suspended  Currently  the cap is temporarily suspended     The Federal Housing Administrations reverse mortgage program is an important example of a successful public private partnership  It allows our elderly citizens the opportunity to age in place  by spending their own equity and retaining their dignity  Predictions are being made that  in the future  these loans will be a common financial planning tool for retirees     Crapo  who serves as the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing  Transportation  and Community Development  spoke on the Senate floor during debate over S  2338  The House has passed a separate version of the bill  so the two measures must be conferenced before final action can be taken by Congress
