 Washington  DC     As the Senate session wrapped up over the weekend  the U S  Senate passed by unanimous consent a financial services industry package authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Banking Committee  The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006  S  2856  reduces the regulatory burden on banks  thrift institutions and credit unions in Idaho and nationwide   The financial institutions industry is among the most heavily regulated industries in the country   Reducing the burden of unnecessary or outdated government regulation allows financial institutions to shift their resources from complying with these regulations  to make more small business  consumer and housing loans  enhancing economic development and returning money to consumers in the form of reduced fees  The measure was approved last week in the House and will now be sent to the President for his signature       Crapo said     This brings to a close over two years of intense work on regulatory reform for the financial services industry  and I am very pleased that we have reached this point   The last time Congress passed a regulatory relief package was over 10 years ago   As this process demonstrates  it is important for Congress to periodically review the laws applicable to the financial services industry to ensure that compliance and red tape does not impose an unreasonable and unnecessary burden on the economy and truly achieves its intended goals   While there are still reforms that need to be made  this is a terrific beginning   I commend Banking Chairman Shelby  Ranking Member Sarbanes  House Financial Services Committee Chairman Oxley and Ranking Member Barney Frank for their leadership on this issue   Without their tenacious efforts  we would not have reached agreement and passage this Congress    Crapo continued     Ending the nearly seven year logjam over the SEC   s proposed Regulation B  or Reg B  by directing the SEC to work with the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate joint regulations is intended to ensure that regulators do not create a new and burdensome regulatory maze of requirements that would disrupt or interfere with the business practices of banks and thrifts that offer traditional bank products and services to their customers   Ultimately  this legislation will lessen the regulatory burden  so banks  thrifts  and credit unions can better serve their customers and communities        Crapo has been the Senate leader in prompting reforms in the financial services industry that will ultimately improve customer services  and has spent the last two years working on this measure
