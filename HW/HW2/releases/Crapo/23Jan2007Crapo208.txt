 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo issued the following statement regarding the President   s annual State of the Union address delivered to Congress this evening        Tonight   s speech recognized the hard tasks facing Congress as well as the bipartisan support that will be necessary for our country to progress and resolve some long standing domestic issues     Crapo said      The tone that President Bush set from the beginning recognized the dissatisfaction that the American public has expressed on the direction of the country  and he set out some domestic and foreign policy goals that are not only needed  but have the potential to bring Congress together in solving some tough challenges we face        I particularly noted his desire to improve the No Child Left Behind Act  as that is a priority of mine as well   Earlier this week  I re introduced legislation to address some of the very issues that the President mentioned   I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to strengthen our public education system and keep our students competitive        The initiatives laid out on health care were broad and will require much discussion   All Americans deserve to have access to high quality healthcare and the President   s proposal to make health insurance more affordable through the tax code may be a good approach   Healthcare decisions must remain with patients and doctors  and I will support efforts that will keep those decisions at that level        One of the most daunting challenges facing our country right now is immigration and  again  the President has laid out a plan that touches on many of the issues that so deeply concern Idahoans and others   secure borders  jobs for Americans  criminals conducting illegal activities across the border   It is important that we find solutions to these issues  and I expect to fully participate in the debate that will continue over immigration        It was terrific to hear the President endorse the need for renewable and alternative energies   As a member of the Senate Renewable and Energy Efficiency Caucus  I have long advocated increasing our efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil   It is within our own interests to reduce our reliance on traditional energy sources and find ways to conserve energy  improve efficiency and pioneer alternative and renewable energy choices        Finally  the President wound up his speech discussing foreign policy and the War on Terror   This issue has deeply divided our nation  and as we discuss and debate our country   s options  we must keep our national security at the forefront   As I continue to review the President   s proposals as well as the legislation and resolutions proposed by various Senators  I agree that it is necessary to work together  to continue the debate  and to ascertain the most effective way to keep American citizens safe from terrorism  regardless of whether they are at home or abroad        Crapo concluded     Tonight  the President did exactly what he needed to do   The election in November left both the House of Representatives and the Senate with a change in leadership and razor thin margins   The speech noted that and concluded correctly that it isn   t so important on which side of the aisle you sit  but whether you are willing to walk across the aisle to find solutions to the challenges our country faces   I look forward to discussing  debating  and hopefully resolving these issues as the 110th Congress moves ahead
