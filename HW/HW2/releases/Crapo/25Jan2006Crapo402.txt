 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo issued the following reaction to remarks on salmon recovery made today in Portland by James Connaughton  Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality        Jim Connaughton s speech presents ideas that are intriguing  and yet raise some items of concern   We all agree that wild anadromous fish recovery needs to be properly balanced among all the H s habitat  hydropower  hatchery  and harvest        However  there are many uncoordinated activities  understandably so  occurring in the region at this time lawsuits  appeals  remands  other harvest reviews  habitat programs  and many hydropower activities   And many of these activities are managed by state or tribal governments   The matter of how we coordinate these ongoing efforts region wide is a threshold decision that must be made before we move forward   It would be useful to recognize the recently completed Nez Perce Agreement as a model of difficult negotiation and collaboration that resulted in a durable agreement         Additionally  hatcheries provide for our salmon and steelhead sport fishery so we must be mindful of the impact that changing hatchery practices and policies might have   Not only is hook and line fishing an iconic regional activity  but it is also the basis of a great many local economies in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest   Certainly many existing hatchery practices must be reviewed  but we cannot forget the thousands of anglers that work very hard for anadromous fish recovery   I am pleased to support the Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery initiatives  and believe these techniques to hold great potential          It is my hope that Chairman Connaughton s remarks stimulate a solution oriented regional effort to develop a recovery plan to restores our wild anadromous fish to sustainable  harvestable numbers  while preserving reliable and affordable electricity  a strong economy  and diverse culture in our region          I look forward to working with the Administration  other members of Congress  and all interested parties in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest  in this critically important effort
