 Washington  DC     Concerns that the Idaho National Guard does not have the necessary equipment to properly deal with potential disasters or domestic emergencies has sparked a letter to the White House by Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig   In the letter to President Bush today  the Senators agree with concerns expressed by Governor Dirk Kempthorne and Adjutant General Lawrence LaFrenz that equipment Guard members left in Iraq will not be available for disaster response and that troops will be unable to maintain the advanced skills they learned on equipment that was left behind                The Army National Guard plays a crucial role in State response to domestic emergencies  The greatly diminished percentage of equipment on hand in our Guard units carries with it the risk of not only denying these units the equipment needed to conduct good training for their combat mission but also leaves them with fewer tools to support State responses to natural disasters  terrorist incidents or other emergencies     Crapo and Craig wrote in the letter to the President      While it is possible to shift equipment from state to state  it is clear that National Guard response will be faster if the needed equipment is available for training and closer to the point of need             The Senators added the General Accounting Office  GAO  might also be of assistance in determining the needs of Idaho   s Guard      Specific items of National Guard equipment are of particular value for homeland security purposes   These include trucks of various sizes  communications equipment  night vision devices  engineer equipment and helicopters  Unfortunately  the National Guard has troubling shortages in all of these areas   Nationwide the Guard has only 2 3 of the Humvees  3 4 of the radios  half of the night vision devices and 1 4 of the modern medium trucks it needs to be mission responsive   Moreover  due to combat wear and the operational need for returning units to leave some equipment behind in the combat zone  these shortages are getting worse               Governor Kempthorne  returning from visiting with Idaho troops in the Middle East  met with both Senator Crapo and Senator Craig in Washington  DC today   The Senators want President Bush to include Idaho   s needs as he prepares his military and defense budgets for Fiscal Year 2007
