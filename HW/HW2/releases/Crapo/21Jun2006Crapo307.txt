 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring a Senate bill tightening the laws against child pornography and the exploitation of children   S  2140  the Protecting Children from Exploitation Act sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch  R Utah   strengthens several laws surrounding pornographic material  including a provision that requires producers maintain records detailing the ages and names of persons appearing in such material      Crapo says the bill  which already has 26 co sponsors  is needed because the U S  Department of Justice has encountered problems in prosecuting distributors of child pornography   Justice officials say those producing such material are using loopholes in the law the new act is intended to close     S  2140 would criminalize the refusal to permit inspection of name and age records of performers in material which depicts actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct   It would also update existing statutes to take into account use of the Internet to distribute such pornography        The connection between viewing child pornography and becoming a child predator is also strong and conclusive     Crapo said      The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children revealed  in a study from June of last year  that 40  of those arrested for possessing child pornography had also victimized children   The increased regulation and requirements in S  2140 will make Idaho   s children safer
