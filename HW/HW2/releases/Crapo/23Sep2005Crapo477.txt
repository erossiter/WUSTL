 Washington  DC    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring the Pledge Protection Act  S  1046  to protect the Pledge of Allegiance from being removed from schools  after a U S  District Court Judge in California ruled the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools unconstitutional last week       The measure would bar federal courts  appellate courts  and the Supreme Court from hearing or deciding on any rulings regarding the interpretation of the Pledge of Allegiance under the Constitution   Currently  the ruling only pertains to a few schools in California  but if the Ninth Circuit Court upholds the ruling after an appeals process  all states within the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction would be subject to the ruling  including Idaho         The Pledge of Allegiance is a symbol of commitment to America and needs to be protected     Crapo said      The Pledge is woven throughout history and it is important that our children and future generations are instilled with the value of patriotism  of which the Pledge is a part         This bill comes after the Senate  with the support of Crapo  also passed a resolution  S  Res  243  expressing strong disapproval of last week   s ruling regarding the Pledge of Allegiance
