 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a newly selected member of the Senate Finance Committee  has joined in support of legislation aimed at encouraging private donations for tsunami disaster relief   H R  241  which has been spearheaded by leaders of the Finance Committee  was introduced in the U S  House of Representatives this morning where all revenue bills must originate   The Senate took up the bill this afternoon   Both houses passed the measure by unanimous consent and it will now be sent to the President  who has indicated that he will sign it       The bill would allow taxpayers who make tsunami aid contributions through January 31  2005  to deduct those donations from their taxable income for 2004   It applies specifically to deductible cash contributions for tsunami relief to any tax exempt charitable group that falls under Section 501 c  3  of the tax code          Under current law  taxpayers would have to wait until 2006 to claim a tax deduction     Crapo said      The enormity of the disaster and the overwhelming need for assistance makes it clear that we need to do what we can to encourage people to donate now rather than later   This doesn   t permanently change any tax code  but provides a strong incentive for those who may be considering donating to a tax exempt relief organization   We have already seen a tremendous outpouring of generosity from Americans and this added incentive will encourage even more to demonstrate their compassion   I am pleased that the Congress has acted so quickly on this measure and that the President intends to sign it        The most recent estimate has put the death toll from the tsunami that struck December 26  2004 at more than 150 000 with some expecting the number to double in the coming weeks   The tsunami devastated numerous countries and islands throughout southeast Asia              FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
