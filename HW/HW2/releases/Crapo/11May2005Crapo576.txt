 Washington  DC     Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig today introduced legislation that would include all of Idaho under the existing federal government program to compensate those who can show medical evidence they were harmed by nuclear testing fallout in the 1950s and 1960s   The so called downwinders are now compensated only in parts of Utah  Nevada  and Arizona  although studies show some Idaho counties received some of the highest doses of radioactive fallout from the Nevada tests       The legislation introduced today by the Senators amends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  RECA  to include Idaho   The RECA Act recognizes participants based on geography  but that may soon change   A recent report released by the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  recommends that Congress change RECA to more accurately account for compensation so it is based on scientific standards and the medical history of applicants and not reliant on geographic designations       Senators Crapo and Craig recognize that change  but say in the meantime  Idahoans affected by the fallout need government help as soon as possible   They noted that some may not be able to wait for changes to RECA  and thus they want any Idahoans affected to be able to apply for compensation under the existing program while the new one is being framed          Information used to establish who would be eligible for compensation failed to recognize that four counties in Idaho ranked in the top five in having the highest per capita thyroid dosage of radiation in the nation  more than any county currently recognized by RECA for eligibility     Crapo said in a statement for the Congressional Record      This clear inequity must be rectified  Idaho has a documented history of high cancer rates in people who lived in these areas during testing           The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed that compensation under RECA should not be confined to the Act s current geographical borders     said Craig     While the scientific standards are being updated to reflect the best available science  we must ensure that Idahoans are made eligible so that there will be no delay for those who qualify for compensation today        Crapo credited in his floor statement Idahoans involved in the effort to make the case for downwinders   He said former and present Emmett area residents Sheri Garmon  Idaho Representative Kathy Skippen  and Tona Henderson as leaders who have fought for compensation on behalf of all Idaho victims of nuclear fallout   While introducing the RECA legislation  Idaho   s Senators will also continue to make program more comprehensive for future applicants
