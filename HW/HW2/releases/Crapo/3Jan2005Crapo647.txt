 Washington  DC      With this afternoon   s announcement by Interior Secretary Gale Norton regarding the official transition to state management of wolves  Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig and Idaho Representatives Mike Simpson and C L     Butch    Otter joined together to applaud the action  which validates Idaho   s leadership in the conservation of wolves   More than 450 wolves are located in Idaho  with a total of at least 850 wolves in the Idaho Montana Wyoming area          This demonstrates that the Idaho vision for species conservation works   the state does its part  the federal agencies do theirs  and together we have a real partnership   said Crapo    By putting forward our own conservation plans  we in Idaho have found that the conservation job gets done and property rights are protected at the same time          Craig said     After years of hard work by Governor Kempthorne and other affected states  we have reached the goal of state management  and are one step closer to de listing wolves in Idaho   Unfortunately  the wolves are breeding faster than the paperwork can be completed   In Idaho alone  there are approximately 450 wolves and the population is still growing   I appreciate Secretary Norton   s commitment to the recovery of this species and know that state management of wolves will bring about a successful and levelheaded recovery of this    threatened    species             The State of Idaho is clearly prepared to manage its own wolf population and I commend the Bush Administration for recognizing that fact and moving to transition authority back to the State     said Simpson       Otter said     This is a welcome and important step toward recognizing state authority  I applaud Secretary Norton for acknowledging the value of Idaho s efforts  and for moving federal policy toward accepting that states are good stewards  While I have never supported releasing Canadian gray wolves in Idaho  the fact is that they re here now  Dealing with them effectively requires ensuring that states and local communities play the primary role in species management  This expanded authority brings that ideal closer to reality          During the 2002 and 2003 state legislative sessions  the Governor and the Legislature issued state policies supporting a viable self sustaining population of wolves and protecting livestock and big game herds   The Idaho policy required that federal policy be updated so that an orderly transition of authority could proceed back to the state level   The Nez Perce Tribe  which has been implementing the field work of wolf conservation under federal authority  is expected to continue to play a role as a partner with the State of Idaho
