 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has co sponsored new legislation seeking to avoid a costly permitting process for owners of family and recreation boats not intended under federal law  Crapo  a member of the Congressional Boating Caucus and the Co Chair of the Congressional Sportsmens Caucus  says recent judicial interpretations of environmental law could penalize boat owners for incidental discharge related to bilge water  engine cooling water and common deck runoff     The Recreational Boating Act  S  2067  was introduced by Senator Mel Martinez  R Florida   It codifies a 34 year old exemption recreational boats have from permitting requirements for incidental discharge under law  Recently  a U S  District Court nullified the Environmental Protection Agencys  EPA  rule  and overturned the exemptions  That ruling  which came as the result of a lawsuit brought with the intention to protect waters from invasive species carried aboard ships in ballast water  will now have a dramatic effect on the nations eighteen million recreational boats  Ballast water  which is largely used by commercial boats  is carried on board to ensure stability     Unless Congress moves to restore this exemption  millions of family and recreational boat owners will be required to comply with a burdensome and costly permitting system  Crapo said  People operating canoes and kayaks could be affected if this exemption is not restored by this legislation  We need to focus this law to the appropriate water craft  and that is what this bill will provide     Groups supporting the legislation include the Blue Ribbon Coalition  the Congressional Sportsmens Foundation and the National Marine Manufacturers Association
