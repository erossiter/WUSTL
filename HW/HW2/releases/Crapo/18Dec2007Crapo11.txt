 WASHINGTON  D C Annual efforts to raise awareness of the crime of teen dating violence nationwide received resounding reinforcement late last night when a Senate Resolution authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo declaring February 4  8  2008  National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week passed the U S  Senate by Unanimous Consent     Dating violence has been shown to be a precursor to adult domestic violence  it is a cruel reality for many American teens  said Crapo  We must teach our children what it means to have healthy relationships free from harassment  fear and physical and emotional abuse  This annual effort helps communities across the nation raise awareness of the destructive and sometimes fatal dating relationships of our teens  and promotes prevention of this violence    Crapo continued  I m honored to have spearheaded efforts to raise awareness here in the United States Senate  and I want to thank all the organizations in Idaho who partner with me in this important Initiative  including the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence  the Idaho Council on Domestic Violence and Victim Assistance  the Womens Center Incorporated of Coeur d Alene  the Nampa Family Justice Center  Advocates Against Family Violence of Caldwell and the Lewiston YWCA  These organizations will continue their efforts to raise awareness of the importance of healthy dating relationships throughout Idaho  and I encourage Idahoans to contact one of these organizations and become involved in this important effort in 2008    The Idaho Council on Domestic Violence and Victim Assistance would like to commend Senator Crapo for his diligent work in procuring a National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week  said Luann Dettman  Executive Director of the Idaho Council on Domestic Violence and Victim Assistance  Through his efforts we will be able to promote education and conduct public awareness activities for a better understanding of a teen victimization that is rarely reported  We must recognize how prevalent Teen Dating Violence has become and the importance of providing teens with the knowledge and resources to secure their safety      Through a federal grant  the Idaho Teen Dating Violence Awareness  Prevention Project  a collaborative project of Idaho s advocacy  medical  education  legal and youth based organizations  is working hard to increase awareness on teen dating violence through a statewide campaign  said Kelly Miller  Legal Director  Idaho Coalition Against Sexual  Domestic Violence  Teen dating violence prevention is critical work  Teens are very aware of the high levels of teen dating violence in their communities   name calling  derogatory remarks  demands to be always available through cell phones  isolation from family  friends or activities  pressure to use alcohol or drugs  or the pressure to have sexual contact  As a community  we need to alert teens and parents on the warning signs of teen dating violence and encourage families to have a real discussion on strategies for safe dating    Nicole Crowell with the YWCA of Lewiston  Idaho and Clarkston Washington asked teen attendees of its teen dating violence awareness and prevention presentation about what was most useful and received the following responses     Learning how to get out of an abusive relationship     How to recognize when someone is in danger of an abusive relationship     Knowing that it happens everywhere and you can get help fast     This resembled a relationship I used to be in  The information was helpful     I feel more empowered to stand up for myself     This marks the third year that the Senate has passed a resolution declaring the first full week in February as a time to encourage local  state and national organizations  governments and private industry to call attention to the tragedy and pervasiveness of teen dating violence in our communities     The crime of teen dating violence  including physical  emotional and sexual assault  and harassment via texting  email or Instant Messaging is a reality for many American teenagers  Like drug abuse  its a reality of which many parents are unaware     One in three female teens in a dating relationship report having feared for their safety    30  of teens in a dating relationship have been text messaged 10  20  or 30 times an hour by a partner finding out where they are  what they are doing or who they are with    One in five teens in a serious relationship report having been hit  slapped or pushed by a partner    One in four girls in a relationship report having been pressured to go further sexually than they really wanted     The Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Initiative was started by teens through the American Bar Association in 2004  In 2006  the first national week was declared by Congress and was declared in 2007 as well  Both years  a number of governors declared proclamations  and today  the Initiative includes over 35 national  state and local agencies and organizations as partners  More information can be found at  http   crapo senate gov issues teen_dating_violence cfm
