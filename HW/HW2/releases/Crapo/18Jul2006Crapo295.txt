 Washington  DC     Funding for adult and alternative stem cell research was approved today through the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act  S  2754   with the support of Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  as the Senate voted on three stem cell related bills   Crapo also voted in favor of a second bill   S  3504  to prohibit    farming    embryonic stem cells  but against a third bill   H R  810  that would allow human embryos created during invitro procedures to be used for research and subsequently destroyed  All three bills were passed by the Senate        I recognize the significant medical breakthroughs that may result from stem cell research and support federally funded research conducted within strict ethical guidelines   The federal government shouldn   t support such research when it involves the purposeful creation and destruction of human embryos   Additionally  I do not condone using federal dollars to fund programs that harvest living embryos solely for the purpose of research   The significant amount of medical information that can be gained from research must be balanced with the responsibility to the unborn of our society     We don   t have to choose between science and ethics with the vast amounts of promising results coming from adult and alternative stem cell research     Crapo said      The federal government should support research to develop alternative stem cells that are capable of producing almost all cell types but do not destroy a human embryo  and it should send funding where there are proven results   Aside from ethics  stem cells drawn from adults  umbilical cord blood and others with no harm to the donors are already used in human treatments  and currently show more real potential for more diverse applications than those cells derived from embryos          The Senate   s approval today of the three bills will now send H R  810 to the president for signature or veto  The two Senate originated bills  S  2754 and S  3504  will be sent to the House for further consideration      FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov in the Radio Links
