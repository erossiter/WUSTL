 Washington  DC     The Senate Budget Committee has voted to approve a budget blueprint that reduces the deficit  but still gives priority to homeland security and defense spending   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Budget Committee  supported the blueprint and expects the final document sent to the Senate will assume funding for new nuclear research at the Idaho National Laboratory and language beneficial to Idaho   s largest private employer  Micron Technology           This is a bare bones budget blueprint  one that will cut the deficit in half in five years and one that still funds homeland security and national defense  which have to be our priorities at this stage     Crapo said      While this document is only a blueprint  the budget also assumes the funding necessary for a demonstration of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant by 2015   The Idaho National Laboratory is the Department of Energy s lead lab on nuclear energy research and development           The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution also eliminates language that could have created questions over trade case payments related to Micron and softwood lumber   Crapo worked to delete language relating to subsidy and tariff payments which Micron and some lumber companies have collected resulting from unfair trade   The actions mean those payments will not become part of discussions related to budget setting and the U S  Treasury          The Budget Resolution was approved by a 12 10 margin in committee and now goes to the Senate floor   It would cut deficits from a projected  362 billion next year to  208 billion in 2010   The  843 4 billion provided in discretionary spending  outside the more fixed cost of living related programs like Social Security  is in line with President Bush   s budget request           The deficit and war against terror mean lean budgets  but we are seeking to extend tax policies that are stimulating economic growth while keeping education programs like Pell Grants  welfare and pension programs intact     Crapo said      The budget also envisions a comprehensive national energy policy  something that is long overdue and which will assist not only our financial picture but our independence from foreign oil                Crapo added the budget document also guards against future temptations for excess federal spending      For the first time in almost ten years  this budget resolution is addressing the fastest growing part of our federal spending   The reconciliation instructions in this resolution will provide for a positive first step in reducing the rate of growth of mandatory spending  which by 2015  will make up two thirds of all federal spending   This budget resolution also contains new budget enforcement provisions  which will make it more difficult for Congress to recklessly increase spending or to pass unfunded mandates on to the states     he concluded
