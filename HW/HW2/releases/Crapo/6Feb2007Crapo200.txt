 Washington  DC   Under legislation introduced by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  middle income taxpayers throughout the country will continue to reap the benefits of tax relief enacted in 2003   Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance Committee  with oversight on tax issues  said the measure would make permanent the tax relief approved earlier on capital gains and dividends       Crapo noted that the latest figures released from the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  show that reducing capital gains tax rates from 20  to 15  in 2003 has  to date  brought in a dramatic 68  increase in new revenues above expectations   Critics had claimed the U S  Treasury would lose  5 4 billion as a result of the lower tax rates during that time frame  the actual revenue was an increase of  133 billion      Middle class Americans today are stockholders  nearly half of all taxpayers with incomes below  50 000 receive dividends or report capital gains   Crapo said    The facts are in  and they show American families and workers  our national economy and our federal budget will benefit by making these tax reductions permanent   And when this tax relief is made permanent  middle class taxpayers will be among the chief beneficiaries        Crapo noted that  under the original 2003 legislation  the capital gains rate for those in the lowest income brackets  10  and 15  brackets  will actually drop to 0  in 2008   The capital gains rate for all others will remain at 15  through 2010   His legislation will maintain the 15  tax rate and stop it from climbing back to 20         The increased revenues from these rate reductions are a critical point to factor in as we are consider our overall budget and spending plans for Fiscal Year 2008   Crapo added    Although we were only able to enact a 2 year extension in the last Congress  now is the time to look at the record   This tax relief brought real economic growth   It has stimulated our economy and our markets and should be kept in place
