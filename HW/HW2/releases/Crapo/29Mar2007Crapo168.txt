   Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted against passage of a supplemental spending bill that contained a mandated deadline for troops to leave Iraq because it sends the wrong message to U S  troops  terrorists  and all Americans   The supplemental spending bill passed on a 51 47 vote and is very likely to be vetoed by President Bush        I don t believe Congress alone is the entity that should be making the decision about troop management in the field   Crapo said    No matter your opinion on the Iraqi conflict  this is not the way to do business regarding spending and foreign policy  I support a fair and detailed debate over our involvement in Iraq  but forcing deadlines on our troops removes the chance to let strategy  including diplomacy  work in the Middle East   We are sending the wrong message to our troops  the terrorists  and our foreign partners working to find solutions to this conflict   This mandate hamstrings our military commanders and supporting it is the wrong direction for the nation at this time
