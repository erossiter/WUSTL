 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo   s Export Import Bank reauthorization legislation passed the Senate Banking Committee by voice vote today  clearing the way for Senate floor action   The Export Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the United States and the current authorization for the Bank ends on September 30   Crapo is chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on International Trade that oversees operations of the Ex Im Bank          Financing is a key element in global trade competition and extending the Bank   s programs for five years is a vital and integral component in supporting the export of American made goods and American provided services for both small and large companies     Crapo said      At the same  time we need to ensure that the Bank   s support for transactions not only helps U S  exports but does not negatively impact domestic companies          Crapo noted the current system still has problems  citing loan guarantees involving semiconductors  steel  ethanol and soda ash   Leaders with Idaho based Micron Technology also provided Crapo with industry insight into some of the current circumstances with the Ex Im Bank          This is a great outcome for Micron  and we thank Sen  Crapo for his leadership on this important issue   said Steve Appleton  Chairman  CEO and President of Micron Technology  Inc   This legislation provides greater fairness through transparency in the US Export Import Bank economic impact analysis process  It allows for public notification of loan changes and designation of sensitive export industries and products    Crapo   s legislation makes the operating and loan process at the Ex Im Bank more transparent in several ways and involves interested stakeholders throughout the process   First  it would require the Bank to maintain a list of sensitive areas where export financing is unlikely to be provided   Second  it requires detailed information to the public regarding the proposed financing at an early stage and in an adequate way so that input can be brought to bear by those who have the expertise on the specific proposal and industries involved   Third  it establishes protections against circumvention of U S  trade remedy orders          There is also a lot of concern that the Bank has not met its 20 percent small business mandate and this legislation builds upon structural changes to make sure the small business community has an advocate to advance its needs and address its concerns     Crapo added      It establishes a Small Business Division  headed by a Senior Vice President who will report directly to the Bank President   It also establishes a Small Business Committee  chaired by the Senior Vice President of the Small Business Division   And  it requires Ex Im to authorize banks to process medium term transactions on behalf of Ex Im to facilitate the approval of such transactions                Under the leadership of Senators Mike Crapo and Richard Shelby  the Senate Banking Committee did an excellent job of listening to smaller exporting companies and responding to their concerns     said James Morrison  President of the Small Business Exporters Association of the United States     The bill contains a number of innovations that will help these companies   For example  it will create a permanent Senior Vice President for Small Business at Ex Im Bank  who will be authorized to develop a strong cadre of small business specialists  and to review small business applications for Ex Im Bank financing that might otherwise be turned down   SBEA is proud to endorse this bill  It   s good for small business
