 Washington  DC     Idaho   s Congressional Delegation issued the following statement today regarding the announcement of further court action regarding the operation of dams along the Upper Salmon River in eastern Idaho          Historically  Idaho   s dams hold back water for irrigators  and Idaho has already agreed to send 427 000 acre feet of water down the river for salmon and steelhead recovery in years where the water is available   We   d prefer the model of collaboration and consensus seen in efforts like the Snake River Basin Adjudication  SRBA  which solved many pending court cases over water rights   Lawsuits like the one filed today go against the spirit of the SRBA Agreement  These kinds of attacks in court will engender counter attacks   The end result will be to crowd out solutions that might otherwise flourish through negotiation and collaboration
