 Washington  D C   Today Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted against moving forward on immigration reform legislation  saying that the bill was a flawed approach to a critical issue  The final vote was 46 53  14 votes short of what was needed to move forward with the legislation     Over the past several weeks I have heard an overwhelming response from Idahoans regarding immigration reform  said Crapo  Clearly  change is desired but not if that change comes with offering amnesty to millions of people who have entered the country illegally     While there were several positive provisions in this legislation  it remained fundamentally flawed  The bills Z Visa measure would grant immediate and permanent legal status to individuals who have illegally entered our country  essentially rewarding illegal entry  This is not an acceptable or effective means to sound immigration policy     The reality is much work remains to be done to properly address the current immigration situation  We must work to restore Americans confidence in the governments ability to protect the integrity of our borders and enforce our existing laws     The underlying issue of immigration reform is one that will not go away  We must work for not just a temporary fix but a solid solution that will secure our borders  not give incentives for more illegal immigration by rewarding illegal entry  allow Americans first right to access available jobs and enable a reasonable guest worker program  The American people deserve and demand our attention to this critical issue           FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality on the immigration reform bill is available by calling 1 800 545 1267  Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions  You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
