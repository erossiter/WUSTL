 Washington  DC     In a Senate hearing today  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo brought Idaho into the center of the debate over the impending beef import rule from the Agriculture Department   The hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee focused on the effects of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  BSE  on U S  imports and exports of cattle and beef   Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns was the primary witness in a nearly three hour hearing on Capitol Hill        Crapo stressed the importance of U S  producers regaining the foreign export markets  especially Japan   He said     We cannot let this languish   In Idaho  we already have one local plant in extended suspension  in large measure as a result of the current export situation with beef         Crapo encouraged Johanns to continue to push for re opening of Pacific Rim markets to U S  cattle and beef exports      Due to Idaho   s geographic location  Idahoans have benefited greatly from past beef trade with Pacific Rim countries  and prolonged closure of the Asian markets hurts Idaho producers and our economy         Since the U S  border opened for importation of Canadian beef products under 30 months of age  Canadian producers have increased their processing capacity by as much as 30 percent      U S  cattle producers and our economy are impacted as domestic processing capabilities are squeezed and shifted above the border     Crapo said during the hearing   Crapo further questioned the science behind a specific provision of the rule  set to take effect March 7th  that would expand beef products that will be allowed into the U S      I am concerned with the portion of the rule that provides for the import of beef over 30 months of age  even though cattle over 30 months of age will not be allowed to be imported   It is inconsistent to ban cattle over 30 months of age while allowing in boxed beef over 30 months of age         During questioning  Johanns indicated USDA will continue to work to regain U S  export markets quickly   He also indicated that he understood the concerns with the inconsistencies pointed out by Crapo and others on the committee in the expected rule and plans to address it                FOR INTERESTED MEDIA  A radio actuality is available by calling 1 800 545 1267   Press 327 at any time during or after the greeting and instructions   You can also access the actuality through the Internet at http   src senate gov radio
