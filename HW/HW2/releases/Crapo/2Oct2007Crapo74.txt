 Washington  DC  Americans who invest in mutual funds can look forward to more profitable  long term investing and a more secure retirement  thanks to a bipartisan bill introduced today by Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho  and Tim Johnson  D South Dakota   The bill would allow shareholders who automatically reinvest distributions to keep more of their own money working for them longer by deferring capital gains taxes until they actually sell the investment  Senator Judd Gregg  R New Hampshire   Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  is also an original co sponsor of the bill     The bill remedies an unfairness in the tax code that complicates savings unnecessarily for middle income Americans  Currently  shareholders in taxable mutual funds are subject to yearly capital gains taxes  even if no shares are sold and capital gains distributions are re invested into fund shares  Under the Generating Retirement Ownership Through Long Term Holding  GROWTH  Act  mutual fund investors would receive the same treatment as investors in individual stock  and would pay capital gains taxes only when the investment is sold     The government needs to do more to help Americans prepare for retirement  the tax code should help  not hinder  the process  Crapo  a member of both the Senate Finance and Banking Committees  said  American families have historically low savings rates  The GROWTH Act provides a better tool to grow long term retirement investments  and this bipartisan legislation will be a step in doing everything we can to promote sound investing and preparation for retirement savings  I look forward to working with Senator Johnson and Senator Gregg to advance this legislation     The GROWTH Act would immediately help the more than 31 million Americans saving for retirement in mutual fund accounts outside of employer plans and lor IRAs  The Act would provide sensible tax treatment that would defer  not avoid  taxation  In the process  it would better enable retirement savers to do what they are trying to do  plan for an uncertain road  Johnson said  a member of the Senate Banking Committee  I am pleased to work with Senator Crapo on this legislation to encourage secure retirement savings     Companion legislation for the GROWTH Act was introduced in the House  H R  2796  earlier this year  It has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee  More information is also available at  http   crapo senate gov issues taxes growth_tax cfm
