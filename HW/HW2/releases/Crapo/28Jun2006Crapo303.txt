 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo voted today  both as a member of the Senate Finance Committee and on a full Senate vote  to confirm Henry Paulson as U S  Secretary of the Treasury   Crapo cited Paulson   s vast experience and knowledge as unsurpassed credentials for the post   Paulson was confirmed by the full Senate by a voice vote         Hank Paulson has the experience and stature needed for an effective Treasury Secretary     said Crapo      During the confirmation process  he listened to my questions and responded to my satisfaction and I support his confirmation   As Treasury Secretary  Mr  Paulson will hold significant authority and influence over tax policy and other financial sectors that influence the economy    For example  there are efforts in this Congress to change the manner in which we regulate derivatives and how they affect the economy   It is important to have someone who understands how derivatives have helped create a far more flexible  efficient  and resilient financial system   Mr  Paulson   s responses to my questions during today   s hearing were thoughtful  and I anticipate it reflects how he will approach other issues as he serves our country as Treasury Secretary
