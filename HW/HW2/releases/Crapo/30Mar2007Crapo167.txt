 Washington  D C    Idaho Senator Mike Crapo had the following reaction to the United States Trade Representative Susan C  Schwab s  announcement today that the United States has requested formal consultations with Canada under the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement regarding compliance with several of its provisions          The strength of any agreement is based on parties adhering to its terms   said Crapo    Unfortunately  Canada has been ignoring parts of the agreement  forcing U S  timber producers to struggle to compete in a down turned market with high volumes of government subsidized Canadian lumber   This is affecting jobs in Idaho and across the country and it cannot continue        The Bush Administration is rightly taking this necessary step to ensure that the agreement is respected   I will continue to work with Ambassador Schwab and others to make certain that the terms of the agreement are upheld
