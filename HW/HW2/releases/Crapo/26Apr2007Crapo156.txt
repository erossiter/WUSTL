 Washington  DC   The amount of tax receipts being generated by the nation s economy hit a single day record high this week  the same week that the stock market has closed at record levels   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo noted the news is strong evidence that Congress should agree to extend the tax relief legislation that it passed in 2001 and 2003   The record of  48 7 billion in revenues was recorded by the U S  Treasury on April 24th  shattering the old mark by more than  12 billion          This is a single day record for revenue to the Treasury   Crapo said    Certainly that record is reflective of this time of the year when people pay their taxes  but they are taxes paid after the lower tax rates have been put in full effect   The last thing we need now is allow tax rates to rise again and bring an end to this period of economic growth and deficit reduction   In the same week  Wall Street set two all time records by passing the 13 000 mark twice   This underscores the importance of passing legislation that will extend the successful tax relief policies that have fueled and maintained the economic recovery and job creation         Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance and Banking committees  has authored S  502  legislation which would make permanent the 2003 tax rate reductions on capital gains and dividends  He noted that tax relief benefits from S  502 are not limited to higher income households because more than half of all U S  households with incomes under  50 000 receive dividends or report capital gains        Tax relief benefits everybody and every area of the economy  including reducing the budget deficit   Crapo added    Too often  we hear those who want to increase taxes claim that the tax relief is only directed at a wealthy few   That tired old argument has been disputed many times  and the economic growth and tax collection records reflect that   Tax relief efforts from 2001 and 2003 are directly responsible for taxpayers keeping more of their hard earned dollars as well as improving their own economic situations
