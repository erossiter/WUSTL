 Washington  DC    Waterfowl hunters and stamp collectors buying a Federal Migratory Bird Duck Stamp this year will now have the ease and convenience of purchasing that stamp electronically after a bill  sponsored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  Co Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen Caucus  was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee         The bill will create a three year pilot program in 15 states that will enable the purchase of the federal migratory bird stamp online   Hunters are required to purchase the Duck Stamp annually  which generates revenue to acquire national wildlife refuge lands  to hunt federally designated migratory birds   Several states already have electronic systems to purchase hunting licenses  but none have electronic methods to purchase the Duck Stamp          By allowing the purchase of the Duck Stamp electronically  hunters will be able to spend more time enjoying nature rather than waiting in lines to purchase their Duck Stamp     Crapo said      More people are now buying items online and this electronic method takes advantage of that convenience   The Duck Stamp provides millions of dollars to conservation efforts and preserves nature and I   m pleased that hunters and stamp collectors will now have a more convenient method of buying the stamp          The program allows hunters to purchase stamps over the phone or Internet  giving immediate access to a verification number  That number will be replaced by an actual paper stamp  This can dramatically reduce the time and effort for hunters to get in the field   Both sportsmen and stamp collectors wishing to buy the stamp at a store or post office will continue to have that option available        The bill will now go to the full Senate for final approval
