 Washington  DC     Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho   Larry Craig  R Idaho  and Conrad Burns  R Montana  are complimenting former Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch   s efforts to update the benefits that residents of his state are receiving under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act  RECA    Hatch  in a news release  outlined the benefits to residents in his state on the 10 year anniversary of their inclusion in the RECA program      The RECA program compensates victims who received fallout from nuclear testing in Nevada during the 1950s and 1960s  once the states and areas are declared eligible for inclusion in the program    Crapo  Craig and Burns have introduced S  2132  which would make residents of Idaho and Montana eligible for inclusion under RECA        Although studies show the top five counties in the nation that were exposed to radiation lie in Idaho and Montana  those states have not been included in RECA     Crapo said      We are hopeful for a hearing on our legislation to bring compensation to the people of Idaho and Montana in the same way Senator Hatch was able to make the case for his constituents in Utah            Although more than 15 000 recipients of more than  1 billion received their fair compensation from the federal government thanks to Senator Hatch  geographic borders have caused Idaho and Montana residents to be left behind     said Craig      This is an obvious oversight that we are working to correct  and that we hope we will be able to enlist Senator Hatch to support           Senator Hatch was instrumental in the creation of RECA     said Burns     I   m happy to be working with him along with Senators Crapo and Craig to update this legislation to account for new scientific evidence that the radioactive byproducts of above ground nuclear testing spread a lot further than the local areas in Utah  Arizona and Nevada           We know you understand that  like the citizens of Utah  Nevada and Arizona  the people of Montana and Idaho aren   t seeking an entitlement program     the Senators said      This issue is about justice and  as you rightfully maintained while the people of Utah waited for ten years for the Senate to take up their cause and enact RECA  justice delayed is justice denied                                                              Presently  residents of Utah  Arizona  and Nevada are eligible for  50 000 payments under RECA     We congratulate you on this important milestone and respectfully request your assistance in continuing to seek protection for Americans who have been exposed to radiation  by expanding RECA coverage to constituents in our respective states     the Senators concluded
