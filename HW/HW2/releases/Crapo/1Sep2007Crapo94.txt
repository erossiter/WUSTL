 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo released the following statement regarding the resignation of Idaho senior Senator Larry Craig   For more than two decades  Larry Craig has consistently put Idaho first in his public service career  Today  he did so again in announcing his decision to resign his position as U S  Senator from Idaho   As I have said over the last week  I will accept any decision that my friend Senator Craig makes regarding the unfortunate circumstances he presently faces  As such  I am comfortable that he has determined that this is the best course of action he can take for his wife and family  his state and his nation  He has demonstrated his courage and strength in making this tough decision   During his long and distinguished tenure in Congress  he has solidly championed common sense solutions and brought a strong tenacity to important issues to our state and our nation  His certainty and consistency have provided a base for many public policy debates on a wide range of issues  including agriculture  fiscal responsibility  immigration  community and economic development  transportation and natural resources  He was advocating for a Balanced Budget Amendment long before most Members of Congress would even recognize the out of control spending by the federal government  He has been a strong voice for improving our nations energy security  most particularly nuclear energy  The efforts he has undertaken over the years regarding agriculture and natural resources have helped build strong rural economies in Idaho and across the country  His conservative voice has spoken out in favor of legislation and efforts to limit the federal government and to ensure that Idahoans and every American have liberty  opportunity and security  In addition  he has provided consistent advocacy for Idahoans who have come to him for help with problems they are experiencing with federal agencies  Early in his career  he laid out a mission and philosophy that put Idahoans first  and he has lived up to that creed throughout his public service    Today is a sad day for me as I recognize that Senator Craig has made clear his intentions to leave the U S  Senate  He has been my colleague for many years  and I have enjoyed working with Larry  but  more importantly  he has been my friend  It is my hope that as history judges Senator Craig  that his successes  accomplishments and strong leadership for Idaho in Congress are taken in totality  and that those he served so admirably in Congress for five terms in the U S  House of Representatives and three terms in the U S  Senate will recall the full measure of the man
