 Washington  DC    A plan to save more than  10 billion over five years while starting to address federal health program improvements was approved today by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and his colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee   The deal addresses inefficiencies within the Medicare and Medicaid programs and strives to maintain access to health care for beneficiaries       The Committee approved the savings in its budget reconciliation measure  mandated as part of the 2006 Senate Budget resolution   In addition to program savings  the bill includes provisions to benefit rural and community hospitals  and financial protection for small hospitals that provide a large amount of care to Medicare patients   In addition  the package includes  1 8 billion in Medicaid benefits for Hurricane Katrina victims   The reconciliation package also provides funds to programs like the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  to expand enrollment  increases resources to pursue Medicaid abuse and fraud  and provides new options through private coverage of long term care under Medicaid          Crapo expressed strong concern  however  that the bill does not include reforms designed to give states more flexibility in administering Medicaid  and that some programs affected by the reconciliation were approved in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and have not yet had a chance to succeed   Crapo especially believes the Committee did not go far enough with the Medicaid reforms endorsed by the National Governors Association task force on Medicaid  led by Governor Kempthorne           This reconciliation package is a compromise  so it isn   t a perfect bill to everyone     said Crapo      While this budget seeks to exercise fiscal responsibility and address healthcare concerns  I am concerned that the bill doesn t go far enough in giving states more flexibility and less regulation in running their Medicaid programs   I also share the President   s concern with provisions in this package that eliminate funds for Medicare programs that haven   t even begun operating   I   m supporting this package because of the improvements that are included  and in an effort to move the budget process forward   I hope this Committee process is a first step and these concerns can be rectified when the Senate and House conferees meet over this package           The Finance Committee reconciliation report will now go to the Senate Budget Committee to be included in a larger budget reconciliation package   If approved by the Budget Committee  that package will then be sent to the Senate floor for full consideration   Additionally  the Senate Finance Committee will meet in the coming days regarding tax portions of the federal budget
