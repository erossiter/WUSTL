 English historian Arnold Toynbee wryly observed     America is like a large  friendly dog in a very small room   Every time it wags its tail  it knocks over a chair      Notwithstanding Toynbee   s conceit  he alludes to an indisputable truism   when America takes military or economic action  at home or abroad  the rest of the world is affected  Our grand history has prepared us for this role and means that our nation carries a responsibility regarding to world affairs and stability       United States  national security decisions invariably sends ripples through international markets and  at times  decisions made in a corporate boardroom affect our national security   Caution  deliberation and consideration of all repercussions must guide critical decisions   Borders and ports must be secured while preserving an efficient flow of goods worldwide  to markets that benefit Idaho and American producers and manufacturers       The proposed purchase of the operation of container terminals at six major U S  ports by a company headquartered in the United Arab Emirates  UAE    highlights the tension between healthy foreign relations and secure borders   Since 1988  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   has evaluated certain foreign purchases of U S  firms for national security implications   Comprised of representatives from 12 different federal departments and agencies  it conducts a 30 day review on the transaction in question with an additional 45 day review option   In these times of terrorism and the reality of globalization  our national security demands exhaustive examinations of any potential threats  no matter what the source   This is one of those times  Our seaports represent significant danger points and the additional 45 day review that has now been ordered is warranted   More importantly  Congress is conducting extensive fact finding on this issue during hearings this month           Government systems should be reviewed periodically for efficacy   Last year  the Senate Banking Committee on which I serve held a two part hearing on CFIUS   At the same time  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  issued a report on CFIUS  highlighting serious concerns     CFIUS defines national security differently than Homeland Security or Defense     Reports to Congress about cases under review are not standard practice     Because of the possible negative effect on foreign investment  CFIUS has been hesitant to  initiate investigations       The Banking Committee held a hearing on March 2 to address these issues and legislation is planned for later this year to reform CFIUS   This and other hearings on the subject are for the explicit purpose of gathering all the facts about both this proposed sale and of CFIUS   That is the responsibility of Congress to American citizens  and one it will uphold       Idaho are keenly aware of the importance of positive relations with foreign countries   provided those relationships do not violate our security   We must exercise caution and deliberative judgment when evaluating our international business relationships  evaluating the facts within the framework of national security   Over the coming weeks  Congress will closely examine the disclosures of all involved in this issue   Only that information will yield what is needed to make a decision that keeps the safety of Americans paramount   Another famous Brit  Sir Winston Churchill  may have said it best      I have great confidence in the judgment and the common sense of the American people and their leaders   They invariably do the right thing after they have examined every other alternative
