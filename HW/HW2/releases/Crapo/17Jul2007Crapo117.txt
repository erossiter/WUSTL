 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo says efforts by Senate leaders to promote around the clock debate on removing troops from Iraq provides a good opportunity for discussion  but the timetable for decision making should remain the samethat Congress must review options in Iraq when U S  military leaders issue a report this September on the recent surge in Iraq        The debate on our Iraq policy and how best to ensure the U S  is successful in fighting the Global War on Terror is one that Congress should continue to have  said Crapo  In light of the recent terrorist events in the United Kingdom and the findings of today s National Intelligence Estimate  it is even more critical that we continue to engage al Qaeda and other terrorist forces in Iraq  Afghanistan and around the world  and do everything we can to keep them away from U S  shores  While there is much disagreement about the proper way to make that effort  we all agree that a stable Iraq is vital to our national security        Our brave men and women in uniform are serving our nation  and they deserve our fullest support  Crapo continued  The President s plan has shown mixed results since the full complement of forces arrived in Iraq in June  but it is very important to allow the surge time to demonstrate results  Congress agreed to wait until September to evaluate the effectiveness of the recent troop surge  Although we do not know whether the Iraqis can fulfill their commitments  it is critical to our national security that we do not undermine our forces by hamstringing them or trying to micromanage the conflict  We must trust our commanders on the ground in Iraq to do their job  and trust their evaluation and assessment of progress and setbacks        Crapo s comments about Iraq and the Senate s activities can be accessed on his website at http   crapo senate gov and his teleconference with reporters today is available at http   crapo senate gov media audio 2007 craponewsconf07_17_07 mp3
