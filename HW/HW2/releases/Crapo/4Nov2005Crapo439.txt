 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is co sponsoring a Senate bill seeking to beef up the prosecution of those who cross the northern U S  border illegally   Crapo and Senator Maria Cantwell  D Washington  co sponsoring the Northern Border Prosecution Initiative Reimbursement Act  S  1958  which was introduced this week        This measure seeks to stop illegal immigrants along the northern border of the U S  similar to a measure last session covering illegal activity in the southern United States     Crapo said      I have sponsored both measures in an effort to put teeth and funding behind our effort to prosecute those who cross the border illegally    Border security is a serious issue and one that the federal government must put its resources behind   This bill does just that        The Act co sponsored by Crapo would create a reimbursement program modeled after the Southwest Border Prosecution Initiative to provide financial assistance to state and local jurisdictions   Through the second quarter of FY2005  more than  112 million has been provided under the southern initiative to assist southern border states in offsetting the costs of prosecuting immigration cases  The new bill would authorize  28 million in fiscal year 2006 exclusively for the Northern Border  as well as such funds as necessary in future years   The actual budget outlay would depend largely on whether states and localities apply for the reimbursement   The goal of the Act is to copy the southern border program  which requires localities to apply for reimbursement on a case by case basis        This measure has the strong support of local law enforcement officials in North Idaho     Crapo said  noting many told him they were appreciative of his co sponsorship of it during the 108th Congress      The bi partisan nature of support for the Northern Border bill means it stands a good chance of quick passage similar to the southern border bill
