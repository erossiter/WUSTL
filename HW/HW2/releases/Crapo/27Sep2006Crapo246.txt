 Washington  DC     Agreement between the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee on a financial services industry package culminated today with expected House passage of legislation that will provide regulatory improvements in that industry   The measure  authored by Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  brings regulations up to date and in line with current technology and practices   The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006  S  2856  cleared the Senate unanimously in May and was sent to the House for consideration    The package will now be sent back to the Senate for approval    In applauding the House action  Crapo  a member of the Senate Banking Committee who has been the Senate leader in prompting reforms in the financial services industry that will ultimately improve customer services  said     This reform legislation has been a long time in coming and I am pleased that Chairman Oxley and others have worked with me to reach agreement on many issues that remained in contention   In particular  with regard to the nearly seven year logjam over the SEC   s proposed Regulation B  or Reg B   Congress has decided to intervene   Joint rulemaking between the SEC and Federal Reserve Board  as required by this legislation  will give effect to the congressional intent underlying the Gramm Leach Bliley Act   Specifically  the legislation is intended to ensure that regulators do not create a new and burdensome regulatory maze of requirements that would disrupt or interfere with the business practices of banks and thrifts that offer traditional bank products and services to their customers   The creation of requirements like those proposed in Reg B would ultimately force banks and thrifts to stop offering their customers the very same products and services that we were seeking to protect in Gramm Leach Bliley   It has always been my intention to push for regulatory reform that would streamline and improve the transparency and reporting issues involved in the financial services industries       Following is a list of highlighted modifications from the Senate passed version of S  2856   The House and Senate have reached agreement on the items included    Section 101   This section has been modified to require the SEC and the Federal Reserve Board to jointly adopt rules implementing the exceptions to the definition of

has been added to enhance the authority for banks to make community development investments   This provision increases from 10 to 15 percent the amount of unimpaired capital and surplus that a

investments are those designed primarily to benefit the welfare of low  and moderate income communities or families   In addition  the provision requires that each investment under this paragraph by a national bank must meet the test   The provision makes conforming amendments to the Federal Reserve Act as it applies to the same type of investments by state member banks    Section 505   This section has been added to make certain amendments relating to non federally insured credit unions   Specifically  this section amends Section 43 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act  FDIA   which
