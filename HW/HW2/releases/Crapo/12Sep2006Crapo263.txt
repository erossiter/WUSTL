 Washington  DC     The longtime war on illegal methamphetamine is taking a new turn  according to Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  one that has moved it out of American backrooms and across our borders   Testimony today before the Senate Finance Committee  on which Crapo sits  clearly demonstrates that illegal smuggling of manufactured methamphetamine from Mexico and other countries vastly outpaces manufacturing within our borders and requires renewed attention           Meth is the number one illegal drug of choice in Idaho     Crapo said      The common perception has been that this is a drug that is made in backrooms and garages   We have cracked down on the sale of over the counter cold medications that are used to manufacture meth and stepped up efforts to stop the manufacturing of it on rental properties in Idaho   Now we are finding more of this drug is coming across the U S  border than we ever imagined          The Finance Committee heard testimony today from top officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  in Washington  DC  as well as the Office of Drug Interdiction with the U S  Customs and Border Protection Office    Crapo noted the DEA has promoted the use of mobile enforcement teams  which have resulted in nearly 20 000 arrests nationwide in the past decade   According to the DEA  Mexican based drug organizations control most of the trafficking in Idaho         The influx of Crystal Methamphetamine being produced in Mexico and eventually smuggled into Idaho for distribution is of a great concern to our multi agency drug enforcement task force here in Boise   said DEA Resident Agent in Charge Keith Weis    Right now  we are placing a great emphasis on all of the state s agencies  whether federal  state or local  to continue coordinating  investigative efforts in this particular area  to maximize law enforcement s response to these multi jurisdictional criminal organizations responsible for importing and distributing Crystal Methamphetamine                    The problem of imported meth can be especially difficult for rural areas like Idaho where we don   t have the manpower or resources to provide the 24 7 effort to stop the sale of these drugs     Crapo said      This must be a problem we address on our borders   It makes for another good reason we need to improve security efforts along our northern and southern borders
