 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin are asking President George W  Bush to increase funding for a program that places domestically grown fruits and vegetables in schools as healthy snacks   This program benefits both students and produce farmers  Crapo enlisted the support of Senator Larry Craig and a bipartisan list of Senators in the letter to the President requesting that the Administration include funding in the fiscal year 2006 budget to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program          Under current funding levels  the Fruit and Vegetable Program can only serve a small fraction of our nation   s children in a limited number of schools in eight states     the letter says      While we recognize that the current fiscal situation would make it difficult to expand the program to all children and schools  we do believe that a substantial investment in the program for fiscal year 2006 is vital to the health of our nation   s children             This program has helped address concerns about childhood obesity and nutrition by encouraging our students to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables     said Crapo      An additional benefit is the increased market for our fruit and vegetable growers             The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program is a very effective way to raise awareness and consumption of two vital food groups that are sometimes ignored  especially by children     Craig said      The program results in more children consuming more fruits and vegetables  helping their health and Idaho s farmers        The program was first authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill as a pilot program in 25 schools in four states and seven tribal schools   The program has been considered largely successful in decreasing the risk of obesity  increasing attention in class  reducing consumption of less healthy food  increasing student awareness of a variety of fruits and vegetables and helping feed hungry children   Crapo worked with Senator Harkin to introduce legislation in the 108th Congress to extend and expand the program   The Child Nutrition Reauthorization Bill  signed into law last year  incorporated similar legislation that extended the program to four additional states and additional tribal schools
