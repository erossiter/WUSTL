 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln today introduced legislation to assist pulmonary and cardiac Medicare patients by increasing access to critical rehabilitation programs   The Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation Act  S  329  will include pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation as specific services covered by Medicare   The bill would establish a uniform Medicare policy for coverage of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation  which would effectively end a decade long debate among providers  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  and the various fiscal intermediaries responsible for the reimbursement of these services      Currently  neither pulmonary nor cardiac rehabilitation services are specifically included in the Medicare statute   While these programs are often covered by Medicare under the    incident to physician services    clause  without a national policy  coverage is inconsistent  resulting in limited access to necessary care and lack of reimbursement in many cases           Thousands of Idahoans with heart and lung disease need pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation programs     said Crapo      This legislation will pave the way for Medicare   s consistent coverage of these important services and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to the health care they need          This legislation will go a long way in helping Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receive the care they need to live a longer and better quality of life   Lincoln said   We know that many Medicare beneficiaries are in need of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation services  and this legislation would not only improve access to care for these beneficiaries nationwide but also would save money in Medicare from better disease management          Pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation programs are recognized throughout the medical community as the standard of care for chronic lung disease and have proven to be effective in lowering inpatient stays and removing the need for certain surgeries     added Crapo      A national  comprehensive Medicare policy is clearly necessary   Our seniors and their providers deserve the enactment of this legislation            Crapo chairs and Lincoln co chairs the Congressional Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  COPD  Caucus   Crapo officially launched the COPD Caucus in March of 2004        Key groups supporting the Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation Act include the American Association for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation  the American Association for Respiratory Care  the American College of Chest Physicians  the American Hospital Association  the American Lung Association  the American Thoracic Society  the National Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care and the National Home Oxygen Patients Association
