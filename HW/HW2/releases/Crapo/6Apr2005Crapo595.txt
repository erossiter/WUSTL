 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  R Idaho   a member of the Senate Banking Committee  expressed disappointment today after a divided Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  voted 3 2 to approve the Regulation NMS  National Market Structure  rule   The new set of regulations for stock market trading in the U S  will significantly change the way trading occurs in the country and removes a level of investor involvement and choice   The proposed trade through rule will dictate at what price orders are executed  with regard only to best quote and without regard to other crucial factors such as depth of trading interest  market efficiency  market impact  and firmness of quotes       Crapo said he is considering all options  including legislation  to stop the divisive mandates to allow more collaboration in creating revisions to the national market structure         I am disappointed and troubled that the Commission was unable to proceed with one voice on this important rule     Crapo said      The lack of consensus within the commission  academics  and capital markets experts questions the need of going forward and raises the possibility that Congress should intervene   The vote today approved a rule that has no consensus inside or outside the SEC   While there does appear to be agreement that several courses of action need further study  the vote was still pushed forward and the rule had been adopted by a deeply divided SEC   There appears to be growing support for congressional action at this point and I am evaluating all options including legislation to address this matter          Crapo  along with other Senators  sent a letter  pdf 2 pages  51 kb  to the SEC regarding the Reg NMS rule   The letter addressed several other possible courses of action that deserved consideration and further study   A copy of that letter accompanies this news release
