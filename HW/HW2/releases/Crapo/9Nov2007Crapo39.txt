 Washington  DC  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo wants to ensure that sufficient funds are made available for wildland fire management in Idaho  including recovery and rehabilitation efforts underway from this years fires  In letters sent to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and Acting Agriculture Secretary Chuck Connor  Crapo noted that the funds are crucial for fighting and recovery from wildland fires in the state  Wildland Fire Management funds in the Fiscal Year 2008 Continuing Resolution are designated for the Bureau of Land Management  BLM  in the Department of the Interior  and the U S  Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture  The Continuing Resolution was passed last night as part of the Defense Appropriations bill     It is my hope that some of this newly appropriated assistance will be used for firefighting efforts in Idaho  including emergency wildfire suppression and the replenishment of depleted resources that were expended for fighting fires in 2007  Crapo said in the letters     Idaho has had a particularly brutal fire season this year  There were 904 fires in Idaho which burned approximately 1 72 million acres of land  Fighting large fires cost the U S  Forest Service and the BLM nearly  150 million in Idaho  This figure does not include expenditures to fight fires subdued by an initial attack or for fires contained within a small area     Both departments will receive an increase in the funds available for firefighting efforts  The Continuing Resolution contains funding at  329 million above the 2007 level for the Department of Agriculture for emergency wildfire suppression  hazardous fuel reduction  the rehabilitation and restoration of federal lands and facilities and replenishing funds that have been exhausted fighting fires in 2007  The Department of the Interior has been funded  171 million above the 2007 level for the same purposes     With devastating wildland fires  the primary emergency response garners the most attention  but the need for adequate funding is ongoing to mitigate the damage and prevent similar tragedies in the future  Crapo said  I want to ensure the needs of Idahoans and affected lands are not overlooked after the fires themselves have died down  I look forward to working with Secretaries Kempthorne and Conner to address the needs of Idaho communities     Copies of the letters accompany this news release
