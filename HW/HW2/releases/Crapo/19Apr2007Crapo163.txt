 Washington  DC   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is pleased with an announcement today by the Export Import  Ex Im  Bank  which underscores the need to approach investment decisions that could affect sensitive U S  commercial industry   Specifically  the announcement today reaffirms the concern that Crapo has consistently held  particularly that the Ex Im Bank support transactions that not only help U S  exporters  but also do not negatively impact domestic companies        The Export Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2006  P L 109 438  required the Ex Im president  Jim Lambright  to submit to the Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees a list of sensitive commercial sectors and products for which financing is deemed unlikely because financing could adversely impact the U S  economically   Steel and DRAM are on that list   The announcement means that Micron  an Idaho based DRAM producer  is part of the list and classified as a sensitive commercial product  Therefore  any future considerations regarding loans involving DRAM must be carefully reviewed for adverse effects to the U S  economy      Crapo said   I applaud Lambright s decision  as it confirms my position that the U S  government should be very cautious before providing any financial support for foreign DRAM manufacturers   The DRAM industry is important to U S  economy for investment and manufacturing jobs   The Ex Im Bank should not do anything that could potentially add over supply to this key U S  industry          Steve Appleton  Chairman  CEO and President of Micron Technology  Inc   said   We are pleased that today s announcement takes into account the concerns that Senator Crapo has consistently brought to attention  This is a great outcome for Micron and Idaho  and we applaud Senator Crapo for his dedication and leadership on this important matter  The announcement significantly improves the economic impact analysis process required to determine whether a loan from the U S  Export Import Bank will harm a U S  industry
