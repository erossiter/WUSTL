 Washington  DC     Idaho Senator Mike Crapo will co sponsor legislation offered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  to abolish the individual Alternative Minimum Tax  ATM  this year  The tax was started as a way to catch upper income Americans who paid zero in taxes  but unintended consequences and inflation have slipped consequences of the tax into middle class taxpayers        If we don   t take action now to repeal the tax  it will affect more and more middle class taxpayers  and the longer we wait  the larger the effect will be on the federal budget will be     Crapo said      This is a stealth tax that affects at least 6 000 Idahoans  like farmers  landowners  and others   By next year it may affect more than 25 million Americans  and if left untouched  it could radically affect twice that many by 2015        Congress implemented the Alternative Minimum Tax in 1969 after finding many cases where wealthy individuals paid nothing in taxes   Implementing ways to counter the situation through closing tax loopholes resulted in unintended consequences for middle income taxpayers  Crapo said  As examples  some families with several children or those who reside in states with higher property taxes or incomes were adversely affected by the AMT structure        The best solution is to simply repeal the tax in its entirety and deal with the consequences on the federal budget     Crapo said   He ruled out any effort to amend popular tax deductions  such as mortgage interest or health care payments  suggesting instead that slight  overall tax code modifications and budget belt tightening could alleviate any budget shortfall      What will be worse is if Congress does nothing and allows this unfair tax issue to affect more and more Americans     he concluded
