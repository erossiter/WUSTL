 Washington  D C   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Rural Revitalization  Conservation  Forestry and Credit  today issued the following statement regarding todays cloture vote on the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007  Crapo voted against cloture and continues to press for an open amendment process on the bill  The motion to invoke cloture  a procedure to limit debate and the amendment process  on the substitute amendment to H R  2419  the Farm Bill  failed to get the 60 votes necessary to proceed by a vote of 55 to 42     Our farm families and all Americans deserve strong federal farm policy  said Crapo  Unfortunately  the Senate Majority Leader has chosen to waste the past two weeks  which could have been spent properly debating and voting on amendments to further shape the bill  by providing a closed process  It is especially disappointing that the first Senate vote on the Farm Bill is one to limit consideration of the measure even more than it already has been limited  By now  the Senate should have had numerous votes on amendments if a fair and open process had been allowed     I cannot support these tactics  Crapo added  The Farm Bill is far too important  That is why I voted against cloture  I am hopeful that Senate Leadership will work in the coming weeks to reengage a Farm Bill debate process that allows this essential legislation to move forward in a fair and open process  Farmers and ranchers across this nation deserve no less     To link directly to Crapos floor speech on the Farm Bill  please go to http   crapo senate gov media audio_2007 cfm
