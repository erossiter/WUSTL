 Washington  DC   With a nod to today s deadline for filing federal income taxes  Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has partnered with Senator Jon Kyl  R Arizona  to introduce legislation to make sure tax relief does not disappear in the next few years   Left unchecked  present budget plans and tax changes could cost taxpayers more than  700 billion dollars by 2011  when most of the important and successful tax relief passed in the last few years is set to expire       The Invest in America Act makes permanent the  1 000 per child tax credit  marriage penalty relief  individual income tax and business tax relief that Congress approved in 2001 and 2003   Crapo says the action is needed to extend or make permanent the tax relief set to sunset in the next few years        We must address the tax rates as well as the ultimate issue of tax reform   Crapo said    This Act would make permanent the increase in tax credits for the child tax credit  marriage penalty relief  the adoption tax credit and the tuition tax credit   In addition  it would permanently repeal the death tax and the alternative minimum tax which affect thousands of Idahoans        Crapo noted that tax relief has spurred economic growth averaging 3  annually   With more than half of all Americans owning stock  many families and retirees will benefit as the changes in capital gains and dividends taxes drop to zero in 2008 for those in the lowest income brackets        The Invest in America Act secures a system where our economy creates jobs and private investment keeps taxes low for individuals   Crapo added    We can make these tax cuts permanent by passing this bill as soon as possible and then getting to work on simplifying the tax code        Crapo  a member of the Senate Finance Committee  has long led efforts to extend pro growth tax policies for all Americans   In the 110th Congress  Crapo has also introduced S  502 to make permanent tax relief on capital gains and dividends   The bill currently has thirty co sponsors
