SEN. CANTWELL VOTES AGAINST ALITO
  Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) voted against the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., making her the only senator in the Pacific Northwest to oppose the nominations of both Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Alito. 
   Based on Alito's record as a jurist and following the answers he gave in response to her questions during their face-to-face meeting on Monday afternoon about the right to privacy, the balance of power between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the rights of the individual versus the government, Cantwell released the following statement on her decision to vote against Alito's nomination: 
   "I am very concerned with Judge Alito's record regarding an individual's constitutional right to privacy. While I do not expect any judicial nominee to prejudge future cases, I do expect all nominees to make their positions clear on protecting the most basic rights of individuals and the fundamental structure and foundations of our democracy. In the end, I cannot be sure that Judge Alito would do either. 
   "Judge Alito has a record of concern when it comes to placing and consolidating the rights of the government over the rights of the individual and he has not provided the answers to adequately reassure the people of our nation. I must conclude that he would neither show due respect for the authority of Congress nor apply a necessary check to the reach of the executive. With great respect for the institution, I cannot vote to confirm Judge Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States."
