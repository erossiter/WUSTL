SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER CHAIR OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN WASHINGTON STATE MARCHIORO
  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement today on the passing of Karen Marchioro, former chair of the Democratic Party in Washington state.  
  "Karen Marchioro was the Democratic Party in Washington state. She embodied everything that our party cared about. She became a forceful leader who knew it all started with the precinct committee officers and built that into a major grassroots effort in Washington state. She helped countless Democrats get elected in both eastern and western Washington. 
  "Her bluntness might have made her memorable to people who met her but her advocacy for the Democratic Party will be unmatched for decades to come. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you for sharing Karen with all of us."
