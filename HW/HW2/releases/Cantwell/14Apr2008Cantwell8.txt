AS TAX DAY APPROACHES, SEN. CANTWELL REMINDS WASHINGTONIANS TO LOOKOUT FOR THEIR STIMULUS CHECK
  As Tax Day, April 15, approaches U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) today reminded Washingtonians to be on the lookout for stimulus checks they may be receiving. In order to receive the stimulus checks, residents of Washington state must fill out a tax return for the 2007 filing year. Cantwell joined her Democratic colleagues to bring much needed relief to American families, including 20 million more seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans in the economic stimulus package. 
  "With tax day quickly approaching, Washingtonians should remember that in order to take full advantage of their stimulus checks they must file a tax return by April 15,"said Cantwell. "During this time of economic uncertainty, these stimulus checks will help put extra money in the pockets of hard working American families." 
  Starting in May, the U.S. Treasury will begin sending economic stimulus payments to taxpayers. Taxpayers must have a valid Social Security number, $3,000 of income, and file a 2007 federal tax return. Eligible taxpayers will receive up to $600 ($1,200 for married couples), and parents will receive an additional $300 for each eligible child younger than 17.
