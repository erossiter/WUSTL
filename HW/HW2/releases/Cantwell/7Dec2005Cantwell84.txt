SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PEARL HARBOR DAY
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement on Pearl Harbor Day: 
   "Today, I honor and remember the 2, 390 brave Americans who died during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 64 years ago, which sunk the U.S.S. Arizona, brought our nation into WWII, and made real the unyielding threat of tyranny. 
   "The Arizona still rests below the waters of Pearl Harbor today, a silent yet irrefutable reminder of war's gravity. I recognize those who have given of themselves and answered the call of duty. Yesterday and today, in Europe and Asia, in Afghanistan and Iraq, so many Americans in uniform have faced the battlefield with courage and strength. 
   "I take these sacrifices very seriously. And as a national community, we must always take military action seriously. We must never take for granted the sacrifices of those who came before of us; we must always defend the freedom so many have fought and died to protect."
