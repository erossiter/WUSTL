SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES $130,000 GRANT FOR FORT NISQUALLY
  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) today announced that The Fort Nisqually Museum has been awarded a grant totaling $130,000. The grant is from the Institute of Museum and Libraries Services as part of the Save America's Treasures Grants. 
   "Save America's Treasures helps preserve our nations precious past and informs generations to come about our country's rich history," said Cantwell. "I applaud Fort Nisqually Museum on receiving this grant and for continuing to tell the story of Native Americans in the Northwest, and their important contributions to our state's history." 
  The Fort Nisqually Museum will use its grant to preserve, protect and make accessible the Forts' artifact collection, archives and research library. The project will provide an artifact storage facility with the temperature, humidity, and light controls necessary for long term survival of the collection. As the center of the fur trade, agriculture, and commerce on Puget Sound, the Fort's collection tells the story of local Native Americans, HBC employees representing numerous ethnic groups, and American settlers as they worked to establish what was to become Washington Territory.
  Save America's Treasures works to preserve significant cultural treasures, which illustrate the past and show great events in America's history. Not only are physical structures preserved, but important documents, records, artifacts, and artistic works are kept for people to enjoy. Save America's Treasures involves other federal agency partners, including the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has been the program's principal partner since the program began.
