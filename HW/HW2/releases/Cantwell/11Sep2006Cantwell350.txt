SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  Monday, Sen. Maria Cantwell issued the following statement on the five-year anniversary of 9/11:  
   "Five years after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, we still feel the pain and loss of that terrible day. We will always honor the memory and spirit of those who lost their lives and those who gave their lives for others. 
   "Our nation's most enduring values were attacked on that day. We have a responsibility to those who died, to their families, and to the first responders who answered the call of duty without hesitation to never forget and to never let this tragedy be repeated. Together we have a responsibility to all Americans to keep our nation secure and our citizens safe. 
   "Yet, five years after our cities were attacked, America is still not as secure as it should be. We must take the hard lessons from that devastating attack and confront the new challenges of a changing world. We must continue fighting for the tough, smart policies that will make our communities safer. 
   "We have a lot of work ahead of us. Our vast transportation systems remain vulnerable. Our borders are porous. 
   "To protect America, we must secure our ports, improve intelligence oversight, share information effectively, and allocate resources based on risk. We must fully implement the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, improve nuclear material tracking, and strengthen our diplomacy around the world. We must deliver better support to our first responders to help them do their jobs. 
   "In the aftermath of September 11th, our nation came together. Five years later, we must remember those we have lost, their courage and brave spirits, and once again, move forward together to better protect our communities and defend the freedom we cherish."
