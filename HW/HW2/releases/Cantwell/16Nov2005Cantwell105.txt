SEN. CANTWELL'S ICE AGE FLOODS LEGISLATION PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) applauded the Senate's unanimous approval Wednesday night of her bill to create an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail through portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.  
   "Celebrating the unique geological history of the Pacific Northwest by creating a National Trail will boost tourism, help invigorate rural Central and Eastern Washington communities, and provide a valuable educational tool," said Cantwell. "This is something the whole region can take pride in." 
   The proposed trail--which will tell the story of how a series of monumental floods created the unique geology of Central and Eastern Washington--would be managed by the National Park Service in partnership with the Ice Age Floods Institute, participating States, Tribes, and other local entities. Interpretive centers, signs and markers, exhibits, waysides, and roadside pullouts would be used to tell the story of the floods. Representative 
   "Senator Cantwell's legislation will help spark new opportunities for economic development and education throughout the Inland Empire," said Tom Davis, President, Cheney-Palouse Chapter, Ice Age Floods Institute. "The Ice Age Floods were a one of a kind event and the Northwest is poised to take advantage of this unique opportunity." 
   Cantwell's bipartisan bill is co-sponsored by four of her Energy and Natural Resources Committee colleagues, Senators Larry Craig (R-ID), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Conrad Burns (R-MT), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), as well as Washington State Senator Patty Murray. Representative Hastings' bill has 10 co-sponsors, including 4 Republicans.
