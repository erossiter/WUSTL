SEN. CANTWELL CELEBRATES FIRST EVER CAPITOL CHRISTMAS TREE FROM WASHINGTON STATE
Wednesday evening, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) will attend the lighting of this year's Capitol Christmas Tree, cut from Washington's Olympic National Forest and now on display on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol building. The tradition of the Capitol Christmas Tree dates back to 1964, but this year marks the first time the tree has come from Washington state.  
 "During a season highlighted by giving and sharing with friends and family, it's a special honor for the Evergreen State to present this beautiful tree to our nation's capital," said Cantwell. "The Pacific Northwest's timber industry has long been a shining light; now one of our trees will provide holiday light for the Capitol this season. I'm so proud of the Washington state children who provided the thousands of ornaments for this tree." 
 The 65-foot tall Pacific Silver Fir, decorated with 10,000 lights and 3,000 ornaments handmade by Washington schoolchildren, will be lit each evening from Wednesday through New Year's Day. The ornaments decorating the tree reflect this year's theme, "A Gift from the Evergreen State," and depict the state's diverse landscapes and ecosystems, cultural heritage, and history. Before arriving in our nation's capital on November 27, the tree visited 21 communities across Washington state.
