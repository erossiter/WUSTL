SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BOEING TANKER PROTEST
  Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on Boeing's decision to formally protest the Air Force's tanker decision: 
   "Many questions still remain as to why the Air Force came to the decision it did, and the American public has a right to know their rationale.
   "After looking at all the information provided to them, Boeing concluded that the Air Force's decision was flawed and warranted appeal.
   "There could be serious negative implications for our country's national security as it relates to the high cost of fuel, and implications for our country's industrial base and workforce. I hope that as the GAO reviews the appeal, they will also look into these issues as well."
