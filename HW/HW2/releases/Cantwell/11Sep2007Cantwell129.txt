  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement today on the anniversary of September 11: 
   "Today, we remember those who were tragically killed six years ago on September 11. We stand together as a nation to honor the courage and strength of all those men and women who gave their lives so that others might live and all those who died so needlessly on that day. The challenge remains to improve our homeland security to protect America and refocus our efforts to fight terror. My thoughts and prayers remain with the families who lost loved ones on that fateful day. We will never forget the courage, bravery, and selflessness of those men and women six years ago."
