SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Today Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) responded to the release of the 9/11 Commission's report.  
   "The commission's report gives us a good look back, and a number of valuable lessons," Cantwell said. "But will this report help reduce the threat level? Is it going to make America safer? Only if we act on its recommendations, and act now. This report makes clear that we cannot afford to waste time pointing fingers for the past, but must focus on the future. 
   "We must improve international cooperation, create a flat decentralized, network to improve intelligence gathering and strengthen our analytical capabilities, and more fully use technology to protect out borders and track down terrorists. At the same time, we must take care to protect the fundamental civil liberties enjoyed by all Americans, including the right to privacy. 
   "I am grateful to all of the commission members for their months of service - and in particular, Slade Gorton - for their selfless service to the nation."
