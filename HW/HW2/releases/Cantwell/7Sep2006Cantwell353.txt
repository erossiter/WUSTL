SEN. CANTWELL BACKS COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-GANG PACKAGE
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced her full support of comprehensive legislation to strengthen the prosecution of gangs and reduce gang membership. The Cantwell-cosponsored Gang Abatement and Prevention Act authorizes more than $850 million over the next five years to help federal, state, and local law enforcement combat violent gangs. Specifically, the measure would fund intervention and prevention initiatives targeting at-risk youth, improve the coordination of anti-gang efforts, establish new criminal gang offenses, enhance existing punishments, and identify and assist areas especially prone to gang violence. 
   "It's time to get tough on gangs and keep our communities safe," said Cantwell. "We have an obligation to protect our kids, safeguard our neighborhoods, and give our law enforcement the best possible resources, training, and tools. Too many of our communities are seeing a marked increase in gang violence. We cannot turn our backs to this dangerous surge in crime. The legislation I'm calling on Congress to pass will deliver much-needed tools to communities, law enforcement, and prosecutors across our country, keeping violent criminals behind bars and helping at-risk youth realize their full potential."  
   "Once again, Senator Cantwell is aware of the needs of our communities," said Tacoma City Councilwoman Connie Ladenburg. "She understands that the Gang problem is multi-faceted and is working toward securing funding for us to address this from multiple approaches." 
   "Cosponsoring this important legislation underscores the senator's willingness to partner with our citizens and community," said Tacoma City Councilman Rick Talbert. "She came to Tacoma, asked how she could support us in preventing gang violence. She took the time to listen to our concerns and this is a great step in reaching our mutual goals to address gang violence and provide essential prevention opportunities for our communities." 
   The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act, introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), co-sponsored by Cantwell, and currently under consideration in the Senate Judiciary Committee, would provide additional tools, resources, and personnel to local law enforcement in communities across Washington, including communities like Spokane, Yakima, and Tacoma that have experienced a recent rise in gang violence. 
   In late July, Cantwell met with law enforcement and community leaders in Tacoma to discuss how federal support could help with ongoing local efforts to curb gang violence. The anti-gang legislation supported by Cantwell would help confront many of the problems identified at this and other meetings with Washington state law enforcement. Local law enforcement officials in Washington state have noticed a clear increase in gang activity during the past year. 
   The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act would: 
   * Make recruiting minors to join criminal street gangs a federal crime carrying mandatory prison time. 
   * Make illegal participation in a criminal street gang a federal crime. 
   * Criminalize violent crimes in furtherance or in aid of criminal street gangs. 
   * Increase the maximum sentences for many gang-related offenses and establish new mandatory minimum sentences. These new minimum sentencing laws would not apply to first-time offenders who agree to tell all they know about criminal activity. 
   * Make murder and other violent crimes committed in connection with drug trafficking a new federal crime. 
   * Allow for the prosecution of gang members who cross state lines to obstruct justice, or intimidate or retaliate against witnesses, jurors, informants, or victims. 
   * Create tougher laws for certain federal crimes like carjacking, conspiracy, interstate assault, and other existing offenses in which gang members may be involved. 
   * Increase penalties for the criminal use of firearms in crimes of violence and drug trafficking. 
   * Allow for the detention of individuals charged with firearms offenses who have been previously convicted of violent crimes or serious drug offenses. Current law does not allow a prosecutor to ask that a person be held without bail in many of these cases. 
   * Extend from five to 10 years the time within which a violent crime case can be charged and tried. 
   * Allow prosecutors to more easily charge as adults 16- and 17-year olds suspected of serious violent felonies. However, unless the juvenile in question has been prosecuted previously as an adult, a judge would still review every decision a prosecutor makes to charge the juvenile as an adult. 
   * Create and provide assistance for High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas (HIIGAA). Specifically, the Attorney General would designate high intensity interstate gang activity areas and provide assistance in the form of criminal street gang enforcement teams made up of local, state, and federal law enforcement to investigate and prosecute criminal street gangs in the designated areas. 
   * Authorize $500 million over five years to support HIIGAA activities, including the establishment of a National Gang Activity Database, hiring of new prosecutors and agents, and promotion of gang activity prevention efforts. 
   * Establish a national clearinghouse to collect and disseminate "best practices" for fighting gangs. 
   * Authorize an additional $270 million over three years for witness protection needs at all levels of government. 
   * Authorize $100 million over five years to expand the Project Safe Neighborhood program and require U.S. Attorneys to identify and prosecute significant gangs within their district.
