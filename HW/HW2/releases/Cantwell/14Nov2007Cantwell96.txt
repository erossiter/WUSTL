SEN. CANTWELL PRAISES REAUTHORIZATION OF HEAD START PROGRAM
  Wednesday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) praised final passage of the first reauthorization of the Head Start program since 1998. The Senate passed its version of Head Start reauthorization by unanimous consent in June and passed the report on the conference with the House by today's vote of 95-0. The bill will now be sent to the president's desk. 
  "Today's vote gives millions of low-income children in America a better future," said Cantwell. "Since 2002, Head Start funding has effectively declined 11 percent. Currently, the program only serves half of the children eligible for the pre-school program, and far less than half of the children eligible for Early Head Start. If we want to keep our economy competitive and ensure a bright future for the next generation of leaders, we must begin early and make sure that our children are ready to learn. It's time to do more, not less. I look forward seeing this bill signed into law quickly."
  The Head Start program has provided comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children since 1965. The Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 reauthorizes Head Start through fiscal year 2012 and will help more children be prepared for their first day in kindergarten. The bipartisan legislation improves teacher and classroom quality, strengthens Head Start's focus on school readiness, expands access for more children, ensures well-run centers, and encourages coordination between Head Start and state and local programs.
  Washington state received over $99 million in Head Start funds in 2007 and roughly 11,000 children in the state are enrolled.
