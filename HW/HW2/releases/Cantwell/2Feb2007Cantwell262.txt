SEN. CANTWELL SUPPORTS SENS. WARNER-LEVIN COMPROMISE RESOLUTION ON IRAQ
  Sen. Cantwell is supporting the Warner-Levin compromise resolution on Iraq. She opposes the president's escalation of the war and earlier signed onto the Biden-Hagel bipartisan resolution of opposition. 
   She believes Congress must hold the president accountable for more diplomacy in the region so far. She continues to believe the U.S. cannot have an open-ended commitment to this war and that we must change course.
