SEN. CANTWELL DEMANDS ANSWERS ON WASHINGTON'S PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SUPERFUND SITES
  Friday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) demanded better information from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Washington's 10 Superfund sites where, according to the EPA, human exposure to toxic chemicals and hazardous materials is still not under control. A total of 146 sites in the United States currently meet this description. There are also an additional 148 sites nationwide where the EPA has insufficient data to determine whether or not human exposure to hazardous substances is under control. 
   "We have far too many toxic sites across our country where people are still coming in contact with hazardous material," said Cantwell. "There seems to be inadequate information and no timeline to clean up these particularly dangerous sites, and we don't know if people are being harmed by leftover toxins. We even have a site in Washington where cleanup is reported complete, but where the EPA still says human exposure is not under control."  
   In a letter sent Friday to the head of the EPA, Cantwell requested a detailed report on the human exposure threat at each site in Washington that the EPA defined as "uncontrolled." Cantwell also asked for more information on how the EPA prioritizes cleanup at these sites, and how more data could be collected to clear up uncertainties at the locations where the Agency cannot determine human exposure accurately. 
   "For each Washington state site, I request that EPA provide a detailed plan outlining how and when the Agency plans to control human exposure as well as what level of funding EPA would require annually over the next five years to control human exposure at both the 10 sites in Washington and the 146 sites nationwide," wrote Cantwell. "I would also like an explanation as to why, for sites where construction is reported complete such as the Palermo Well Field site in Tumwater, Washington, there continues to be "uncontrolled human exposure." 
   Cantwell has long worked to ensure timely cleanup of Washington's Superfund sites, including the former Asarco site on Commencement Bay near Tacoma. 
   Washington state sites where, according to the EPA, human exposure to toxins is not under control include: 
   * Bangor Naval Submarine Base in Kitsap County 
   * Commencement Bay Nearshore and Tide Flats in Tacoma 
   * Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane County 
   * The Fort Lewis Logistics Center in Tillicum 
   * Hamilton and Labree Roads in Chehalis 
   * Harbor Island in Seattle 
   * The Jackson Park Housing Complex in Kitsap County 
   * The Lower Duwamish Waterway in Seattle 
   * The Midnite Mine in Wellpinit 
   * Palermo Well Field in Tumwater 
   Congress established the Superfund Trust Fund in 1980 to clean up hazardous sites when the liable party cannot be identified or is unable to pay. The Superfund Trust Fund was funded by excise taxes on crude oil and chemicals and by a corporate environmental income tax until 1995. Since then, the Fund has steadily declined until it ran out of money in 2003. Since then taxpayers, rather than polluters, have had the full burden of paying for Superfund cleanups. Currently, as shown by a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report requested by Cantwell and released last summer, many companies are using bankruptcy to avoid environmental cleanup responsibilities, dropping cleanup costs onto the taxpayers. Earlier this year, Cantwell introduced the Cleanup Assurance and Polluter Accountability Act (S. 3515), based on the GAO report's findings and recommendations, to make sure that polluters, not taxpayers, pay to clean up the sites they contaminated.

   July 14, 2006 
   The Honorable Stephen L. Johnson Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460 
   Dear Administrator Johnson: 
   I am writing with great concern about the number of Superfund sites at which the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that "human exposure is currently not under control." According to the EPA website, as of today's date, 146 sites in the United States currently meet this description. In Washington state, there are ten sites where human exposure to hazardous materials is not currently under control. These sites are listed in the table below. 
   As you know, the number of sites with "uncontrolled human exposure," and the lack of detailed information available about these sites, was recently discussed at a Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Waste Management hearing on June 15, 2006. I share these concerns, and therefore request in-depth information about human risks and details on the EPA's management of exposure at uncontrolled sites in Washington state which I can share with my constituents. 
   Specifically, I request that EPA provide a detailed report on the exposure threat at each "uncontrolled" site in Washington state, and the populations potentially at risk. I also ask that EPA provide an explanation of how cleanup efforts at these sites are prioritized in ways that protect populations that are at the greatest risk due to either the nature of the hazardous substance, or the exposed population, such as proximity to daycare facilities or senior centers. For each Washington state site, I request that EPA provide a detailed plan outlining how and when the Agency plans to control human exposure as well as what level of funding EPA would require annually over the next five years to control human exposure at both the 10 sites in Washington and the 146 sites nationwide. I would also like an explanation as to why, for sites where construction is reported complete such as the Palermo Well Field site in Tumwater, Washington, there continues to be "uncontrolled human exposure." 
   Lastly, I note that there are an additional 148 sites nationwide where the EPA has insufficient data to determine whether or not human exposure to hazardous materials is controlled. I request an explanation as to why these alarming data gaps exist and what steps are necessary to fill this information void. 
   Thank you for your attention to this matter and I appreciate your timely response. 
   Sincerely, 
   Maria Cantwell 
  United States Senator
