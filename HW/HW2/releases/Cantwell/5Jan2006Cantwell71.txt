SEN. CANTWELL LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THOUSANDS OF MAIL ORDER BRIDES FROM ABUSE BECOMES LAW
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) applauded the president's signing of the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act Thursday as part of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2005. The new regulations, based on a bill sponsored by Cantwell, will help provide foreign fiancées with additional resources and will help them decide for themselves whether they are entering into a safe situation. VAWA includes additional safeguards for survivors of domestic violence. 
   "This law builds on past lessons, putting in place vital safeguards to protect women from abuse and exploitation," said Cantwell. "Foreign-born fiancées deserve to know about their rights here in the United States, and need information about whether their potential spouse has a history of violent crime." 
   Under current practice, American clients can get all the information they want about foreign fiancées, while foreign fiancées only receive the information that the men choose to share, and have no way to confirm what they are told. The new law, signed today, will make information available to foreign women about the marital and violent criminal history of their prospective American husbands, and will require international marriage brokers to provide foreign fiancées with information about the rights and resources available to domestic violence victims in the United States. The original legislation was sponsored by Cantwell and Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) in the Senate, and Congressman Rick Larsen (D-WA) in the House. 
   Cantwell's bill to protect mail order brides was included in the reauthorization of the landmark 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which provides resources for battered women and their families, and funds local law enforcement training programs. The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 makes several much need improvements to the original law by strengthening penalties, enhancing the privacy of victims, and increasing funding levels for programs to train law enforcement officers and provide assistance to survivors of domestic violence. The bill also makes it easier for officials to prosecute individuals who stalk victims over the internet, and enhances the services available to immigrants and trafficking victims, regardless of their immigration status. 
   "Domestic violence destroys families and we need to put a stop to it," said Cantwell. "This new law delivers more resources and help to the women and children who need it most." 
   Washington state VAWA programs served more than 25,000 Washingtonians in 2001, but because of a lack of resources, more than 30,000 women and children who sought services could not get help during that same time. 
   The new mail order bride law included in VAWA protects mail order brides by implementing much-needed safeguards at the federal level to monitor the thousands of unions arranged by international marriage brokers each year. 
   The use of marriage broker services has exploded in recent years with the growth of the internet. About 500 Internet sites exist solely to market foreign women, primarily from Eastern Europe and Asia, who are seeking American husbands. In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 women had entered the U.S. using an International Marriage Broker during the previous five years. By 2004, those figures had more than doubled according to reports by the Tahirih Justice Center, a public policy advocacy center based in Virginia. 
   Cantwell supports domestic violence prevention initiatives and increased services for survivors of domestic violence. The Violence Against Women Act of 2005: 
   * Increases funding to over $400 million a year for existing grant programs that provide vital support to law enforcement officers, lawyers, judges, and advocates who help domestic violence survivors * Strengthens criminal penalties for repeat domestic violence offenders
