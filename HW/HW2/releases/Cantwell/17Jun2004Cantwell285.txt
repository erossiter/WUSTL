ENERGY ASSISTANT SECRETARY COMMITS TO SEN. CANTWELL: 99% OF NUCLEAR WASTE WILL BE CLEANED UP
  The senior Department of Energy (DOE) official who oversees nuclear waste cleanup made a clear commitment today to Sen.  
 Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that the DOE would clean up 99% of nuclear waste left in underground tanks like those at Hanford. In previous testimony in 2002 and 2003, the DOE refused to commit to the 99% threshold, even though it was legally obligated to do so. In the last two years of negotiation with the state of Washington, the DOE also failed to commit to 99% tank cleanup.
   Cantwell questioned DOE Assistant Secretary Jessie Roberson today during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the accelerated cleanup of nuclear waste. 
   Cantwell said, "If the DOE sticks to the commitment made by Assistant Secretary Roberson this would be a significant step forward in protecting Washington State from shortcut cleanup tactics." 
   The state of South Carolina, under language currently moving through the Senate, could be stuck with almost 10 percent of the high-level nuclear waste left in tanks at Savannah River. The last 10 percent is the most toxic and dangerous of all the waste. 
   Cantwell said, "Hanford won't be left with large amounts of tank waste if the DOE sticks to its 99% cleanup plan."
