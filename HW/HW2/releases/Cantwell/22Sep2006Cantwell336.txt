SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROSH HASHANAH
  Friday, Sen. Maria Cantwell issued the following statement in celebration of Rosh Hashanah:  
   The Jewish New Year is a time for celebration, prayer, and reflection. As friends and family commemorate the high holy days which begin this evening, Jewish communities across Washington state and around the world will come together, consider the past, and look to the year ahead. Rosh Hashanah brings new beginnings and new energy; Yom Kippur calls for atonement and forgiveness. These ideals extend beyond religion or race - they build common ground and inspire shared sacrifice. All of this was threatened by an act of senseless violence and hate this summer in Seattle. We cannot give in to that hate. During these days of repentance and renewal, I share your commitment to ending violence and living with one another in peace around the world, in Israel, and here in our own communities.
