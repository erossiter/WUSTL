SENS. MURRAY, CANTWELL, REP. HASTINGS SECURE FUNDS FOR HANFORD REACH VISITORS CENTER
  The total amount of federal dollars for the Hanford Reach Visitors Center has been increased to $5.78 million through the joint efforts of Sen.  
 Patty Murray, Sen. Maria Cantwell and Rep. Doc Hastings. 
   "As a longtime supporter of the protection of the Hanford Reach, I am pleased to have worked with Rep. Hastings to secure these funds for the Visitor Center ," Senator Murray said. "From its pristine natural beauty to the salmon that spawn in its waters to its strong Native American history, the Hanford Reach is a unique American resource. The Visitor Center will help tell the story of the Hanford reach to travelers from across the country." 
   "The Hanford Reach is one of the natural jewels of our beautiful state," Senator Cantwell said. "I was proud to join a strong team of supporters in both Washingtons to make this important economic and community development project a reality." 
   "This is a locally driven project that will help attract tourists to our community," said Congressman Hastings. "I am pleased to join with Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell in helping the Center become a reality," said Hastings . 
   The Hanford Reach Visitor's Center is expected to be ready for construction by the end of Fiscal Year 2006. 
   $2.25 million was secured in the final Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill that has been approved by the House and Senate. That, combined with the $775,000 secured in the Interior bill last year, represents the maximum amount that U.S. Fish and Wildlife can spend on the project. $2.78 million was secured in the federal highway bill which has been approved by the House, and is expected to pass the Senate today.
