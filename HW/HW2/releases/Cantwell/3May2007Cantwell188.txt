SEN. CANTWELL-BACKED NEW BILL WOULD HELP ALERT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO METH LABS
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined Sens. Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) in introducing legislation to help law enforcement shut down meth labs and apprehend individuals illegally stockpiling meth ingredients. The bipartisan Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act builds on the Combat Meth Act, signed into law last year. The Combat Meth Act moved meth ingredients behind pharmacy counters and required purchasers to sign a logbook. The legislation introduced today would promote the use of electronic logbooks to monitor sales more accurately over a wider area and help notify law enforcement of individuals stockpiling meth precursors.  
   "We've already taken a key step by moving meth ingredients behind pharmacy counters, now we need to help law enforcement catch the meth cooks who've found a way around this law," said Cantwell. "Electronic logbooks will go a long way toward stopping the criminals who pass through several stores to build up illegal stockpiles of these medicines. By encouraging broader use of technology we already have at our fingertips, our law enforcement will gain a valuable new tool to further reduce the number of meth labs in our state." 
   Specifically, the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act would: 
   * Revise the Combat Meth Act's logbook requirement to facilitate the use of electronic logbooks to better track meth precursors 
   * Create a federal grant program to help states create and enhance electronic logbook systems
   * Preserve the privacy safeguards of the Combat Meth Act
   * Encourage the use of statewide electronic logbooks that transmit in real-time and facilitate information-sharing across jurisdictions 
   Many states have already begun developing electronic logbook systems, but lack the resources and coordination needed make them fully effective. Grants provided under the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act would help alleviate this problem. The legislation is endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Association, the Major Count Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Counties, and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. 
   In March 2006, Cantwell worked with her colleagues to include the Combat Meth Act and other anti-meth measures in legislation to re-authorize the Patriot Act. Under this law, products containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine must now be kept behind pharmacy counters, and purchasers must show identification and sign a logbook before buying these products. The new law also limits to 9 grams per month and 3.6 grams per day the amount of these medicines one person can purchase. 
   Cantwell has worked tirelessly to help local law enforcement fight meth. Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee passed her legislation to study the growing link between meth and identity theft. In February, Cantwell toured the state for a series of community meetings with local law enforcement to hear firsthand about meth issues and look at how the federal government can help curb the manufacture, trafficking, sale, and use of meth. Cantwell has worked to increase funding for anti-meth programs, curb meth trafficking across the U.S.-Canada border, and move meth ingredients behind pharmacy counters. Last year, Cantwell also joined Representative Brian Baird (D-WA) to create a National Meth Awareness Day, observed in November, and backed new legislation, signed into law in September, authorizing $40 million annually to help children affected by meth.
