ECONOMIC NEWS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO ERASE 1.6 MILLION JOBS DEFICIT
  According to the jobs report released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. still suffers a 1.6 million jobs deficit since President George W. Bush has been in office.  
 There were 288,000 new jobs in April, but 85% of those jobs are in the service sector. Only 21,000 jobs were in the manufacturing sector - Washington state alone has lost more than three times that.
   Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), who is fighting to re-instate federal unemployment benefits, said today's report underscored the importance of federal unemployment benefits.
   "Nearly two million Americans have spent the last six months or more trying to find a job. And, we just broke a record for sustained long-term unemployment.
   "Until the economy has fully recovered, Congress has an obligation to extend unemployment benefits. This isn't just about compassion: unemployment benefits help stimulate the economy and save families from financial ruin, which costs taxpayers far more than a few more weeks of unemployment benefits. If Congress extended unemployment benefits today, $320 million would be injected into Washington state's economy.
   "1.6 million jobs would have to be created this month to say that unemployment benefits aren't necessary. When we had a smaller jobs deficit of 1.1 million jobs, George HW Bush extended unemployment benefits for nine months.
   It would be shameful for Congress to think that a few numbers eliminates the pain that so many American families are feeling right now. I will continue pushing Congress to act to provide unemployment benefits for workers who can't afford to wait while we watch numbers."
