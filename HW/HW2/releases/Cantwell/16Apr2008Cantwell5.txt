   [The text of the letter follows below]
   April 15, 2008
   His Excellency
  Umaru Musa Yar'Adua
  President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
  Aso Rock Villa, Abuja
   Dear Mr. President:
   We seek your personal assistance to secure the release of the following U.S. citizens: Sandy Cioffi, Tammi Sims, Clifford Worsham, and Sean Porter, as well as the release of a Nigerian citizen, Joel Bisina, who was taken into custody with them. These U.S. citizens entered Nigeria legally on April 5 to complete a documentary film concerning the impact of oil production on the Niger Delta. They were detained by the Nigerian military on April 12 while in the Niger Delta region and later transferred from military custody to the State Security Service in Abuja, where they continue to be detained without charge. We are deeply concerned that these individuals have been held for so long without any apparent cause.
   We call on you to release this group immediately and urge you to ensure their full protection during their time in Nigeria.
   Sincerely,
   Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Max Baucus (D-MT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jon Tester (D-MT), John Kerry, (D-MA), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH)
   Reps. Jim McDermott (D-WA-07), Jay Inslee (D-WA-01), Rick Larsen (D-WA-02), Brian Baird (D-WA-03), Norm Dicks (D-WA-06), Adam Smith (D-WA-09)
   cc: Ambassador Robin Reneé Sanders, cc: Ambassador Oluwole Rotimi
