SEN. CANTWELL COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ON ENERGY
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement in response to the president's energy remarks delivered Monday:  
   "Senate committees have passed out a landmark nationwide fuel efficiency boost for every new car and truck, closing the SUV loophole. The bill also covers for the first time medium and heavy vehicles, and ensures that 80 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States by 2015 can also run on biofuels. Congressional committees have also recently cleared legislation mandating production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022, and a host of important energy efficiency measures. 
   "I hope the president will help round up support for both these groundbreaking bills, and back our efforts to enact strong consumer protections that make gas price gouging illegal."
