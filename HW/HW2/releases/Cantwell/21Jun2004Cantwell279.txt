LEADING THE FIGHT TO FREE RATEPAYERS, BUSINESSES, AND UTILITIES FROM ENRON'S ILLEGAL CONTRACTS
  Today I called on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Pat Wood and Attorney General John Ashcroft to release e-mails written by Enron employees that could provide new "smoking guns" in the investigation of Enron's illegal market manipulation.  
 FERC has redacted these e-mails form the public record and has opposed the release of additional e-mails that may contain valuable evidence. I am deeply troubled by FERC's ongoing efforts to quash and obstruct the investigation of Enron's illegal activity. Last December, FERC attempted to quash the subpoena for Enron's audiotapes by Snohomish PUD. Now FERC is again obstructing efforts to release these important e-mails.
   Just as the now-infamous Enron audiotapes exposed Enron's corrupt corporate culture and trading practices, these e-mails could help prove how Enron manipulated energy markets. Both DOJ and FERC should cooperate to make all such e-mails available to the public, state and local governments and utilities attempting to defend themselves from Enron lawsuits. Ratepayers, businesses, and utilities not be held financially responsible for Enron's egregious market manipulation.
