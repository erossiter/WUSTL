SEN. CANTWELL SUPPORTS BOOST IN FUNDING FOR PAYMENTS TO COUNTIES
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced this morning that a Senate appropriations bill contains a big boost to a program that brings millions of dollars total each year to Washington state counties hosting a large number of federal employees and federal lands.  
   "These funds will help our schools, repair our roads, and provide better tools for firefighters," Cantwell said. "It prevents local taxpayers from being burdened by the need to care for nearby federal lands." 
   The payments help counties that have tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries by offsetting the costs of providing services to federal employees and users of the public lands. Without the payments, local taxpayers would have to bear the financial burden alone for those services, including education, solid waste disposal, law enforcement, search and rescue, health care, environmental compliance, firefighting, housing, social services, and transportation.
   Funding for the "payments in lieu of taxes" (PILT) program in 2006 will jump $8.2 million over last year's level, to $235 million. That meets the funding level requested by the National Association of Counties, and represents an increase of $35 million over the President's budget. 
   The funds were included in the Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The full House of Representatives passed a spending bill last month that included $242 million for PILT.
