SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON GEN. PETRAEUS, AMBASSADOR CROCKER TESTIMONY
  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement today in response to the testimony of General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker before the Senate: 
   "While there has been some success in stabilizing Anbar Province, I am concerned about other recent reports to Congress such as the General Accountability Office finding that violence remains high. It is past time to transition the mission of U.S. forces out of a combat role and for the president to let the Iraqis know that U.S. troops will not remain indefinitely. Iraqis must stand up and take control of their own security and make the compromises needed to stabilize their country."
