SEN. CANTWELL TO OPPOSE MUKASEY NOMINATION FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Thursday night, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement opposing the nomination of Judge Michael B. Mukasey to serve as Attorney General of the United States: 
  "I do not support the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States. Our country has been through a period where this administration's over-reaching use of executive power has not only been called into question, but has been reversed by the courts.
  "America deserves an Attorney General who will restore confidence to an office that has been hurt by politically influenced firings.
  "Judge Mukasey's answers to questions about executive power, especially regarding surveillance that may involve U.S. citizens, are troubling. I cannot support his nomination."
