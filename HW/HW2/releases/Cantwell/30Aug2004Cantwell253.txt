SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES $365,000 FOR GRAYS HARBOR COLLEGE TO HELP STUDENTS MEET CHALLENGES OF COLLEGE
  Today Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that Grays Harbor College will receive $364,996 in federal funds this year to meet the college's goal of increasing graduation rates and helping students move on to four-year schools.  
   "As someone who was the first in their family to graduate from college, I know that the transition from high school to college is a tough one," Cantwell said. "This grant will help Grays Harbor students meet the challenges of college with additional tutoring and career services." 
   The funds will go toward improving services in the college's learning center, including increased tutoring, career, and transitional services. 
   The grant is expected to be renewed for an additional four years, providing the college with $1,522,279 over 5 years. 
   The grant was awarded through the Department of Education's "Strengthening Institutions Program," which was authorized by Congress in the Higher Education Act of 1998. Cantwell voted to continue the program's funding in the 2004 Fiscal Year Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill.
