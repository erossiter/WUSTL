SEN. CANTWELL TO ANNOUNCE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION COAUTHORED WITH SEN. SESSIONS TO CLOSE 'RESSAM LOOPHOLE'
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) Monday will announce bipartisan legislation authored with Sen.  
 Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to close the "Ressam Loophole" that currently makes it easier terrorists to illegally enter the United States with falsified documents, and circumvent the U.S. biometric visa identification system, by taking advantage of the Visa Waiver Program. Under Cantwell's legislation, terrorists like Ressam would be stopped long before entering the United States. Cantwell's legislation would make participation in the Visa Waiver Program conditional on those countries adopting biometric fingerprint identifiers in granting visas to third-country nationals as the US-VISIT program. 
   When: 2:30 p.m., Monday, October 4, 2004 
   Where: Senator Cantwell's Office (717 Hart Senate Office Building)
