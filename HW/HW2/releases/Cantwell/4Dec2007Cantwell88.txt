COMMERCE COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. CANTWELL-BACKED MEDIA CONSOLIDATION LEGISLATION
  Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee passed the Media Ownership Act of 2007 introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), and cosponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA). The bill will increase the transparency in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) process and adopt new media ownership rules. 
  "Chairman Kevin Martin is in a rush to complete his media consolidation rulemaking and limit public participation, while only paying lip service to localism and woman and minority ownership,"said Cantwell. "This legislation makes the FCC more responsive to the public on this very important issue and increases the transparency of its process. Diverse voices make this country what it is today and democracy is strengthened when we have various opinions broadcast on our airwaves, posted on the Internet, and printed in the press. No one should be allowed to corner the marketplace for ideas."
  On November 13, 2007, FCC Chairman Martin released proposed rules that would allow a major daily newspaper in the twenty largest media markets to own one television station or radio station in the same market, if the television station is not among the top four ranked stations in the market, and there are more than eight independently owned and operating newspapers and television stations after the transaction is completed.
  Additionally, the proposed rules would make it easier for the FCC to grant a waiver to the ban of common ownership between a major daily newspaper and broadcast media outlets, in smaller markets. Seattle is the nation's fourteenth largest media market. Chairman Martin has stated that he wants the Commission to vote on the proposed rule at its next open meeting on December 18, 2007. The bill attempts to restore a deliberative process to the FCC's rulemakings on localism and media ownership and give the public enough time to comment on the proposed rules. 
  Specifically the bill would require the FCC to:
  * publish any proposed modification to its broadcast ownership regulations at least 90 days prior to a vote and provide at least 60 days for public comment;
  * complete a separate rulemaking on localism before voting on changes to broadcast ownership regulations, including a study to determine the impact of station duopolies and newspaper / broadcast cross-ownership on the quantity and quality of local news, public affairs, local news media jobs; and
  * establishment of an independent panel on female and minority ownership and for the FCC to provide the panel with accurate data on female and minority ownership. This panel must issue recommendations and the FCC must act on them prior to voting on any proposed ownership rules.
