SEN. CANTWELL LAUNCHES ONLINE SUPPORT CENTER FOR WASHINGTON'S FLOOD VICTIMS
  Thursday, US Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) launched a special section of her website to help Washingtonians recovering from flood and storm damage - http://cantwell.senate.gov/services/flood.cfm 
  "After visiting Washington's affected communities in person, it is clear that our residents need help to quickly rebuild their communities," Cantwell said. "While I am working in DC to ensure that our communities and businesses get the help they need from the federal government, these families have questions and they need advice right now. My office is standing by ready to help in any way possible, and it's my hope that this online support center will help reach families looking for information and guidance to get through the bureaucratic red tape as they're getting back on track. I also hope that people will remember to donate to help the organizations that are on the ground working hard to lend a much-needed helping hand."
  The new section of her website features information for people dealing with the conditions on the ground, offers help in getting assistance from FEMA or finding local Red Cross Centers, avoiding storm-related scams, resources for small business owners, and links to certified charities that are working on the ground to help storm victims. The website will be updated periodically as more information about services becomes available.
