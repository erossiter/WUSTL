SEN. CANTWELL APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF HATE CRIME PREVENTION ACT
  Thursday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) applauded Senate passage of legislation that expands the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim. The bill strengthens efforts of state and local law enforcement and the Department of Justice to assist with their investigations and prosecution of hate crimes. It also provides grants to help state and local governments meet the high costs involved in hate crime cases. Cantwell has consistently supported the bipartisan Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act led by Senator Kennedy (D-MA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR).  
  "America was created on the idea that all people are created equal," said Cantwell. "Today, finally, we are recognizing these rights and giving law enforcement the tools to vigorously prosecute crimes motivated by hate or bias regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. Hate crimes must not be tolerated in America. I hope the President reconsiders his veto threat. " 
  For the past 10 years, there has been consistent support for the bill by 33 senators.
