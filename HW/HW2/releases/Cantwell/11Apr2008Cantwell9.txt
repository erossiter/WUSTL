SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ
  Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement following President Bush's speech on Iraq: 
   "While the Administration is finally agreeing to decrease troop deployments to 12 months, I am very disappointed by the President's decision to stop U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq after July. President Bush's insistence on indefinitely keeping 142,000 troops in Iraq further damages our national security and military readiness. At home, Washington state forces have been deployed to Iraq for more than 5 years and suffered more than 80 casualties and nearly 900 wounded.
   "Today, our troops are in the middle of what amounts to a civil war with no end in sight. Iraqi leaders continue to avoid making tough decisions to end political disputes that must be resolved to stabilize Iraq. This situation is not acceptable.
   "Even though President Bush has less than a year left in office, Congress must hold him accountable for his failed strategy. He needs to have a plan that implements a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces, steps up diplomacy in the region, and ensures the Iraqis take responsibility for their own country."
