FIGHTING TO RELIEVE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES FROM ENRON'S MARKET MANIPULATION
  Senator Maria Cantwell's Weekly Memo
   I was outraged when I heard Enron energy traders joking about how they had schemed to defraud consumers, businesses, and public utilities on audiotapes that were made public last week.  
 Yet incredibly, Enron is suing a number of utilities throughout the West for more than half a billion dollars. This includes a case against the Snohomish Public Utility District, which Enron is suing for $122 million, claiming that the utility acted illegally when it ended a 2001 contract resulting from manipulative practices in western energy markets. 
   Today I met with Snohomish County PUD GM Ed Hansen to plan a joint strategy to gain relief for Washington state ratepayers. I have written a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft, calling on the Department of Justice to make public all previously unreleased Enron audiotapes that remain in DOJ's possession. The criminals at Enron who stole from us should be locked up - not the audiotapes that provide evidence of their crimes. Clearly the public has a right to hear the full and complete story. Releasing every single audiotape can only strengthen our case before FERC and the courts that consumers deserve relief from the damage that Enron's misbehavior continues to cause.
