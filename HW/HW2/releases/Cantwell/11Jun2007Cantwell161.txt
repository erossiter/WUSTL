SEN. CANTWELL RENEWS CALL FOR RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES AFTER CLOSE SENATE VOTE
  Monday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), released the following statement: 
   "A majority of the country thinks Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is failing at his job. It's now clear that a majority of the Senate agrees. 
   "Attorney General Gonzales does not have the independence needed to serve as our country's top law enforcement official. There are simply too many unanswered questions on everything from warrantless wiretapping, to the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, to the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys. As a majority of the Senate has made clear, he should resign. With the continued rise in gang activity and violent crime, strong and effective leadership at the Department of Justice is more important than ever."
