SEN. CANTWELL DISAPPOINTED BY JAPAN'S DECISION TO HALT IMPORTS OF U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on Friday in response to Japan's decision to close its market to U.S. beef: 
   "Japan's suspension of U.S. beef imports is very disappointing. We were beginning to make real progress regaining access to our most important export markets and we cannot afford this kind of setback. Our cattle producers are working extremely hard in a difficult economic environment to raise the world's highest quality beef, and USDA inspectors have let them down. In light of this announcement, I hope to see the USDA finally take action to ensure that our food safety inspectors do their job in examining the integrity of our beef exports to ensure compliance with our trade agreements. The FDA must also stand firm on the promise it made two years ago, in the wake of finding Mad Cow in Washington state, to strengthen feed regulations necessary to eliminate existing risks of the spreading of Mad Cow disease through feed. Our beef producers deserve better."
