SEN. CANTWELL CALLS FOR END TO AIRBUS LAUNCH AID
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on Thursday after learning that the Airbus A350 will benefit unfairly from launch aid.  
   "This is another unfair subsidy for Airbus," said Cantwell, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. "American aerospace workers deserve a level playing field. Launch aid for the A350 undermines current trade negotiations and calls into question the EU's commitment to resolving this dispute. Unfair Airbus subsidies must come to an end." 
   Cantwell continues to call on European governments to reject unfair subsidies for Airbus. Airbus has benefited from a number of unique subsidies commonly known as launch aid, which is risk-free, low-cost government funding for the development of new lines of aircraft. The company only needs to repay the loans if the new product succeeds. This means Airbus remains unfettered by marketplace realities, while American companies must assume realistic levels of commercial risk.
