SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON TIBET
  Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement upon returning from Beijing, China and Seoul, South Korea:
   "Last week, I expressed great concern about the current situation in Tibet in meetings with Chinese government officials and in a major policy speech on clean energy. Restraint and dialogue is needed by all sides. In order to reach its full potential as a global leader, China must respect human rights and religious freedom."
