SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEVERE STORMS, FLOODING
  "In the wake of the massive damage caused throughout Western Washington by wind, rain and flooding, I would like to offer my support to Governor Chris Gregoire and local officials in the affected counties and cities throughout the state. I commend the Governor on her swift action in declaring a state of emergency and immediately making resources available to local governments. From the 80,000 people without power, to the closure of I-5, to the massive flooding and road closures, these storms have wreaked havoc across the Western part of the state, and are now threatening to cause damage in Eastern Washington as well. The scope of the damage inflicted will require federal assistance for residences, small businesses and communities across the state. I stand ready to fully support Governor Gregoire in her request for this assistance and will work to ensure that federal assistance is provided expeditiously. My thoughts and prayers are with all Washington residents who have been affected by this devastation."
