  Today Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell sent a joint letter to the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency urging him to quickly approve the federal assistance that Gov. Chris Gregoire has requested to help communities in Western Washington recover from recent flooding.  
   [The text of the letter follows below] 
   November 22, 2006 
   The Honorable R. David Paulison Federal Emergency Management Agency U.S. Department of Homeland Security 500 C Street S.W. Washington, D.C. 20472 
   Dear Director Paulison: 
   We are writing to urge you to approve as quickly as possible the federal disaster declaration requested by Governor Gregoire. 
   As you know, heavy rains, strong winds and flooding have impacted numerous counties in western Washington state. The state and local communities are performing admirably in response to this disaster. However, given the scope of the storms, federal assistance is needed as specified in the Governor's letter to the President. Therefore, we again urge you to approve a federal disaster declaration as soon as possible. 
   Thank you, in advance, your quick attention to this issue. 
   Sincerely, 
   Patty Murray 
  United States Senator 
   Maria Cantwell 
  United States Senator
