SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES IRS TAX RELIEF FOR WASHINGTON FLOOD VICTIMS
  Thursday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the IRS will provide tax relief for Washington state taxpayers in the Presidential Disaster Area from recent floods. Affected taxpayers in Lewis and Grays Harbor Counties have the option of claiming disaster-related casualty losses on their federal income tax return for either this year or last year. The IRS will also waive the usual fees and expedite requests for copies of previously filed tax returns for affected taxpayers who need them to apply for benefits or to file amended returns claiming casualty losses.  
  "Washingtonians have plenty of other concerns and stresses right now as they clean up from the flood," said Cantwell. "The IRS announcement removes one immediate worry so people can focus on getting their lives back on track."
  In addition, the IRS has waived certain tax filing deadlines for affected taxpayers. For details, go here: http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=165494,00.html
  IRS computer systems automatically identify taxpayers located in the covered disaster area and apply automatic filing and payment relief. Taxpayers within the covered disaster area do not need to self-identify by writing on their returns or using the disaster designation in their tax software. But affected taxpayers who reside or have a business located outside the covered disaster area are required to call the IRS disaster hotline at 1-866-562-5227 to self-identify for disaster relief. 
  Taxpayers may download forms and publications from the official IRS Web site, www.irs.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). The IRS toll-free number for general tax questions is 1-800-829-1040.
