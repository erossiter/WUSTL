KEY COMMITTEE APPROVES $150,000 REQUESTED BY SEN. CANTWELL FOR PIERCE COLLEGE HOMELAND SECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE
  Wednesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $150,000 she had requested for the Pierce College Center of Excellence for Homeland Security in Lakewood.  
   "Now in its third year, the Homeland Security Center of Excellence at Pierce College has worked to bring community and technical colleges into the emergency preparedness process and improve first responder training across our state," said Cantwell. "These funds will help the college coordinate better, more effective emergency training and preparedness initiatives, helping Pierce College play a greater role in keeping our communities safe. I'll continue to fight to make sure this important funding gets signed into law." 
   Pierce College's Center of Excellence for Homeland Security proved successful during its first two years, but still needs additional resources to accomplish its critical Homeland Security training mission effectively. The funding announced Wednesday would help standardize curriculum throughout Washington's Community College system, address gaps in skill sets for first responder training, and develop an associate degree in Homeland Security/Emergency Management. 
   The full Senate is expected to approve the funding for the Center of Excellence in the upcoming months. Once approved, a conference committee will work out differences between House and Senate versions of the legislation. The final legislation will then go to both the House and Senate for final approval.
