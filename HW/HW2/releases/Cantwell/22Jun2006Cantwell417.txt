SEN. CANTWELL ENCOURAGES IRAQIS TO TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FUTURE
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement in support of the Levin-Reed Amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. Cantwell underscored the need for Iraqi security forces to step up so the United States can begin bringing our troops home, and reiterated the need for the administration to do more to garner international support and foster diplomatic collaboration. She also made clear that the United States should not stay in Iraq indefinitely and must work to get U.S. troops home safely and as soon as possible.  
   "I support the Levin-Reed Amendment to encourage the Iraqis to take complete control of their own future. The amendment recognizes the increasing number of Iraqi troops being trained but calls on those troops to take the lead so U.S. forces can be redeployed beginning this year. It makes clear that the president should convene an international conference on Iraqi stability and reconstruction. This amendment calls on the Iraqis to take action to achieve a broad-based political settlement such as adopting amendments to the Iraqi Constitution on fair sharing of political power and economic resources. It also urges the Iraqi government to promptly disarm the militias. 
   "Last year, by a vote of 79-16, the Senate declared that 2006 should be a year of transition. The Levin-Reed Amendment is consistent with that goal and adds to my own calls for both the Iraqis and the international community to step up. We must make it clear that the United States is not going to stay in Iraq indefinitely. As I have said before, we must get the Iraqi people on their feet and U.S. troops home."
