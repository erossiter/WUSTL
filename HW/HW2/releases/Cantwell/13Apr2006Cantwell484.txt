SEN. CANTWELL HONORS WASHINGTON STATE VETERAN
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined veterans and community leaders to recognize U.S. Corporal Limuel "Lim" Forgey's courageous military service during the Korean War. Laura Forgey, Corporal Forgey's wife, accepted the overdue Purple Heart Medal on behalf of her late husband.  
   "I am extremely honored to present the Purple Heart to Laura Forgey for her husband's dedicated service," said Cantwell. "This tribute is long-overdue. Corporal Forgey's service to our country was truly admirable and reflects the spirit of selflessness shown so often by our men and women in uniform. We must never forget the valiant efforts of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen, both past and present, who have sacrificed so much to protect our country." 
   Corporal Forgey received the Purple Heart for injuries he incurred in the line of duty in 1951 while serving during the Korean War. Born in 1931, Cpl. Forgey moved to Prosser, Washington in 1949 and served in the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1953. A Korean War Veteran, Cpl. Forgey spent a year recovering at Madigan Army Hospital after being injured near the 48th parallel. After his discharge from the Army, Cpl. Forgey lived in Sunnyside from 1954 until his death in 1999. Cantwell presented the Purple Heart Medal to Mrs. Forgey on Thursday. Cpl. and Mrs. Forgey were married in 1953. 
   The Purple Heart is world's oldest military decoration still in use. Created by George Washington in 1782, the Purple Heart was the first American award made available to the common soldier.
