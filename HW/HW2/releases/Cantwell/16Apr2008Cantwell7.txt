SEN. CANTWELL: PRESIDENT'S CLIMATE CHANGE SPEECH SHOULD GO STRAIGHT INTO RECYCLING BIN
  Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement following President Bush's speech on Climate Change: 
   "I didn't hear the President say anything new that convinces me that after seven years the White House is going to stop trying to block every legislative or judicial effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Or, for that matter, that he suddenly understands the urgency of making our nation a clean energy leader. The best thing for the environment would be if the President recycles the paper his speech was written on.
   "While tackling climate change is the most urgent and important environmental challenge facing our generation, we need to make sure that any greenhouse gas reduction strategy is efficient, effective, and puts consumers first. If we learned anything from Enron and the western energy crisis, and what is currently going on in petroleum markets, when in comes to an irreplaceable commodity like energy, we need to make sure there is no way to game the system."
