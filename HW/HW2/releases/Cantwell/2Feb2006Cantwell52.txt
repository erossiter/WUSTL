SEN. CANTWELL TO JOIN HAWKS FANS AT SUPER BOWL XL IN DETROIT
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) will travel to Detroit this weekend to join the rest of the 12th man squad to cheer the Seattle Seahawks to a crushing victory in Super Bowl XL. In anticipation of a Seattle win on Sunday, Cantwell has wrapped the front door of her Washington, DC office in a giant number 12 and worn blue all week  
   "As Seattle takes center stage, I am proud to join the 12th man fans in Detroit," said Cantwell. "I heard there were 30,000 Pittsburgh fans there, so I am going to Detroit to join the Seahawks and teach those Steelers about the loudest fans in the NFL. They're going to need those terrible towels to mop up their tears after hearing from us." 
   "The Northwest is proud of the Seahawks for earning a spot in the Super Bowl for the first time in Seattle history," Cantwell continued. "The rest of America will learn what we've always known here in the Northwest: No one should take the Hawks lightly. On February 6th, fans across the Northwest will be rewarded for 30 years of unwavering support. It's going be a great victory." 
   Proudly wearing her Seahawks pin, Cantwell has been talking up the team on Capitol Hill, and striking a friendly wager with Pennsylvania's Senators Specter and Santorum. The losers buy the winners food and drink. When the Seahawks win, the menu will be chosen by Senators Santorum and Specter, and will hopefully include Iron City Beer, Perogies, Primaniti Brothers sandwiches. Should the Pittsburgh Steelers improbably stumble upon a victory, Senators Cantwell and Murray will deliver salmon, Red Hook Beer, Starbucks coffee, and Washington state cherries and apples to Specter and Santorum. Specter and Cantwell have privately agreed that the losing party will publicly deliver the food while wearing the winning team's hat. Cantwell has an extra Seahawks hat already set aside for Specter to don next week.
