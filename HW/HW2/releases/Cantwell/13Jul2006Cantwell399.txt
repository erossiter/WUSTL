SENATE APPROVES SEN. CANTWELL PLAN TO IMPROVE BORDER CROSSING EFFICIENCY, SAFETY IN TIME FOR VANCOUVER OLYMPICS
  Thursday, the Senate unanimously approved Sen. Maria Cantwell's (D-WA) proposal to improve communication among state, local, federal, and Canadian law enforcement and security agencies in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Cantwell's amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to work with the State Department, the Federal Communications Commission, and Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska state governments to develop a plan for interoperable communications. The Cantwell-sponsored amendment was added Thursday to legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security during 2007.  
   "The Olympics in 2010 should be an exciting time of celebration and universal pride, not massive border delays and fear," said Cantwell. "Our region needs a solid plan to make sure first responders and border personnel in the U.S. and Canada can communicate effectively with all other agencies involved with the Olympics and throughout the region. With a solid plan in place, we can respond rapidly to any potentially dangerous situation that could arise, while helping to keep our border traffic moving." 
   Cantwell proposed the amendment at the suggestion of the Washington State Military Department. If the proposal becomes law, DHS has six months to complete the plan and submit it to Congress, leaving enough time for federal, state, and local governments to apply for the federal funding needed to implement the plan in time for the 2010 Olympics. A comprehensive plan that addresses both the technical and operational aspects of effective communication is a key part of securing the public safety and smooth border crossing needed to boost Washington's tourism industry during the 2010 Olympics.
