SEN. CANTWELL JOINS SEN. BIDEN TO REINFORCE COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES PROGRAM, DELIVER MORE RESOURCES TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE) this week in introducing bipartisan legislation to reinvigorate the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. The COPS program, which has faced deep cuts by the administration in recent years, provides state and local law enforcement agencies with grants to hire additional community police officers and purchase new crime-fighting technology. This critical legislation authorizes a total of $1.15 billion and will reinforce the existing program, establish funding authorities and priorities, and improve the grants process.  
   "To stay tough on crime, keep drugs out of our communities, and stop gang violence, we need to stand by our local law enforcement officers and give them the resources, tools, and personnel they need to do their jobs efficiently and effectively," said Cantwell. "COPS is indispensable when it comes to supporting law enforcement and stopping crime in Washington state. Our state has received almost $200 million through this program, helping us hire more that 1,900 additional officers. We need to keep the COPS program strong." 
   Specifically, the legislation would: - Authorize $600 million per year to hire additional law enforcement officers to engage in community policing and counter-terrorism efforts, and serve as school resource officers 
   - Provide for a new program to establish and implement innovative programs to reduce and prevent illegal drug manufacturing, distribution, and use, including of methamphetamine 
   - Authorize $350 million per year for technology grants to help law enforcement agencies acquire new technology and equipment, including laptop computers for patrol cars and crime mapping software 
   - Authorize $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire and train community prosecutors 
   - Establish the COPS office as an entity within the Department of Justice 
   Since the program's creation in 1994, Washington state has received more than $192 million in COPS program grants, allowing local law enforcement agencies to hire more that 1,900 additional police officers and sheriffs deputies, and funding nearly 100 additional school resource officers to improve safety at primary and secondary schools in our state. All together, COPS grants have directly benefited more than 250 state and local law enforcement agencies in Washington, and supported more than $22 million in new crime-fighting technology. Nationwide, the COPS program has funded the hiring of 118,000 new officers since its inception.
