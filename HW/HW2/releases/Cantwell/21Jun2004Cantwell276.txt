WORKING TOGETHER TO CONFIRM FEDERAL JUDGES FOR WASHINGTON STATE
  Last week, the Senate confirmed two new federal judges to serve on the Western District of Washington.  
 Judge Ricardo S. Martinez is a talented jurist with a long history of public service, and he will be our state's first Hispanic federal judge. Judge James Robart has considerable experience practicing in federal court, where he has earned a reputation for fairness and integrity. Both nominations were the product of a bipartisan selection committee that I believe is a sound model for other states. Members of the state's legal community, the White House, and my colleague Sen. Patty Murray and I worked together to review a group of applicants. Together, we all agreed that they were the best for the job, and I was proud to support them.
