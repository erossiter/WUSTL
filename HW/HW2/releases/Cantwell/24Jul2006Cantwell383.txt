KEY COMMITTEE APPROVES $200,000 REQUESTED BY SEN. CANTWELL FOR SKAGIT VALLEY CANCER CARE CENTER
  Monday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $200,000 she had requested for the Skagit Valley Hospital Cancer Care Center in Mount Vernon.  
   "Skagit County's citizens need access to first-rate medical care near where they live and work," said Cantwell. "Supporting world class cancer care in Skagit Valley means area residents can have access to highly-skilled doctors and nurses and cutting-edge technology close to home. I'll continue to fight to make sure this critical funding gets signed into law." 
   Since 2000, the number of patients seeking cancer care services at Skagit Valley Hospital has increased by 15 percent. With Skagit County's population projected to grow to 150,000 by 2020-a 50 percent increase in 20 years-there is a pressing need to get Skagit County residents convenient access to the newest technologies and treatments. The $200,000 requested by Cantwell was approved last week by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. The funding must still be approved by the full Senate and House.
