CALLING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY ON HIGHER GAS PRICES
  Last week I joined other members of our state's congressional delegation in releasing a new government report that forecasts the likely impact of higher gas prices on Washington state drivers.  
 Our report shows that, as of last week, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in our state was $2.26 - 68 cents higher than one year earlier. If that holds for the rest of the summer, Washington drivers will pay $493 million more in gas costs than last year, and the average Washington family will pay an additional $225 between Memorial Day and Labor Day. 
   These higher gas prices are putting a chokehold on family's pocketbooks and our economy, but the reasons for the increase are shrouded in too much secrecy and confusion, especially since energy companies made record profits in the first quarter of 2004. To bring prices down, we need to open the books of America's petroleum industry so that we can fully understand what is actually going on in gas markets and what we can do to lower gas prices. I strongly believe that the Administration should conduct a review of the volatile petroleum markets to ensure consumers are not being gouged at the gas pump.
