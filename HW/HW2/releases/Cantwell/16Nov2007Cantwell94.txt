SEN. CANTWELL VOTES FOR TROOP REDEPLOYMENT, NEW COURSE IN IRAQ
  Friday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) again voted to change America's course in Iraq and begin bringing American troops home safely. After the bill passed the House of Representatives late Wednesday night by a vote of 218 to 203, President George Bush issued a veto threat on the bill. Because of the president's threat, despite Cantwell's support, the Senate was blocked from taking up this critical legislation for a new direction in Iraq. 
  "It is past time to transition the mission of U.S. forces out of a combat role," said Cantwell. "Iraqis must stand up and take control of their own security and make the compromises needed to stabilize their country. We cannot maintain a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq. Iraq's future must be in the hands of the Iraqi people." 
  The Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act of 2008 seeks to transition America's role in Iraq and bring our troops home. The $50 billion package also includes two Cantwell-backed provisions to prohibit the use of federal funds to establish permanent bases in Iraq or assert U.S. control over Iraq's oil supply.
  The bill would require the immediate start of the redeployment of U.S. forces with a goal for completion of the redeployment by December 15, 2008. The bill also:
   * Requires the president to provide Congress - within 60 days of enactment - a plan to complete the redeployment by December 15, 2008 
   * Prohibits deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq who are not fully trained and fully equipped 
   * Changes the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq to: a) diplomatic and force protection; b) targeted counterterrorism operations; and c) limited support to Iraqi security forces 
   * Includes an extension to all U.S. government agencies and personnel of the current prohibitions, in the Army Field Manual, against torture 
  The vote on the bill came just days after new reports show that the administration's Iraq war spending has reached $1.6 trillion and the administration requested an additional $196.4 billion in funds from Congress specifically for the Iraq war.
  Congress has already passed, and the President signed into law, legislation providing $459 billion for the Department of Defense to strengthen our military and provide for our troops. Specifically, the measure provides over $11 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, $23.5 billion for military health care programs and a 3.5 percent pay raise for active duty military personnel which was opposed by the Bush Administration.
