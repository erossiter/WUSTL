WEEKLY UPDATE FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CANTWELL
  Maria's Monday Memo
  Senator Maria Cantwell's Weekly Update for Washington State
   * Calling on FERC to Fully Investigate Enron's Manipulative Trading Practices
   Last week Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman joined me in calling for Senate hearings to examine the thoroughness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigation of Enron's abusive energy trading practices. We also asked FERC Chairman Pat Wood to reopen FERC's investigation into Enron's manipulative trading during the 2000-2001 Western energy crisis and to explain how the agency will respond to new evidence of extensive and deliberate trading manipulations, particularly in the context of disputed energy cost refunds and long term energy contracts. 
  FERC has failed to review thousands of hours of audio recordings that provide evidence of the abusive tactics used by Enron traders to inflate electricity prices. This casts serious doubts on the results of the FERC investigation, concluded in March 2003. It's time we had a thorough investigation of Enron's activities. The ratepayers, businesses, and utilities who were ripped off by Enron deserve answers and access to information that will help them defend themselves from Enron's lawsuits.
  *Expanding Washington's Park Lands...
  I'm glad to report that the Senate has taken two important steps towards expanding park lands in Washington state. First, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a proposal I have been working to create the largest expansion of Mount Rainier National Park in 70 years. This bipartisan proposal would improve access for visitors to the park, allow for a new campsite to be built, and add about 800 acres to the park in the Carbon River valley. 
  The Energy Committee also approved my bill to create a "Lewis and Clark National Historic Park." My bill will protect three sites on the lower Columbia River that played crucial roles during the Corps of Discovery expedition's dramatic arrival at the Pacific Ocean: Clark's Dismal Nitch, where the expedition first viewed the ocean and was trapped during a horrific six-day storm; Station Camp, where the group held a historic vote among all group members - including Sacagawea and York - on where the expedition should stay for the winter; and Cape Disappointment, marking the furthest point westward reached by Lewis and Clark. Both bills now head to the full Senate for a vote on final passage. 
  *...and Protecting Roadless Areas in Our National Forests
   I am extremely disappointed by the Bush Administration's ongoing efforts to overturn the U.S. Forest Service's Roadless Area Conservation Rule. Despite hearing from over two million Americans who said they support the Roadless Rule, the Administration has sought to dismantle the rule since its first days in office. In a time of record deficits, the Bush Administration should not be forcing American taxpayers to subsidize logging roads and timber sales while ignoring the Forest Service's $10 billion backlog on existing road repairs. That's why I sponsored the Roadless Area Conservation Act, which would permanently protect roadless areas. I'll keep working on this issue, and I'll keep you updated in the weeks to come.
  * Fighting Human Trafficking and Abuse of Mail Order Brides
   The U.S. State Department has released a new report estimating that between 800,000 and 900,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year, and including between 18,000 and 20,000 people who are trafficked into the U.S. Human trafficking and abuse includes for-profit international marriage brokers - companies that operate solely to connect men and women of different nations with the intent of getting married. Between 20,000 and 30,000 women have entered the U.S. using an international marriage broker in the past five years. Last week I testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about my bill, the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act, on mail order bride services that serve as human trafficking rings. My legislation, based on Washington state law, is designed to end this abusive and unregulated practice.
