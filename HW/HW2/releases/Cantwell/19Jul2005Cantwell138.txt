SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE ROBERTS
  Sen. Maria Cantwell's (D-Wash.) statement follows below: 
   "The opportunity to replace Justice O'Connor, who for over 20 years on the Supreme Court brought the nation together and respected and preserved the Constitution, is one of this President's and this Senate's most important roles.  
   "Tonight, the President has selected Judge John Roberts of the D.C. Circuit. While I am disappointed that President Bush did not choose one of America 's many well-qualified female jurists to replace Justice O'Connor, I look forward to the debate before us. I will be examining Judge Roberts' record to see whether he is competent, ethical and has a judicial temperament worthy of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. 
   "I will be especially interested to discuss Judge Roberts' views on the right to privacy as it exists in the U.S. Constitution. In a 1991 case Judge Roberts argued that Roe v. Wade 'was wrongly decided and should be overruled' ( Rust v. Sullivan , 1991)."
