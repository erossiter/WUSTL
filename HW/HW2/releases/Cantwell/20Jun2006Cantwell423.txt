SEN. CANTWELL INTRODUCES LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO INCREASE AVERAGE GAS MILEAGE TO AT LEAST 35 MILES PER GALLON
  Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined a bipartisan Senate coalition in introducing legislation to dramatically improve the fuel efficiency of America's vehicles. Cantwell's "Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act" would increase corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards to 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2017 for all passenger cars and light trucks, including sport utility vehicles (SUVs). The bill would also for the first time apply CAFE standards to passenger vehicles weighing between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds - such as Hummers and Large SUVs - improve safety standards in the event of a crash between different sized vehicles, and establish a credit trading program allowing auto manufacturers that cannot economically reach required fuel economy levels to buy credits from automakers that exceeded compliance requirements.  
   The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act incorporates legislation previously introduced by Cantwell that would empower drivers to reduce their own gas usage, including a requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency provide more accurate fuel economy data for the window stickers on new vehicles. Current window labels overestimate real world fuel economy by 20 to 50 percent. The legislation would also require new vehicles to come equipped with features allowing drivers to put their cars in a more efficient driving mode, an onboard display showing real-time fuel consumption, and a warning for tire pressure levels affecting fuel economy. 
   "Every time Americans empty their wallets to fill up their gas tanks, they wonder why they're paying so much and getting so little," said Cantwell, a member of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committees. "We know the technology already exists to allow American families to drive any car they want and still save hundreds of dollars a year just by getting better gas mileage. It's time we ask for more from our cars and the companies that make them. This bill sets a reasonable goal of improving fuel economy by ten miles per gallon over the next ten years. If we're going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and keep gas costs affordable, we need this common sense approach to improve the efficiency of the cars and trucks on our roads." 
   Specifically, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, introduced Tuesday by Senators Cantwell, Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Lincoln Chaffee (R-RI), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Joe Lieberman (D-CT), would: 
   * Require an average fuel economy level of 31.1 mpg for 2009 model year passenger cars, up from the current level of 27.5 mpg. 
   * Require an average fuel economy level of 23.6 for 2009 model year light trucks, including SUVs, up from 22.2 mpg today. 
   * Create a single combined fuel economy level of 35 mpg for both passenger cars and light trucks, including vehicles weighing between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds not currently covered under the CAFE system, by 2017. 
   * Require the Environmental Protection Agency to update and improve the accuracy of fuel economy data that appears on new car window stickers, and use the same accurate data as the basis of fuel economy compliance. 
   * Empower consumers to improve their own fuel economy by requiring new vehicles to come equipped with features allowing drivers to put their cars in a more efficient driving mode, an onboard display showing real-time fuel consumption, and a warning for tire pressure levels affecting fuel economy. 
   * Provide the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with the authority to restructure passenger car fuel economy standards based on vehicle attributes, not weight. 
   * Prohibit average manufacturer fleet fuel economy from "backsliding"--or going below current fuel economy levels. 
   * Establish a credit trading program allowing auto manufacturers that cannot economically reach required fuel economy levels to buy credits from automakers that exceeded compliance requirements. * Establish a "Fuelstar" program similar to the Energy Star program for appliances and consumer electronics to promote consumer awareness of the most efficient vehicles in a given class. 
   * Establish a green labeling program to recognize cars with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions over the useful life of the vehicle compared to all vehicles in a given class and model year. 
   In a letter of support endorsing the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, Consumers Union said, "Legislation aimed at reducing America's consumption of transportation fuel is arguably the single best way to shrink the nation's growing demand for oil and relieve pressures on rising gas prices." The full letter of endorsement is attached. 
   In May, Cantwell served as the Ranking Member for a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on fuel economy standards. At the hearing, Cantwell asked witnesses to analyze the impact of 20 years of stagnant fuel economy standards. She questioned the Administration's claim that it needs additional Congressional authority, and identified the technologies available to improve fuel economy and boost the use of alternative fuels. 
   Cantwell has been a consistent advocate of measures to reduce oil imports, promote greater use of domestically produced biofuels, increase the availability of flex fuel vehicles, and improve vehicle fuel economy standards. As the chair of the Senate Democrats' Energy Independence 2020 national campaign, Cantwell is working to break America's overdependence on foreign oil, protect working families from skyrocketing energy costs, and stop unfair market manipulation by energy companies.
