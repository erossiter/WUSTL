SEN. CANTWELL SUPPORTS SENATE STIMULUS PACKAGE; CALLS ON CONGRESS TO DO MORE TO CREATE AMERICAN JOBS
  After Republican leadership blocked attempts to pass an economic stimulus package that addressed some of our country's short and long term economic challenges, today the U.S. Senate passed a package that brings much needed financial relief to American families, including more than 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled vets. While pleased that short-term relief will be given to millions of American families, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) expressed disappointment that the package did not do enough to create new jobs here at home and invest in the long-term solvency of our economy. 
   "By passing this much-needed stimulus, American families, seniors, and veterans can now rest assured they'll have some extra money in their pockets," said Cantwell. "At the same time though, Congress missed an opportunity to preserve and create jobs here at home and address the economic hardship created by high energy costs. I will not stop fighting for policies that bring businesses the certainty they need and help them to create high-paying jobs across the country."
   As a member of the Finance Committee, Cantwell spearheaded efforts to include clean energy tax incentives that would have resulted in billions of dollars in investment, created thousands of jobs across the country, and helped consumers and businesses take control over rising energy costs.
   During his floor statement, the Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), said the following about Cantwell's efforts, "Senator Cantwell has been a champion of these provisions. There isn't enough that I can say to commend her for her good work. It's outstanding and these tax incentives make sense from the standpoint of our economy and our nation. They create jobs for Americans and in the process would reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy."
