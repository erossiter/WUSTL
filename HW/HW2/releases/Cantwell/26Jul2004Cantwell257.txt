WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CANTWELL
  * Acting on the 9/11 Commission's Report
   Last week the 9/11 Commission presented its long-awaited report on the terrorist attacks on our nation. The commission's report gives us a good look back, and a number of valuable lessons. But will this report help reduce the threat level? Is it going to make America safer? Only if we act on its recommendations, and act now. This report makes clear that we cannot afford to waste time pointing fingers for the past, but must focus on the future.  
  We must improve international cooperation, create a flat decentralized, network to improve intelligence gathering and strengthen our analytical capabilities, and more fully use technology to protect out borders and track down terrorists. At the same time, we must take care to protect the fundamental civil liberties enjoyed by all Americans, including the right to privacy. I am grateful to all of the commission members for their months of service - and in particular, Slade Gorton, who brought a Northwest perspective to the group's work - for their selfless service to the nation.
  * Working to Improve Social Security
  Social Security benefits include a modest annual cost-of living adjustment (COLA) to protect beneficiaries from inflation and the rising costs of basic necessities like electricity. For individuals participating in Medicare Part B, the current voluntary program that covers physician care, part of each month's Social Security check is withheld to pay for the monthly premium. The premium is adjusted annually and is based on the estimated average cost for an individual enrolled in Part B. In 1986, a "hold harmless" provision was created to ensure that an increase in the Part B premium won't exceed the beneficiary's COLA. 
  However, beneficiaries of Part D, the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, aren't protected by a "hold harmless" provision. With the escalating cost of prescription medications, seniors and people with disabilities who choose to participate in the Medicare Part D program may be subject to the possibility of a premium that far exceeds their annual COLA. That's why I'm cosponsoring the Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2004, which was introduced last week. This bill would guarantee that no more than 25 percent of a beneficiary's COLA could be withheld to cover increases in any Medicare premiums.
  * Protecting the White Salmon River . . .
   I'm proud to report that the Bush Administration has announced its support of my bill to protect about 20 miles of the upper White Salmon River and Cascade Creek, all within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Mark Rey, Agriculture Undersecretary for Natural Resources and the Environment, made the announcement at hearing of a subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This designation will permanently protect the upper third of the White Salmon as a premiere recreational destination, a Southwest Washington economic resource, and an important wildlife and salmon habitat.
  * ... and Exploring the Northwest's Unique Natural History
   I'm also glad to announce progress on another bipartisan effort to protect and celebrate the Northwest's unique natural heritage. I'm joining Rep. Doc Hastings and Sen. Patty Murray to propose a plan to establish an Ice Age Floods National Geological Trail through portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. An Ice Age Floods Trail will help educate the public about the series of floods that swept across the Pacific Northwest at the end of the Ice Age - some 12,000 to 17,000 years ago. The Ice Age Floods fundamentally changed the geography and way of life in the Pacific Northwest leaving coulees, buttes, boulder fields, lakes, ridges and gravel bars that define the landscape today. 
  * Working with Amb. John Miller to Fight Human Trafficking 
   I'm glad the Senate has confirmed former Rep. John Miller as Ambassador at Large to address the growing problem of human trafficking. When he represented Washington state in Congress from 1984 to 1992, Miller served on the International Relations Committee and was a member of the Human Rights Caucus. Amb. Miller brings his vast experience, compassion, and dedication to human rights with him to this daunting problem, and his ability to serve this nation goes without question. I urged Sen. Tom Daschle to speed Amb. Miller's confirmation, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on this issue.
