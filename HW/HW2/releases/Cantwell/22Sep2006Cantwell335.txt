SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON RAMADAN
  Friday, Sen. Maria Cantwell issued the following statement in celebration of Ramadan:  
   This week, Muslims across Washington state and around the world will begin observing the holy month of Ramadan through prayer, reflection, fasting, and charity. This season of contemplation commemorates the revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammed and represents a period of great generosity and community strength. Our nation was built on freedom of religion and we are stronger today because of our faithful and diverse Muslim community. As Muslims in our state and worldwide come together in prayer and peace, this holy season brings renewed understanding and compassion. I send my best wishes. Ramadan mubarak.
