SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINANCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Thursday, with Senator Cantwell's strong support, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bipartisan plan by a vote of 17-4 to renew and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) this year. CHIP provides health coverage to low-income, uninsured children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid, but who cannot afford private health insurance. Cantwell, a member of the Finance committee, issued the following statement:  
   "Ensuring children have access to affordable health insurance is the right thing to do. This vote brings millions more low-income, uninsured kids one step closer to coverage that can keep them healthy and give them a good start in life. I'm proud of the cooperation that went into this agreement. It's time for the full Senate and the entire Congress to stand together for kids, and to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program in a way that makes a difference for kids in need."
