SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ
  Wednesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement on Iraq: 
   "The president's statement tonight hangs our Iraq policy moving forward on 20,000 troops to stabilize Baghdad. Our strategy must be to significantly change the course by holding Iraqis to sooner timetables on taking security control, passing an oil law, and making the other political compromises necessary to ease disagreements among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds."
