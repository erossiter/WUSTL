SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement today honoring our nation's veterans: 
  "Veterans Day is a time to honor the millions of Americans who put their lives on the line for our country. We honor those who have fought to keep us safe, defend our freedom, and protect our liberty. Their devotion has made our nation what it is today.
  "As a nation, we have a responsibility to make sure service members, veterans, and their families receive the benefits and recognition that they have earned and so greatly deserve. We must keep our commitment to our veterans. 
  "This year, Congress has passed the largest funding increase in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure our troops coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan get the care they deserve, while continuing to meet the needs of veterans from previous wars. This funding will help improve conditions at veterans' military facilities, enhance VA health care services, improve veterans' access to critical benefits, and decrease VA waiting times and bureaucratic obstacles, safeguard veterans' personal data, and fund research for illnesses like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury. But we need to make sure this critical funding for our veterans gets signed into law.
  "Let us celebrate the service of America's military personnel and remember the many who have given their lives for our country. We do so on this day, and every day. Their sacrifice is immense and our gratitude is profound."
