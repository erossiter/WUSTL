SEN. CANTWELL: FDA, CONGRESS NEED TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES TO RESTORE CONSUMER, INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE IN U.S. BEEF INDUSTRY
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) commented tonight on the decision to reverse the Canadian beef ban made by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today.  
   "Regardless of the court's decision, Congress still needs to close existing loopholes that leave us vulnerable to possible mad cow outbreaks in the future. Strengthening standards will protect our food supply and help reopen foreign markets for the U.S. beef industry," Cantwell said.
   Cantwell introduced a bill that would enhance protections against the spread of Mad Cow by banning the use of Specified Risk Materials as ingredients in all animal feed, including pet food. (Animal Feed Protection Act of 2005, S.73)
