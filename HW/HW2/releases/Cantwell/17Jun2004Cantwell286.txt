SEN. CANTWELL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT EDUCATIONAL RADIO STATIONS
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced legislation today that would protect small educational radio stations from being forced to shut down because larger stations decide to take their frequency.  
 Cantwell introduced her bill as the fate of Mercer Island High School radio, KMIH, remains uncertain.
   "Educational radio provides a homegrown voice for local communities and a valuable hands-on experience for students," Cantwell said. "The FCC should not be in the business of choosing big business over education. Mercer Island High School has provided a service to students and the community for over 35 years. KMIH deserves protection."
   Cantwell's bill, the "Educational Radio Protection Act" (S. 2540), would provide protection to "super-powered" Class-D stations, like KMIH operating out of Mercer Island High School and nine other educational stations around the country, by changing their status to Class-A. This change would protect the stations from having their signal overpowered by larger stations looking to relocate.
   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally decided to shut down KMIH because a larger station from Oregon was attempting to relocate. The FCC issued an unexpected reversal of that decision last week. It is uncertain whether the FCC will allow KMIH to remain in operation, or simply reissue the decision with some technical changes. Either way, Cantwell's legislation is necessary for permanent protection. 
   Cantwell visited Mercer Island High School in May, promising to introduce legislation protecting stations like KMIH. She will use her positions on the Senate's Commerce Committee and its Subcommittee on Communications, which monitors the FCC, to move her bill toward passage.
