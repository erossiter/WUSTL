SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S COMMUTATION OF LIBBY SENTENCE
  Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement:
   "President Bush has committed a great injustice to justice by commuting Scooter Libby's sentence. Libby was found guilty by a federal court of committing crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice.
   "The president should be demonstrating that his office is not above the law instead of writing an additional chapter in his administration's long history of interpreting the law to serve its political purposes."
