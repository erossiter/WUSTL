VICTORY FOR WALLA WALLA VETERANS
  After months of grueling grassroots work, Walla Walla veterans candeclare victory today with the great news that Walla Walla's VA medical facility will remain open for veterans, despite the CARES Commission's recommendation to close the facility.  
   "For many veterans in Southeast Washington, this decision means that he or she will not have to face a longer drive to a care center or an even longer wait for an appointment. I am thrilled by the commission's decision and for all the veterans in Washington state who do not deserve to see their health care compromised," Cantwell said.
