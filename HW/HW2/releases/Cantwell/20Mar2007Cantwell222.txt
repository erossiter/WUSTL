SENATE PASSES SEN. CANTWELL-BACKED LEGISLATION TO KEEP PROSECUTION OF FEDERAL CRIMES FREE FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE
  Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), released the following statement:  
   "As the Judiciary and Ethics Committees continue their investigations, I am glad that the Senate has passed this legislation. Our U.S. attorneys must be independent and objective and the prosecution of federal crimes must be kept free from political influence. Now we need to see what Congressional investigations uncover and administration officials should fully cooperate or face subpoenas. As more facts come to light, it might be necessary to appoint a Special Counsel to prosecute any crimes that may have been committed. No one is above the law in our country." 
   The legislation approved by the Senate Tuesday would reverse a Patriot Act provision allowing the administration to appoint federal prosecutors to indefinite terms without Senate confirmation. Cantwell co-sponsored the measure, which passed on a 94 to 2 vote. The House must still act on the bill.
