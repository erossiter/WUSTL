SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES VOTE AGAINST ALITO
  Monday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that she will vote against the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
   As she has with previous potential Supreme Court Justices prior to announcing her position, Cantwell met face-to-face with Judge Alito in her Washington, DC office. During their meeting on Monday afternoon, Cantwell asked Alito about his record and recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Cantwell specifically asked about his positions on the right to privacy, the balance of power between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the rights of the individual versus the government. 
   Based on Alito's record as a jurist and following the answers he gave in response to her questions, Cantwell released the following statement on her decision to vote against Alito's nomination: 
   "I am very concerned with Judge Alito's record regarding an individual's constitutional right to privacy. While I do not expect any judicial nominee to prejudge future cases, I do expect all nominees to make their positions clear on protecting the most basic rights of individuals and the fundamental structure and foundations of our democracy. In the end, I cannot be sure that Judge Alito would do either. 
   "Judge Alito has a record of concern when it comes to placing and consolidating the rights of the government over the rights of the individual and he has not provided the answers to adequately reassure the people of our nation. I must conclude that he would neither show due respect for the authority of Congress nor apply a necessary check to the reach of the executive. With great respect for the institution, I cannot vote to confirm Judge Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States."
