SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO COMPLETE EBEY'S LANDING
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the Senate's FY 2008 Interior Appropriations bill contains her request to fund land acquisition at Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve on Whidbey Island. Cantwell was able to secure the same $500,000 in last year's appropriations bill, but that measure never became law when the outgoing Republican Congress failed to pass the fiscal year 2007 funding bills.  
   "Preservation of the Ferry House will help ensure that future generations will learn about Washington's pioneer legacy, and appreciate the natural beauty of Ebey's Landing," said Cantwell. 
   These funds will allow the National Park Service to acquire the Ferry House farm parcel, an easement on 35.5 acres within the Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve, from the Nature Conservancy who has been holding the land until it can become part of the National Historical Reserve. In many ways, the Ferry House is the heart of the Ebey's Landing Reserve, and many visitors recognize the historic house from its role in the movie "Snow Falling on Cedars."
   In a letter sent to Cantwell last year about her about her request, Washington State Parks Director Rex Derr wrote, "Ebey's Landing is one of many significant historical properties that State Parks manages for the benefit of Washington's citizens. The appropriation will help assure the park's legacy for the future."
