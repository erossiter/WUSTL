SENATE APPROVES NATIONAL METH PREVENTION MONTH
  Friday U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), praised the Senate's unanimous approval Friday of legislation she co-sponsored establishing a National Meth Prevention Month to help increase awareness of this debilitating drug and educate the public about the dangers of meth use. In 2006, Cantwell's legislation establishing a National Meth Prevention Week was signed into law. 
  "Meth is not an isolated problem in America," said Cantwell. "It may have begun in the West and it is now a nationwide problem, but as the drug is beginning to move up from Mexico by new gangs, its impact is spreading and getting exponentially more dangerous. We need to help local law enforcement shut down labs, investigate violent meth-related crimes, and educate the public about the dangers of meth before even more families become victims. Last year, I was in a classroom in Vancouver and a young girl said she didn't know that something that was so easy to make could be so dangerous. Every American needs to be aware of the meth epidemic and its effects on our citizens. With such a highly addictive drug, we must invest in educate and prevent further lives from being destroyed and help people get the help they need."
  The use of methamphetamine is still increasing throughout the United States. By 2006, almost 750,000 Americans aged 12 or older reported that they were using meth. On top of these numbers, underfunded and understaffed local enforcement agencies are struggling to deal with the problem. While some studies show that meth abuse has declined since 2002, 55 percent of sheriffs departments are reporting increases in meth-related robberies and burglaries during the last year.
