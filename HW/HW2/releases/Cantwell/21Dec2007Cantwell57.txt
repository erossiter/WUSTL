SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES $363M TO REDUCE DISABILITY CLAIM BACKLOG
  To help reduce the enormous waiting times for many disability benefit applicants to have their benefits approved, and to help reverse cuts in services to the public in Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices, today U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced an additional $363 million for the SSA to reduce the huge backlog in disability claims. The funding was included in the omnibus spending package passed by the Senate on Tuesday night. The House passed the bill on Wednesday, and sent it to the President for his signature. 
   "This funding is much needed and well deserved," said Cantwell. "The Northwest ranks second in the nation when it comes to waiting times for Social Security disability hearings. Delays mean that disabled residents in our region wait longer than almost everyone else to receive a decision on their benefits. In the meantime, most disabled applicants go without work and health insurance coverage as they attempt to navigate a rigorous application process. This program needs support, and I will continue working to ensure the disability backlog is reduced."
   The Seattle Social Security Region, which includes Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska, ranks second in the nation in Social Security disability hearing delays. The delays mean that disabled residents in the region wait an average of 584 days to get a decision regarding their eligibility for federal support. Advocates report that over half of claimants receive a favorable decision at Social Security disability hearings. As of December 2006, SSA had over 568,000 initial disability claims pending with an average processing time of 88 days. It also had nearly 718,000 Administrative Law Judge hearings (appeals) pending with an average delay time of 483 days.
