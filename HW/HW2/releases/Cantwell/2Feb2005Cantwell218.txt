WASHINGTON STATE GETS $1.4 MILLION IN EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) today applauded the decision of the U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services to release $100 million in emergency Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds, including $1.4 million for Washington state. Last Thursday, Sen. Cantwell and a bipartisan group of 49 other Senators asked the Bush Administration to release the full $200 million in emergency Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds the Administration had at its disposal. The Administration responded to the call by releasing half of the money, including funds to assist more than 2,700 Washington families who need help paying their utility bills this winter.  
   "I'm glad that the Administration has responded to our call to help Washington families keep their lights and heat on," Cantwell said. "Now I hope that they'll follow through by releasing the remaining $100 million. There's still enough money to help about 3,900 extra families in Washington state who continue to suffer unfairly from the fallout of the Western energy crisis. Helping them get through the winter is the least we can do." 
   The LIHEAP program provides federal funds to states every year to distribute to low-income families through local organizations. Typically, Congress designates a portion of this money for distribution to states through a formula set in the law, and sets aside another fund for the Administration to release when an energy emergency occurs. 
   There is currently $100 million in emergency funding that the Administration has not released-even as the total number of households asking for assistance nation-wide is expected to reach a 10-year high. If these funds were released and divided up according to the existing formula, Washington state would receive an additional $2 million-enough to help about 3,900 extra households. 
   All over Washington state, local community organizations are struggling to keep pace with the growing demand for LIHEAP assistance. This situation was documented in a recent status report issued by the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. Specifically: 
   * The Blue Mountain Action Council in Walla Walla reported that the number of households on its LIHEAP waiting list had more than quadrupled compared to last year at this time, from less than 100 to 426. 
   * The Hopelink program that serves portions of North and East King County reported a 63 percent increase in utility disconnections compared to last year (41 in 2005 to-date, compared to 15 in 2004). Its number of "crisis" appointments (for households that have received notices, but have not yet been disconnected) has grown from 192 last year, to 243 thus far in 2005, a 21 percent increase. 
   * The Rural Resources Development Association, serving Ferry, Pend Oreille and Stevens Counties estimated that funding for Ferry and Pend Oreille would be completely exhausted by the end of this month. Stevens County would run out of funding by March, or possibly earlier. Thus far, unmet need in the three counties combined was estimated as 890 households. 
   * In Snohomish County , 2,208 households are currently waiting for assistance. To date, the local program has served 304 families in "crisis" situations, within 72-hours of being disconnected. 
   * In Clark County , "crisis" situations averaged just over 80 per month in 2004. In 2005, the average has been more than 105 per month.
  * The Community Action Council of Lewis, Mason and Thurston Counties reported that "There was an extraordinary high demand for energy assistance when we initiated our energy assistance this year to the point of frenzy by our clients." 
   * The North Columbia Community Action Council also reported that "we have seen a substantial increase in the number of clients seeking assistance (high demand) and a good share of disconnections during the cold snap we just had." 
   In Washington state, an estimated 80 percent of the families eligible for LIHEAP assistance last year were unable to get it. While 302,000 households in the state qualify to receive this aid, there was only enough money to help 61,165 of these families in 2004. Of those who did receive aid, 71 percent make less than $12,000 per year. 
   Sen. Cantwell has consistently advocated increased funding for the LIHEAP program and has fought for the release of emergency resources to help Washington ratepayers hit hard by the Western energy crisis. In January 2003, after more than a year of pressing for release of this emergency money, Cantwell was able to free up an additional $3.2 million for Washington state. When it became clear that the Bush Administration would not voluntarily release the $300 million it was then withholding in emergency funds, Cantwell co-authored a successful amendment to a pending appropriations bill to distribute the funds to states. Within 48 hours of the amendment's passage in the Senate, the Administration released $200 million of this money. Washington state's share was enough to help another 5,500 families. 
   Cantwell has also authored the LIHEAP Emergency Reform Act, which would give states a more transparent process for applying for emergency assistance and require a timely response from the Administration. She plans to reintroduce this legislation in the new Congress.
