REMEMBERING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
  Today we remember the life of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  
 Although an assassin brutally ended his life nearly four decades ago, his legacy lives on. 
   Dr. King's eloquence in expressing the principles at the heart of the civil rights movement was unparalleled. As he wrote in his famous Letter From a Birmingham Jail, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." 
   On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he issued a poetic and historic call for all Americans to stand up to injustice by erasing the color line and living up to our country's guarantee of freedom and equality for all. Dr. King's leadership reaffirmed the promise of our democracy: that everyday people, working together, have the power to change our government and our institutions for the better. 
   Today, we can honor Dr. King's memory by recognizing that we are stronger because of our diversity, not in spite of it, and by continuing to champion the cause of freedom and equality.
