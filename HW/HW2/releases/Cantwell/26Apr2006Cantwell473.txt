WASHINGTON CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION: KEEP HANFORD CLEANUP ON TRACK
  Wednesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Washington State Gov. Christine Gregoire, Rep. Norm Dicks (D-WA-6), and Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA-4) in calling for Congress to approve $690 million in funding for the Hanford vitrification plant for fiscal year 2007.  
   "The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to clean up America's nuclear legacy at Hanford," said Cantwell, a member of the Senate Energy Committee. "We need to make sure vit plant construction stays on track. The safe, effective construction and operation of the vit plant is critical to removing and treating the 50 million gallons of radioactive and chemical waste from Hanford's 177 underground storage tanks. The federal government made a commitment to clean up Hanford and protect the citizens of the Pacific Northwest, and we're going to make sure they keep their word." 
   Funding the vitrification plant construction continues to be a top priority for Cantwell, who will join Murray and Gregoire this afternoon for a meeting with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) in his capacity as ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee with jurisdiction over Hanford funding. The event is one in a series of meetings between Washington state officials and key policymakers in Washington, DC this week.
