SENS. CANTWELL, KERRY INTRODUCE PLAN TO HELP FUEL-DEPENDENT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH RISING ENERGY COSTS
  Thursday, Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and John Kerry (D-MA) introduced legislation to create a fuel emergency program to help small firms struggling with rising gas costs. Kerry and Cantwell will also offer their proposal as an amendment to the energy bill currently under consideration in the Senate. 
   "Small businesses all across our country are hurting from record fuel costs that eat up their profit margins," said Cantwell. "More than 25 percent of small businesses have had to increase their prices as a direct result of rising fuel costs. It's time we helped fuel-dependent small businesses stay competitive so they can continue providing good, high-quality jobs."
   The legislation would create a state grant program within the Department of Commerce Economic Development Agency to provide assistance for fuel-dependent small businesses in the wake of a fuel emergency declaration by the president. Small firms and farms demonstrating need and a plan to become more energy efficient would also be eligible for these grants.
   Thursday, Kerry and Cantwell also held a Senate Small Business Committee hearing to examine the effect of high fuel costs on America's small businesses. At the hearing, Cantwell heard testimony from Janet Myhre of Tacoma-based small business ChuckAls, Inc., an independent office supply dealer. The delivery segment of their business is hurting under today's fuel costs, and many of their products are increasing in cost as a result of fuel price hikes. For example, a cost of a carton of paper has increased 15 percent over the last two years.
   Ms. Myhre said, "As we've discussed with Senator Cantwell and her staff, while there are new options for the consumer both in alternative fuel and vehicles, there currently are very few options for the small business owner who has commercial fleets, which run on gasoline."
