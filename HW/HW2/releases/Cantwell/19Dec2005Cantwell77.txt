SEN. CANTWELL VOTES TO EXTEND DEBATE ON PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Maria Cantwell(D-WA) released the following statement after she voted to extend debate on the Patriot Act. 
   "This summer the Senate unanimously passed a good bill which achieved our goals of both protecting our civil liberties and fighting terrorism. Sadly, the House turned its back on that bill and proposed in its place legislation which does nothing to address these concerns. Today, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to extend debate on the Patriot Act. I believe that with further discussion the Senate and the House can in fact send to the president's desk a bill which will ensure that individuals' private records are not obtained without due process or due cause. The federal government has a responsibility to protect our nation from those who may bring terror into our homes. It also has a responsibility to respect our rights and honor our privacy. These principles are not mutually exclusive: we can and must achieve both."
