SEN. CANTWELL CONGRATULATES WHIDBEY NAVAL AIR STATION ON WINNING TOP NAVY BASE HONORS
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) congratulated the men and women of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island on receiving the 2006 Commander in Chief Annual Award for Installation Excellence, designating their base as the nation's best in 2006. Cantwell also congratulated the City of Oak Harbor, Oak Harbor Mayor Patricia Cohen, and the Island County Commissioners for their outstanding support of the facility.  
   "For the second time in just over a decade, the Whidbey Naval Air Station has received top honors for its standard of excellence we in Washington have long admired," said Cantwell. "Washington state's men and women in uniform should be proud of their dedication, hard work, and many accomplishments." 
   Whidbey Island Air Station is home to 19 squadrons, including EA-68 Prowlers electronic warfare jets, P-3C Onion patrol aircraft, and EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance planes. The Naval Air Station will receive the award on May 5 in the nation's capitol. The base also received the award in 1994. Washington state's Kitsap Naval base won the honor in 2005.
