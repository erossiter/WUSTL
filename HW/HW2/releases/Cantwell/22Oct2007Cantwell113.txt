WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CANTWELL
  FAILED CHIP VETO OVERRIDE HURTS MILLIONS OF UNINSURED CHILDREN
   Last week, the House failed to override the president's veto of the children's health bill which would have provided nearly 10 million children with health care coverage through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). I am disappointed that this bipartisan, cost-effective plan to provide health care coverage to millions of children was defeated by political maneuvering. Even though a strong majority of the American public and Congress support this plan, the president and his allies chose to oppose it and deny millions of children the health care they need to have a healthy start in life. Despite this bill's defeat, I am committed to working with likeminded Senators and Representatives to prevent the number of uninsured children in this nation from growing.
   WASHINGTON'S LAW ENFORCEMENT GETS A BOOST DESPITE VETO THREAT
   This past Saturday, I met with local law enforcement officials in Vancouver to discuss the rise in violent crime and lack of resources available to battle this increase. Last week, the Senate restored nearly $2.7 billion for local law enforcement, through important programs like Byrne Justice grants and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). These programs deliver critical funding to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with grants to hire additional police officers. Before being slashed by the Bush Administration, COPS put nearly 2,000 police officers on the ground in Washington state and helped support our state's Meth Initiative. But despite this program's tremendous success in combating violent crimes, and the success of many more like it, the president is threatening to veto the bill. These funds will prevent critical resources from getting into the hands of law enforcement once again. Our local communities need this help for their law enforcement to help build stronger and safer communities in Washington and across the country.
