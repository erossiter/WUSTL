SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL PASSAGE OF DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement in response to the Senate's passage of legislation necessary to deliver much needed resources to America's troops and Hurricane Katrina victims. 
   "Today we played by the rules and won fair and square," said Cantwell, a member of the Senate's Commerce and Energy Committees. "For the second time today, America's political parties joined together to put our nation's troops ahead of special interests and personal attacks. America's military should come first, not big oil and special interests." 
   At 10:20 pm ET Wednesday, senators voted to pass the Defense Appropriations bill without Arctic Refuge drilling riders, reinforcing Cantwell's victory earlier in the day on the issue.
