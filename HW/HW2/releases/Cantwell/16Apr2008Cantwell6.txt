FILMMAKERS RELEASED FROM DETENTION NIGERIAN STATE SECURITY
  Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced the release of Sandy Cioffi, Tammi Sims, Clifford Worsham, and Sean Porter, as well as the release of a Nigerian citizen, Joel Bisina, who were detained by the Nigerian State Security Service. They still have to complete final processing with Nigerian authorities on Friday. Yesterday, Cantwell along with 13 of her colleagues sent a letter to the President of Nigeria regarding the release of these U.S. citizens. 
   "I am thrilled these four Washingtonians were released from detention today," said Cantwell. "I will keep pressing until the group is able to return to Washington state."
   The U.S. citizens entered Nigeria legally on April 5 to complete a documentary film concerning the impact of oil production on the Niger Delta. They were detained by the Nigerian military on April 12 while in the Niger Delta region and later transferred from military custody to the State Security Service in Abuja.
