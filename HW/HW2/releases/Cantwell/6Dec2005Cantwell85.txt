SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DOE'S WINTER FUEL PRICE FORECAST
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement on the Department of Energy's December forecast of winter fuel prices, released Tuesday:  
   "Winter means lower temperatures across our state and higher natural gas bills for households and schools. Nationwide, household heating costs are up 26 percent, and households heating primarily with natural gas will likely spend $281 more for fuel, 38 percent more than last year. "High heating costs are maxing out school budgets and forcing educators to debate between paying energy bills and buying school books for children. By not acting on this growing problem, the administration is literally leaving teachers, children, families and seniors in the cold. When energy prices are still out of control and far too many Americans can't afford to heat their homes in the face of rising winter heating costs, America has the right to expect leadership from our president." 
   Three times this fall, Cantwell joined a bipartisan group of senators to add $3.1 billion in additional funding for low income home heating assistance, which was left drastically under funded in the president's budget request. Each time, the measure failed to get the necessary 60 votes needed to enable hundreds of eligible families to get the help they need this winter.
