LEADING THE FIGHT TO STOP AN END RUN AROUND THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT
  Senator Maria Cantwell's Weekly Memo
   Recently I told you about my concerns that Department of Energy (DOE) officials and a few members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have teamed up to try to rewrite the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  
 For years, DOE has sought the authority to reclassify high-level nuclear waste as "incidental" waste. This would relieve DOE of its obligation to dispose of radioactive nuclear waste in sites such as Hanford. Instead, DOE would leave an indeterminate amount of this waste in the leaky tanks, attempting to seal them with a mix of sand, cement and grout - a solution rejected by scientists for the last 50 years. Considering that more than 1.1 million people live down river from Hanford in both Washington and Oregon, this is a reckless proposal. Moreover, last year, federal courts found that DOE's plan violated the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
   Last week, I continued to fight their sneak attack on the Senate floor, by introducing legislation to omit the proposed change. Although my amendment was narrowly defeated on a tie vote, 48-48, I'm not going to give up. Many of you have helped call attention to this problem: more than 6,000 Americans, including people from all 50 states, have signed a petition on my web site calling on Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Senate leaders not to cut corners on nuclear waste cleanup. As I continue this effort, I'll be sure to keep you updated on our progress, and let you know what you can do to help.
