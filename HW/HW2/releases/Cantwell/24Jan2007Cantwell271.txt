SEN. CANTWELL RESPONDS TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following response to President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday evening:  
   On Energy: 
   "I'm glad the president mentioned biofuels in his speech. Washington state is already a leader when it comes to alternative fuel development and we've waited six long years for the aggressive new incentives needed to really get our biofuels industry off the ground and break America's oil addiction. The new Congress will pass comprehensive energy independence legislation this year to put our country firmly on the path to energy independence." 
   On Iraq: 
   "We need an aggressive strategy to get the rest of the international community involved and a Dayton-like summit with Iraq and its neighbors to push for a political solution. Our strategy must be to significantly change the course by implementing a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces and ensuring that the Iraqi government takes control of the country's security. 
   "The Iraqis must pass an oil law and take other steps critical to achieving a political solution for the disputes between the Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds. Congress will be holding the president more accountable for what happens in Iraq."
