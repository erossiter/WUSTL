SEN. CANTWELL: SENATE APPROVES $1.5 MILLION FOR MT. RAINIER NATIONAL PARK EXPANSION
  Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.5 million she had requested to acquire land along the Carbon River within the recently expanded boundaries of Mt. Rainier National Park. 
   "Mt Rainer is an icon of the Northwest and a defining image of Washington State," Cantwell said. "The recent devastating floods highlighted the importance of this expansion in maintaining visitor access and economic activity around Mt Rainier's northwest entrance. Many generations of Americans have enjoyed this regional symbol, and this expansion will ensure even more generations to come will be able to take part in its beauty. 
   This funding will expand the Mt. Rainier National Park by 200 acres, including a mile of the Carbon River that provides habitat for salmon, steelhead and other native species in the Northwest. The expansion area will also provide room for a new visitor's center and campsites to replace facilities washed out during last year's tremendous floods. 
   This is the second phase of acquiring lands in the 800-acre expansion area, which was established by Cantwell's Mt. Rainier National Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 2004.
