SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement in celebration of Women's History Month:  
   "As we celebrate Women's History this month, we reflect on the work of so many women in the life of our nation who have worked to make it a better place. From Sacajawea to Amelia Earhart to Madeleine Albright, American history is filled with women whose lives stir us to action, inspire us to new heights and offer hope to all. Generations of American women have served as pioneers--redefining the role, rights and reach of women in our country. From these bold women, we have much to learn. 
   "As activists, artists, soldiers, scientists, mothers, educators, entrepreneurs, community leaders and in countless other ways, women have shaped our great nation and its values--making their mark by struggle, strength, and perseverance. Many have earned great praise and well-deserved fame; many more have labored tirelessly as unsung heroes. More than 150 years ago, Sojourner Truth addressed a women's convention and said 'If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again!' Together, we find strength in our proud history and justice in our drive to make the world right."
