SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF LOW POWER FM
  "Five years ago today, the Federal Communications Commission authorized the creation of a new class of FM radio stations.  
   "These low powered radio stations play an important role because they bring a diversity of voices to the airwaves. In a democratic society, everyone's better off when there's greater access to the marketplace of ideas. 
   "That's why it is so unfortunate that, in 2001, Congress inserted a rider in a spending bill to roll back the FCC's decision. This misguided rider has made it nearly impossible for these affordable, community-oriented radio stations to gain a foothold in some of our largest media markets. 
   "That's why, last year, I co-sponsored legislation to roll back the rider and reinstate the FCC's rule, making it easier for these low powered stations to exist. 
   "In an age of mass media consolidation, I think it's important to continue to fight for the diversity of voices on our nation's airwaves. That's why we will continue to fight for the low powered FM legislation, and hopefully pass it through Congress this year."
