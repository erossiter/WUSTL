SEN. CANTWELL CRITICIZES FEDERAL PROPOSAL TO CLOSE SPOKANE AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER AT NIGHT
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to abandon its proposal that would leave the Spokane International Airport Control Tower unmanned between midnight and 5 a.m. According to Sen.  
 Cantwell, the ill-advised plan would severely hamper air ambulance services and emergency jet landings, and remove an important asset for Fairchild Air Force Base. 
   "Meeting homeland security and airplane safety challenges is not a part - time job; it requires a full - time commitment," Cantwell said. "We need to be prepared 24 hours-a-day to safely mobilize and land our military planes and not jeopardize the safety of air travelers."Because of Spokane 's all-weather instrument landing system, the airport receives flights at all hours of the night that have been redirected from Seattle and Portland . In addition, the control tower supports North west MedStar 's round-the-clock air ambulance service. According to Cantwell, the proposal is especially disturbing because the federal government has made significant investments in the ongoing construction of a new control tower, which will serve both the airport and Fairchild. 
   Cantwell expressed her concerns in a letter (attached) to FAA Commissioner Marion Blakey with Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Rep. Cathy McMorris (R-Wash.) and Rep. C.L. "Butch" Otter (R-Idaho).
