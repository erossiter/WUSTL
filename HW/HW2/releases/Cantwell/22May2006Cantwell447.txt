SEN. CANTWELL ANNOUNCES OVER HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT FOR WASHINGTON STATE'S FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sunday, the day after National Police Week, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined members of the Normandy Park Police Department to announce more than $600,000 in U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) equipment grants for first responders across Washington state. 
   "We need to make sure all our communities - including smaller communities and those in rural areas - have efficient, effective emergency response," said Cantwell. "This equipment will help police and fire departments in small communities all across our state do the job they were trained to do as effectively as possible. Our state's first responders do an amazing job and put their lives on the line every day to keep us, our children, and our communities safe and secure. We owe them the support and tools they need to do the job."  
   The funding announced by Cantwell and distributed through the DHS Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP) was approved by Congress as part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. CEDAP provides smaller law enforcement and emergency response agencies with equipment that will enhance emergency response and improve their ability to assist and communicate with other agencies at all levels of government. The program includes training in conjunction with all new equipment, and covers costs associated with training sessions. 
   The $623,412 in grants announced today will help 41 smaller agencies gain cutting-edge equipment, such as tools to extract victims from vehicle accidents, thermal imagers and night vision equipment, GPS tracking devices, and technology to clarify grainy surveillance video. 
   "Partnerships like this have a tremendous impact," said Normand Park Police Chief Rick Kieffer. "By working with our representatives in Washington, D.C., smaller local agencies can get important equipment they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. We work closely with all police agencies in King County, and would gladly go out and assist any of them with this new equipment. This is a win for everyone involved and I want to thank Senator Cantwell for her great work on behalf of Washington's police officers." 
   The Normandy Park Police Department will receive a thermal imager, purchased by DHS for $13,020. The device will allow officers to see hiding suspects, find missing people in the dark, locate activity on the water at night, and detect the source of an explosion or fire in a building. The Normandy Park Police Department belongs to a coalition of small King County police agencies. Member departments share information and equipment, meaning that other departments will also benefit from the device. The coalition includes the communities of Normandy Park, Lake Forest Park, Black Diamond, Enumclaw, Issaquah, Carnation, Duvall, Algona, Pacific, Mercer Island, Snoqualmie, Medina, Clyde Hill, and Yarrow Point. In addition to sharing resources with members of this coalition, the Normand Park Police Department works closely with all of King County's law enforcement agencies to share resources and information to better serve the citizens of King County. 
   Sunday, in observance of National Police Week, Cantwell also extended her thanks to the many police officers working tirelessly to keep Washington's communities safe. 
   "National Police week is an important time for us to thank our nation's law enforcement officers for their unending courage and sense of duty, and to remember those we have lost," said Cantwell. "Our gratitude extends far beyond this one week. Local, state, and federal law enforcement officers represent the very best of America, and I offer my thanks to the men and women who wake up everyday, put on a uniform, and set out to make our country an even better place." 
   First observed in 1962, National Police Week takes place each year during the week that includes May 15. This year, police week began on Sunday May 14, and ended yesterday, Saturday May 20. 
   Cantwell has worked continuously to support first responders and increase the funding and resources available to smaller agencies and those in rural areas. This week, the Senate is considering legislation that includes Cantwell's measures to help border communities cover the cost of prosecuting and detaining individuals suspected of border crimes. Currently, the high costs associated with these activities are weighing down small communities along America's northern border. Modeled on an existing program for the southern border, Cantwell's proposal would authorize almost $30 million annually to reimburse border communities for the cost of prosecuting cases, detaining suspects, and constructing holding spaces. 
   Cantwell has also fought to maintain funding for other important law enforcement programs, including the Urban Area Security Initiative, Emergency Management Performance Grants, Port Security Grants, Fire Act Grants, and SAFER Act Grants, and will work to secure additional funding for CEDAP, which is currently a pilot program. Earlier this year, Cantwell worked with her colleagues to include the Combat Meth Act and other anti-meth measures in legislation to re-authorize the Patriot Act. This new law authorizes $99 million for the Meth Hot Spots program, which provides grants to states and communities to clean up meth labs, purchase equipment, and train state and local law enforcement officials to investigate and convict meth offenders.
