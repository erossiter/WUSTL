SEN. CANTWELL ENCOURAGES U.S. MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY HOPEFULS TO APPLY FOR NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) is encouraging interested high school seniors to apply for her nomination to the United States Military Service Academies.  
   "We are looking for strong, smart young leaders who will represent the best Washington state has to offer," Cantwell said. "The military service academy application process is a rigorous one, but successful candidates will be rewarded with a top-shelf education."
   Every year, Cantwell recommends students to one of four service academies: West Point, The Naval Academy, The Air Force Academy, or the Merchant Marine Academy. Interested students should first contact the academy to set up an applicant file. The student should then apply for a recommendation from Cantwell, Sen. Patty Murray, and their congressional representative. 
   Applications are reviewed by an independent panel of Military Service Academy alumni. The panel looks for individuals who demonstrate strong leadership skills, academic achievement, athletic ability, and strength of character. Recommendations are made to the senator for her final selection. 
   Cantwell is able to nominate ten Washington state residents to each academy. 
   To request an application, please contact Lee Lambert in Cantwell's Seattle office at 1-888-648-7328 , or visit the senator's website at http://cantwell.senate.gov/services/academy.html. 
   Applications for Cantwell's recommendation are due by 5:30 p.m. on November 18, 2005.
