PROVIDING VICTIMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH TOOLS TO COMBAT IDENTITY THEFT
  Senator Maria Cantwell's Weekly Memo 
   On Friday, consumers and law enforcement gained a new tool to fight identity theft - the nation's fastest-growing crime - as an important provision of my identity theft legislation took effect.  
 The provision allows victims of identity theft, and those they "deputize" in law enforcement, to receive records related to their identity theft directly from businesses. This will simplify and speed up law enforcement investigations and will enhance the ability of authorities to solve cases of identity theft and related crimes across state lines. 
   According to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington state ranked tenth nationally in 2003 in per capita reports of identity theft, and a study by the Identity Theft Research Center observed that there may be as many seven to ten million victims of identity theft nationwide. Now, we've got one more weapon in the arsenal to fight identity theft. This national legislation will help protect consumers from becoming victims of identity theft and it will help victims of identity theft reclaim their identity. Just as importantly, it gives law enforcement another tool to bring identity thieves to justice.
