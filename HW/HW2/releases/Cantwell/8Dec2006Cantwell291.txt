SENATE PASSES SEN. CANTWELL-BACKED LEGISLATION TO GIVE TRIBES ACCESS TO ANTI-METH FUNDS
Friday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) applauded the Senate's unanimous approval of legislation to give tribes with law enforcement capacity access to two vital anti-meth grant programs. Congress approved funding for the Meth Hot Spots Program and the Drug-Endangered Children Program earlier this year as part of legislation to re-authorize the Patriot Act, but failed to list tribes as possible recipients of grants under the programs. The Native American Methamphetamine bill, introduced by Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and John McCain (R-AZ) and backed by Cantwell, would guarantee tribes access to both programs. The legislation must still pass the House of Representatives.  
 "Indian country faces a growing meth epidemic with devastating consequences," said Cantwell, a member of the Indian Affairs Committee. "Today's action will help open important anti-meth programs to tribes, and will help stop meth-production, meth-trafficking, and meth-related crimes on tribal lands across our country. We must redouble our efforts to aid tribal governments and local law enforcement in their fight against this dangerous, debilitating drug." 
 The re-authorization of the Patriot Act authorized new funding for three grant programs within the Department of Justice: the COPS Hot Spots program, the Drug-Endangered Children program, and the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders program. 
 Specifically, the Patriot Act: 
 * Authorized $99 million for the COPS Hot Spots Grant Program, which provides grants to states and communities to clean up meth labs, purchase equipment, and train state and local law enforcement officials to investigate and convict meth offenders. Tribes were not included as eligible applicants. 
 * -Authorized $20 million for a Drug-Endangered Children Grant Program to help children found on meth sites. Tribes were not included as eligible applicants. 
 * Authorized funding for the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders Grant Program to reduce the use of drugs by pregnant women and those with dependent children. Tribes were included as eligible applicants, but clarifying language is needed to ensure that there is adequate coordination with tribal service providers. 
 The Native American Methamphetamine bill, passed by the Senate Friday, would ensure that tribes can apply for funding under all three of these programs.
