SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAILED CHIP VETO OVERRIDE
  Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) made the following statement today after the House failed to override the president's veto of the children's health bill. The legislation would have provided nearly 10 million children with health care coverage through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The statement follows: 
  "I am disappointed that this bipartisan, cost-effective plan to provide health care coverage to millions of children was defeated by political maneuvering. Unfortunately, too many Republicans in the House have put their loyalty to Bush ahead of the needs of kids. 
  "A strong majority of the American public and Congress support this plan, but the president and his allies have chosen to oppose it and deny millions of children the health care they need to have a healthy start in life.
  "America's families deserve better. I will continue to look at different vehicles so we can do the right thing and prevent the number of uninsured children in this nation from growing."
