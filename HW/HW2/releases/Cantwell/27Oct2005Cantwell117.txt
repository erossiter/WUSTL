SEN. CANTWELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON HARRIET MIERS WITHDRAWAL
  Protecting an American's privacy is the biggest issue of the 21st century, from medical records to personal financial records, from what companies do with our personal information to what we do in our own homes.  
 The next Court will struggle to protect civil rights and liberties in our society. I hope the President chooses someone who shows a respect for our fundamental constitutional right of privacy. 
   I hope the President will send a new nominee who clearly states her beliefs in an American's right to privacy because it will be at the core of many of the Court's decisions. President Bush should consider a qualified woman, as women bring important perspectives to all the issues the Court considers. 
   I urge the President to seek the perspective of a bipartisan group of Senators in choosing the new nominee. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to assure that the next Supreme Court justice is qualified and has appropriate judicial temperament to merit being placed on the high court.
