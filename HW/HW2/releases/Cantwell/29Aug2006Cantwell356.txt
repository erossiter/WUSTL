SEN. CANTWELL COMMENTS ON HURRICANE KATRINA ANNIVERSARY
  Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.  
   "One year ago, Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath brought unimaginable loss and terrible devastation to New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast region. A year later, the people of the Gulf Coast are only now beginning to recover. 
   "We must continue to demand leadership. Across the region, many people are working to rebuild their homes and families. But we have so much work still left to do and in too many communities the absence of progress is appalling. "When I traveled to the Gulf Coast a few months ago, I visited with so many people struggling just to get back on their feet. To replace their despair with hope and bring the region back to life, we must collaborate beyond traditional boundaries and provide critical resources, organization, and infrastructure. "In the U.S. Senate, I will continue fighting to make sure we confront these challenges quickly and hold all agencies accountable for meeting their responsibilities. For New Orleans and our nation to thrive again, we must take a sober look at the conditions ahead, plan honestly and openly for a better future, then work together to make it a reality."
