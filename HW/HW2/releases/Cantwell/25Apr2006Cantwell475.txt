   "On Yom Ha'Shoah, this solemn Holocaust Remembrance Day, we reflect on the six million Jewish men, women, and children who were systematically murdered by Nazi hands. We recall remarkable acts of bravery, perseverance, and faith performed by so many forced to live their final days in darkness. We celebrate the spirit of those who resisted, those who fought, and those who survived. And we pause today in remembrance - honoring the dead and pledging never to forget the atrocities of the past."
