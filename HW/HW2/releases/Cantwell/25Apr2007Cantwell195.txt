COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. CANTWELL LEGISLATION TO FIX DEEPWATER
  Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee approved Sen. Maria Cantwell's plan to fix Deepwater. The legislation has been endorsed by Taxpayers for Common Sense, Citizens Against Government Waste, and the National Taxpayers Union because of the comprehensive accountability and transparency measures it includes, and the steps it would take end the waste of taxpayer dollars.

   "It is absolutely essential we get this right, and we can't get Deepwater back on its feet without strong transparency, reliable oversight, and open competition," said Cantwell, Chair of the Senate Coast Guard Subcommittee. "The men and women of our Coast Guard deserve the best equipment money can buy, and taxpayers have a right to know that their tax dollars are spent wisely and efficiently. Deepwater has failed on both these points. It needs the serious, systemic overhaul called for in my bill." 
   Cantwell's legislation, approved by the Commerce Committee Wednesday and now ready for consideration by the full Senate, is cosponsored by Subcommittee Ranking Member Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The bill would ensure open competition for future Deepwater contracts, end Coast Guard reliance on a single private sector entity to oversee the entire project, and mandate better technical oversight by Coast Guard engineering staff. It would also improve internal Coast Guard management of Deepwater, enhance transparency, and initiate an analysis of all alternatives for proposed Deepwater assets not currently under contract to determine the best way forward.
