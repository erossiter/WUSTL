SEN. CANTWELL CALLS NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE TROUBLING
  Wednesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement on the National Intelligence Estimate:  
   "The key judgments in the National Intelligence Estimate are troubling. It is especially disturbing to hear that terrorist threats to U.S. interests at home and abroad may become more diverse, leading to increasing attacks worldwide. 
   "We need a new direction in Iraq to end rising violence. The president needs a plan to help the Iraqis reach a political settlement of their differences and to achieve more progress in taking control of their own security. The United States should be leading international efforts to promote Iraqi stability, so that Iraq can no longer be considered a 'cause celebre for jihadists."
