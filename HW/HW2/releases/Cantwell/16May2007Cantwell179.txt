COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. CANTWELL'S PLAN THAT COULD DOUBLE BUDGET FOR COMPOSITES RESEARCH, TRAINING CENTER
  Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a measure introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that doubles the authorized funding level for the University of Washington and Edmonds Community College composites research and training center. This Center of Excellence, which Cantwell helped create, is helping to reinforce Washington state's leadership role on composites and other new manufacturing materials.  
   "Composites are key to keeping our economy strong and preserving our state's place at the cutting edge of innovation," said Cantwell. "This Center of Excellence boasts the nation's best composites workforce training program, and leads the way on new groundbreaking advancement. A funding boost will not only mean a stronger aerospace industry, it will reinforce our entire Northwest manufacturing sector." 
   Cantwell's legislation, included in the 2007 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill, would double the center's annual authorized funding level from $500,000 to $1 million. It would also extend authorization through 2012. The FAA Reauthorization bill was passed by the Commerce Committee Wednesday and is now ready for consideration by the full Senate. The legislation also includes Cantwell-sponsored provisions to: 
   * Improve safety on medical helicopters 
   * Help enable Unmanned Arial Vehicles to fly safely in our airspace for commercial use 
   * Increase the number of slots for planes at Washington National Airport in Washington, DC 
   * Create a pilot project to encourage cooperation between airports and surrounding communities for redevelopment of land in high-noise areas 
   Washington's composites expertise is currently helping to make Boeing's 787 aircraft a success. Composites also play a key role in new fuel efficient big-rig trucks developed by Bellevue-based PACCAR and armor for our troops developed by Armor Systems International in Vancouver. According to Boeing, as much as 50 percent of the 787's primary structure will be made of composites, allowing the aircraft to use 20 percent less fuel than today's similarly sized airplane. Advanced materials like composites currently represent a $25 billion-a-year global industry with tremendous growth prospects. 
   Soon after taking office, Cantwell passed legislation as part of a previous FAA reauthorization bill creating a Center of Excellence for applied research and training in advanced materials. Established in 2003, the University of Washington portion of the center specializes in research, while the Edmonds Community College portion specializes in workforce training. The Edmonds Community College Advanced Materials Science program is the nation's foremost composites workforce training program. 
   The Center of Excellence at UW and ECC is made up of business, academic, and government interests working to coordinate research efforts and encourage the broader use of advanced structural materials, including composites and aluminum alloys, in future aircraft like the 787.
