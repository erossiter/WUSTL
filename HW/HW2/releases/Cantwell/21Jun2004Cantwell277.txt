STANDING UP FOR HANFORD WORKERS
  In a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week, I questioned Department of Energy (DOE) Assistant Secretary Jessie Roberson about changes in the pension plan for some Hanford workers.  
 DOE has introduced plans for a new, two-tiered pension system that requires companies that win contracts to contribute to the current pension plan only for the first five years of the contract. After that, the system changes to a market-based plan under which the contractor has no obligation to continue contributing to the workers' pensions. I secured a pledge from Roberson to meet with me and follow up on my objections to this plan. Employees who have worked for years at Hanford shouldn't be left out in the cold.
