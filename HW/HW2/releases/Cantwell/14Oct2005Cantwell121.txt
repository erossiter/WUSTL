SEN. CANTWELL FIGHTS FOR TOUGHER SEX OFFENDER TRACKING LAWS
  Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined a bipartisan effort to strengthen the laws protecting children from sex offenders. Legislation cosponsored by Cantwell would link state tracking systems and create a national sex offender database to prevent sex offenders from escaping tracking systems through a move to another state. The bill would also put in place stronger, nationwide registration standards, and provide additional tools to law enforcement officers working to keep our communities safe.  
   "Communities need to be protected against sex offenders," said Cantwell. "I can think of no worse crime than one against a child. This bill will protect local communities and will help make sure we always know where sexual predators are. Over 18,000 registered sex offenders reside in Washington state, and keeping track of where these criminals are is critical in protecting children everywhere." 
   The legislation supported by Cantwell would expand the scope and duration of sex offender registration and notification requirements, and, through the creation of searchable internet databases, would make sure citizens always have access to accurate and up-to-date information about sex offenders in or near their community. 
   "If this bill becomes law, it will be easier for law enforcement and communities to share information about sex offenders across state lines, and sex offenders will face tougher sentences for these heinous crimes" said Cantwell. 
   Cantwell is joining Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to push for immediate passage of "The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act." 
   Key components of "The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act": 
   * Requires that sex offenders register prior to release from prison or supervised programs (current federal law requires registration after release) 
   - Requires that a sex offender register and update their registry in person at a state designated office twice a year, and every three months if the offender is a sexually violent predator 
   - Mandates that first time sex offenders remain registered for 20 years, and requires second time offenders and sexually violent offenders to remain registered for the rest of their lives 
   * Mandates that any change of status requiring a registry update, such as a change of address or employment, must be made 3 days after the change occurs (the current standard is 10 days), and requires a sex offender's photograph and fingerprints be updated once each year 
   - Makes failing to register or updating registry information a federal felony, or a deportable offense 
   - Requires a first-time sex offender to wear a tracking device for the duration of their supervised release, and requires a second-time offenders and sexually violent predators to wear the device for the rest of their lives 
   - Links State Registries so that an offense committed in one state does not go unrecognized in another, and requires states, not just local governments, to maintain a searchable sex offender registry 
   - Provides funding for law enforcement to initiate programs to identify sex predators currently in jail 
   * Requires federal officials to send out immediate notification of a sex offender's intent to move to a new state 
   Establishes a new federally maintained sex offender DNA database to be used by law enforcement and prosecutors, and directs the U.S. Attorney General, in consultation with the states, to develop a national sex offender registry.
