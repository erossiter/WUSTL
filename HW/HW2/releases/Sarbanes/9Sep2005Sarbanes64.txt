SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR SAFE SCHOOLS IN SOMERSET COUNTY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that the United States Department of Education is providing Somerset County Public Schools a grant totaling $1,212,053 under the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Grant Program.  
   The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Justice and is geared towards promoting healthy childhood development and preventing violence and alcohol and other drug abuse. The Initiative draws on the best practices of education, justice, social services, and mental health systems to provide integrated and comprehensive resources for prevention programs and prosocial services for students. 
   Recipients of this funding design plans to provide students, schools and families with a network of effective services, supports and activities that help students develop the skills and emotional resilience necessary to foster positive mental health and prevent violent behavior and drug use. 
   "Education is a cornerstone of our society and our students deserve a safe and healthy environment in which to learn and grow," said Sarbanes. "This grant will allow Somerset County educators to cultivate and promote a positive setting for our young people to flourish and develop into successful citizens." 
   "We as a nation must do all we can to make sure no child should is left out or left behind. We must create a safe environment for young students to succeed," said Senator Mikulski. "Throughout my career I have fought to ensure children have the resources they need, and I congratulate Somerset County on being awarded this well-deserved money."
