SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE GRANT TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES IN GARRETT COUNTY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced the awarding of a $1 million Rural Business Enterprise Grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission to the Garrett County Commissioners to help design and build a multi-purpose trade/enterprise center in Garrett County. 
   Specifically, this project will assist small and emerging business enterprises by providing the county with a facility to host trade shows, exhibits, and cultural activities, as well as a facility for local artisans, craft persons, and specialty product entrepreneurs to display and sell local products.
   "This grant will help to serve two purposes," said Sarbanes. "First, with a County unemployment rate of over 8%, this center will be a catalyst to showcase new small businesses and job opportunities throughout the Western Maryland region. And secondly, the craftspeople and artisans, as well as the entrepreneurs, will have a showcase to display their wares and their talents, providing them an opportunity to enhance their economic well-being."
   "This $1 million is a federal investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Garrett County," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I know how important small businesses are to the health of the economy and to the communities that they serve. That's why I'm so proud of this federal investment in Western Maryland."
