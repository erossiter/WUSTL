SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE APPROVAL OF HIGHWAY, MASS TRANSIT PROJECTS FOR WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that agreement has been reached on a new six-year transportation bill that provides $2.9 billion in federal highway funds and over $900 million in dedicated mass transit funding for the State of Maryland over the six-year period.
   "This is a major victory for the transportation network in the Washington Metropolitan area, and particularly the inclusion of more than $100 million for the purchase of new subway cars for the Metro system," said Sarbanes, who served as a member of the Conference Committee that helped to prioritize the projects in the final authorization bill. "This will help ease congestion, alleviate bottlenecks and is forward thinking for our future mass transit and highway needs. I am pleased that we have been so successful in securing this much-needed money for the State of Maryland over the next six years." 
   "I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes to put money in the federal checkbook for Maryland public transit systems," said Senator Mikulski. "I'm pleased that this bill provides much needed funding for the Washington Metro to purchase additional rail cars. Facing record high ridership and homeland security challenges, these funds will go a long way in ensuring a better Metro system for our region. That means safer and faster commutes to work, better air quality, jobs today and jobs tomorrow. Marylanders can count on me to continue to work in the Senate to keep them on the move."
   Included in the multi-year spending bill are the following priority projects:
   MASS TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS, NEW PROJECTS:
   * Almost $100 million for the purchase of 52 new rail cars for the Washington Metrorail system. The funding will enable the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to purchase up to 120 new rail cars and improve facilities. The purchase of these additional rail cars will help alleviate the severe overcrowding that the Metrorail system is currently experiencing. WMATA has experienced 33 percent in ridership growth over the past eight years and currently carries an average of 660,000 persons a day. The new cars will enable WMATA to lengthen trains from 6 cars to 8 cars on one-third of the Metrorail system. With the new cars, WMATA will be able to move an additional 14,000 people per hour;
   * $21 million to complete Phase 2 of the Silver Spring Transit Center, a multi-modal facility to expand and modernize the existing 30 year old transit center that is the busiest transit center in the WMATA system. The Silver Spring Transit Center is a planned $75 million, public-private development project which will consist of a new three-tier inter-modal transit center to link buses, taxis, Metrorail and MARC trains and sidewalk, street and public open space improvements;
   * The Gaithersburg Upcounty Senior Center is one of only four full-service senior centers in Montgomery County. Many participants in the Center rely on the City's "senior bus" for transportation to and from their homes to the Center. The existing bus must be replaced and the funds provided with enable the City to purchase a new 35-passenger, fully-equipped bus with handicapped lift, kneeler function. Federal funds will pay for $112,000 of the total $140,000; 
   * Bi-County Transitway (Purple Line). Authorizes the Bi-County Transitway, otherwise known as the Purple Line, connecting Bethesda to Silver Spring and extending to the New Carrollton Metrorail station. Funds are allocated to complete the planning and environmental phases of the project. The costs of final design, right of way and construction are to be determined. Total project costs will depend on the outcome of the current studies. Preliminary cost estimates of the 14-mile transitway range from $360 million to $1.6 billion, depending on alignment and modes. The project will provide connectivity and relief to traffic congestion as well as improve air quality within Montgomery and Prince George's Counties;
   * Corridor Cities Transitway, Montgomery County. The project is being designed to provide relief to traffic congestion and improve air quality along the I-270 corridor. It is also expected to help connect new predominantly high-tech employment centers and mix-use developments to the Washington Metrorail and MARC Commuter rail systems. The alignment currently being studied is from Shady Grove to Clarksburg, a distance of 14 miles. Completion of the study and environmental documentation phase is estimated to cost $11 million. The State of Maryland plans to continue study of this project with final design and construction to commence within the fiscal years 2007 - 2010. Preliminary cost estimates depending on mode and alignment range from $416 million to $732 million;
   * Woodrow Wilson Bridge Transit Project. Authorizes funding for alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering of a transit route over the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge which would connect the Metrorails' Green Line Branch Avenue Station and the Yellow Line Eisenhower Station. The new Woodrow Wilson Bridge was designed to accommodate future rail transit and two of its 12 lanes will be dedicated to either mass transit or high occupancy vehicles. Rail service in the bridge corridor (from Branch Avenue in Maryland to Alexandria, Virginia) is included in WMATA's 2025 Transit Service Expansion Plan, but before rail transit could be implemented, additional studies and engineering are required; and 
   * Maryland Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Provides $25 million to improve bus facilities and replace bus vehicles throughout the State of Maryland, including locally operated, small urban and rural transit systems. Half of Maryland's Mass Transit Administration's fleet has been in operation since 1990 and is in dire need of replacement. All 23 counties in Maryland, as well as the Cities of Annapolis, Ocean City, are eligible to receive fund for locally operated transit systems.
   ALLEVIATE BOTTLENECKS AND IMPROVE HIGHWAYS:
   * Through the efforts of the Sarbanes and Mikulski, as well as Congressmen Steny Hoyer and Albert Wynn, a total of $15 million has been earmarked for the construction of an interchange at MD Route 4 and Suitland Parkway. It will also allow for the construction of one general use lane in each direction for 1 mile on MD 4. Project will improve access to Andrews Air Force Base (AAFB) and will improve access to military bases in Southern, as well as ease traffic congestion in one of the fastest growing population areas in the State of Maryland. Work is part of the overall upgrade of MD 4, from MD 223 to I-95/I-495 which has been divided into three interchange projects. Total project cost is $77.26 million;
   * $5 million to support construction of a Branch Avenue Metro Station access road; flyover ramp from the inner loop of the I-495 Beltway to southbound MD 5. Estimated cost of project is $80.4 million. This project will provide a long-term solution to traffic congestion in the vicinity of the Branch Avenue Metro Station. (Congressman Albert Wynn obtained $3.2 million in the House for this project); 
   * As part of the Town Center redevelopment project, the City of Rockville is in the process of building or modifying 6 streets to create a transit accessible and pedestrian friendly urban core with job growth and retail and entertainment options. The allocation of $4 million in funding will be used for the construction of the Maryland Avenue and Market Street Intermodal access project and will include pedestrian safety improvements in the Baltimore Road corridor. (Congressman Van Hollen obtained $3.2 million in funding in the House for this project);
   * $2 million for roadway improvements from the intersection of US 29 in Montgomery County along Industrial Parkway through to the Food and Drug Administration access at Cherry Hill Road. Funds would be used to provide roadway improvements to the planned new East County Center for Science and Technology - a business incubator facility of mixed lab and office space in Eastern Montgomery County. Located near the consolidated FDA campus in the White Oak/Silver Spring area, the new Center, which is modeled after the Shady Grove Life Sciences Center in the I-270 corridor, will help facilitate synergies for businesses serving the FDA; 
   QUALITY OF LIFE, PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENTS, STATE ENHANCEMENTS:
   * Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge Road improvements in Laurel - $3 million. Funds will be used to repair and resurface roads on the North Tract of the refuge. Since transfer of the 8100 acres from Fort Meade in 1991, the condition of the roads in the refuge has drastically deteriorated and there are numerous potholes making bicycling and driving in the refuge hazardous; 
   * Woodrow Wilson Bridge wetlands mitigation/Anacostia River restoration, Prince George's County - $1.6 million. The project will enhance 15 acres of degraded tidal marsh along the Anacostia River, as well as the remediation of an old landfill on the site to restore an additional 15 acres of tidal wetlands. The project site is located in Prince Georges County, Maryland, just upstream from the New York Avenue Bridge. The remedial action would require moving the existing rubble landfill to an upland portion of the site, planting wetland plants, and restoring tidal exchange to the former marsh now buried by the landfill; and
   * Potomac Gorge Restoration Demonstration Project: $500,000 would be used mitigate Federal roads-related environmental degradation in the Potomac Gorge area of the Washington, D.C. metro region by mapping and controlling invasive species that are spread by roads; and developing improved floodplain maps for flood emergency preparedness to protect parks and other Federal and county roads and other infrastructure.
