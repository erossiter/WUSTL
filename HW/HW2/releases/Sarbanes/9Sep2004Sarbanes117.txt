SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that 3 organizations throughout the Washington D.C. metro area were among 38 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 38 Maryland recipients this year.  
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "The Small Watershed Grants are a federal investment in helping communities protect and preserve the Bay."
   Those Washington D.C. metro area projects receiving funding are:
   * The Friends of the Beaverdam Watershed in Prince George's County will receive $8,100 to conduct outreach and remove invasive species from Woodworth Park, which surrounds a 1,700 ft. section of the Lower Beaverdam Creek. A brochure with a map of the mini-watershed, with locations of storm water inlets which drain into the stream, will be distributed to watershed residents; 
   * The City of Bowie will use $25,000 to retrofit two adjacent City parking lots to filter storm water runoff into an existing wetland. They will remove the asphalt, replace it with permeable concrete pavers, and install a bio-retention cell and plant significant landscaping, including trees. Educational signage will be installed to educate the community on the retrofits and benefits to water quality; and
   * The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin will establish a citizen's watershed organization for the protection and restoration of the Rock Creek watershed. Three public education meetings on Rock Creek watershed issues will be held to recruit volunteers to start the watershed organization.
