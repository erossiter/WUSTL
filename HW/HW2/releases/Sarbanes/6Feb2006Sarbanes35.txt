SEN. SARBANES ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S FY2007 BUDGET
  "The budget presented by President Bush today is just more of the same mismatched priorities - more deficits, more cuts to critically needed programs that benefit hard working Americans, and more tax cut giveaways to the wealthiest in our society.
   "I remain very concerned that his escalating budget deficit is going to have serious consequences on the health of our economy. His deficit for this year alone grows by more than $100 billion, and over the long term, his budget ignores significant costs, such as realistic assumptions about funding to sustain American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. This fiscal irresponsibility must end but this budget presented today is more of the smoke and mirrors that we have come to expect from this Bush Administration." 
   The President's budget cuts Chesapeake Bay Clean Up funding by more than $20 million. These cuts include:
   * Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which provides assistance to state and local governments to upgrade sewage treatment plants is cut from FY 06 level of $887 million to $688 million. Since Fiscal 2001, the Clean Water SRF has been cut by 50%. Maryland received $32.5 million in Fiscal 2001. Under President's proposed budget MD would receive $20.5 million - cut of $4.8 million from Fiscal 2006 and of $12 million from Fiscal 01. In addition, direct grants for upgrading sewage treatment plants in Maryland for Biological Nutrient Removal or to address combined sewer overflows are eliminated. In FY 06 Congress provided more than $2.3 million to upgrade the sewage treatment plants in Maryland. Total cut for the Bay area states of MD, VA, PA and DC is $17.8 million from FY 06 level and $58.8 million since FY 01; 
   * EPA Chesapeake Bay Program would receive $20.4 million, a cut of $350,000 from Fiscal 06. President's budget provides $6 million for the Corisca River in Maryland, but eliminates the Chesapeake Bay Small watershed grants program ($2 million) and the Chesapeake Bay targeted watersheds program ($6 million). 
   Amtrak:
   * Unlike last year, when it tried to eliminate all federal funding for Amtrak, the Bush budget provides $900 million for Amtrak - $500 million in capital costs and $400 million in efficiency incentive grants, but the level is insufficient to prevent Amtrak from going bankrupt. Last year the congress provided $1.3 billion for Amtrak. 
   The President's proposed budget for HUD is also once again characterized by disinvestment in existing housing assets (e.g. public housing), elimination of reinvestment programs to create new assets (e.g. HOPE VI & Brownfields), and cuts in programs that provides housing, services, and a healthy home environment for millions of American households (elderly & disabled housing, and others). 
   Housing and HUD Cuts:
   * Elderly Housing (Section 202): $189 million cut (26%). [From $734.6 million to $544.5 million];
   * Disabled Housing (Section 811): $118 million cut (50%). [From $237 million to $119 million]. As last year, the Budget would eliminate all capital funding for the construction of new homes for the disabled, leaving them with vouchers only;
   * CDBG Block Grants. $736 million cut (20%). From $3.711 billion to $2.975 billion. The Administration will also propose a formula change that, it appears, will reduce or eliminate the access of wealthier communities to formula funds; 
   * Public Housing Capital: cut $261 million (11%), from $2.439 billion to $2.178 billion;
   * HOPE VI - eliminated in FY2007, and proposes to rescind the $99 million appropriated for FY 2006;
   * Lead Paint: $35 million cut (23%). From $150 million to $115 million;
   * Brownfields Redevelopment Grants: eliminated (was $10 m last year);
   * National Community Development Initiative (NCDI): eliminated (was $30 million last year). NCDI provides funds to LISC, Enterprise, and Habitat for Humanity to give technical assistance to small non-profits so that they can improve their delivery of housing and services in their communities. The program gets high marks from OMB;
   * Section 108 CDBG loans: eliminated. This very useful program allows local governments to borrow against future allocations to raise larger sums needed to fund larger projects. $4 million of credit subsidy supported $138 million in loans last year;
   * Urban Empowerment Zones: eliminated (also received no funding last year).
   Some examples of cuts at the National level that will affect the State of Maryland are as follows:
   The budget contains cuts in discretionary education funding of approximately $2.1 billion, for a total of $54.411 billion, a 3.8% cut. No Child Left Behind program is underfunded by $15.4 billion.
   It eliminates or significantly reduces 141 discretionary programs, and $65 billion over five-years by trimming the growth of entitlement programs, including $36 billion from Medicare. 
   It reduces funding for NIH again (like last year) seeking to cut NIH spending for the first time since 1970. The proposed total funding is $28.6 billion is a 2% cut from last year's level.
