SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN TOWN OF ACCIDENT
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has approved $250,000 in federal funds to repair and upgrade a failing sewer system in the Town of Accident.  
   Groundwater is currently entering the system and the existing treatment plant does not have the capability to handle the amount of flow now being collected. The ARC grant will be used to repair the collection lines, increase the plant's treatment capacity, and allow businesses to obtain necessary permits to accommodate expansion plans. Currently the Town has been under a Consent Order from the Maryland Department of the Environment and has not been allowed to add new sewer users to the existing system. 
   "These funds are critical in maintaining a clean, safe, and healthy water supply for the residents of the Town of Accident," said Sarbanes. "The Appalachian Regional Commission continues to provide the towns of Western Maryland with funding to enhance and upgrade their localities and I am pleased that we have been able to provide continued financial support to these local jurisdictions."
   "I am proud to work in the U.S. Senate to build communities. This federal investment of $250,000 for the town of Accident to improve their sewer system will do just that," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "Maryland cities and towns need to upgrade their water and sewer infrastructure but they can't do it on their own, and rate payers shouldn't have to bear the full burden. This grant is a double value for the taxpayer dollar, creating jobs while helping Accident grow."
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
