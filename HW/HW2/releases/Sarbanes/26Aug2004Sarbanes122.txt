SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO AID IN DEVELOPMENT OF GARRETT COUNTY BUSINESS PARK
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has approved a $442,955 grant to the Board of County Commissioners of Garrett County.  
 The federal funds, along with $110,740 from county sources, will be used to construct a local access road into the newly developed Keysers Ridge Business Park.
   The new road will run approximately 0.20 miles from U.S. Route 40 into and through the park and is vital to the park's development. It is estimated that 700 new jobs will be created once the park is fully operational.
   "These funds will help in the completion of a new comprehensive industrial park, which will serve as an incubator for job creation," said Sarbanes. "I'm glad to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job growth in our State's rural areas, as is evident in the Keysers Ridge Business Park project."
   "These funds are a federal investment in jobs and infrastructure in Western Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep standing up in the U.S. Senate for projects that help Western Maryland grow, and create jobs today and jobs tomorrow."
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
