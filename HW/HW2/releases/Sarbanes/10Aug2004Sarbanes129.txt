SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE NEW CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS NETWORK GRANTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced the 21 Maryland recipients of grant funding from the National Park Service for the fifth year of the "Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program." The program, which Sarbanes authored in 1998, is working to link the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network. 
   The grants support projects at places participating in the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network. According to the National Park Service, the Gateways Network is a partnership system of over 100 parks, refuges, maritime museums, historic seaports and water trails where people can experience and learn about the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.
   "This program is opening up new opportunities to enhance public awareness and involvement in our on-going efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "Each Gateway site tells a different Bay story, and enables people to better understand and appreciate the Chesapeake Bay and all it has to offer.
   "In addition, these grants will help local communities and organizations improve desperately needed public access to the Bay and its waterways, and help to boost the economic activity generated by tourism and recreation within the watershed," Sarbanes added.
   "The Chesapeake Bay is who we are as Marylanders: it is part of our heritage and culture. That's why we must celebrate, appreciate, and fight to protect it," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "Maryland communities and organizations want to do the right thing, but they can't do it alone; that's where the Chesapeake Bay Network Grants can help. I am proud to fight in the U.S. Senate for a federal investment in the Chesapeake Bay."
   Seven of the 21 grant recipient sites, one third of the entire total of Maryland recipients, are located on Maryland's Eastern Shore:
