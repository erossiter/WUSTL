SEN. SARBANES: BUSH BUDGET LEAVES OCEAN CITY, WORCESTER COUNTY VULNERABLE TO STORM DAMAGE
  Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) expressed deep concern today after learning of the Bush Administration's plan to zero out funding for Maryland's periodic beach re-nourishment efforts in Ocean City and the north end of Assateague Island. 
   Sarbanes said that the Ocean City hurricane protection project needs approximately $5 million in fiscal year 2006 for periodic beach re-nourishment efforts. Funding would be used to pump approximately 800,000 cubic feet of new sand to help stem erosion of the world famous beach. The north end of Assateague Island also requires $1 million for additional re-nourishment efforts. Funding would enable the Army Corps of Engineers to address these issues and make sure that Maryland's barrier islands remain intact.
   "This budget proposal leaves Ocean City and Worcester County vulnerable to hurricane damage," said Sarbanes. "The Administration's budget proposals also break long-standing Federal commitments to protect human life and property, as well vital resources and risk undermining the substantial Federal investment of over $50 million already made in these projects." 
   "We will not allow years and years of commitment by the Army Corps of Engineers to restore, protect and enhance our waterways to be washed away by the Bush Administration's effort to save money for tax cuts for the elite," Sarbanes added.
