SEN. SARBANES ISSUES STATEMENT UPON REVIEWING ADDITIONAL PHOTOS, VIDEOS OF PRISONER ABUSE IN IRAQ
  Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) issued the following statement after reviewing additional photos and videos of prisoner abuse in Iraq:  
   "I was deeply disturbed and appalled with the images privately shared by the Department of Defense with members of the House and Senate today. What has happened is counter to everything that our country stands for. 
   "There needs to be a top to bottom examination of what happened and all those responsible for these actions, including those in the chain of command, must be held accountable."
