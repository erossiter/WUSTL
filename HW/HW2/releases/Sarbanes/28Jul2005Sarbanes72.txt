SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE APPROVAL OF HIGHWAY PROJECTS FOR EASTERN SHORE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that agreement has been reached on a new six-year transportation bill that provides $2.9 billion in federal highway funds and over $900 million in dedicated mass transit funding for the State of Maryland over the six-year period. 
   "This agreement represents my priorities to improve safety and roadway conditions on our Eastern Shore roadways for the commuting and vacationing public," said Sarbanes. "It also represents an on-going commitment to enhance our public works and public transportation infrastructure and further promote Maryland as a tourist destination."
   "Upgrades to MD 404 and US 113 are about saving lives on the Eastern Shore," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have worked for the past six years, making the upgrades to these roadways one of my top priorities in the Senate. Marylanders can count on me to continue to work to improve safety and reduce congestion, keeping traffic flowing and our neighborhoods safe."
   Included in the multi-year spending bill are the following priority projects:
   * $16.6 million for design and right of way acquisition for the widening of MD 404 from US 50 to the Denton Bypass. When completed MD 404 will be upgraded to a 4-lane highway with associated safety improvements. Total cost of the 5-stage project is estimated at $226 million. This project has been a major Eastern Shore priority for the two Maryland Senators. (Congressman Gilchrest secured $5.6 million in the House for this project);
   * $15.2 million for continued construction on the dualization and safety improvements to US 113. This money will be used for Phase 2 of this 4-phase project. The total cost of all 4 phases is estimated to be $105 million. (Congressman Gilchrest helped secure funding in the House for this project); 
   * $6.3 million for the construction of a new Assateague Island National Seashore Visitors Center. Project entails construction of a new a 10,000 square foot Barrier Island Visitor Education Center to replace the current obsolete facility, built in 1966. It will be designed to function synergistically with the new adjacent University of Maryland, Eastern Shore Coastal Ecology Teaching and Research Laboratory (CERTL), which was completed in 2005 and will include two 52 seat multipurpose rooms that will serve both as audiovisual viewing rooms and class/interpretive program rooms; a new 1,400 sq. ft. main exhibit area and one 1,900 sq. ft. aquarium exhibit area, and new bookstore; 
   * $1.5 million in funding for improvements at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. About half of these funds would be used to complete the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge Visitors Center and the remaining funds would be used to help resurface the existing parking lot at the Visitors Center, and construct a connector roadway and bike/pedestrian lane from the Center to the wildlife auto tour route to improve visitor safety by avoiding heavy traffic along MD Route 335; and
   * Maryland Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Provides $25 million to improve bus facilities and replace bus vehicles throughout the State of Maryland, including locally operated, small urban and rural transit systems. Half of Maryland's Mass Transit Administration's (MTA) fleet has been in operation since 1990 and is in dire need of replacement. All 23 counties in Maryland, as well as the Cities of Annapolis and Ocean City, are eligible to receive fund for locally operated transit systems.
