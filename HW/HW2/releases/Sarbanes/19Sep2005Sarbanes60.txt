SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE NEW CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAY NETWORK SITES
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski today announced the 18 Maryland recipients of grant funding from the National Park Service for the sixth year of the "Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program." The program, which Sarbanes authored in 1998, is working to link the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network.  
   The grants support projects at places participating in the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network. According to the National Park Service, the Gateways Network is a partnership system of over 140 parks, refuges, maritime museums, historic seaports and water trails where people can experience and learn about the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. This year, the National Park Service is awarding $1.6 million in federal grant funding. Twenty-seven grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
   "This program has been extremely popular in opening up new opportunities to enhance public awareness and involvement in our on-going efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "Each Gateway site tells a different Bay story, and enables people to better understand and appreciate the Chesapeake Bay and all it has to offer.
   "In addition, these grants will help local communities and organizations improve desperately needed public access to the Bay and its waterways, and help to boost the economic activity generated by tourism and recreation within the watershed."
   "The Gateways Program greatly aids our communities in preserving Maryland's greatest natural resource, the Chesapeake Bay, for future generations of Marylanders," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is part of who we are as Marylanders. It's part of our heritage and its part of our culture. That's why I am so proud to work with Senator Sarbanes to keep fighting for the Bay and keep fighting for the Marylanders whose livelihoods depend on it."
