BALTIMORE METROPOLITAN AREA RECEIVES FIVE GRANTS FROM NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced the 21 Maryland recipients of grant funding from the National Park Service for the fifth year of the "Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program." The program, which Sarbanes authored in 1998, is working to link the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network. 
   The grants support projects at places participating in the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network. According to the National Park Service, the Gateways Network is a partnership system of over 100 parks, refuges, maritime museums, historic seaports and water trails where people can experience and learn about the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.
   "This program is opening up new opportunities to enhance public awareness and involvement in our on-going efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "Each Gateway site tells a different Bay story, and enables people to better understand and appreciate the Chesapeake Bay and all it has to offer.
   "In addition, these grants will help local communities and organizations improve desperately needed public access to the Bay and its waterways, and help to boost the economic activity generated by tourism and recreation within the watershed," Sarbanes added.
   "The Chesapeake Bay is who we are as Marylanders: it is part of our heritage and culture. That's why we must celebrate, appreciate, and fight to protect it," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "Maryland communities and organizations want to do the right thing, but they can't do it alone; that's where the Chesapeake Bay Network Grants can help. I am proud to fight in the U.S. Senate for a federal investment in the Chesapeake Bay."      
   Five of the 21 grant recipient sites are located in Baltimore Metropolitan Area:
   The awarded sites are:
   * The Baltimore Heritage Area has been awarded $111,500 to create an outdoor wayside exhibit that will integrate more than 13 current and 5 future trails telling Chesapeake Bay stories in relation to the Inner Harbor. A guide and scripted tour for the Heritage Walk, a trail connecting seven Inner Harbor Gateways, will also be developed;
   * The Fells Point Preservation Society has received $33,135 to develop and archeology oriented interactive display highlighting the history and settlement of Fells Point;
   * The Maryland Historical Society has been given $16,678 to redesign their entrance way and exhibit hall in order to increase their appeal and more effectively engage visitors in the Maritime history of Fells Point; 
   * Patapsco Valley State Park will use a $26,800 grant to develop a series of wayside exhibits in the Avalon area. The project's goal is to tell the story of the Patapsco River, its significance in the industrial revolution in Maryland, and its evolution into a greenway park that protects water quality and provides recreational opportunities in the Baltimore Area; and
   * The National Aquarium of Baltimore has received two grants. The first, totaling $27,500, will be used to engage community volunteers in the restoration of 1.5 acres of wetlands in the Blackwater National Wildlife refuge. The second grant of $150,000 will aid in the development of the Pier 3 Waterfront Park. Specifically the funding will be used to create interpretive graphics in each habitat of the park that will introduce conservation concepts and strategies as well as provide an educational interpretation of Maryland's diverse habitats.
   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program provides grants to non-profit organizations, and state and local governments to enhance places participating in the Gateways Network. The Program is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program and a 17-organization working group established by the Bay Program.
