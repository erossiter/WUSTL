SEN. SARBANES PROMOTING NEW INITIATIVE TO PROTECT GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
  Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) is promoting a new initiative during his final weeks in Congress that would establish a new bipartisan and independent Commission that would renew America's commitment to help protect the global environment. 
   Sarbanes has introduced legislation into the Senate (S. 4038), that would create a "Global Resources, Environment, and Security Commission." The Commission would examine the state of scientific understanding and current efforts to protect the global environment, assess the impact of continued global environmental deterioration on U.S. interests, and to make recommendations for United States environmental leadership in the world through the creation of a coordinated, comprehensive, long-range national strategic policy to help promote global environmental security. The last time the federal government undertook such a broad in-depth review of international environment and development issues was in the 1970s.
   "As the world's wealthiest nation, I believe our country is in a unique position and also has a responsibility to lead the world toward a more sustainable future," said Sarbanes, who has championed environmental causes and specifically the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay during his tenure in Congress. 
   The legislation is modeled after the "Oceans Commission," and would consist of 18 members appointed by the President and the leadership of the Senate and House, 9 from each major political party. The Commission would sunset in 2009 after it submits its final report to the President and the Congress.
   "We need a new consensus and a foundation upon which to build a renewed commitment to protect the global environment and I believe through the establishment of the Global Resources, Environment, and Security Commission we can create a blueprint to address worldwide environmental degradation," Sarbanes added.
