SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S, MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) a grant totaling almost $5.9 million to replace 35 aging transit buses in Prince George's and Montgomery counties.  
   Montgomery County will receive $5,012,132 to purchase 30 transit buses and Prince George's County will receive $802,863 to purchase 5 transit buses. The funding will allow transit operators in both counties to reduce the excessive maintenance costs associated with older vehicles as well as ensuring safer and more reliable service. 
   "Maryland's Capital Region is one of the most heavily congested areas in the Nation," said Sarbanes. "Investment today will help prevent a deteriorating infrastructure and increased congestion tomorrow. This significant infusion of new funds will bolster the transportation infrastructure network of Prince George's County and Montgomery County and help meet the day-to-day needs of our traveling and commuting public."
   "Marylanders depend on our public transportation systems to stay on the move. These new and improved buses will help the hardworking people of Montgomery and Prince George's County get to work each day and reduce the congestion on our roads," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I fight every year to make sure that Maryland's transportation needs are a priority in the federal checkbook."
