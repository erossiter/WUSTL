SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $500,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TWO EASTERN SHORE AIRPORTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that two Eastern Shore airports are being awarded a total of over $500,000 in aviation grants from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), under the Department of Transportation, for improvements at their facilities. 
   The awards announced today are for:
   * Cambridge-Dorchester Airport will receive $275,000 to obtain necessary environmental permits for the extension of runway 16/34.
   * Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport will receive 384,430 to complete phase two of its rehabilitation of runway 14/32. 
   "Improving our state's transportation infrastructure is one of my top priorities," said Sarbanes. "These funds will provide for the improvements for a growing passenger population and will enhance the safety of the passengers and pilots using these facilities."
   "I fight every year to make sure that Maryland's transportation needs are a priority in the federal checkbook," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I am proud to announce this federal investment in keeping the Eastern Shore on the move."
