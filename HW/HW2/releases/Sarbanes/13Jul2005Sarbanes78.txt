SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO BENEFIT PORT OF BALTIMORE, BALTIMORE AREA, OTHER MARYLAND WATERWAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced that the full Senate on July 1 approved the FY 2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill which will provide funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake efforts to maintain and improve the Port of Baltimore's harbor and other shipping channels leading into the Port. Funding is also included for other water and waterway improvement projects important to Baltimore City, the Greater Baltimore area and other efforts to improve the water quality and habitat of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 
   "The Port of Baltimore and its shipping channels are vital to the economic well-being of our State," said Sarbanes. "This funding helps to ensure that the Port of Baltimore has the means and continued federal support necessary to help it grow and meet the needs of its customers. In addition, it funds programs that are critical to our on-going efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay and its habitat. And finally it jump starts some new projects, including the Gwynns Falls restoration effort which will help improve the water quality and quality of life throughout that watershed."
   "These projects will help ensure that freight carriers and cruise ships can safely navigate Baltimore's channels so the Port can continue to serve as an important economic engine for Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work with Senator Sarbanes to create jobs and protect the environment. By putting money in the federal checkbook to upgrade Baltimore's aging sewer system, we have done just that."
   The funding approved by the full Senate as part of the Energy and Water Development bill for FY 2006, includes the following projects:
   * $19.2 million - more than $4 million above the President's request - for annual maintenance dredging of the Baltimore shipping channels. The additional funds would be used to help address a backlog of dredging needs;
   * $13.4 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems;
   * $11.475 million for operations and maintenance of the C&D Canal and approach channels;
   * $3 million for improvements to the Gwynns Falls watershed including restoring wetlands, stabilizing streambanks, rehabilitating the sewer system, and retrofitting stormwater management features. The projects will be part of regional restoration actions for the Patapsco River. This specific funding will be used to complete construction at one of the stream/wetland sites, complete plans and specifications for the remainder of the ecosystem restoration plan, and initiate portions of the sewer rehabilitation work;
   * $3 million to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on these reefs;
   * Funding of $2.95 million provided as part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program. The money is given non-federal interests in the Chesapeake Bay for environmental restoration efforts. Funding of $273,000 is included in this amount for continued efforts by the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the risks and benefits of the introduction of non-native oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay; 
   * $1.45 million to continue the shoreline erosion study of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries by the Army Corps of Engineers. Shoreline erosion around the more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline amounts to approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material being deposited into the Chesapeake Bay annually; 
   * $1 million for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration techniques and technologies in the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay program has established a goal of planting at least 1,000 acres of SAV (bay grasses) by December 2008. At present most SAV planting projects are small in scale and labor-intensive. The funding is to be used for extensive research to improve restoration techniques as well as continue SAV restoration efforts;
   * $500,000 to begin the restoration of Pleasure Island. The island is currently a part of North Point State Park in Baltimore County. The island is one of several remnant islands and is the historic location of an early amusement park. The island currently serves as a natural breakwater to protect the nearby Swan Point community and businesses. The area was severely damaged in 2004 by Hurricane Isabel. The money will be used to help restore and repair the island to serve both as wildlife habitat and erosion control;
   * $500,000 to initiate a new study of the opportunities to restore wetlands in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area, and specifically in the Patapsco and Back Rivers;
   * $500,000 to continue the Eastern Shore Waterways Study of potential beneficial use of dredged material projects similar to Poplar Island in the mid-Bay area; 
   * $500,000 to initiate a study of the feasibility of using dredged materials from the Baltimore shipping channels to restore lost wetlands at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. More than 8,000 acres of valuable marshlands have been lost at Blackwater since 1933;
   * $250,000 to develop plans for the environmental restoration of Middle Branch which is one of the major tidal portions of the Patapsco River and is the receiving body of water for the Gwynns Falls and Patapsco River. The Corps of Engineers in conjunction with the City of Baltimore will conduct the study which is expected to identify over 100 acres of potential wetland and riparian habitat restoration and other environmental enhancements;
   * $200,000 for habitat and wetland restoration on Hart-Miller Island which will provide new nesting and habitat areas for over 200 species of birds; and
   * $200,000 to undertake a comprehensive plan for Chesapeake Bay restoration projects. There has not been a comprehensive plan of action undertaken by the Corps of Engineers for more than 20 years. This funding will be used to develop a new master plan that would integrate existing and future work of the Corps of Engineers and to assist in the implementation of the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
   Differences between the House and Senate version must now be reconciled before being sent to President Bush for his signature.
