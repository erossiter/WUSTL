SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL $3.2 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WESTERN MARYLAND
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have awarded grants to five separate Western Maryland institutions totaling $3,260,000.  
   The projects receiving funding are:
   * Garrett County Community Action Committee will use a $2,650,000 USDA Rural Development loan to construct and equip a pump station to supply water to support the development of the Adventure Sports Center at Wisp. This project is a key part of the County's effort to promote tourism and economic growth of the region;
   * Allegany County has been awarded $495,000 to provide high-speed internet access which is necessary to attract and retain small and medium sized businesses and develop business and economic opportunities in the isolated communities of Allegany County; 
   * The Town of Oakland in Garrett County has been awarded two grants from the Appalachian Regional Commission. The first grant, totaling $60,000, will be used to assist in the design of a new Entrepreneurial Center which will house a micro-business assistance center, an artisan's co-operative and commercial kitchen, as well as office and retail space. The center will focus on maintaining existing businesses and recruiting new businesses to the county. The second grant, totaling $50,000, will be used for the construction of a multi-purpose community center. The center will host after-school programs, senior citizen and adult education classes, health education and awareness seminars and also be used as a blood donation facility for the American Red Cross; and
   * The Town of Grantsville will use a $5,000 ARC grant to support the community's efforts to create a new regional tourism destination. In coordination with community groups, a handicapped accessible pier will be constructed along the Casselman River for anglers. The project will be fully compliant with Americans With Disabilities Act and compliment the county's investment in outdoor recreation. 
   "Over the past week we have successfully announced over $4,000,000 in federal funding to aid a variety of development projects in Western Maryland," said Sarbanes. "These funds are crucial for job creation and continued economic growth throughout the region. I am proud to join with my colleague Senator Mikulski in announcing this federal funding."
   "This federal funding is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Western Maryland has received these grants to develop and grow by attracting new businesses and economic development. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities."
