SEN. SARBANES REACTS TO BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  SEN. PAUL S. SARBANES REACTION TO BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS: 
   "I very much welcomed the President's math and science proposal to help our children compete in our increasing global economy, as well as his commitment to making the research and development tax credit permanent, which is crucial to many businesses throughout the state of Maryland. 
   "But in the broader picture, we once again are down the path of deficits and debt, as the President continues to emphasize above everything else making his tax cuts permanent. And these excessive tax cuts are what has thrown us into this serious deficit situation. They overwhelmingly benefit the people at the very top of the income ladder and they weaken and undermine the basic foundations of our economy.
   "He spoke about compassion at the end of his speech and I think we do strive to be a compassionate, decent and hopeful society. But this Administration has not done on Hurricane Katrina relief what needs to be done. He referred to it only at the very end of his speech. The Administration is still late and short in its reaction which has placed a bad mark on it from the very first days with its dismal performance from FEMA.
   "Finally, his discussion of health care was quite limited given all the advance attention the Administration sought to bring to health care. And the specifics he made reference to are really not going to help most people who are uninsured and do not have access to health care today which, in my view, is the overwhelming problem that we confront."
