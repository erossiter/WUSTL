SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CRIME FIGHTING, PREVENTION EFFORTS IN BALTIMORE CITY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the City of Baltimore more than $1.2 million to assist the city in crime-fighting and crime prevention efforts. 
   Specifically, the City of Baltimore is receiving more than $240,000 for the Gang Resistance And Training Program (GREAT), a school curriculum program designed to provide students with the skills they need to avoid gang pressure and youth violence. The GREAT program coordinates with federal, regional, state and local agencies as well as individuals from community and civic groups. The goal of the GREAT program is to train law enforcement officers in a school-based curriculum in which officers provide instruction to school-aged children in life skill competencies, gang awareness, and anti-violence techniques.
   In addition, $993,000 is being given to the Baltimore Police Department to provide funding for the Department's Crime Laboratory Improvement Program. The funds will be used to increase analytical testing capabilities; decrease total turnaround time for forensic testing; provide advanced training and improve laboratory systems.
   "These funds will be used to help prevent crimes associated with gang violence, as well as help to solve crimes by committing resources to education programs and lab analysis operations," said Sarbanes.
   "Education is the opportunity ladder of this nation; this is a federal investment in making sure every child in Baltimore has an opportunity to succeed," added Senator Mikulski. "I'm so proud that we are investing resources in our communities and in our children while standing against gangs and violence."
