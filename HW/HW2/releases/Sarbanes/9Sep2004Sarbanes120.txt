SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE SEVEN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY PROJECTS TO RECEIVE SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that 7 organizations throughout the Anne Arundel County were among 38 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 38 Maryland recipients this year.  
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "The Small Watershed Grants are a federal investment in helping communities protect and preserve the Bay."
   Those Anne Arundel County projects receiving funding are:
   * The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will use a $100,000 Community Legacy grant to launch a river-wide implementation framework to guide future living shoreline and estuarine habitat enhancement projects in the South River and complete a demonstration restoration project. Outreach activities will be undertaken to ensure that waterfront landowners and residents in the South River watershed understand the purpose of the framework and how they can help implement it. Project partners include Burke Environmental Associates, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, South River Federation, Flood Brothers Marine Consultants, Community of Wild Rose Shores, Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the National Aquarium in Baltimore;
   * The City of Annapolis has been given $30,000 to design and install a 1,200 square foot demonstration rain garden in the Back Creek Nature Park where there is currently insufficient storm water management and infiltration from the adjacent parking area and surrounding impervious surfaces. The rain garden will handle and treat storm water runoff from approximately 1 acre of upland area. Interpretative signage will be installed at the site to educate community visitors and local school children who use the park as a living classroom;
   * The Spa Creek Conservancy will use $35,000 to develop a watershed management plan for the 1,300-acre Spa Creek Watershed focusing on approximately 2 miles of the severely degraded non-tidal headwaters. Locations for restoration projects, pollution prevention, trash clean-ups, reforestation projects and storm water retrofits will be identified along with the estimated costs of implementation;
   * The Town of Highland Beach has been awarded $35,000 to install a vegetated roof, cistern, two rain barrels and a rain garden at the Highland Beach Town Hall. This project will serve as a model facility to demonstrate how to build a green facility on a residential scale, with applications for local governments as well. Community residents and visitors will be educated through hands-on presentations, tours, workshops and a CD on the green building design and implementation, with a focus on methods to protect the Chesapeake Bay;
   * The Weems Creek Conservancy will use a grant of $6,300 to transform 300 linear feet of riprap into a living shoreline on private property in Weems Creek, a tributary to the Severn River. The interstitial spaces between the riprap rocks will be filled with a sand/compost mix and the shoreline regraded to the low tide zone. Local volunteers will plant native species to establish a fringe marsh adjacent to upland plants;
   * The National Council of Churches (the Council) has received $12,200 to educate the religious community to increase their participation in restoring and protecting the Chesapeake Bay. The Council will host a half-day training event for 75-150 faith-based activists that include outreach strategies, field trip opportunities, networking sessions, restoration techniques and train-the-trainer sessions. A demonstration project on Bayscaping techniques will be conducted on the grounds of a church in Annapolis. The Council will also develop a water action guide and distribute it to 300 congregational representatives, reaching a total of 50,000 individuals; and
   * The South River Federation will use $25,000 to complete a plan for the entire 55 square mile South River watershed. In coordination with the Center for Watershed Protection, Anne Arundel County and volunteers, the South River Federation will conduct stream and retrofit assessments for the remaining nine sub-watersheds of the South River. The plan will contain prioritized stream buffer plantings, community based storm water retrofits, stream restoration areas, trash cleanup areas and potential illicit discharge locations. A 'River Steward' program will also be developed and implemented to engage local businesses in pollution prevention actions and retrofits.
