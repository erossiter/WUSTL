SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION FOR HAGERSTOWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that the United States Department of Labor has awarded Hagerstown Community College a grant totaling $1.65 million under the Department's Community-Based Jobs Training program.  
   The federal funding, to be used over a three year period, will expand and enhance Hagerstown Community College's transportation programs allowing it to meet the workforce demands of the area's growing trucking, warehousing, and manufacturing businesses. Specifically, the program, titled Project I-81/I-70, will design and implement a curriculum for an Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree along with an expansion of credit and non-credit education training programs. Approximately 310 students, an increase of 50%, will receive a Commercial Vehicle Transportation (CVT) certificate and 100 students will enroll under the A.A.S. and continuing education programs. 
   "Funding for this project is critically important to Hagerstown Community College and to the future of transportation-related jobs in Western Maryland," said Sarbanes, who wrote a letter of support to the Labor Department on behalf of the College. "This grant will help to keep Maryland on the move by enhancing education and training opportunities and putting more highly skilled truck drivers and transportation managers to work." 
   "This is great news for Hagerstown Community College," said Senator Mikulski. "A strong, modern transportation system needs an educated and well-trained workforce. This funding is a federal investment in the next generation of transportation workers and Western Maryland communities today and tomorrow."
