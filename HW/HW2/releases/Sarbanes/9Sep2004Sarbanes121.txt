SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE NINE EASTERN SHORE PROJECTS TO RECEIVE SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that 9 organizations throughout the Eastern Shore were among 38 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 38 Maryland recipients this year.  
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "The Small Watershed Grants are a federal investment in helping communities protect and preserve the Bay."
   Those Eastern Shore projects receiving funding are:
   * The Adkins Arboretum, Ltd. has received $18,700 to develop a plan to protect a 40-mile section of U.S. Route 301 from Queenstown to the Maryland/Deleware state line. A display, presentation and brochure will be developed. The overall purpose is to retrofit the four-lane highway so it can serve as a model for good land stewardship and educate both out of town travelers and the local community on the importance of land management, the connection to the Chesapeake Bay and the cultural and historical aspects of the Eastern Shore;
   * The Chesapeake Environmental Planners, in connection with the University of Maryland Center of Marine Biotechnology, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the Maryland Waterman's Association, Inc. will use $37,000 to construct "grow-out" nursery tanks for up to 500,000 juvenile blue crabs. The crabs will be reared in a laboratory and then transferred to this nursery facility to be held until released into the ecosystem;
   * The Chesapeake Fields Institute has been awarded $40,000 to market their findings on the economic feasibility of potential value-added agricultural crops to the general public and farmers on Maryland's Eastern Shore. They will develop a database of at least 1,500 farmers, establish at least 50,000 points of information through wed site hits, newsletter circulation, brochures, paid ads, newspaper and audience members and engage at least 750 farmers in communication (by phone or presentations);
   * The Chesapeake Wildlife Heritage will use $35,000 to work with landowners to reduce agricultural pollution in the Chester River and improve wildlife habitat on area farms. Management plans for approximately 20 properties will be developed and implemented;
   * The Chester River Association has received $35,000 to develop a detailed watershed management plan for the Radcliffe Creek watershed and begin its implementation. At least 50 citizens will be engaged in community based "Creek keeper" programs that will monitor stream health, map and stencil storm drains and adopt and promote homeowner best management practices; 
   * The Delmarva Discovery Center has been granted $11,550 to remove a paved area and restore a tidal wetland in Pocmoke City, Maryland. Six high schools and eight paid interns will assist in the removal of 0.05 acres of paved area at the Pocomoke River Exploratory and the planting of native species;
   * The National Audubon Society will use a grant of $8,500 to conduct an education campaign and enhance an existing riparian buffer to increase local awareness of the importance of healthy riparian buffers in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. At least 100 volunteers will assist in enhancing and existing one acre, riparian buffer along Pickering Creek by removing exotic vegetation and planting native trees and shrubs;
   * The Wildfowl Trust of North America will use $50,000 to define the optimal seed processing and storage methods of submerged aquatic vegetation seeds. They will then produce viable seed stock necessary to plant 10 acres of underwater grasses at a density of 2 seeds per square foot of Bay bottom. Various community groups will assist in isolating and counting seeds for testing and will also participate in the field planting; and
   * The Potomac Watershed Partnership has been awarded $30,000 to collect the curriculum developed by teachers utilizing "Growing Native," a watershed wide native hardwood seed collection effort to support reforestation of riparian buffers and urban greenways, and develop a standardized curriculum and teachers guide for distribution throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. A series of workshops will be held to familiarize teachers with the program and encourage hands-on educational opportunities for students.
