SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE APPROVAL OF HIGHWAY, MASS TRANSIT PROJECTS FOR BALTIMORE AREA
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that agreement has been reached on a new six-year transportation bill that provides $2.9 billion in federal highway funds and over $900 million in dedicated mass transit funding for the State of Maryland over the six-year period.
   "The agreement announced today in prioritizing highway and mass transit projects helps to make the State of Maryland 'BRAC ready' as it prepares to handle an influx of new people in the areas surrounding many of Maryland's military installations," said Sarbanes, who served as a member of the Conference Committee that finalized the agreement on highway and mass transit authorization bill. "In addition, we have focused on alleviating significant transportation bottlenecks and completing roadway improvements across the State and enhancing the State's transportation and mass transit infrastructure, as well as other public works improvements in the State. I am particularly pleased that we were successful in moving forward with the much needed Red and Green Lines to the Baltimore subway system." 
   "I fought in the Senate to BRAC-proof Maryland's bases, and I am now working to BRAC-ready our transportation systems," said Senator Mikulski. "We have a top notch work force in Maryland that deserves a top notch transportation system. I am also proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes to move forward with the Baltimore Red and Green Line. Improvements to our transit systems mean safer and faster commutes to work, better air quality, jobs today and jobs tomorrow. I'm also pleased that the bill provides funds for the Pennington Avenue drawbridge. These improvements will enhance the safety of the bridge for commuters while ensuring a reliable, open portal to the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay. This is especially important given the critical ship repair work the Yard will be doing over the next seven years."
   Included in the multi-year spending bill are the following priority projects:
   UPGRADES TO ENHANCE BRAC READINESS IN THE BALTIMORE AREA:
   * $12.5 million for improvements to MD 175 from MD 170 to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in Anne Arundel County - as part of the effort to address congestion and safety to support the growth associated with new base activities at Ft. Meade and the National Security Agency (NSA). (Congressman Cardin helped secure funding in the House for this project); 
   * $8 million for the construction of an interchange from eastbound US 40 to northbound MD 715. The project will improve safety and operations along US 40 and will also improve access to Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Town of Aberdeen; 
   * $1.5 million for upgrades to the Maryland train station in Edgewood. The station is adjacent to Aberdeen Proving Ground's Edgewood entry gate and is heavily used for MARC train travel. With additions coming to the area from the BRAC process and from the US State Department's Center for Anti-terrorism and Security Training (CAST), the station use is expected to grow substantially. Funds will be used to upgrade and expand the current parking lots, improve access to the station, and improve lighting and streetscaping. An additional $1.5 million was also provided to improve intermodal access to the Edgewood and Odenton MARC Stations. 
   MASS TRANSIT:
   * $105.3 million for Baltimore Red and Green Line Transit Projects. Authorizes $102.5 million for planning, environmental studies, right of way acquisition, and initial construction of priority projects as proposed in the Baltimore Region Transit System Plan; and $3 million for alternative analysis; 
   The Red Line - An East-West Transit Line that will extend for approximately 11 miles from the Social Security Administration (SSA) Headquarters in Woodlawn to Fells Point. The Red Line will provide service to area currently not served by high quality transit. Starting with the SSA facility, the line will serve the Edmondson Avenue Corridor, the West Baltimore MARC Station, University Center, the Camden Yards Sports Complex, the Inner Harbor, Little Italy/Inner Harbor East, Fells Point and West Canton. Connections with Metro, Light Rail, and both the Penn and Camden MARC lines are envisioned. The planning phase of the Red Line began in 2004 and will be completed in 2007. The engineering phase will begin in 2008 and conclude in 2010. The right-of-way phase will take place in 2008 and 2009. Initial construction of the Red Line is expected to begin in 2010. 
   The Green Line - An extension of the existing Metro for approximately 5 miles from its current terminus at the Johns Hopkins Hospital northeast to Morgan State University. The Green Line will provide service to the Broadway Corridor, Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello, Northwood Shopping Center, and Morgan State University. 
   Total project costs, depending on the ultimate mode selected range from about $230 million to $1.8 billion. Providing this authorization to the Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) for the Red and Green Lines will guarantee that these projects continue to move forward in a timely fashion over the next 5 years;
   * Baltimore Light Rail Double Track Project. The final $12.6 million is authorized to complete the double tracking of the Baltimore Light Rail system. Single tracked sections have presented operational constraints, causing trains to be delayed while waiting for passage of on-coming trains. Resulting delays have hindered ridership growth. Maintenance in single-track sections renders that section impassable. The facility services 30,000 daily riders, provides intermodal connections, reverse commute to suburban jobs and commuter access to Baltimore; 
   * $5.034 million for the construction of a Howard County Transit Operation Repair Facility. Funds provided will enable Howard County to design and build a multi-functional, multi-jurisdictional transit system service facility to support the County's bus and paratransit systems as well as Connect-A-Ride and the western Anne Arundel County transit service. The facility will serve such functions as dispatch, vehicle maintenance, parts storage, and vehicle storage; 
   * MARC Capacity Expansion Program. Authorizes continued funding for MARC projects, including rail improvements; purchase of new rail cars; construction of a 4th track and station improvements at BWI Airport Station; and parking expansion at various MARC stations. The costs of the four potential projects contained within this initiative are currently estimated at approximately $286.3 million, which is allocated as follows: rail improvements ($66.3 million); rolling stock ($90 million): BWI improvements ($75 million; and parking expansion ($55 million);
   * Maryland Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Provides $25 million to improve bus facilities and replace bus vehicles throughout the State of Maryland, including locally operated, small urban and rural transit systems. Half of Maryland's Mass Transit Administration's has been in operation since 1990 and is in dire need of replacement. All 23 counties in Maryland, as well as the Cities of Baltimore, Annapolis, Ocean City, are eligible to receive fund for locally operated transit systems; and
   ALLEVIATE BOTTLENECKS; IMPROVE HIGHWAYS: 
   * $7.5 million for the replacement of the Pennington Avenue drawbridge over Curtis Creek in Baltimore. The bridge is one of only two drawbridges in Baltimore, spanning 2000 feet. Project will improve decking and structure and mechanical and electrical operation of the drawbridge. The bridge frequently gets stuck for ships coming into the Curtis Bay shipyard. (Congressman Cummings helped secure funding in the House for this project); 
   * $9 million to be used to reconstruct roadways in East Baltimore as part of the Life Science Park. The boundaries of this portion of the redevelopment project are Broadway, Madison Street, Patterson Park Avenue, and the AMTRAK rail line. The requested funding will support a traffic circle, new street and park areas, and rail corridor acquisition. The total cost of the roadway improvements is $30 million. (Congressman Cummings secured $6.8 million of the total in the House bill); 
   * Baltimore Watertaxi facilities - $5.2 million. Funds will be used to support development of a water transit system in Baltimore Harbor to help address growing issues of traffic congestion, parking shortages air pollution and to supplement existing and planned future transit systems in the city. "Park and Float" facilities at the Clinton street terminal would provide a passenger bypass for the Fort McHenry tunnel and provide a water transit gateway to those approaching from the north. Other terminal improvements at Pier I, adjacent to the downtown business district and at Fort McHenry would form the anchors of the local system. (Congressman Cardin secured $3.2 million of the total in the House bill); 
   * $5 million for the widening of MD 295 from I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) to the entrance and exits ramps to I-95. The roadway project is designed to improve access to the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Total estimated cost of the project is $22.4 million (Congressman Ruppersberger secured $3.8 million for this effort); and 
   * $3 million to continue ongoing studies and to develop preliminary engineering plans for the replacement or rehabilitation of the Howard Street and other rail tunnels that serve the passenger and freight customers in the Baltimore region and the entire Northeast rail network. 
   QUALITY OF LIFE, PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENTS, STATE ENHANCEMENTS:
   * Fort McHenry Visitors' Center - $11 million. Project entails construction of a visitors/administrative center to replace current building. Current building constructed in 1964, is designed for 250,000 visitors per year. Fort McHenry currently has over 600,000 visitors. Total project cost is $13.3 million. (Congressman Cardin secured $3.7 million of the total in the House bill); and 
   * Roadway access improvements, boardwalks, and pier construction at Hanover Street and West Cromwell in the City of Baltimore - $1.5 million. The National Aquarium in Baltimore is developing a new Center for Aquatic Life and Conservation on 19 acres along the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. Full development of this brownfields site will be a national demonstration of urban redevelopment featuring a sustainable designed landscape that integrates site cleanup, public-access waterfront park and fishing pier, and innovative stormwater management, with a green building. The $1.5 million in Transportation funds will pay for design and construction of an entrance from the main road to the Center, install sidewalks from the nearby bus stop to the building and the park, design and construct a waterfront walking and biking trail, construct boardwalks over the restored wetland areas, build a fishing pier for the public, and landscape the adjoining areas with native, Bay-friendly plants.
