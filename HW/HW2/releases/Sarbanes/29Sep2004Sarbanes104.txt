SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $870,000 IN FUNDING FOR WESTERN MARYLAND
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded grants to four separate Western Maryland institutions totaling $874,000.  
   The projects receiving funding are:
   * Garrett County has been awarded $750,000 to construct a sewer system for the new 385-acre Keyser's Ridge Business Park. The infrastructure, consisting of five miles of new sewer line and five pumping stations, will move wastewater to the treatment facility in Grantsville and provide sewer service to 23 homes and businesses. The project will create between 250 and 500 jobs within the next three to five years;
   * The City of Cumberland's Department of Community Development will use a $50,000 grant to provide counseling and assistance to entrepreneurs and businesses in the City and throughout the Allegany County. Cumberland's Business Resource Center will host at least 12 workshops and training seminars attracting 50 attendees while providing over 600 hours of business counseling;
   * Allegany County will receive $50,000 to assist in the acquisition of 4 strategically placed information kiosks to promote tourism activities throughout the county. The kiosks will provide information on current and future tourism and cultural events, as well as where to purchase local arts and crafts, make reservations and purchase tickets for events, and obtain maps and directions to places of interest in the county; and 
   * The City of Hagerstown has been awarded $24,000 for the Hagerstown 2006 Comprehensive Plan project. It is anticipated that under this grant approximately 100 residents will be involved in the planning process, preparation of the comprehensive plan, and development of an inventory of existing resources (assets) and facilities. Other benefits include promoting a sense of community pride, citizenry, and unity; building local community capacity and promoting leadership development among local officials and residents; and identifying cooperative solutions to city-county challenges and opportunities. Planning elements to be explored in depth in the 2006 Plan include: economic development, annexation, parks and community facilities water and sewer, transportation, land use, housing and neighborhoods, and sensitive areas. The implementation of such improvements will leverage future private investment by developers or businesses for development projects. 
   "The creation of jobs and the strengthening of local economies are crucial to Western Maryland's continued growth and development," said Sarbanes. "Whether it is funding to aid local businesses, enhancing tourism opportunities, or fundig to provide new wastewater infrastructure, the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job creation in our State's rural areas and I am proud to join with Senator Mikulski in announcing this federal funding."
   "This federal funding is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Western Maryland has received these grants to develop and grow by attracting new businesses and economic development. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
