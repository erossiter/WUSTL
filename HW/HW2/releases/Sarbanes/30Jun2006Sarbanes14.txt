SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR EASTERN SHORE WATERWAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) have announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the FY 2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, that includes millions of dollars in federal funding for navigational improvements to waterways as well as environmental and habitat restoration projects throughout Maryland's Eastern Shore. 
   "The waterways of the Eastern Shore - its rivers, bays and Atlantic Ocean beaches - are the lifeblood of the region's economy and quality of life," said Senator Sarbanes. "During my years in the United States Senate, I have fought for funding for these types of projects that have been so critical to the Chesapeake Bay's way of life. We must continue these efforts if we are protect and enhance these assets and bolster our State's economy."  
   "This is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the waterways of the Eastern Shore," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment." 
   The bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee includes the following projects:
   FOR THE CHESAPEAKE BAY: 
   * $13.1 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems;
   * $2 million to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on these reefs; 
   * $1 million for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration techniques and technologies in the Chesapeake Bay. SAV or "sea grasses" are vital to marine and estuarine ecosystems, providing not only food and habitat for a wide variety of species, but also serving as sediment traps to help prevent shoreline erosion. In the Chesapeake Bay, the level of grasses in the bay has dropped to under 70,000 acres, about one-tenth of their historic level. At present most SAV planting projects are small in scale and labor-intensive. The funding is to be used for extensive research to improve restoration techniques as well as continue SAV restoration efforts;
   * Funding of $1 million provided as part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program. The money is given to state and local governments in the Chesapeake Bay for environmental restoration projects, such as wastewater treatment, and sediment and erosion control efforts. Funding of $118,000 is included in this amount for continued efforts by the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the risks and benefits of the introduction of non-native Asian oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay; 
   * $950,000 to complete and begin to implement a coastal master plan that addresses problems and proposes opportunities to reduce the impacts of shoreline erosion of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Shoreline erosion around the more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline amounts to approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material being deposited into the Chesapeake Bay annually;
   * $450,000 for the initiation of a feasibility study which will examine how to restore the Chesapeake Bay marshlands in and around the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. More than 8,000 acres of valuable marshlands have been lost at Blackwater since 1933 due to sea-level rise, invasive species and shoreline erosion;
   * Funding of $300,000 to continue the Eastern Shore Waterways Study of potential beneficial use of dredged material projects similar to Poplar Island in the mid-Bay area; and
   * $150,000 to begin to develop a coordinated, comprehensive plan within the Army Corps of Engineers mission areas for restoring, preserving, and protecting the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The master plan, when completed, will be helpful to integrate existing and future work of the Corps of Engineers and to assist in the implementation of the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
   FOR THE ATLANTIC OCEAN BEACHES: 
   * Funding of $2 million for restoration efforts at the northern end of Assateague Island National Seashore. The two Senators have been strong proponents in obtaining both long and short term funding commitments to replenish and restore the island's beaches to avoid breaches which would not only damage and possibly destroy the island, but also to protect the fragile habitat that resides behind the barrier island; and 
   * $200,000 to support the periodic beach replenishment efforts along the Atlantic Coast of Maryland, including Ocean City. The Bush Administration has sought to terminate this funding.
   FOR EASTERN SHORE RIVER AND HARBOR NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENTS:
   * $800,000 for the next phase of dredging operations to include the lower portion of the Wicomico River. With the Port of Salisbury serving as the second largest port in the State and supporting facilities for grain exports and petroleum imports, the continuation of these dredging operations is essential to the economy of the Delmarva Peninsula;
   * $600,000 for the dredging of Rock Hall harbor. The harbor serves 15 marinas for commercial, charter and recreational vessels which includes over 1,100 slips, 150 commercial fishermen; and 750 registered recreational vessels based in Rock Hall;
   * $110,000 EACH for engineering and design for future dredging projects between Rhodes Point and Tylerton; the Honga River; and the Chester River;
   * $100,00 to the Army Corps of Engineers for the engineering and design efforts to repair a deteriorating north seawall of the Ocean City Harbor and Inlet; and
   * $80,000 to commence engineering and design of a maintenance dredging project of Goose Creek in Somerset County. The project serves a seafood packing house, and 50 commercial fishing vessels as well as recreational vessels. Shoaling has severely limited access to the project and threatens to diminish economic development in the area.
   The bill must now go to the full Senate for approval and any differences between the Senate and House passed bills must be reconciled before being sent to President Bush for his signature. The FY 2007 fiscal year begins on October 1.
