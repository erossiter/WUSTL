SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE $100,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR GARRETT COUNTY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has approved a $100,000 grant to the Board of County Commissioners of Garrett County.  
 The federal funds, along with $40,000 from county sources, will be used to complete Phase II of a construction project for an access road to the newly developed Kyeser Ridge Business Park. 
   With the help of Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski, over $400,000 was approved in August of 2004 for Phase I construction of the new road. Phase II will extend the access road towards the northern most site of the park and will provide vital access and help attract business to the park. It is estimated that the newly developed park will support the creation of approximately 250 new jobs. 
   "These funds will help in the completion of a new comprehensive industrial park, which will serve as an incubator for job creation," said Sarbanes. "I'm glad to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job growth in our State's rural areas, as is evident in the Keyser Ridge Business Park project."
   "This federal funding is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Garrett County has received this grant to develop and grow by increasing access to businesses and economic development. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
