SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FINAL APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR CHESAPEAKE BAY RESTORATION, CLEAN-UP EFFORTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced that both the House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the Department of Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006. The final bill includes funding for several environmental restoration and research programs which will aid and enhance on-going efforts to clean-up the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  
   "I am pleased that we were able to reverse course and fund several of these important initiatives," said Sarbanes, who noted that the Bush Administration had severely underfunded or zero funding many of the programs. "If we are to continue our efforts in cleaning-up and restoring the health of the Bay, it is important to provide this federal commitment of funds to keep our progress moving forward. The funding in this bill helps to do just that."
   "The Chesapeake Bay is our heritage - it is part of who we are as Marylanders," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment. This money is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the Bay."
   Included in the bill is funding for the following programs and initiatives:
   * The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Program is slated to receive $1.5 million. The program, first initiated in 1999, is linking the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network by providing grants to non-profit organizations and state and local governments. To date 140 sites throughout the watershed have been designated gateway sites. The Bush Administration and the House initially proposed zero funding for this program. The two Maryland Senators fought to have the funding restored throughout the process;
   * $2 million has been provided for the Chesapeake Bay Small Watersheds Grant program which helps local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The program was first created in 1998. The Bush Administration also proposed no funding for this program;
   * $20.75 million has been earmarked for the overall EPA Chesapeake Bay Program;
   * $900 million has been provided nationwide for the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds which are used to help states and local communities meet water quality standards, improve sewage treatment plants, and restore the health and safety of our nation's waterways;
   * $6 million for efforts to reduce nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. High levels of nitrogen coming from non-point sources such as sewage treatment plants, runoff from farmlands, and stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas is the single major cause of the pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. President Bush proposed not funding this program in his 2006 budget request to the Congress;
   * $950,000 for the USDA's Forest Service's State and Private Forestry Office to support the Chesapeake Bay Program's Office in its reforestation effort. According to reports, the states closest to the Bay lost 350,000 acres between 1987-97 or almost 100 acres per day. This decline in forest reserves poses a threat because many forests perform many important functions such as controlling storm water runoff, erosion and air pollution, all of which are critical to the Bay clean-up effort; and
   * Approval of $200,000 to the United States Geological Service (USGS) Biological Resources Division to continue the efforts to protect the populations of Diamondback Terrapins in the Chesapeake Bay. The Diamondback Terrapin, the Maryland state reptile, is a species that is declining in population. Unfortunately, little is known about the habitat requirements, nesting activities and population dynamics of this species. The USGS and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources have been working together to evaluate the physical features of terrapin habitats and identify major risk factors for critical life stages.
