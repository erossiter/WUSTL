ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY RECEIVES FIVE GRANTS FROM NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced the 21 Maryland recipients of grant funding from the National Park Service for the fifth year of the "Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program." The program, which Sarbanes authored in 1998, is working to link the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network. 
   The grants support projects at places participating in the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network. According to the National Park Service, the Gateways Network is a partnership system of over 100 parks, refuges, maritime museums, historic seaports and water trails where people can experience and learn about the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.
   "This program is opening up new opportunities to enhance public awareness and involvement in our on-going efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "Each Gateway site tells a different Bay story, and enables people to better understand and appreciate the Chesapeake Bay and all it has to offer.
   "In addition, these grants will help local communities and organizations improve desperately needed public access to the Bay and its waterways, and help to boost the economic activity generated by tourism and recreation within the watershed," Sarbanes added.
   "The Chesapeake Bay is who we are as Marylanders: it is part of our heritage and culture. That's why we must celebrate, appreciate, and fight to protect it," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "Maryland communities and organizations want to do the right thing, but they can't do it alone; that's where the Chesapeake Bay Network Grants can help. I am proud to fight in the U.S. Senate for a federal investment in the Chesapeake Bay."
   Five of the 21 grant recipient sites are located in Anne Arundel County:
   The awarded sites are:
   * The Annapolis Maritime Museum has received $21,350 to develop a virtual tour of the Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse to compliment direct physical tours. This alternative experience of the lighthouse can be used when direct access to visitors is not possible due to seasonal or weather-related cancellations;
   * Galesville Heritage Society Inc. has received $89,137 to enhance both the interpretation and the physical access to the museum. An environmentally sensitive parking extension, interpretive panels, and the installation of native plant and wetland displays are the focus of the project.
   * The City of Annapolis has been granted $5,000 to replace six deteriorated wayside panels and incorporate historical photographs on two existing blank panels at City Dock;
   * The London Town Foundation is slated to receive $150,000 to design, fabricate and install interpretive exhibits within the new $5.3 million visitor center and museum currently under construction at Historic London Town and Gardens. The exhibits will interpret London Town's story as a colonial port town and its relation to its waterfront location and access to the Chesapeake Bay; and
   * Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission has obtained a $17,550 grant to fill a gap in the public interpretation of archeological and historical resources at Mt. Calvert, a section of the Jug Bay Natural Area. This will be accomplished by developing ten interpretive waysides, and interpretive brochure, and including Mt. Calvert on the M-NCPPC website.
   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Program provides grants to non-profit organizations, and state and local governments to enhance places participating in the Gateways Network. The Program is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program and a 17-organization working group established by the Bay Program.
