SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR SOUTHERN MARYLAND WATERWAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) have announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the FY 2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill that includes millions of dollars in federal funding for navigational improvements to waterways as well as environmental and habitat restoration projects throughout Southern Maryland. 
   "The waterways of the Southern Maryland are a vital part of the region's economy and quality of life," said Senator Sarbanes. "During my years in the United States Senate, I have fought for funding for these types of projects that have been so critical to the Chesapeake Bay's way of life. We must continue these efforts if we are protect and enhance these assets and bolster the region's economy, and further protect our environmental resources and heritage."  
   "This is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the waterways of Southern Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment."
   The bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee includes the following projects:
   For the Chesapeake Bay: 
   * $13.1 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems;
   * $2 million to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on these reefs; 
   * $1 million for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration techniques and technologies in the Chesapeake Bay. SAV or "sea grasses" are vital to marine and estuarine ecosystems, providing not only food and habitat for a wide variety of species, but also serving as sediment traps to help prevent shoreline erosion. In the Chesapeake Bay, the level of grasses in the bay has dropped to under 70,000 acres, about one-tenth of their historic level. At present most SAV planting projects are small in scale and labor-intensive. The funding is to be used for extensive research to improve restoration techniques as well as continue SAV restoration efforts;
   * Funding of $1 million provided as part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program. The money is given to state and local governments in the Chesapeake Bay for environmental restoration projects, such as wastewater treatment, and sediment and erosion control efforts. Funding of $118,000 is included in this amount for continued efforts by the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the risks and benefits of the introduction of non-native Asian oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay; 
   * $950,000 to complete and begin to implement a coastal master plan that addresses problems and proposes opportunities to reduce the impacts of shoreline erosion of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Shoreline erosion around the more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline amounts to approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material being deposited into the Chesapeake Bay annually;
   * Funding of $300,000 to continue the Eastern Shore Waterways Study of potential beneficial use of dredged material projects similar to Poplar Island in the mid-Bay area; and
   * $150,000 to begin to develop a coordinated, comprehensive plan within the Army Corps of Engineers mission areas for restoring, preserving, and protecting the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The master plan, when completed, will be helpful to integrate existing and future work of the Corps of Engineers and to assist in the implementation of the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
   For Southern Maryland Waterway Navigational Improvements:
   * $550,000 for navigational and dredging improvements to Herring Bay and Rockhold Creek. The Deale harbor area serves commercial fishermen, charter vessels and 18 marinas. The water area is also home to many crabbing and oyster operations, restaurant facilities and a seafood packing business. The port area also contains the largest concentration of recreational power and sailboats on the Chesapeake;
   * $300,000 to complete the design phase on efforts to improve the St. Mary's River, a subwatershed within the Lower Potomac River basin. The St. Mary's River is a highly valued ecosystem that is being challenged by increasing population and development growth. These factors have resulted in increased erosion and flooding, loss of fish and wildlife habitat, and degraded water quality; and
   * $60,000 to complete maintenance dredging plans for Parish Creek. The project serves six marinas for commercial, charter, and recreational vessels as well as a marine educational facility.
   The bill must now go to the full Senate for approval and any differences between the Senate and House passed bills must be reconciled before being sent to President Bush for his signature. The FY 2007 fiscal year begins on October 1, 2006.
