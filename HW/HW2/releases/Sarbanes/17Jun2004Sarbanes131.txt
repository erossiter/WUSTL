SEN. SARBANES ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP PRESERVE HISTORICAL RECORDS OF OBLATE SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE
  Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) today announced that the National Historic Publications and Records Commission (a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration) has awarded a $25,830 grant to the Oblate Sisters of Providence, the oldest religious order of women of African descent in the world. 
   The order of the Oblate Sisters of Providence (O.S.P.) was founded in Baltimore in 1829 and is the oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic school founded for African American children in the United States. Over 300 sisters now educate and care for children in eighteen states, Cuba, and Costa Rica while maintaining their motherhouse in the Arbutus area of Baltimore County.
   This federal grant will be used to create both hard copy and electronic finding aids as well as a searchable database to organize their collection of more than 16,000 historical photographs. The pictures, which date from the 1850s to present day, will be organized, cataloged and preserved for viewing at the O.S.P. archives and also be submitted to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections and the Library of Congress for inclusion in their databases.
   "This grant will help to ensure the preservation and protection of the remarkable legacy of the Oblate Sisters of Providence for generations to come," said Sarbanes, who wrote to the National Historical Publications and Records Commission on behalf of the order.
   Since 1964, the National Historical Publications Records Commission has been awarding grants to organizations dedicated to preserving and publishing the record of our democracy, history, and culture.
