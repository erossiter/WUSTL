SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $300,000 IN FUNDING FOR WESTERN MARYLAND PROJECTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded grants to four separate Western Maryland institutions totaling $327,500.  
   The projects receiving funding are:
   * The Maryland Office of Planning will join with local officials in Allegany, Garrett and Washington Counties to use $192,500 in federal funds to create eight mini-grants geared toward enhancing planning, economic development and growth management initiatives throughout the region. Technical assistance, program planning and development, and project evaluations will also be provided to help increase and promote economic activity;
   * The City of Cumberland's Department of Community Development will use a $50,000 grant to provide counseling and assistance to entrepreneurs and businesses in the City and throughout Allegany County. Cumberland's Business Resource Center will host at least 12 workshops and training while providing more than 600 hours of business counseling. The grant will also provide support for the Cumberland Main Street Initiative which serves businesses in Downtown Cumberland;
   * The Tri-County Council of Western Maryland will receive a $40,000 grant to provide equipment for the Windsor Hall Performing Arts Hall in Cumberland. The historic multi-use facility will be used to host live performances, conventions and large conferences and will complement the efforts of city leaders to restore the downtown area into an arts and entertainment district; and
   * Garrett County will utilize a $50,000 grant to upgrade two miles of recreational trail running from Friendsville to Kendall, along the Youghiogheny Wild and Scenic River Corridor. Specifically, the trails' uneven depressions will be leveled, drainage controls installed and new signs and trail maps will be established. The project is expected to create economic benefits for Friendsville by increasing the trail's visitation rate by 1000 hikers annually and promoting revitalization through the town's position as a river and recreation community.
   "The creation of jobs and the strengthening of local economies are crucial to Western Maryland's continued growth and development," said Sarbanes. "Whether it is funding to aid local businesses or enhancing tourism opportunities the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job creation in our State's rural areas. 
   "This federal funding is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Western Maryland has received these grants to develop and grow by attracting new businesses and economic development. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
