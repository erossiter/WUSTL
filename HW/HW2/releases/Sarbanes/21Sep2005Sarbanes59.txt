SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE $500,000 GRANT FOR WESTERN MARYLAND JOB CREATION EFFORTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded Allegany County a grant totaling $500,000.  
 The federal funding, along with an additional $500,000 in State and local funding will be used to enhance job opportunities in Western Maryland. 
   Specifically the grant award will be used to assist in the renovation of the North Branch Industrial Park (NBIP), a large manufacturing facility in Mexico Farms near Cumberland. The former Pittsburgh Plate Glass manufacturing plant was acquired by the County in 1996 and is in the process of being redeveloped. It is expected that 200,000 square feet will be available to accommodate up to six new businesses. The renovation is expected to generate 200 new jobs when completed. 
   "Small businesses create jobs, strengthen local economies and are crucial to the region's continued growth and development," said Sarbanes. "I'm glad to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job creation in Western Maryland, as is evident with this grant."
   "This funding is a federal investment in Western Maryland communities today and tomorrow," said Senator Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Allegany County will be able to use these funds to continue to develop and grow. I will continue to fight in the U.S. Senate for this funding which helps support our communities."
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
