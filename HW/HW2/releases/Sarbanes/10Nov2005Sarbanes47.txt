SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT ON FUNDING FOR WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA WATERWAY IMPROVEMENTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the House and the Senate have reached agreement on the FY 2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill that includes federal funding for waterway improvements in the Washington metropolitan area.  
   "Cleaning-up and restoring our urban watersheds is a critical component in our on-going efforts to save the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "The Anacostia Watershed has been identified by the Chesapeake Bay Program as a priority watershed for restoration and funding for these projects represents a renewed and continuing commitment to aid in these restoration efforts." 
   "This is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the Chesapeake Bay and the Anacostia watershed," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment."
   The final agreement includes funding for the following projects for the Washington Metropolitan area:
   * $1.158 million for the restoration of approximately 16 acres of forest and floodplain wetland habitat along the Western Branch of the Patuxent River in Upper Marlboro;
   * $250,000 for development of a comprehensive plan to restore the Great Seneca/Muddy Branch watersheds in Montgomery County;
   * $156,000 to finalize construction plans and specifications for the development of fish passageways along the Paint and Little Paint Branch watersheds. Upstream migration of spawning fish in the Anacostia River has been largely prevented by several dozen unintentional and man-made barriers located primarily along the lower portions of the various territories, including the Paint Branch watersheds. The project will provide migration for fish to their historic ranges and enhance habitat in the Paint Branch and Little Paint Branch watersheds; and
   * $180,000 to continue efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to develop plans for the construction of local flood protection and environmental restoration projects on the Northeast and Northwest Branches of the Anacostia River.
   The final agreement must be approved by both the Senate and the House before being sent to President Bush for his signature.
