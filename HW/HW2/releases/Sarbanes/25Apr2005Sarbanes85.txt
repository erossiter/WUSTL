SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR GREATER BALTIMORE AREA MUSEUM PROJECTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) has awarded nearly $126,000 to five museums throughout the Greater Baltimore area. The IMLS distributed these grants under the auspices of the 1996 Museum and Library Services Act that provides federal support for museums and libraries.  
   Those receiving the funding include:
   * The Walter's Art Museum is being awarded $107,515 in the form of an IMLS Conservation Project Support grant that will be used to purchase environmental monitoring and control equipment. These tools will assess the environment in the museum's three major public buildings to better preserve its collections;
   * The Annapolis Maritime Museum will obtain $2,325 under the IMLS Museum Assessment Program. This grant will provide technical assistance and enable the museum to better assess its strengths and weaknesses in planning for the future;
   * The Baltimore Maritime Museum will receive $4,610 in the form of an IMLS Conservation Assessment Program. This grant will fund a two-day visit by a conservation professional who will provide an overall assessment of the grantee's conservation efforts;
   * Cylburn Arboretum Association, in Baltimore City, has been awarded $3,820 under the IMLS Museum Assessment Program. This money will provide technical assistance for reviewing the museum's strengths and weaknesses allowing it make improvements in the future; and
   * Goldsmith Museum of Chizuk Amuno Congregation, in Baltimore City, will obtain $7,570 in the form of an IMLS Conservation Assessment grant. This money will fund a two-day visit by a conservation professional who will deliver an overall assessment of the grantee's conservation efforts.
   "I want to congratulate these museums for being awarded this important funding," said Sarbanes. "These grants are designed to help museums do what they do best: educate, inspire, entertain, and enrich the lives of thousands of Marylanders and visitors they attract each year."
   "Museums contribute to the rich quality of life in our communities," said Senator Mikulski. "They record our history, reflect our values and renew our sense of pride and wonder. This money is a federal investment to help five Baltimore Area museums continue their mission to educate and entertain families for generations to come."
   The IMLS offers federal support to museums of all types and sizes-in urban, suburban, and rural communities throughout the country. Grants in this award cycle are focused on museum operations, which impact all areas of a museum's activities. With the support from the IMLS, museums can achieve high standards of operations that can include: improved fundraising, efficient use of resources, increased educational programs, and successful outreach to the community, schools, and families.
