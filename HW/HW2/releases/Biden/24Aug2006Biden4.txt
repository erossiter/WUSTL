            	Biden and Lugar Call on Mahmoud Abbas to Re-Double Efforts to Bring Kidnapped Journalists to Safety
             August 24, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senators Joseph R. Biden, Jr, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Richard Lugar (R-IN) sent a letter this week to President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas calling for him to re-double his efforts to bring two kidnapped journalists to safety. Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig were kidnapped not far from the Palestinian security services headquarters in Gaza City over a week ago.    The role of the foreign press in Gaza is instrumental in providing information independent from governments both on the situation in Gaza and on fast-breaking developments there. In order to allow reporters and staff to take serious risks in troubled areas of the world, foreign news establishments must be assured that governments will do everything necessary to ensure that they can operate freely, without harassment or threat of violence. We urge you to redouble your efforts to peacefully resolve this situation, securing the release of the two hostages unharmed, and bringing to justice those responsible for this unprovoked act, Senators Biden and Lugar wrote.
