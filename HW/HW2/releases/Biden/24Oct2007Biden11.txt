             October 24, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Following last week's terrorist attack on Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, U.S. Senators Joe Biden (D-DE), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) sent the following letter to Pakistan's President Pervaiz Musharraf:   President Pervaiz Musharraf c/o The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 3517 International Court, NW Washington, DC   20008   Dear President Musharraf:   We write to express our sympathy for the tremendous loss suffered by Pakistan in the October 18 suicide attack during a rally welcoming Pakistan Peoples Party leader Benazir Bhutto. The brutal murder of 140 Pakistani citizens in Karachi was a senseless tragedy, and we extend our condolences to you, to the victims' families, and to all of the people of Pakistan.   We believe this devastating attack serves as a stark reminder of the need for effective security mechanisms for the protection of all candidates and their supporters (particularly, although not exclusively, Ms. Bhutto and members of her party), who will be participating in the coming election. To this end, we ask you to take the following points under close consideration, as you and your government develop a plan to confront these serious challenges:   We share the pain that you, and all Pakistanis, suffered at the brutal murder of 140 of your fellow citizens. We continue to believe in the critical importance of a strong friendship between the people of United States and Pakistan.   Sincerely,   Joseph R. Biden, Jr. United States Senator   Joseph I. Lieberman United States Senator           Patrick J. Leahy United States Senator
