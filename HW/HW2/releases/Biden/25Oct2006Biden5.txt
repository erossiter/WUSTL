Biden Statement in Response to President Bushs Press Conference
 October 25, 2006 
 Washington, DC  Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) issued the following statement in response to President Bushs press conference today:    I didnt hear anything new from the President today  all I heard was more of the same with a request for more time to do it. It is time, not for a slight course correction or slight flexibility, but time to radically change course in Iraq. Theres still a chance to make this work if we insist on a political solution. Its time for a federalism approach that allows each of the three Iraqi regions breathing room and gives them a piece of the oil revenue. We then need a regional conference where the neighbors agree to support a political settlement in Iraq -- or help contain the fallout if the Iraqis fail to achieve one. More troops or less troops wont work. For victory in Iraq  victory meaning we are able to responsibly leave with our interests intact and not trading a dictator for chaos  we must have a political solution.
