             September 27, 2006 
 Washington, DC  Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) released the following statement following President Bushs decision to release the NIE:    President Bush was right to order the release of a portion of the NIE, and he ought to release a declassified version of all of it. The reports conclusions are clear: Iraq is now what it was not before the war  a recruiting and training ground for a new generation of terrorists. The report also makes clear that success in Iraq could dissuade other terrorists from carrying on the fight. That makes it all the more dangerous that this administration has no strategy for success in Iraq  its strategy is to prevent defeat and pass along the problem to the next administration. And it makes it all the more important to act on the plan Ive proposed to keep Iraq together, prevent chaos and bring our troops home.
