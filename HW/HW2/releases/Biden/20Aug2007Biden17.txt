 Biden: "Today's youth hold the key to our future - we must ensure that it will be safe and secure."   WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) announced today that Delaware will receive ten grants to prevent juvenile delinquency and improve the juvenile justice system. The grants, which come from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), bring a total of $600,000 to Delaware for a variety of state and local initiatives. "There are two vital goals for juvenile justice - prevention and rehabilitation - and these programs serve to accomplish both of them," said Senator Biden. "Today's youth hold the key to our future - we must ensure that it will be safe and secure." Phil Arendall, Unit Director at the Clarence Fraim Boys and Girls Club in Wilmington, said programs like this help children become productive adults.  "Financial support from this grant enables us to continue providing quality youth development programming for these kids," said Arendall. "It's a safe place for children and youth when they are not in school, which we know is the time that they are most vulnerable to negative influences." The OJJDP granted the money to ten programs, administered by agencies such as the Criminal Justice Council, Wilmington Enterprise Community, the Boys and Girls Club, and Methodist Mission Church. The recipients were based on detailed studies of needs in their jurisdictions and the program is authorized under the JJDP Act of 2002.
