            	Delegation Helps Announce Up To $80 Million For New Cellulosic Ethanol Plant Which Will Use DuPont Technology
             February 28, 2007 
 Washington D.C. -- The Delaware delegation -- Senators Joe Biden and Tom Carper and Congressman Mike Castle -- today helped announce up to $80 million in federal funding from the Department of Energy that was awarded to Broin Companies for the development of a cellulosic ethanol plant that will commercialize cellulosic ethanol technology developed by DuPont.    The bio-refinery will be built at Broin's Emmetsburg, Iowa facility which is expected to produce 25 million gallons of ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks.  The delegation sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman, in October 2006 supporting Broin's grant application.  President Bush visited DuPont's experimental station in Wilmington in January where the cellulosic ethanol technology is produced.  This technology - which recycles leftover corn stalks, leaves and cobs into energy - is crucial to reducing our dependence on oil and meeting the goal of replacing 20 percent of our fuel supply with homegrown, renewable fuels.  I applaud DuPont for its innovation and leadership, said Senator Biden.  I am thrilled that DuPont's cellulosic ethanol technology, developed in Wilmington at the DuPont Experimental Station, will be commercialized, said Senator Carper, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Chairman of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. DuPont continues to lead the way for creating technologies that provide solutions to global warming as well as decrease our dependence on foreign oil.                Today's funding announcement proves once again the significance of DuPont's role in the research and development of alternative sources of energy, such as cellulosic ethanol.  With their innovative work, the United States can start to implement realistic and effective methods of using renewable fuels to meet our energy needs, which will help our country face the issue of climate change head on, Congressman Castle said.                The grant of up to $80 million is a huge boost to Broin and DuPont's partnership to accelerate the commercial delivery of bio-fuels from cellulose through a technology collaboration which will significantly increase the amount of ethanol produced from cellulose in the next 4 to 6 years.   By partnering with Broin, the largest dry grind ethanol producer in the U.S., DuPont is able to accelerate market introduction of its technology by at least two years.
