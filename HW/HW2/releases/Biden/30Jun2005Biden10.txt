             June 30, 2005 
 WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today issued the following statement regarding the sale of MBNA America to Bank of America.   MBNA has been a driving force behind the states strong economy for nearly two decades. I hope this planned merger will create new opportunities, take advantage of our professional and experienced workforce and Delawares many other resources. It is a good sign that Bank of America has already indicated that they will keep the credit card division in Wilmington. I look forward to Bank of America following MBNAs example of outstanding corporate citizenship.
