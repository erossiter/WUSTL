 WASHINGTON, DC - Today U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) announced two grants totaling $485,000 for the University of Delaware. In one, the U.S. State Department has funded the University of Delaware's 4-H Youth Leadership Program for another year. The other is a grant from the National Science Foundation for software research and evolution intended to dramatically increase the quality of software processing.    "I'm glad we are able to reward the cutting-edge research and forward-thinking leadership of the University of Delaware," said Senator Biden. "These two programs make the necessary early investment we need to continue to be world leaders in several fields in the future - one with pioneering software research and another cultivating international relationships with the world's future leaders. Simply put, I am pleased that these models for innovation and leadership education are based in our state - and at my alma mater."   The $85,000 Youth Leadership grant allows 15 secondary school students and three educators from Bosnia and Herzegovina to come to the U.S. for a four-week program on leadership and action. The program prepares the students and educators to return to Bosnia and Herzegovina and develop projects that will benefit their communities.   In September of this year, for the first time, the program will take a delegation of 4 Delaware teens, 1 teacher and 2 4-H staff to Bosnia. The University first hosted Bosnians in 2006, and will continue the program through 2008.   The software research program, funded by the National Science Foundation, was designed because recent studies have shown software engineers spend more time reading and deciphering code than actually writing it. This program is predicted to substantially advance the tools available to engineers and significantly increase the quality of software.
