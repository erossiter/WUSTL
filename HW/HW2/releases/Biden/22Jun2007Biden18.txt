            	SEN. BIDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL
             June 22, 2007 
 Washington, DC U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after the Senate passed S.6, the National Energy and Environmental Security Act of 2007: Last nights passage of the comprehensive energy bill was an important step on the long path towards a national energy policy principled on reducing our dependence on oil and increasing our use of clean technology.   I have long advocated a responsible and balanced energy policy, one with substantial investments in alternative and renewable energy sources.  Our future depends on it  its that simple.   Because I believe that the use of renewable energy sources is so critical, I am disappointed there wasnt sufficient support for an effort to require more of our countrys electricity to come from clean, renewable sources like wind, solar, biomass and geothermal.   But this is a process and after decades of inaction, this bill finally does something to increase fuel economy standards.  It increases production of biofuels, expands energy efficiency programs, increases research into technologies and will save American consumers billions each year.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on additional legislation to put our energy future on the right track.
