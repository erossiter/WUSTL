            	Biden Leads Effort Urging China to Help Stop Violence in Darfur
             April 30, 2007 
 WASHINGTON, DC - In a letter sent today to Chinese President Hu Jintao, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-DE) led 96 Senators in calling on China to use its influence to help end the violence in Darfur. The letter also urges President Hu not to extend interest-free loans to the Sudanese government, which is currently engaged in a military offensive against Darfur that humanitarian groups estimate has cost 400,000 lives. The need for action to stop the atrocities in Darfur has never been greater, said Senator Biden. It is critical that the international community act together to stop the violence and start real negotiations toward a political settlement. China has a critical role to play in convincing Khartoum to end the atrocities and to accept the full U.N. peacekeeping force. Over the course of the conflict, Janjaweed, Sudanese government forces and rebel militias have driven more than 200,000 refugees into Chad. Two million people have been displaced 50,000 of them in the last four months alone. An estimated 400,000 people have lost their lives, and thousands of women have been raped and assaulted as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The text of the letter is below: April 30, 2007His Excellency Hu Jintaoc/o Ambassador Zhou WenzhongEmbassy of the People's Republic of China2300 Connecticut Avenue, NWWashington, DC   20008 Dear President Hu: We write to request your assistance on a matter of grave mutual concern requiring urgent action.   The devastating crisis in western Sudan has escalated despite United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, and the subsequent agreement brokered by the United Nations late last year in Addis Ababa to establish a joint African Union-UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur.  Simply put, the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) has not had the troop level, financial resources, institutional capacity or mandate to protect civilians or humanitarian organizations in Darfur.   Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir recently sent a disturbing letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in which he backed away from the Addis agreement to implement phases II and III, the heavy support package and a robust UN peacekeeping force.  Last week, he apparently reversed himself and agreed to move forward with the heavy support package, but given his record of stonewalling we need to keep the pressure on until peacekeepers are actually deployed.  It is also essential that President Bashir's decision to allow the second phase of the U.N. deployment not be used as a rationale for Khartoum's rejection of the full hybrid AU/UN force authorized in UNSC Resolution 1706. The conflict waged by Sudanese government forces and government-backed Janjawid militias against armed rebel groups has driven more than 230,000 Darfuri refugees into Chad, and displaced more than 120,000 Chadians.  Hundreds of thousands of Darfuri civilians have been killed and an estimated 2 million displaced in Darfur itself.  The conflict has had particularly devastating consequences for women and children, who make up the vast majority of victims. Humanitarian operations have also been increasingly attacked and disrupted in recent monthsleaving millions without access to the most basic assistance. We appreciate the steps the international community and China have taken to confront war crimes and other egregious human rights violations in Darfur.  The President's Special Envoy for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, recently told Congress that China may have been the critical factor in Sudan's decision to accept important portions of the Kofi Annan plan.  That is an important contribution.  By continuing to work together, in our complementary ways, the United States and China can achieve more.  In this regard we urge China to reassess its recent decision to provide the Government of Sudan with an interest-free loan to build a presidential palace.  We believe extending such a loan would clearly send the wrong message to Khartoum.  We hope that you will reconsider the loan and impress upon President al-Bashir the need to halt Sudan's military operations throughout Darfur, to withdraw Sudanese troops from the area, and to follow through on its agreement to accept a robust AU/UN peacekeeping force in Darfur.  These steps, at a minimum, are essential to enforce the ceasefire, protect civilians, ensure access to humanitarian assistance, and begin the path to reconstruction and reconciliation in Darfur. As Members of the U.S. Senate, our primary objectives in this endeavor, and those of our constituents across the United States, are to protect civilians in Darfur, end the violence, find a just resolution to the political conflict, and begin the long path to reconstruction and reconciliation. We must now work together as an international community; there is no time left to wait.  We therefore appeal to you today to use your influence in words and in deeds to protect civilians.  China has a lead role to play in ensuring that President al-Bashir accept the best and most reasonable path to peace, and that he agree to move forward with the heavy support package and the full contingent of UN peacekeepers and related personnel in Darfur.  We would appreciate any information you can share on actions China intends to take to protect civilians in Darfur.             Sincerely, Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman
