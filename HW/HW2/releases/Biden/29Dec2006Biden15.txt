             December 29, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today in response to the news of the death of Saddam Hussein:  Iraq has closed one of the darkest chapters in its history and rid the world of a tyrant.  Every effort was made to afford Saddam the judicial rights he denied to the 148 innocent victims of Dujail and to hundreds of thousands of other Iraqis during his brutal reign. I hope that the families of his many victims can now begin the healing process.
