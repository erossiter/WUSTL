            	Biden Calls for Special Envoy to Darfur, Sudan and Support for NATO Mission to help End Genocide
             April 27, 2006 
 Washington, DC  As the violence and genocide in Darfur continue unabated, today, U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) introduced two separate amendments to the emergency spending bill now before the Senate that would focus more resources, attention and money on the war-torn area.   Specifically, Bidens legislation would:     Give the President the authority to spend money made available to the Department of Defense for any action NATO might take to support the United Nations and African Union Mission in Darfur, Sudan; and   	For the first time, allocate $250,000 to establish an office for a Special Envoy for Sudan at the Department of State.     Earlier this year, Biden introduced a measure calling on the President to take immediate steps to protect civilians from genocide in Darfur, including through the deployment of NATO troops. The resolution passed the Senate unanimously on March 2.   The United States is not bringing all the diplomatic pressure it could on the Sudanese, nor are we providing enough support to the African Union team trying to broker an accord, said Biden, who visited the region last summer. We need money to help pay for any action NATO may take, and a high-level envoysomeone with international stature-- working to end the ongoing genocide. The situation in Darfur continues to deteriorate. We need to take action on both a military and diplomatic front to end the conflict.
