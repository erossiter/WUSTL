 Biden: Local program's success "has made it a national model"  WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) today announced a grant in the amount of $176,743 for Delaware Adolescent Program, Inc., (DAPI) the only statewide program in the nation that helps pregnant and parenting teens receive prenatal care while continuing their education. Funding is for the Laurel Kids Connection Mentoring Program, a mentoring partnership between Laurel Middle School and the Delaware Adolescent Program, Inc.. The Laurel Kids Connection Mentoring Program will establish outreach efforts with low-income, at-risk middle school students and help them make smart choices.  Senator Biden noted that the Delaware Adolescent Program Inc. has a national reputation and he praised its progressive, preventive initiatives. "DAPI's successful history over the last three decades has made it a national model," said Senator Biden. "Life as a pregnant teen can often be overwhelming. We should teach life skills, promote self-esteem and hammer home again and again the message that an unplanned pregnancy can derail dreams. DAPI has done that in the past and I'm confident they'll do the same in Laurel."  Dr. Doris Griffin, Interim Executive Director of DAPI, was pleased with the news of the funding and said the Laurel initiative has set high goals for area students. "This program is designed to make sure that our students never become pregnant teenagers," Griffin said. "It's an alternative method that provides guidance and structure to students who need more support; Mentoring will remind students frequently of their wonderful potential if they make the right choices. We want to facilitate bright opportunities for young people so that they can achieve higher standards than every before. We're thrilled to again receive federal support."
