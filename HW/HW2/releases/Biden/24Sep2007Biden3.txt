             September 24, 2007 
 WILMINGTON, DE - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) issued the following statement today after the United Auto Workers union began a nationwide strike:   "I fully support the UAW's right to strike.  American automakers have made promises to their hard-working employees and must do their best to uphold those commitments. Both sides in these talks are stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I urge them to return to the table and find a resolution as quickly as possible. Today's events remind us that American automakers need help with health care costs. To keep health care affordable I believe we have to help employers or union-run health plans with catastrophic costs to keep health care affordable for workers, retirees, and their families."
