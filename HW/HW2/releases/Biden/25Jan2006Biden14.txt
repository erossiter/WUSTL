             January 25, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Joe Biden, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, today praised Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's decision to drop all charges against four human rights activists arrested during a recent crackdown on civil society leaders and political opponents.   This is an important step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that the Cambodian people enjoy all of the rights to which they are entitled.   Biden called on the Prime Minister to release all activists imprisoned for criticizing the Cambodian government and to respect the democratic freedoms of all Cambodians.
