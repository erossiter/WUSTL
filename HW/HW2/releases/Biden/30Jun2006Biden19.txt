             June 30, 2006 
 lthough I am not persuaded that a problem exists today, I have become increasingly convinced that preventive action is needed to insure the continued freedom, neutrality and equality that have characterized the Internet since its inception.   Thats why I am disappointed by the Commerce Committees action on the Communications Act. I had hoped that it would send to the Senate, for full debate and consideration, legislation that included language barring telecom and cable companies from discriminating by giving preferential treatment to some content providers over others.
