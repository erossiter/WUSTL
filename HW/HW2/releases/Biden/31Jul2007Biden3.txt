 WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), author of the landmark 1994 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), today announced that the Delaware Criminal Justice Council will receive $815,000 to boost their ongoing battle to end domestic violence. The funding is for one of VAWA's cornerstone initiatives, the Services, Training, Officers , Prosecutors Grant program (STOP Program), which is dedicated to enhancing victim services through coordinated cooperation between victim service organizations, law enforcement, and the courts.   To date, VAWA - which provides the money for Delaware's STOP program - has granted over $4 billion nationwide in the ongoing fight to end domestic violence.   "The STOP Program is the foundation of the Violence Against Women Act that we wrote over a decade ago," said Senator Biden. "It provides essential support for communities to bring police, judges, advocates and victims services to the table and implement coordinated community responses to domestic abuse and rape. STOP resources help dedicated workers who spend every day in the field creating safe alternatives for women and their kids fleeing abusive homes, who advocate for women in the legal system, and who spend their days in the criminal justice system ensuring that batterers are held accountable."   In the past, the STOP program has been able to assist victims in various ways both inside the courtroom (civil protective orders, court-based advocacy programs, and legal representation) and out (obtaining safe housing, police-based victim advocates, and custody of their children). In addition, STOP funds have been used for several other services in Delaware, including:
