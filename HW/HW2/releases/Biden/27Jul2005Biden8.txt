 WASHINGTON, DC -- Earlier today, U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, met with Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts. After his meeting with Judge Roberts, Senator Biden issued the following statement:   We had a very cordial meeting. Judge Roberts is a well-respected, decent, intelligent man.       But thats not the sole test to become a Justice on the United States Supreme Court. As a U.S. Senator, I have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether Judge Roberts meets the standards I believe are necessary for a seat on the Court. I still dont know yet if he does. The hearings will answer that question.   Ultimately, I am looking to the nominee to provide an accurate and informed picture of where a Justice Roberts would take our Constitution, and the country, into the future.
