 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s (D-DE) resolution urging Ukrainians to "preserve and extend" their hard won democratic gains by holding free and fair parliamentary elections on September 30, 2007 passed the Senate unanimously.  Two years ago, the world took notice when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets in an "Orange Revolution" to demand a fair accounting of their presidential election.  Senator Biden's resolution expresses the admiration of the American people for the ongoing success of the Ukrainian people at removing violence from politics and holding free and fair elections, and encourages citizens to maintain these successes in the future.  The resolution also encourages Ukrainian leaders to continue to work past their differences despite serious political disagreements and pledges continued American support for a democratic government in Ukraine.    "Ukrainians deserve enormous credit for their achievements. The ability of a democratic government to draw legitimacy from its citizens is the best path to a stronger and more stable Ukraine," said Senator Biden.  "This resolution asks that Ukraine's leaders work constructively together to build that kind of future. I look forward to free and fair elections in Ukraine on September 30."
