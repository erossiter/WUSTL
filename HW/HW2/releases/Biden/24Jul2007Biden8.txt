 I-95, SR1, and Wilmington Housing Authority among Beneficiaries   WASHINGTON (July 24, 2007) - U.S Senators Joe Biden (D-DE) and Tom Carper (D-DE) today announced initial approval of $10.6 million in federal funding of essential Delaware transportation and housing projects. Funding for these projects was included in the FY 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill which has been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.   The I-95/SR1 interchange, The Ministry of Caring, and Crestview Apartments are just three of the projects designated to receive federal funding.   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration before it is reconciled with a similar bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.  Once the Senate/House compromise bill is passed, Congress sends that bill to the president for final approval.   "These projects will go a long way towards easing strains on many Delawareans' lives," said Senator Biden. "I'm glad we are able to help Crestview turn the corner in its quest to supply safe, dependable housing to its residents; to speed up highway construction that I know many drivers in our state are anxious to see completed; and to reinvigorate the Mary Mother of Hope House, a place that has saved so many lives."   This $10.6 million in federal funds is important for many Delawareans because it will help make roads safer, provide affordable housing, promote economic development and support research to develop more fuel efficient vehicles, Senator Carper said.   A breakdown of the funding is as follows:
