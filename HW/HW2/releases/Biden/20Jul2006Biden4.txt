             July 20, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today regarding the possible re-nomination of John Bolton to the position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations:   Mr. Bolton did not get a vote last year because the Administration refused, with no justification, to allow the Senate to review documents highly relevant to his nomination. These included National Security Agency intercepts Mr. Bolton asked to see in order to learn the identity of American citizens referenced in the intercepts. Since then, we have learned about the NSAs warrantless surveillance program, which makes these intercepts even more relevant. Mr. Boltons performance at the U.N. also confirms my conviction that he is the wrong person for this job. Unless the Administration provides the Senate with the documents it is entitled to see, Mr. Bolton should not get a vote. Instead of wasting time and playing politics, the Administration should nominate someone else to take Mr. Boltons place when his recess appointment expires this fall.
