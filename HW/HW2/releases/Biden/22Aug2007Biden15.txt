             August 22, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after President Bush's speech at the Annual Convention for the Veterans of Foreign Wars:   President Bush continues to cling to a fundamentally flawed premise - that Iraqis will rally behind a strong central government. That will not happen. There's no trust within the Iraqi government; no trust of the government by the Iraqi people; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon. Unless Iraq moves towards a federal system that gives the warring factions breathing room, we will end up trading a dictator for chaos that will set back our national security interests for a generation. President Bush today attempted to draw an analogy to Vietnam, but in fact it's the President's policies that are pushing us toward another Saigon moment - with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy - which he says he wants to avoid.     "The President also continues to play the American people for fools - conflating the terrorists of 9/11 with Al Qaeda in Iraq today. Al Qaeda in Iraq didn't exist before we invaded - it is a Bush fulfilling prophecy."
