            	Biden Renews Push to Hire 50,000 More Cops Nationwide
             January 23, 2007 
 WASHINGTON, DC - Citing recent FBI statistics that show a sharp increase in violent crime, U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D?DE) today introduced a bill to provide $1.15 billion that will resuscitate his Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, a successful law enforcement strategy created through the 1994 Crime Bill. In addition to putting additional officers on the streets, Bidens legislation also includes funding for the School Resource Officer program which is aimed at combating violence in schools.    There can be no doubt that the COPS program was a success, said Senator Biden. In 1994 we had historically high rates of violent crimes like murders, forcible rapes, and aggravated assaults. Because we put more cops on the streets in more neighborhoods, we were able to reduce these crimes to the lowest levels in a generation. In fact, the crime rates went down every year for eight consecutive years. Fewer people were murdered, fewer people became victims, and fewer children will become criminals.    But rather than continue on the path of success, the Bush Administration and Republican leadership have all but eliminated the COPS program, said Biden. Overall funding for state and local law enforcement programs has been slashed by billions and the COPS hiring program has been completely cut.    Biden continued, These cuts are coming at the worst possible time. Local law enforcement is facing what I have called a perfect storm. The FBI is reprogramming its field agents from local crime to terrorism. Undoubtedly, this is necessary given the threats facing our nation. But, this means that there will be less federal assistance for drug cases, bank robberies, and violent crime. Local law enforcement will be required to fill the gap left by the FBI in addition to performing more and more homeland security duties.    Specifically, Bidens legislation would:        -authorize $600 million to hire officers to engage in community policing, counter-terrorism duties, and serve as school resource officers;  -provide $350 million per year for technology grants allowing police agencies to purchase things like lap top computers for patrol cars and crime mapping software;  -provide $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire community prosecutors; and      -establish the COPS office as the entity within the Department of Justice to carry out these functions in order to eliminate duplication of efforts.     The bottom line is this -- we need keep faith with our state and local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe from crime and terrorism, said Senator Biden.    Since 1994, the COPS program has funded 118,000 officers, leading to a 30 percent drop in violent crime. COPS funds can be used to hire community police officers and purchase new crime?fighting equipment for police departments. To date, Delaware has hired over 220 new community policing officers.    ###
