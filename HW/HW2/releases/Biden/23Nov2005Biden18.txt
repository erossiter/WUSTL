             November 23, 2005 
 Wilmington, DE -- As part of the celebration of National Adoption Month in November, Senators Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Thomas R. Carper, along with Congressman Michael N. Castle announced that four Delawareans have been recognized nationally as exemplary advocates for children and families involved in adoption and foster care. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption has dubbed, Karen L. Wilson, Merrijane Pierce, and Brian and Natalie Rickards 2005 Angels in Adoption.     Delaware's Congressional delegation jointly nominated these four individuals for the award.         A brief description of each follows:        Karen L. Wilson is a Permanency Supervisor for the State of Delaware and a 2004 recipient of the Nancy McKenna Award from Adoption Families with Information and Support (AFIS). She began working at the Delaware Division of Family Services in 1985 and is a current member of the Divisions Permanency Committee. Ms. Wilson also sits on the Timeline to Adoption Subcommittee of the Child Protection Accountability Commission.    Merrijane Pierce has served as an Adoption Supervisor at Children and Families First for nearly 20 years. As a social worker and an adoptive mother herself, Ms. Pierce draws from personal experience to lead transracial adoption parent training sessions, present informational classes for adoptive parents, and recruit and educate the public at adoption fairs. Additionally, she serves on the Interagency Committee on Adoption, which monitors Delawares child protection system.    Natalie and Brian Rickards live in Townsend, Delaware and have provided regular foster care and respite services to over thirteen children over the past six years, eventually adopting six children of their own. One of their children, Amari, has significant special needs, and the Rickards have met the challenges of raising Amari with the same unwavering love and support they have shown each child under their care. The Rickards compassion, generosity and willingness to celebrate the diversity of their family makes them model foster parents.   Everyone has heard the African proverb, 'it takes a village to raise a child,' but very few people actually consider it their personal responsibility to reach out beyond their own families, said Senator Biden. These four people walk the walk. They are truly the unsung heroes and the Angels in Adoption Program is a great way to honor and thank them.   Ensuring that the needs of children who are adopted or are in foster care are met is of vital importance, said Senator Tom Carper. These individuals who represent the best of Delaware have given of themselves on behalf of bettering the lives of children. All children deserve love, attention and opportunities, and Karen Wilson, Merrijane Pierce, and Brian and Natalie Rickards help make that a reality.   The Angels in Adoption program honors worthy individuals like these four Delawareans who remain devoted to child welfare and adoption advocacy. The act of adoption is the epitome of human compassion. Dedicating one's time to child advocacy requires kindness and generosity. These individuals have touched the lives of countless children. They deserve not only our thanks but our admiration, said Congressman Castle.     The award winners were honored with a dinner reception September 13th in Washington, DC.
