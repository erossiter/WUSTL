            	Statement by Senator Biden Following the Indictment of I. Lewis Libby
             October 28, 2005 
 I take no satisfaction in learning of the indictment handed down today by the special prosecutor. It is a sad day for Mr. Libby and his family, and for the country.   But in our system, the rule of law prevails, and those who break the law will be held accountable, even if they work in the White House.   My greatest concern is that America faces enormous challenges at home and abroad, and I worry that the credibility of the Office of the President is diminished at this critical time when we need it most.
