 Wilmington, DE -- Senators Joe Biden and Tom Carper and Delaware Congressman Mike Castle today announced that U.S. Department of Transportation will provide the State of Delaware with $1,000,000 in funding to go toward repairing damages incurred during tropical storm Jeanne that ripped through New Castle County late last September. Specifically, the funding will go to the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) to repair road damage as a result of Jeanne.   The announcement from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta is welcome news. All of us here in New Castle County felt the effects of Tropical Storm Jeanne not only during the storm, but in the weeks and months afterward. This funding will allow DelDOT to continue its mission to provide us with safe, quality roadways, said the Delegation.   The U.S. Department of Transportation emergency relief program provides funding for the repair or reconstruction of federal-aid highways and roads on federal lands which have suffered serious damage as a result of natural disasters, including tropical storm Jeanne. Using this funding, DelDOT road repairs will include:           RT 41 south -pavement washout               DE 401 Walthar Road - culvert washout               Salem Church- pavement surface damage               Stanton Christen Road - pavement damage               Naamans Road -culvert washout               Faulkland Road - road washout around bridge abutment              US 13 - shoulder wash out and guardrail damage              RT 4 - sidewalk and embankment washout        Funding in the amount of $105,617.70 for debris removal throughout New Castle County, concerning traffic control, equipment and labor costs.
