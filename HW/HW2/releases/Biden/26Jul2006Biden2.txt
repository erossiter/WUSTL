            	Biden On Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's Address To The Joint Session of Congress
             July 26, 2006 
 WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today in advance of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malikis address to the joint session of Congress:   Since becoming Prime Minister on May 20th, Nouri al-Maliki has taken two major initiatives aimed at regaining control of Baghdad and stifling sectarianism. The first, Operation Forward Together, flooded Baghdad with American and Iraqi security forces. The second was a 24-point National Reconciliation program and sought to nip sectarianism in the bud. Yet sectarian violence has exploded into virtual civil war in Baghdad  with Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents taking over entire neighborhoods and engaging in localized ethnic cleansing, often with no response from security forces.   President Bush acknowledged as much yesterday when he said the situation in Baghdad is terrible and ordered even more U.S. troops into the city. But his response is further evidence that the administration has no strategy for victory in Iraq, only a strategy to prevent defeat. We need to do three things now to prevent further deterioration and help right the countrys course. First, we must push the Shia-led government to get Sunni buy-in by moving against Shia militia and sharing oil revenues. Second, we must help build the capacity of Iraqs government to deliver what people everywhere expect of government. Third, we must help them in tackling an unemployment problem that swells the ranks of the militia, the insurgency and criminal gangs. I hope Prime Minister Maliki addresses these needs in his speech today before Congress.   Without a significantly ramped-up effort to bring the Sunnis in, build Iraqs ministries and generate employment, we risk trading a dictator for chaos.
