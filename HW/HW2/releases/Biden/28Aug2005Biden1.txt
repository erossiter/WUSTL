 This is a partial transcript of ABCs THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS from August 28, 2005.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: And for more on this, I'm now joined by Senator Joseph Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Welcome back, Senator.   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN, DEMOCRAT, DELAWARE: Good to be with you, George.      GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You heard Miguel's report there. All 15 members of the negotiating committee who are Sunnis have rejected the constitution. You said just yesterday that without the Sunnis, this is a losing game. So is this war unwinnable?   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, not yet. You know, this, the hard part from across the sea here is determining how much of this is gamesmanship, how much of it is deep, how much it relates to trying to further negotiate at the last minute here, even though it's been, going to be presented. It's hard to tell, but the bottom line is, at the end of the day, if the Sunnis and that entire portion of the country opts out of this process, that's a formula for, for civil war.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you say it's a formula for civil war. Some would say we already have civil war in Iraq. The other part of ...   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: Well ...      GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, let me go on to the next question. The other part of Miguel's report there is that Muqtada al Sadr, the Shiite leader in Baghdad, is also opposing this constitution. How serious a blow is that?   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, it's just too hard to tell, George. How much of this is posturing at this point, and how much of this is going to result in people taking up arms? And, I don't think anybody can answer this question right now. We put ourselves in this spot by being the only ones involved in the process, looking like it's a U.S.-pushed document, instead of bringing in, like we did in Bosnia, a contact group, bringing in others to be part of the political process, to put pressure on all the parties.   And so it's just, it's just impossible to tell at this moment. I can tell you how the administration is spinning it. The administration is spinning it by suggesting that what really is, there's a lot of Sunnis that are really for this. They're just afraid to speak up and say anything now. That there is some division among the Shia, but ultimately, the Shia are going to be supportive. There'll be more concessions made, as the election occurs, et cetera, et cetera. That's how they're spinning it, that, you know, stay tuned. More to come. Much of it positive. But I don't think anybody knows that now. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But there is a great deal that we do know about this constitution. And we know, for example, that Islamic law will be a main source of, of the legislation, and that Islamic clerics will play a key role on the courts, and that's led to a lot of concern about women's right. And I want to show you something, an event that President Bush had in March, 2004, with a major Iraqi women's rights activist.   PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, UNITED STATES: I want to thank my friend, Dr. Rajah Kuzai, who is with us today. This is the third time we have met. The first time we met, she walked into the Oval Office, let's see, was it the first time? It was the first time. The door opened up. She said, My liberator, and burst out in tears, and so did I. And ...   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That was 2004. But just this week, Dr. Kuzai told The New York Times, This is the future of the new Iraqi government, it will be in the hands of the clerics. I wanted Iraqi women to be free, to be able to talk freely and to be able to move around. I am not going to stay here. Should Americans be sacrificing their lives for a constitution that gives such a key role to Islamic law and Islamic clerics?   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: The answer is the outset of this, no, George, I was on your program a year and a half ago and said the irony here is we may end up, because of this administration's actions, having removed Saddam and ended up with a constitution or a country where women's rights were, in fact, abused and where you had essentially Islamic state, the very thing we didn't want. And it remains to be seen whether that's what, in fact, has happened. But look, the you know, remember the old ...   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me stop you there for a second. You say it remains to be seen. Here's what we know, we know it's in the drafts. We know the Sunnis, 15 members of the committee have rejected the drafts. We know, at least we're reported that Muqtada al Sadr has rejected the drafts.   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: Here's what we also know, we also know that, in fact, it is not decided whether or not, I was told by the secretary of state last night, she called me. She, and I don't know this to be true. I'm telling you what she told me. She told me that, in fact, it is, the Sharia is supposed to be a source of law. B, the constitution would in fact, allow only as it relates to family matters, this decision to be made by a family, whether that be done in the separate courts or by the civil courts. That the civil courts would be made up of people who would include some clerics.   I said, how would the clerics be elected? How would they be appointed? How many? She said I don't know the answer to that question. So you're asking me to comment on reports, George, that I don't know. I don't know whether they're accurate or not. But I do know one thing, this administration has so badly messed this up, we may be in as bad of shape as you say we're in, as everyone says we're in. But I don't know for a fact what that constitution says at this moment.   I know they've rejected every positive proposal, that have been put forward by me, on your program and others, as to how to avoid getting in this situation. And they still have no concrete plan, as to how we're going to proceed, other than hope and pray that this constitution is accepted by the Iraqi people, which just seems to me like a tough bet.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You say, you say the administration has no plan. A lot of your fellow Democrats say you and other Democratic leaders have no plan. Let me show you what Gary Hart said this week.   GARY HART, DEMOCRAT, FORMER COLORADO SENATOR: I would like for at least one of those party leaders to say, I made a mistake. I was misled by the president. The country was misled by the president. The reasons we are in Iraq today are not the reasons that I voted for. And here's a plan for the speedy withdrawal of American military forces.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:  How do you respond to that?      SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: I absolutely did do that. First of all, for me to defend myself against Gary Hart is kind of ludicrous to begin with. I kind of resent it, to tell you the truth. But beyond that, I, when I got back from ...   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why do you resent responding to Gary Hart?      SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN:  Because I resent ...      GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: He's a former Senator, a presidential candidate, respected member of the national security community.   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: Gary Hart should have read, and others, you read my speech I made at Brookings the two days or three days after I got back from Iraq, where I said the president, we must set benchmarks. The president must tell us precisely what he's about to do. How long is it going to take to train the Iraqis? What are they going to do? I pointed out on every program, including yours, George, over a year ago, that he misled us, he's misrepresented, and he misunderstands what's going on in Iraq.   There is no question that this administration has, in fact, squandered every opportunity it had from the beginning. Put too few troops in to begin with. Not taken up the international community, any of their offers to help. Not brought in any outside political advice, in terms of the rest of the world being invested in the outcome here. Not in fact, worked on the Sunnis from the beginning, to get them more deeply involved in this process. The list goes on and on and on.   I have been a constant critic of this administration's policy. I have offered concrete, specific alternatives to precisely what the president should be doing. None, and I'm not the only one. Not only me and other Democrats, but Republicans. Chuck Hagel, John McCain. Others have offered concrete alternative to this administration's policy. And all they keep saying is stay the course. The president has not even explained to the American people why so much is at stake. And the irony of all ironies is, there were no centers of terror in Iraq before this war. And now, if we fail, they will, in fact, be importing the entirety of the jihadists from Afghanistan, and other parts of the world, to the center of Iraq. We have a national security problem we are not addressing.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, Senator, you have said, many times, that the administration should have done more to internationalize this effort. There's no question about that. It's also clear ...   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: I gave very specific examples, George. When you say internationalize, it makes it sound like it was a little bit of Pablum. I gave you specific examples.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no, you said bring in the Egyptian police. You said bring in the French. You said bring in NATO. No question about that. That's not my point. Democrats look at that, a lot of Democrats look at that and say, they still need a more dramatic alternative. And I'm wondering what is wrong in your view, with Senator Feingold's call for a goal, setting a target date to withdraw by December 31st, 2006?   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: George, I said on your program the last time I was on, you can go back and check, I said by the end of 2006, we're gonna be out of Iraq for one of two reasons, either we have come up with a plan, whereby we are proceeding and succeeding in uniting Iraq and letting them stand on their own two feet, or we have failed. It is self-evident that by the end of that time, the American people will not stand for us staying in there. And specifically if you look at what, what Russ said, Russ Feingold said, he said that is not a hard date. It is no different, as I read what he said, what I proposed in the Brookings speech, to set specific benchmarks. Tell us exactly, Mr. President, when you're going to train, how many Iraqis, what your plan is, when you draw down American forces, when you are going to have a plan for changing the situation on the ground, in terms of reconstructing Iraq and so on. With specific benchmarks. Specific dates attached to those benchmarks.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So let me be clear on that. You believe that you and Senator Feingold are in the same place right now?   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: I just tell you where I am, George. I'm not going to speak for Russ Feingold. I am where I have been the last year and a half. Offering specific, concrete alternatives to what the president is doing, and suggesting precisely what he should do.   And I'll say it again - the president, let me give you one concrete example, the president should tell the American people and all of us in the Congress, and he should come before, his secretary of state and defense, et cetera, should come before the Congress, on a monthly basis and tell us, A, we need to train X number of Iraqi forces to draw down Y number of American forces. This is the progress we've made on that training. This is who's involved in the training. This is how it's going, so we can look and see with specificity. Give us a date, Mr. President, that you've set to be able to get the sewage cleaned out of the streets. That you're gonna get the electric working. You have folks like David Brooks and others now, I mean, look, there's universal, left, right and center, acknowledgment, quietly and openly, both, that this administration policy is so far a stark failure. It is still redeemable.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But the goals, but to be clear, the goal should be removing our troops, if possible, by December 31st, 2006.   SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN: The goal should be to remove our troops as rapidly as we can get them out of there. But the ultimate goal is preserving US interest. And if that goal would be, if the goal of December 31st, would come smack- head into not being able to deal with the, a significant growth of a jihadist movement, and training ground in the middle of Iraq, then those goals are at odds with one another. What is the national interest of the United States of America? This president has, you know, that old, that rule that was set by the former secretary of state, the Pottery Barn rule. This president has broken the pottery. He owns it. And now, people are coming to folks like us, when he's rejected all the advice and concrete alternatives we've offered that would have made things different and saying, okay, now how are you going to fix it? The way to fix it is first get rid of Rumsfeld, so that the rest of the world will have some confidence and be willing to join us in any way, politically or economically, to be involved in this.   Secondly, lay out specific terms, Mr. President, as to how many Iraqis you have to train, when you are training them, when you expect them to be trained and when you expect to be able to draw down American forces. So that we can judge whether or not you have a plan, Mr. President. And if your plan is not working, then we have to consider other alternatives.   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, you know, we're just about out of time. Quick question, what did you do for your summer vacation? I know you were out in the country trying to see what the prospects were for a presidential candidacy. Are you closer to it now at the end of summer break, or farther away?     SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN:  Well, I'm closer to it.        GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's good to know. Senator Biden, thanks a lot.         SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN:  Thank you.      GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:  Up next, the Republican take from Senator John Thune.      And later, the Big Easy prepares as Hurricane Katrina barrels down on the Gulf Coast. We'll have the latest.
