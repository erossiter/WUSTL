             November 21, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today in advance of the Middle East Conference in Annapolis, Maryland next week: I strongly support the upcoming Annapolis Conference.  It presents a real opportunity for progress - but if it's a one shot deal, it won't work.  The Middle East peace process needs the sort of sustained day-in-day-out engagement at the highest levels that this Administration has thus far, shown little interest in or aptitude for.  This conference will only be meaningful if it is the start of a continued effort, not the end of one.
