             June 28, 2007 
 Washington, DC    U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) issued the following statement after today's Supreme Court decision regarding diversity in public schools.                  "I am extremely disappointed in today's ruling.  The decision turns the clock back on the achievements the country has made in advancing racial diversity in our public schools.  It is a major blow to the promise of equality and opportunity that began 53 years ago with the Court's landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education.   As I've always said, diversity in our public schools enriches our classrooms and makes America a better and stronger nation.                  "This decision, and other recent decisions affecting individual rights, is the reason I fought so hard to keep Justices Alito and Roberts off the Court.  The personal liberties of every American would be threatened even more if another conservative is allowed to serve on the Roberts' Court."
