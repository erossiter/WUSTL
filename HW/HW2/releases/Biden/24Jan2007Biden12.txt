 Washington, DC:  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement regarding Sen. John Kerrys decision to not run for president and remain in the U.S. Senate: My initial reaction to Senator Kerrys decision is one of extreme sadness. John Kerry is a major voice in American politics and the country would be much better off today if he were President.  It is great news that John will be seeking re-election and I know his influence will continue to grow in the Senate and in America.
