            	Biden/Lugar Champion Legislation to Create Emergency Response Corps for War-Torn Areas
             February 20, 2007 
   WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S Senators Joseph R. Biden (D-DE) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) have introduced legislation that will significantly improve U.S. capacity to undertake stabilization and reconstruction missions in countries that have been torn apart by war or internal conflict.    Ensuring stability in war-torn areas is vital to U.S. security, said Sen. Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  We've seen that terrorist organizations flock to crumbling nations to exploit the instability and lawlessness.  It is our responsibility - both from a security standpoint and humanitarian standpoint - to have an emergency response corps ready to deploy quickly when critical needs arise.  The Biden/Lugar bill strengthens and makes more effective the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization within the State Department by making it the focal point for creating plans and procedures to respond to crises, and establishing a robust corps of active duty and reserve personnel who will be able to deploy rapidly to post-conflict, post-war areas in need.    Specifically, the bill: -Authorizes $80 million for the operation of the State Department Office and the creation of a 250-person active duty response corps;  -Establishes a 2,000 person standby component of responders from throughout federal government, and authorizes the creation of a civilian reserve drawn from the general American workforce who have expertise in areas such as disaster relief, security, judicial systems, education and health care.  -Authorizes $75 million for a crisis response fund, so that the U.S. government will have resources readily available to respond to stabilization emergencies immediately.   Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
