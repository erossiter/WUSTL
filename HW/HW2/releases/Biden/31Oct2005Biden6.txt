             October 31, 2005 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court:   The nomination of Sam Alito to succeed Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court is critically important, as Justice OConnor has been the key swing vote on the court on a wide range of issues. Since 1995, she has voted with the majority 148 out of 193 times on 5-4 decisions  77 percent of the time.   In the aftermath of both the Roberts and Miers nominations, I hope it is now clear that all nominees  left, right and center  have an obligation to the American people to make clear their thinking and methodology on the key constitutional questions facing the nation.   The stakes couldn't be higher. My priority is to ensure the highest court will protect the right to privacy of every American, and that the rights of the less powerful in our society not be trampled.   	I look forward to Judge Alito answering the questions posed to him at his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
