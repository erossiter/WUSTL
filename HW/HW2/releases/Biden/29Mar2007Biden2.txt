             March 29, 2007 
 Washington, DC -   To improve competition and jump start innovation in the American Auto Industry, U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) today introduced legislation that would significantly increase U.S. investment in the development of advanced lithium ion batteries, a product necessary to operate electric vehicles and produce the next generation of hybrids known as plug-in hybrids.   Biden's Bill, The American Automobile Industry Promotion Act of 2007, authorizes $100 million a year for five years to advance this new technology - an amount double the Administration's current budget request.   According to Senator Biden, this infusion of funding is necessary to ensure better competition with foreign auto manufacturers.  On a national and international level, we must do whatever it takes to help our domestic auto manufacturers remain competitive, said Senator Biden. Right now, the Japanese dominate the market for lithium ion batteries because they invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing this technology and in supporting their domestic industry.   And, the Koreans and the Chinese are not far behind.  American auto manufacturers are playing catch-up and we need to move quickly.   Specifically, Biden's bill would support the development of advanced electric components, systems and vehicles, by providing funds for battery research to national laboratories, small businesses, and institutes of higher learning. The bill will also establish, through a competitive selection process, an Industry Alliance of private, U.S. - based, for-profit firms whose primary business is battery development.  The Industry Alliance would be an advisory resource on short and long term battery technology development.    The new program would have 4 major areas of focus:             In addition to research and development for the lithium ion battery, Senator Biden's bill will also set a national standard for biodiesels, a cleaner-burning fuel made from natural and renewable sources; and expand tax credit eligibility for consumers who purchase more fuel-efficient diesel vehicles. Specifically, the bill expands the emissions requirements to qualify for a tax credit for various weight diesel vehicles, increasing the number of American-manufactured, more fuel efficient diesel vehicles that qualify.  This provision will expire in four years, at which time vehicles will be required to meet the higher standards. In particular, Daimler Chrysler produces a Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel that will qualify under the new requirements.    Today's diesels are cleaner than their predecessors, are in compliance with EPA emissions standards, and are 30 percent more fuel efficient than an equivalent gasoline engine, said Senator Biden.   Now is the time to act. It's not too late, but we do not have the luxury of waiting. If we are ever to be truly competitive in the global auto market and free from our dependence on foreign oil, we must move forward on all fronts.  Senator Carper (D-DE) is an original cosponsor of the bill. This legislation is important not only for the two auto plants in Delaware and the thousands of people who work there, but also for the future of entire U.S. auto industry, Sen. Carper said. This support for a new generation of energy-efficient, environmentally friendly cars and trucks will help bring a new generation of vehicles to our roadways sooner.
