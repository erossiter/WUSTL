             October 27, 2005 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) today issued the following statement: I never got a chance to get to know Harriett Miers and make any determination about her qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. But, clearly, she is a woman of accomplishment, and she has been treated very unfairly by those who created a caricature in an effort to undermine her. I hope the President can withstand the demands of extremists to select a nominee who meets their litmus tests and, instead, pick someone who can gain strong bipartisan support in the Senate and across the country.
