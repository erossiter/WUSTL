             May 21, 2007 
  Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement in reaction to today's violence in Lebanon:  The United States must fully support the Lebanese government in its battle with an extremist group that is trying to destabilize the country.  The Bush Administration should urgently organize an airlift of military supplies to the Lebanese Army.  This would send a powerful message of support to the Lebanese people at a critical moment.  More than two years after the Cedar Revolution, the Bush Administration has failed to deliver substantial military assistance to Lebanon, while its neighbors fund and arm radical groups.  To sit on the sidelines now will only further embolden Lebanon's enemies.
