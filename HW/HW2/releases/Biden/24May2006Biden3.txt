            	Biden Calls for Close Cooperation to Isolate Hamas
             May 24, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  Earlier today, newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert addressed a joint session of the United States Congress for the first time since taking office eight weeks ago. Senator Biden, whod met with the Prime Minister in Jerusalem earlier this year, missed the address to attend the funeral services for a Delaware soldier killed in Iraq on May 13, 2006.    Ive had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on several occasions during the past couple of years, most recently in Israel on January 15th, the day of the Palestinian legislative elections.    While the challenges facing Israel, with the election of Hamas, are significant, I have faith in Mr. Olmerts leadership. He has not taken negotiations with the Palestinians off the table, but neither is he waiting for Hamas to miraculously change its ways. Instead, he has proposed a bold convergence path to redefine the contours of the situation. I believe the separation that Mr. Olmert envisions will be good for both Israelis and Palestinians. Pulling this off will not be easy, but I know that he recognizes the challenges.    He has a strong mandate from the Israeli people and, should negotiations prove either unfeasible or unsuccessful, his plan deserves the full support of the United States. I guarantee that he will have mine.    To this end, I have partnered with my colleague, Senator McConnell, in sponsoring the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act which isolates Hamas, while ensuring that the Palestinian people do not suffer for it. I look forward to this bills quick passage and to working closely with the Prime Minister in the coming months and years.    I also share Israels concern about the prospect of Iran developing a nuclear weapon. We must build and sustain a strong international consensus to convince Iran not to pursue that effort.
