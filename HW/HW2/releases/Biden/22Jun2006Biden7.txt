             June 22, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) was instrumental in spearheading key elements of an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that sets out a strategy for success in Iraq. The amendment, introduced by Senators Carl Levin, Jack Reed, Dianne Feinstein and Ken Salazar, calls for starting a phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2006 and a plan to stabilize Iraq.   Today the Senate is staking out a real policy for moving forward in Iraq. The legislation introduced goes beyond phased redeployment to include specific things the President and Iraq must do to ensure that as we leave, we do not leave behind chaos.   At a very minimum  to reduce the growing sectarian violence in Iraq  we must get Sunni buy-in into the political process and keeping Iraq together, including by giving them their fair share of oil revenues; purge the Iraqi security forces of militias and sectarian thugs; and convene an international conference in which Iraqs neighbors agree to a hands-off policy and create a mechanism to enforce that agreement. I am very encouraged that these specific actions are included in the legislation.   The Bush Administration has no strategy for success. Their strategy is to prevent defeat. All they are offering is more of the same. The American people want a real plan on the ground that gets us out of Iraq without making us less safe. The legislation today shows that we have a plan that will allow us to begin to leave Iraq without trading a dictator for chaos.
