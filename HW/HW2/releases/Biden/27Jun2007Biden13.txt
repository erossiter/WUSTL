             June 27, 2007 
 WASHINGTON, DC - Today U.S. Senator Joe Biden. (D-DE) introduced the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2007, designed to preserve over 300 Underground Railroad-related programs and sites in 28 states - including  9 in Delaware - over the next several years. The legislation will raise the authorized level of funding for the program from $500,000 to $2.5 million. Recent National Park Service financial estimates have shown the future of the network in great risk, as it will have a funding shortfall of over 79 percent by the year 2011 if no action is taken. "The Underground Railroad Network is a vital asset to our national park system," said Senator Biden. "This is a special part of American history that we cannot afford to let slip away. We must move now to ensure that the brave acts of these individuals are preserved for future generations to observe and honor." Sen. Biden was joined by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) and eight Senate co-sponsors in introducing the bill. This bill has already been introduced in the House by Reps. Mike Castle (R-DE) and Alcee Hastings (D-FL). Established in 1998, the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom is the only national program dedicated to the preservation, interpretation, and dissemination of Underground Railroad history.
