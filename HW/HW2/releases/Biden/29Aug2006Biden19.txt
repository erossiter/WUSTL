             August 29, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. issued the following statement today regarding the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina:    On the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, our thoughts and prayers remain with the families and victims of this horrible catastrophe. Sadly, even twelve months later, the road ahead remains daunting. When I toured the Gulf Coast this past spring, I saw first-hand the challenges of recovery but was heartened to see the very best of the American spirit in action. Rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is and will continue to be a tough haul, but like in all times in our history, Americans are standing together and rising to the occasion.    A year ago today, we saw unprecedented and shocking devastation on our own shores. We must be prepared for any disaster, natural or man-made, and we werent. We need to have the resources and infrastructure in place to protect our citizens when they are in danger, and we didnt. The flood waters of Katrina were a wake up call to America, and one year later the question is whether or not we were listening. We cannot let time erase the memory of the commitment we made to the people of the Gulf Coast.
