 WILMINGTON, DE - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) released the following statement today after State Sen. James Vaughn announced his retirement:   "Jim Vaughn's career defines public service and his shoes will be extremely difficult to fill. Whether as a police officer, commissioner, or senator, no one worked harder for the people of our state. His vast knowledge and inimitable personality will be sorely missed in Dover."
