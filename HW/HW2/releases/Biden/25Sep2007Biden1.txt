            	BIDEN Resolution to Investigate the Assassination of Lebanese Member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem Unanimously Passes Senate
             September 25, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Yesterday, the Senate unanimously passed S. Res. 328, authored by Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE), which urges the United Nations Security Council to extend the jurisdiction of the international tribunal for Lebanon to include the assassination of Lebanese Member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem and calls upon the Bush Administration and international community to redouble their support for Lebanon.    On September 19, 2007, Lebanese Member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem and at least six others were killed in a massive car-bomb attack in the suburbs of Beirut.  Tragically, this has been an all-too-frequent occurrence in Lebanon since Former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri was assassinated on February 14, 2005.  In total, six Lebanese parliamentarians, all of whom were outspoken critics of the Syrian domination of Lebanon, have been killed in the intervening two and a half years. Lebanon is scheduled to start the process of selecting a new president in just a few days.     "The assassination of Antoine Ghanem is an attack on Lebanon's sovereignty," said Senator Biden.  "This despicable act is also an attempt to undermine the international tribunal set up earlier this year to try the killers of Prime Minister Hariri and other Lebanese victims of political violence. But yesterday the United States Senate sent a clear message to the perpetrators: These attacks on Lebanon must stop and those responsible, including any state sponsors, must be held accountable for their crimes.  Lebanon must be free to choose its next president without intimidation or violence."
