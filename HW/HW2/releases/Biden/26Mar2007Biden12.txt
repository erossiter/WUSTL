             March 26, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) has long been an advocate of barring the construction of any permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq.   Last year, he successfully passed two amendments as part of the Defense Authorization bill and Defense Appropriations bill, which prohibited using any funds to build permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq or to exercise American control over Iraqi oil.  Both bills were signed into law, marking the first clear sign from Congress that the American military presence in Iraq would not be open-ended.    This week, the U.S. Senate will debate the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, legislation which will make emergency supplemental appropriations for the Iraq War.  The Act already includes a provision that prohibits using any of the money to build permanent United States military bases in Iraq or to exercise American control over Iraqi oil.  By including the provision again this year, the Senate will ensure that it remains in force.    I'm pleased Senate appropriators are renewing a provision I proposed last year that would bar the use of this money for the construction of permanent American military bases in Iraq or to exercise American control over Iraqi oil, said Sen. Biden.  When I introduced the provision last year, I was concerned that Iraqi suspicions about American aims in Iraq were endangering American lives.  These misperceptions will not be easily changed, but this measure again shows that the American people have no imperial designs upon Iraq.
