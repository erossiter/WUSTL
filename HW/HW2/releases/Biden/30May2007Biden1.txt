             May 30, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today: "I commend the President for seeking to nearly double funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) over the next five years.  Our HIV/AIDS programs are making a life-saving difference to millions - this proposal offers hope to millions more.  I will work with the President to make that goal a reality and to strengthen all of our efforts, including not only the President's initiative, but also the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS."
