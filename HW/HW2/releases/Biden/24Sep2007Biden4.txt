 Wilmington, DE - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), author of the landmark 1994 Biden Crime Bill, issued the following statement today after the shooting of Philadelphia police officer Richard Decoatsworth:   "My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Decoatsworth, his family, and the entire law enforcement community. Mornings like this are a stark and sobering reminder of the threats faced by these brave officers every day in their constant effort to keep us safe. The young men and women like Officer Decoatsworth, along with essential federal support, are the best hope we have for saving Philadelphia from the current, tragic cycle of violence it's in."
