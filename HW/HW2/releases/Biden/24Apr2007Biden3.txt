             April 24, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today on the Day of Remembrance for the Armenian Genocide, April 24, 2007:  The Armenian Genocide stands among history's most terrible examples of man's inhumanity towards man.  As we memorialize its victims and mourn their loss today and all days, I hope we will also learn its lessons.  Let us rededicate ourselves to ensuring that future generations never endure similar horrors.  And let us take courage in the example of millions of Armenians and Armenian Americans who have refused to be defined by tragedy, but have rather defined themselves through their resilience, their accomplishments and their determination to build a better future.
