             November 30, 2006 
 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today in reaction to today's news reports regarding the content of the Iraq Study Group's report. I look forward to the release of the Iraq Study Group's report on December 6th and I will reserve full judgment until I see it. But if today's news reports are correct, I'm concerned the Iraq Study Group may miss the most important point: the need for a strategy to build a sustainable political settlement in Iraq. Bringing the neighbors in and starting to get our troops out are necessary, but not sufficient. We need to give each of Iraq's major groups a way to pursue their interests peacefully. It would be a fatal mistake to believe we can do that solely by building up a strong central government. That policy has been tried and it has failed because there is no trust within the government, no trust of the government by the people and no capacity on the part of the government to deliver benefits to Iraqis.   The best way to get a sustainable political settlement is through federalism: maintaining a unified Iraq, but decentralizing the country and giving its groups breathing room in their own regions. A central government would still be responsible for the distribution of oil and border security. We would get Sunni buy-in by guaranteeing them a proportionate share of the oil revenues and we'd bring the neighbors in to support the political settlement. If we do all these things, we can withdraw most of our troops from Iraq by 2008, with a residual force to focus on counter-terrorism. And we can achieve the two objectives most Americans share: to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.
