             May 22, 2007 
  Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) called for the immediate release today of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.  Dr. Esfandiari is a dual Iranian-American national who traveled to Iran on December 12, 2006 to visit her ailing mother.  On Dec. 30, 2006, on her way to the airport to catch a flight back to Washington, Dr. Esfandiari's taxi was stopped by three masked men who threatened her life and robbed her of her belongings, including her Iranian and American passports.  Since that time, Dr. Esfandiari has been interrogated and harassed by the Iranian government and she was arrested on May 8th, incarcerated in Tehran's Evin Prison.    I call for the immediate release of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, the Director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Her arrest is inhumane.  It is also self-defeating, since Dr. Esfandiari has been a courageous voice of reason on Iranian issues for decades. She has struggled to build bridges of dialogue across the widening chasm dividing Iran and America.  I urge the Iranian government to release her immediately and allow her to return to her home and her family.
