            	Statement by Senator Biden on the State of the Union Address
             May 25, 2005 
 The President has a nation united behind his leadership, and in the same way we've all supported his prosecution of the war, we want him to succeed on the home front, too.  Tonight, we heard him lay out his administration's priorities, many of which I agree with,  from continuing the long-term war on terrorism, to increasing funding for homeland defense, to protecting Social Security and Medicare.  But we are in a bind.  I fear other important priorities may get short shrift.  For example, are we going to continue to fund law enforcement adequately?  We can't just pay for homeland security and forget about the local cops who are on the front lines of the fight that has led to the reduction in crime rates the last 8 years.  The problem is that just a year ago the White House  projected the federal budget would have a $231 billion surplus this year, but instead we have a $106 billion deficit.  Thats the biggest reversal of fortune since 1952.  Now, the tough choices have to be made.  Tonight President Bush gave us a glimpse of what he proposes, and in a few days the budget will be released and the picture will become clearer.  We will soon find out how the administration is going to fit all the things it hopes to implement, the ten pounds in their wish list into the five pound bag.   I'm eager to see how the President resolves the many hard choices we face.
