             August 23, 2007 
  Washington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) were released to the public:  "The unclassified "Key Judgments" of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq underscore the fatally flawed premise of President Bush's Iraq policy - that surging American troops will buy more time for the central government to succeed.  As the NIE makes clear, "Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively" and "broadly accepted political compromises required for sustained security, long term political progress and economic development are unlikely to emerge unless there is a fundamental shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments."  Absent an occupation that the U.S. cannot sustain or the return of a dictator which we do not want, Iraq cannot be governed from the center.  We need to stop the surge and start to get our troops out, while separating the warring factions and supporting the emergence of a decentralized, federal Iraq that gives each group control over their daily lives. That's what the Iraqi Constitution calls for.  And that's the only way to leave Iraq without trading a dictator for chaos and setting back our national security interests for a generation."
