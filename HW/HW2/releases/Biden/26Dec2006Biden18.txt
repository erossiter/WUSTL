             December 26, 2006 
 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) called for no more new troops in Iraq today in advance of President Bush's upcoming speech to announce a new Iraq strategy:    As President Bush prepares to announce a new strategy for Iraq, one idea has emerged as his leading option: to surge more troops into Baghdad in a last ditch effort to stabilize the city.    There is one big problem with that option: in the absence of a political settlement among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, it will not work. We've tried the military surge option before and it failed. If we try it again, it will fail again.    And surging our forces in Baghdad risks terrible consequences: more American lives lost and more unbearable strain on our military for no strategic gain. If the President proposes escalation in Iraq, I will oppose him and so will many of my colleagues in Congress.
