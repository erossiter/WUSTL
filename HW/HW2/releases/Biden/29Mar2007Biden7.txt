            	Second Chance Act Would Prevent Ex-Cons From Becoming Repeat Offenders
             March 29, 2007 
 Wilmington, DE - In an effort to make communities safer and ensure former prison inmates successfully transition back into society, U.S. Senators Joe Biden (D-DE), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Patrick Leahy (D-CN) today introduced legislation designed to reduce the number of convicted felons that become repeat offenders.         The Second Chance Act of 2007 provides $192 million a year in federal competitive grants to promote programs that combine intensive parole supervision with job training, substance abuse treatment, mental health assistance and other support services to help high-risk offenders reintegrate into the community.  It's time we start facing a stark reality - more than two million people are serving time in our federal and state prisons, and sooner or later, the vast majority - 95%  of them will be released, said Senator Biden. Many of these offenders reenter our communities with insufficient monitoring, little or no job training, insufficient housing and deficient basic life skills. Not surprisingly, two-thirds of those released from state prisons are rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within three years of release - two out of every three.  It is clearly in our best interest to help them reintegrate into the community and become productive, contributing members of our community. Specifically, The Reducing Recidivism and Second Chance Act of 2007 authorizes $216 million annually to: o Improve existing State and local government offender reentry programs by authorizing $50 million annually for the Department of Justice's State and local grant program,  incorporating best practices from the reentry field, and requiring the measuring and reporting of performance outcomes;  o Create new competitive grants for innovative programs to reduce recidivism.  The bill authorizes $130 million each year in new grants for State and local governments and private entities to develop and implement comprehensive substance abuse treatment programs, academic and vocational education programs, housing and job counseling programs, and mentoring for offenders who are approaching release or those who have been recently released.  The bill requires grantees to establish performance goals and benchmarks and report performance outcomes to Congress;             o Strengthen the Bureau of Prisons' ability to provide reentry services to federal prisoners and establish an elderly non-violent offender pilot program; and  o Authorize grants for research and best practices relating to innovative drug treatment methods, causes of recidivism, and methods to improve education and vocational training during incarceration.         According to Senator Biden, The Second Chance Act of 2007 could eventually save American taxpayers millions of dollars, given that, on average, the annual cost of incarcerating a prisoner exceeds $20,000, a number that increased six-fold between 1982 and 2002.  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts compares very well with the alternative -building more prisons for these ex-offenders to return to if they are unable to successfully reenter their communities.  An ounce of prevention, as they say, is worth a pound of cure.
