             July 20, 2007 
 Washington, DC - Delaware's Congressional Delegation, Senators Joe Biden (D-DE) and Tom Carper (D-DE) and Congressman Mike Castle (R-DE), today announced that the United States Department of Transportation has awarded $3.45 million in federal funding to Delaware Airpark for the continuation of land acquisition for a new runway and taxiway system.   Delaware Airpark (33N) is one of five airports operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority.  It is a 45-acre general aviation facility located in Cheswold, Delaware, just outside of Dover.  It serves the general aviation needs of central Delaware and the Capital city of Dover, including aircraft for the flight training program of Delaware State University.  The airport also is used by many to access Dover Downs International Speedway.  It has one existing east-west runway (9-27) with a parallel taxiway and a new terminal building with aircraft-maintenance and classroom facilities for Delaware State University.   "The Authority would like to thank Delaware's Congressional Delegation for their efforts to secure this vital federal funding," remarked James T. Johnson, Jr., Executive Director of the Delaware River and Bay Authority.  "General aviation facilities rely on federal funding for infrastructure enhancements and security improvements, which provide the foundation required for continued aviation success and business development growth.  The land acquisition program at the Delaware Airpark will facilitate a new east-west runway and parallel taxiway consistent with the airport's master plan."   The Congressional Delegation said of the funding, "These upgrades will serve the needs of a growing population in the greater Dover area. We'll soon have more pilots, operating more flights, in a safer atmosphere - one that will benefit the community for years to come."
