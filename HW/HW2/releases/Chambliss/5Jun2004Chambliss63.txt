SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  "Ronald Reagan was a product of what has been called the 'greatest generation.' He exemplified the duty, honor, courage and leadership with which that generation built our nation into the power we are today. As the leader of the free world, he brought liberty and freedom to millions of people and set a standard of leadership to which future Presidents aspire. Our thoughts and prayers are with Nancy and the whole Reagan family".
