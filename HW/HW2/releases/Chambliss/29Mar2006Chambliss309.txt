SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRAT NATIONAL SECURITY PLAN
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement regarding a new national security plan that Senate Democrats unveiled. 
  "Being tough on national security requires a lot more than election-year political posturing. The platform unveiled by the Democrats today offered a lot of talk but no specifics. It's more of the same from a party that has no ideas and no agenda other than to cut and run from Iraq. President Bush and the Republican majority in Congress have been aggressively working to provide our law enforcement, military and intelligence communities the necessary tools to prevent and disrupt future terrorist attacks, and America is safer today because of these efforts."
