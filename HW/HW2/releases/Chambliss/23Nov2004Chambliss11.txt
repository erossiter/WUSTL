SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER ANNOUNCE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS FOR ATLANTA-NORTH GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Zell Miller, D-Ga., today announced that several transportation projects in Atlanta and North Georgia will receive funding from the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "These funds will go a long way to helping ease metro Atlanta's traffic congestion," Chambliss said. "Hartsfield-Jackson is one of the busiest airports in the nation and MARTA is so important for thousands working and living in the Metro-Atlanta area. These funds will also help the hard working men and women working at Hartsfield-Jackson and MARTA do their important jobs making sure our transportation systems are safe and secure." 
   "These funds are a major win for the entire metropolitan area and for all who live, work and drive around Atlanta," Miller said. "Specifically, these important funds will provide much needed improvements for MARTA and Hartsfield-Jackson passengers. This money will help ensure that the Atlanta area remains a thriving economic center." 
   Specifically, the bill includes $3 million for Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to replace an aging cable loop that encases electrical wiring for the entire airfield lighting system and numerous other airfield functions.
