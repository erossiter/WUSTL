SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING BRAC COMMISSION VOTE ON FORT GILLEM
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement today regarding the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's vote to uphold an amended version of the Department of Defense recommendation that would close Fort Gillem. 
   "The BRAC Commission vote to close Fort Gillem is disappointing," said Chambliss. "Through numerous meetings, visits, phone calls and letters, members of Georgia's congressional delegation and Governor Sonny Perdue made a strong and forceful case to the Commission to keep Fort Gillem. Unfortunately, despite the data being on our side they maintained the decision to close the base. However, the Commission's amendment to require the 3 functions which will be enclaved at Fort Gillem, the Georgia Army National Guard, some units from the 81st Regional Readiness Command, and the Army's Criminal Investigation Division's Forensics Laboratory, to be enclaved "contiguously" will retain these important operations and permit more effective redevelopment of the rest of Fort Gillem by the local community. 
   "Now that this decision has been made we must do everything we can to work with the Fort Gillem community regarding redevelopment efforts so that the base's closure will not have a negative impact on the community." 
   The BRAC Commission's final recommendation regarding Fort Gillem will be included in a list of recommendations nationwide that will be sent by September 8, 2005, to President Bush for his approval. President Bush will then have until September 23, 2005, to accept or reject the recommendation in its totality - without the ability to change pieces of the recommendation. If accepted, Congress will have 45 legislative days to reject the recommendation in its entirety or it becomes binding.
