SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR CDC IN ATLANTA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Zell Miller, D-Ga., today announced that key construction funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta are included in the fiscal year 2005 omnibus appropriations bill which the Senate is expected to pass over the weekend.  
   The CDC will receive $250 million for building improvements in Atlanta. These are funds that Senators Chambliss and Miller fought hard all year to secure and will contribute to the CDC's master building improvement plan. 
   "The CDC employs the best and the brightest minds in the world, yet many of them are working in substandard research rooms," said Chambliss. "These important funds will modernize CDC's aging dilapidated buildings through the CDC's master construction and building improvement plan that has been underway for several years. Because these building improvements are so critical to the men and women working at the CDC, I am proud to have worked so hard to help secure these important funds." 
   "This funding is not just good news for the Centers for Disease Control, it's good news for the country," Miller said. "It is absolutely critical to the CDC and to our national security that this renovation moves forward so that we will be prepared to respond to public health emergencies. This is a wise investment."
