SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS 32 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the release of the latest national employment statistics showing 32 consecutive months of economic growth. Specifically, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm payroll employment increased by 138,000 net new jobs in April. Over the year ending in April, close to 2 million net new payroll jobs have been created. In addition, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent in April. 
   "These new numbers show that our economy continues to thrive, and we need to continue to ensure that this positive news is heard," said Chambliss. "America's business owners and entrepreneurs continue to drive our economy. However, we always have more to do to ensure that America's workers have opportunity to compete in the global economy, particularly as the demand for high-skilled jobs continues to rise. Our Republican majority in Congress will stay focused on policies to further this growth and we will reject any proposals that would stifle our growing economy."
