SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES SENATE REJECTION OF IRAQ TIMETABLE
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, today made the following statement following the Senate's vote to reject a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq.  
  "Today's vote to reject a timetable for pulling our troops out of Iraq was the right decision at this critical juncture in the global War on Terrorism. If we were to follow the lead of the naysayers and withdraw troops, al-Zarqawi would still be plotting against America. Our men and women in uniform who have put themselves in harm's way need to know that we support their dedication and professionalism in working with the Iraqi people to secure their country. We are a nation of our word, and we absolutely must stay committed to finish the job because the future of the Middle East as well as our own future security lies in the balance.
  "Having been to Iraq on four separate occasions, I have seen firsthand the tremendous job our soldiers are doing, and I strongly believe that despite what you read or hear in the news sometimes, it is absolutely clear we are winning the war in Iraq. Now is the time to give all of our support to the American military and to the Iraqi people when we are moving in a positive direction and we have positive signs on the ground of how we're winning the war. It's not the time to stand on the street corner and say that we're going to be leaving Iraq next week, next month, next year. That is absolutely the wrong message to send to the world and it's a wrong message to send to the terrorists."
