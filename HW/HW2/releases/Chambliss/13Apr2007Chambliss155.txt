WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  April 3rd FairTax rally in Atlanta.
   Dear Friends,
   The Senate is back in session following the Easter recess and has begun consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Bill. Prior to the recess, I traveled to various areas of the state. Getting out on the road and talking with Georgians is no doubt the part of my job I love the most. I hope you will continue to stay in touch with me about the issues and concerns that are most important to your family and your local community. Please take a few minutes to read over my notes from the road and this past week's legislative items. 
   MIDDLE GEORGIA EVENTS
   On Sunday, April 1, I was pleased to join Reverend Ronald Terry and the congregation of New Fellowship Baptist Church in Macon for a groundbreaking celebration as construction commenced on their new worship center.

   Additionally, I had the privilege of speaking to members of the Macon Rotary Club last Monday, April 9, where I gave a congressional update and visited with folks in the Middle Georgia community.

   VISIT TO COLUMBUS, FORT BENNING, & NEWNAN
   On Monday, April 2, I spent time in the Columbus area, where I started out the morning with a tour of Kodak's Columbus manufacturing facility, which is one of the world's largest producers of printing plate material. I applaud the hard-working employees for their dedication to making the facility one of Georgia's top manufacturers.
   Following my tour of the Kodak facility, I spent the rest of the morning at Fort Benning, where I received several briefings and a tour of Martin Army Medical Center. There is no question the brave men and women who defend our freedoms and liberty deserve the very best in medical care, and I was pleased to hear about the many efforts being made at Fort Benning to provide these services. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and a proud supporter of our military community, the health of our troops returning from theater is a top priority of mine. I had the opportunity to visit with Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski and Col. Margaret Rivera, and I appreciate the great service they continue to provide to Georgia and to our country.

   I was also privileged to tour production lines at the Yamaha Motor Manufacturing Corporation plant in Newnan. The facility employs more than 1,000 hard-working Georgians and consists of three plants that manufacture four different recreational products including Golf Cars, All Terrain Vehicles (ATV's), Personal Watercraft and SidexSide utility vehicles. 
   GEORGIANS RALLY FOR FAIRTAX LEGISLATION
   As April 15 approaches this weekend, it is painfully clear that our current tax system is cumbersome and overly complicated. Quite frankly, I believe we need to rip it up by the roots and start over. I recently announced that I have re-introduced the FairTax legislation in the U.S. Senate. While I was in Georgia, I was joined U.S. Rep. John Linder, U.S. Rep. Tom Price, Ken Hoagland of Americans for Fair Taxation, and Georgia businessman Herman Cain to rally support for the legislation. 
   Prior to the rally, Congressman Linder, who is the sponsor of the FairTax legislation in the U.S. House, and I joined radio host Neal Boortz in his studio to promote the legislation. Grassroots support for the FairTax continues to grow, and this legislation would bring fairness and simplicity to our tax code - and that's what taxpayers deserve.

   ATLANTA AREA CHAMBER & ROTARY CLUB MEETINGS
   During the Easter recess week I also spoke to members of the Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce as well as several Rotary Club meetings. I appreciated the opportunity to give a congressional update, and I addressed the issues pertaining to illegal immigration, the war in Iraq, and stem cell research among others.

   WAYCROSS AREA VISIT
   While I was in the Waycross area, I visited the campus of Waycross College, where I had the opportunity to meet with students, faculty and staff. We discussed current issues such as immigration reform and No Child Left Behind reauthorization. I was also privileged to speak to members of the Waycross-Ware County Chamber of Commerce during a lunch meeting, where we discussed local and national issues. 
   FIELD HEARING HELD AT ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK
   On Tuesday, April 10, I chaired a field hearing at the Atlanta Community Food Bank to address questions and concerns regarding the federal food and nutrition assistance programs to be included in the next farm bill. Nutrition is an important, yet often overlooked component of the farm bill. Our nutrition assistance programs play a key role in ensuring that Americans have access to the food they need to lead healthy, productive lives. The food stamp program, which is included in the farm bill, provides food assistance to millions of Americans and I believe it is important that we reform the food stamp program so it encourages families to utilize the financial investment tools to help them achieve long-term financial independence. We need to provide needy families with resources to help them get back on their feet and prosper, rather than providing a band-aid for their situation.
   I commend Bill Bolling, Founder and Executive Director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank and his hard-working staff for hosting the hearing.

   SUPPORT FOR ISAKSON-COLEMAN STEM CELL BILL
   This past week the U.S. Senate debated the issue of stem cell research. This issue is personal on many levels, and with each year that passes we continue to learn more and more about this area of research. I was pleased the Senate passed the legislation introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN). I was a cosponsor of their bill and I believe the approach they came up with is an effective way to provide for advancements in science and give hope to those who are waiting for cures without compromising the value of life.
   "The Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research (HOPE) Act," or S. 30, allows science to move forward in an ethical and moral way by permitting federal funding of scientific research that does not harm embryos, such as deriving cells from amniotic fluid and placentas, and from embryos that have died naturally and therefore would never be used for fertilization.
   Many of us have personally benefited or have family members who have benefited from the advancements made in modern medicine over the past few years. We are all grateful for the progress that has been made and it is my most sincere hope that we continue to see monumental steps made in medical research, and that we find cures for those suffering from diseases such as juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and spinal cord injuries.
   The Senate also passed S. 5, a separate stem cell research bill. I voted against S. 5 because it does not ensure protection of viable embryos. President Bush vetoed a similar bill last year and is expected veto S. 5 when it reaches his desk for final approval.

   As always, should you need assistance with a federal agency or any issue, or if I can be of assistance in any way, please do not hesitate to contact my office toll free at 1-800-234-4208.
   May God bless you all and may God bless America.
