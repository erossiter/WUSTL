  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today praised President Bush's appointment of U.S. Iraq Ambassador, John Negroponte, to serve as Director of National Intelligence. 
   "I am very pleased with President Bush's nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to serve as our nation's first Director of National Intelligence as well as the nomination of Lt. Gen. Mike Hayden to serve as the Deputy Director. Both candidates are extremely experienced and capable nominees and I am fully confident in their abilities to effectively reorganize our intelligence community. 
   "I had the opportunity to speak with John today by telephone and committed to work with him during the confirmation process. He and I have a longstanding and positive working relationship and I am pleased to support his nomination. I have also worked closely with Lt. Gen. Hayden during my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee and am confident that both of these men will be steadfast in their efforts as we fight and win the war on terror. Both candidates can expect my full support throughout the confirmation proceedings."
