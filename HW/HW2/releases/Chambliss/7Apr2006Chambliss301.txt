SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADJOURNMENT OF SENATE
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss today released the following statement: 
  "I am disappointed that we were unable to get a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill passed in the Senate, but at the end of the day the last product we had was not satisfactory to me or to a lot of folks who are really concerned about this immigration issue. And frankly, the Democrats have been stalling us for a week by not allowing us to put up our amendments for a vote. My amendments have been filed for a week and they would not allow me to call an amendment up. So while I was disappointed, at least we did not pass a bad bill. A bill that has amnesty in it is not the right way to go. I am cautiously optimistic that we can have something when we get back that we can work with."
