SEN. CHAMBLISS: LINE-ITEM VETO WOULD PROTECT TAXPAYERS, BRING FISCAL RESTRAINT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today joined with his colleagues in the Untied States Senate and national grassroots citizen advocacy groups by calling for a vote on line-item veto legislation that would grant the President of the United States the authority to eliminate wasteful federal spending from bills the Congress has already approved.  
  "We must do everything possible to stop the runaway spending in Washington," said Chambliss. "The line-item veto will help defend American taxpayers against wasteful federal spending and bring fiscal restraint to the federal spending process." 
  The measure S.J.Res.25 is supported by Senators Chambliss, Jim Talent, R-Mo., George Allen, R-Va., Norm Coleman, R-Mn., and Jim DeMint, R-Sc. The legislation is also endorsed by the Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Taxpayers Union. Additionally, Chambliss is a supporter of legislation authored by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006.
  The line-item veto continues to have strong bipartisan support. In 1996, the Senate and House overwhelmingly voted to pass it. The Line Item Veto Act was signed into law on April 9, 1996 and became effective January 1, 1997. President Clinton first invoked the new authority on August 11, 1997, and used the line item veto a total of 82 times before it was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 25, 1998.
  Supporters of the line-item veto say it would be an effective tool to reduce federal spending because it gives Presidents a greater role in the appropriations process, allowing them to be held accountable for the budget, particularly for wasteful spending.
