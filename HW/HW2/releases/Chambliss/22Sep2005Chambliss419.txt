SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON HAIL MILITARY FUNDS FOR MCLB-ALBANY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of the Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill, which provides important funds for military construction at Georgia's Bases and for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  
 The Bill includes $4 million for key military construction funds for Marine Corp Logistics Base, in Albany, Georgia. 
  Specifically, MCLB will receive $4 million for Combat Vehicle Maintenance and Preservation Facility 
   "All the men and women at MCLB Albany play such an important role in the national security of the United States," said Chambliss. "These important funds will help the base and our military men and women at MCLB carry out their important jobs." 
  "This investment at MCLB Albany is very good news for Georgia," Isakson said. "MCLB Albany plays a key role in the security of our nation, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington."
   Additionally, the bill includes over $70.7 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including key funds for the health care needs for America's Veterans.
  "I can think of no higher priority than caring for our nation's Veterans who were wounded in their service to our Nation," said Chambliss. "America's Veterans have made great sacrifices to ensure that we call live in a safe and secure America and for the Freedom we all enjoy. It's only right that we do all we can for our Veterans." 
   Now that the bill has passed the senate, the legislation will now move to a joint House-Senate Conference Committee, where differences between the two chamber's versions will be ironed out.
