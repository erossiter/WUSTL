GEORGIA LAWMAKERS URGE DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD TO RETAIN FT. GILLEM COMMISSARY, POST-EXCHANGE
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Georgia Gov.  
 Sonny Perdue are urging Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to retain the commissary and post-exchange complex at Ft. Gillem in light of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round, which called for the closure of Ft. McPherson, Ft. Gillen, and Naval Air Station Atlanta. 
   The lawmakers made their request on behalf of over 36,000 retired military personnel, their over 54,000 family members, in addition to over 15,000 National Guardsmen and Reservists in the metro-Atlanta area, as well as the active duty personnel who are not being relocated, who rely heavily on the facilities. 
   The lawmakers cited two successful precedents for continuing the operation of base commissaries and post-exchanges from previous BRAC round closures: Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana and Fort Ord, California. 
   "In light of these successful precedents of the Department of Defense continuing to take care of service members of all components and status after a BRAC round, we strongly urge you to maintain the commissary and exchange at Fort Gillem," the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Rumsfeld.
