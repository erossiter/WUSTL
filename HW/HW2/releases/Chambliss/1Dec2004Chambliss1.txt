WEEKLY EMAIL UPDATE FROM SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss just returned from meetings with U.S. and Georgia troops stationed in the Middle East.  
  Chambliss, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, spent Thanksgiving Day in Baghdad and Afghanistan. He had the great opportunity to meet with many soldiers from Georgia, handed out scores of Georgia peanuts, AT&T calling cards, and hand-made greeting cards from Georgia school children. 
   During each visit with U.S. troops, Chambliss thanked the soldiers for their hard work, sacrifice and services to our nation. He also praised them for their commitment on the frontlines of the war on terrorism.
   Throughout Chambliss' trip, he met with several Georgians including many from Atlanta, Albany, Blackshear, Columbus, Madison, Lithonia and Pike County and Walton Counties. 
   U.S. Senators John Kyl (R-AZ), and Ben Nelson (D-NE) joined Chambliss' delegation, which visited Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Germany in four days. 
   During visits with U.S. troops, Chambliss expressed his deep appreciation for their sacrifices, their efforts, and their willingness to keep our nation safe and secure. Chambliss said the soldiers he met with are working 7 days a week, around the clock undertaking a massive effort to root out terrorists, provide security, train Iraqis and Afghanis and rebuild these two countries that have suffered so much over the last 25-30 years. 
  At a military hospital in Germany, Chambliss met soldiers just injured in Iraq. While the injuries are bad, Chambliss said the soldiers' morale was positive and he couldn't have been more proud to look them in the eye, shake their hands, and say thank you.
