SEN. CHAMBLISS FOCUSES ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSERVATION PROGRAMS DURING HEARING
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) received testimony today during a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing that continued committee oversight of the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Last June, Sen. Chambliss held a hearing on the effectiveness of all conservation programs, including CSP and EQIP.  
  "EQIP is doing an excellent job of helping to solve agriculture's environmental challenges," said Sen. Chambliss, Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Perhaps I am biased, but my state truly is doing a great job of using Farm Bill programs to put conservation on the ground and keep producers on the land. Those states having trouble with conservation should look to Georgia. It is a model of cooperation, science-based decision making and tangible conservation results." 
  Testifying at the hearing today was Jim Ham, a Georgia farmer and President of the Georgia Association of Conservation District Supervisors. He has worked extensively with state conservationists, the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
  CSP was created in the 2002 Farm Bill and is a voluntary conservation program that pays producers for their ongoing conservation efforts. In FY 2006, 58 CSP contracts were awarded in Georgia worth nearly $14.4 million. The EQIP program was created in 1996 Farm Bill to promote the compatibility of agricultural production and environmental quality by providing producers with financial and technical assistance. In FY 2006, 1,084 EQIP contracts were awarded in Georgia worth over $14.7 million.
