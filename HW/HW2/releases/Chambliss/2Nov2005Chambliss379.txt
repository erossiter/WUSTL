SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR GEORGIA PUBLIC BROADCASTING
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission in Atlanta will receive a $35,000 grant for Georgia Public Broadcasting to support locally based literacy activities.  
   The grant is part of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's Ready to Lead in Literacy initiative. A large part of public broadcasting's most important work occurs not on the screen, but in communities across the nation. Local public television stations are a link that connects parents, teachers and caregivers to the rich educational programs and resources offered by public broadcasting.
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend Georgia Public Broadcasting for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for Ready to Lead in Literacy, which will help our youth meet one of our most important educational needs in this nation - the ability to read," said Isakson.
   The Georgia Public Broadcasting's three-tiered Read to Lead in Literacy program is a building taskforce to examine, develop and implement creative new ways to meet the educational preparedness needs of Georgia's youngest learners. In addition, Georgia Public Broadcasting is partnering with organizations to collaborate on developing new services to enhance early childhood education and family literacy and broadcasting 11.5 hours of Ready to Learn programming.
