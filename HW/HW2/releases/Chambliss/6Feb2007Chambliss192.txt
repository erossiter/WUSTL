SEN. CHAMBLISS ADDRESSES AMERICAN SUGARBEET ASSOCIATION AT ANNUAL MEETING
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today spoke to nearly 250 members of the American Sugarbeet Growers Association (ASGA) at their annual meeting in Washington. Sen. Chambliss discussed the reauthorization process for the upcoming farm bill and trade issues.  
  "Drafting agriculture policy is a bipartisan process and I plan to be actively engaged in discussions with members of the Agriculture Committee as we work toward developing the next farm bill," said Sen. Chambliss. "It will be a challenging process, considering the many competing priorities not only within the agricultural community itself, but also external forces such as budget and trade. Sugar should be involved in this process as we move forward. As these discussions continue, I hope that all components of agriculture - commodity, conservation, rural development, nutrition, and other groups - can work together in a positive way." 
  The ASGA represents 10,000 farmers in 11 states including: California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. The sugarbeet industry accounts for nearly 54 percent of domestically-produced sugar and has created nearly 372,000 direct and indirect jobs in 42 states.
