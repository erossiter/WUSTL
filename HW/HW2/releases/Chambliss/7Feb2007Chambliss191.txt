SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS PLAN TO BUILD GEORGIA'S FIRST CELLULOSIC ETHANOL PLANT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today applauded plans to build first wood-based ethanol plant in Treutlen County. Range Fuels, Inc., a Colorado-based cellulosic ethanol company, will have the capacity to create nearly 70 new jobs.  
   "I am pleased to announce plans for 's first cellulosic ethanol plant," said Sen. Chambliss. "Agriculture and energy policy are converging and unlike anytime in the past, farmers and ranchers are producing food, fiber and fuel. I've introduced legislation to promote the production of cellulosic ethanol from renewable resources available to us here in. Renewable fuels are at the heart of 's energy security, economic growth and job production and now our farmers will have a key role in securing our national fuel supply." 
   Last month, Sen. Chambliss introduced the Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act, which would promote regional diversity in the production of biofuels. The plan requires a minimum level of production within a particular region to accelerate the production of cellulosic ethanol from a variety of resources such as wood chips in Southeast to wheat straw on the Great Plains . The legislation would also accelerate the minimum quantity derived from cellulosic biomass in the Renewable Fuels Standard, currently 250 million gallons, from 2013 to 2010.
