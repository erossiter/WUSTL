SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement following the address of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before a Joint Session of Congress: 
  "Prime Minister Olmert gave a moving and powerful address before the U.S. Congress this morning, which I was privileged to attend. Our countries indeed share common principles and a strong commitment to confront terrorism and secure a better future for the world. The Prime Minister is right: we will not tolerate terrorism in any form. 
  "The people of Israel have been a steadfast ally of the United States, particularly during critical times. As the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, Israel is an important foundation of stability in the region. The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is important to the peace and security of not only the Middle East, but the rest of the world. I endorse and am committed to the Prime Minister's call to educating the next generation of replacing the culture of hate - only then do we have a chance to bring the possibility of peace in the future. 
  "In light of continued statements by the President of Iran, we will stand ready to assist our friends, the Israelis, to promote peace, fight terrorism, and prevent hostile countries who sponsor terrorism from obtaining nuclear weapons."
