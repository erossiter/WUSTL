SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONCURRENT RECEIPT
  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I want to discuss Senator Reid's amendment, which would permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both their full military retired pay and disability compensation. 
   On March 27th I held a Personnel Subcommittee hearing with my colleague Senator Nelson specifically about this issue of concurrent receipt. Our colleague, Senator Reid of Nevada was the first to testify and he was followed by Undersecretaries Dan Cooper and Charlie Able and several experts from the General Accounting Office, Congressional Budget Office, and various veterans groups. There was a lot to learn about the intricacies of federal benefits and compensation, but ultimately the hearing reinforced the fact that this legislation is extraordinarily complex and expensive.
   All said though, I intend to support this amendment because this compensation is long overdue for our nations' veterans. It is unfortunate that the cost of concurrent receipt is so high, but America's veterans have earned their benefits through their long service to our nation.
   Last year, Congress funded a form of special compensation for retired soldiers who had certain combat-related disabilities. The first check for this limited compensation will be cut on July 1st, 2003, and this is good news for those veterans who qualify. This is an important step in the fight to help our nation's veterans but we must do more.
   These benefits for veterans and their families are important and we should honor those who interrupted their lives and the lives of their families to defend this country and preserve our freedom. With that Mr. President, I yield the floor.
