SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS APPLAUD AUTHORIZATION OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR RESPONSE TO FIRES IN BRANTLEY COUNTY
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised authorization of federal funding to respond to another wildfire near Nahunta, Ga., in Brantley County. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue made the request Thursday, and funding has been made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  
   "I am very pleased that the citizens of Brantley County will be able to take advantage of this federal assistance as they recover from these widespread fires," said Isakson. "I applaud the heroic efforts of the emergency personnel and the firefighters who are battling this unwieldy and fast-spreading fire to protect our citizens, and I join with Senator Chambliss in crediting Governor Perdue's quick action in seeking federal aid for the region."
   "This is certainly welcome news for those who will need a helping hand in recovering from the wildfires," said Senator Chambliss. "We are all extremely grateful for the firefighters, forestry personnel, and many, many others who have been working relentlessly to contain the fires and protect our citizens. Additionally, I appreciate Governor Perdue's action in requesting the assistance to help in these efforts." 
   The fire is threatening 150 homes as well as 75 businesses and critical infrastructure. As a result, more than 400 individuals have been displaced. More than 100 firefighters are battling the blaze, using equipment including state tractors and state and U.S. Forest Service aircraft.
   On April 18, federal funding was authorized to respond to the fires in Southeast Georgia near Waycross, Ga., in Ware County and the Okefenokee Swamp that have affected some 60,000 acres of federal, state and private land. Funding was made available through FEMA, and the authorization includes a 75 percent federal cost share to be applied to all fire management assistance grants.
