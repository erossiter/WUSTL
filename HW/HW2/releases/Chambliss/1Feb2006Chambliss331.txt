SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES SENATE CONFIRMATION OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALITO
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to become the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court."  
   "I am honored to join the majority of my colleagues in the United States Senate in a strong vote to approve Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court," said Chambliss. 
   "Unwavering fidelity to the Constitution and commitment to the Rule of Law are absolute requirements of any jurist. Judge Alito has demonstrated these characteristics throughout his career and has the proven ability and qualifications to serve the American people on our nation's highest court. 
   "In only six short months, President Bush has been called on to nominate not one, but two, Supreme Court Justices. He showed a great deal of wisdom in nominating John Roberts and Samuel Alito and I am proud to have voted in favor of both of these outstanding individuals." 
   "I am also pleased by yesterday's bipartisan rejection of the shrill attempt by the ideological extreme of the Democrat party to obstruct by filibuster the important work of the Senate. I am hopeful that the same bipartisan coalition will assure swift reenactment of the PATRIOT Act which is vital to nation's security at a time when Osama bin Laden has vowed to strike again. The stakes are simply too high to play partisan or ideological games with this important legislation."
