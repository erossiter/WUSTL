SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON WHITE HOUSE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a former member of the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement regarding President George W. Bush's nomination of Judge John Roberts to the United States Supreme Court.  
 Roberts has been nominated to fill the vacancy of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Conner, who announced her retirement early this month. 
   "I applaud President Bush's nomination of Judge Roberts to the Supreme Court. His strong legal intellect and experience on the federal bench make Judge Roberts a great candidate for the job. Judge Roberts is highly professional, qualified, and has the right temperament to serve on our nation's highest Court. 
   "Through his many years of public service, Judge Roberts has demonstrated his faithfulness to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Because a Supreme Court Justice serves a lifetime appointment, it's critical that this vacancy, and all future vacancies, be filled with individuals who will strictly interpret the United States Constitution and not legislate from the federal bench. 
   "I am confident that President Bush has selected Roberts because of his proven track record of applying the law as written and not making policy from the bench. I look forward to working with my colleagues as the Senate begins its Constitutional responsibility regarding the confirmation process."
