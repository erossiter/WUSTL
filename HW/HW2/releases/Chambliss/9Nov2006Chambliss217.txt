  In honor of Veterans Day, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement honoring the many veterans across Georgia and across the country:  
  "This week, we pay tribute to our nation's veterans for their service to the United States. Our veterans in Georgia and all across this great country have earned our unwavering support. They have put themselves in harm's way to secure freedom and liberty for all, and generations of soldiers have ensured that this nation we love remains the greatest nation in the world. While military conflicts and threats change over time, the professionalism and determination of our soldiers remains constant. 
  "Georgia has a strong history of bravery and valor in the armed services, and I am very proud to represent our strong military state that is home to13 military installations and more than 700,000 veterans. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue working to ensure that our veterans' needs are a top priority in the United States Senate and that they receive the benefits they've earned. God bless the brave men and women now serving, God bless those who have served before, and God bless America."
