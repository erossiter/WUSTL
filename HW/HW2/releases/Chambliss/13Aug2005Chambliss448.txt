SEN. CHAMBLISS MEETS WITH RUSSIAN COUNTERPART FOR COMMISSION ON POW/MIAs
  Sen. Chambliss, R-Ga., co-chairman of the US-Russia Joint Commission on POWs/MIA's, met with his Russian counterpart, General Vladimir Anato'yevich Shamanov (ret), Chairman of the Russian Interagency Commission on POWs, Internees, and MIAs, in Moscow on Monday, August 15, 2005. 
   "I look forward to establishing a friendship and dialog that will move us forward in pursuing our mutual interests in determining the status and disposition of missing military personnel," said Chambliss. "While establishing the accountability of so many missing Americans is important, it is also critical work on behalf of the many, many POW/MIAs families."
   Shamanov, who also carries the title of Assistant to the Prime-Minister, commented that he was moved by the passion with which the U.S. pursued issues surrounding missing personnel. Shamanov said that the Russian Government also takes the subject of missing service members very seriously and he is proud to have been appointed to this position by President Putin.
   Shamanov indicated that there should be no limits to U.S. Russian cooperation on POWs/MIAs, and reaffirmed support to making available Vietnam-era documents pertaining to missing U.S. service members.
   Both sides agreed to identify key issues to discuss at future meetings with Sen. Chambliss acknowledging the commitment to pursue the important work of the Commission, extending an invitation to General Shamanov, and offering to host another meeting in the U.S.
