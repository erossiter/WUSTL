SEN. CHAMBLISS QUESTIONS SECRETARY JOHANNS ON USDA FARM BILL PROPOSAL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today asked U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns a series of questions at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. Sen. Chambliss focused many of his questions on the specific effects that the Administration's farm bill proposal will have on Georgia agriculture.  
  "I dedicated much of 2006 to preparing for reauthorization of the farm bill, and this Committee spent many hours in field hearings listening to producers about their farm bill needs," said Sen. Chambliss in his opening statement. "Secretary Johanns held his own listening sessions around the country and points to those sessions in his development of the Administration's farm bill proposals. This hearing today is an important step toward farm bill reauthorization, in that it will allow us to explore the justifications for the Secretary's specific proposals and engage in a dialogue about impacts the proposal could have on this nation's farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and the agricultural economy."
  Last week, the USDA announced a series of recommendations for the next farm bill. Sen. Chambliss said that while he values the Secretary's recommendations, ultimately it is up to Congress to write comprehensive farm policy. He said that Congress will have the final say and set the final spending limits in the farm bill. 
  "Certainly there are a lot of challenges ahead of us as we work to complete the farm bill before portions of it expire," Sen. Chambliss said. "But I trust that we can work in a bipartisan manner to reach a consensus that will prove beneficial for each of our states and constituencies."
