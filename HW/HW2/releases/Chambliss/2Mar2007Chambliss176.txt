SEN. CHAMBLISS: C-17 HAS LONG HISTORY OF CONTRIBUTION TO SUCCESSFUL MILITARY OPERATIONS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement regarding the Boeing Corporation's announcement that it will stop procurement of parts for any new C-17 not currently under contract: 
  "The C-17 is a critical aircraft and has contributed to the success of multiple military efforts throughout its history with the Air Force. This cargo plane has not only helped our soldiers on the battlefield, but played a critical role in delivering supplies to assist relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in south Asia and the earthquake in Pakistan. Employing the use of the C-17 would not be possible were it not for the large number of civilian and military personnel who help build this aircraft at the Boeing facility in Macon and maintain it at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center. These men and women do an outstanding job, paying close attention to detail and taking very seriously their role in production and maintenance. Throughout my tenure in Congress I have always been a very strong supporter of the C-17 program. I am disappointed with today's announcement, but will continue to support the C-17 program and work to ensure that our military has the air mobility assets needed to conduct their missions."
