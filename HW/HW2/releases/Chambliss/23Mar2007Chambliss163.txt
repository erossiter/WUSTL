SEN. CHAMBLISS OPPOSES BUDGET RESOLUTION CONTAINING LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement regarding passage of the Democrats' budget resolution: 
   "This is a typical tax and spend budget that the American people cannot afford, and the massive tax increases proposed will stifle our economic growth. Raising taxes on the backs of hard-working Georgians and Americans is not the right approach for this country. In addition, this budget fails to reign in federal spending, address entitlement reform, and ensure the long term solvency of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid." 
   The Democrats' budget:
   * Fails to extend all of the tax relief Republicans have passed, imposing a more than $700 billion tax increase over the next five years, the largest tax increase in U.S. history; 
   * Increases non-defense discretionary spending by approximately $150 billion over the next five years; 
   * Relies on closing the "tax gap" to provide as much as $300 billion a year in revenue, an amount that is both grossly overstated and impossible to collect; and 
   * Makes no attempt to reduce entitlement growth, leaving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on a path to bankruptcy.
