SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO UPDATE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today applauded the Committee's passage of legislation to update and improve the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  
   "I was pleased to see my colleagues come together to create a bi-partisan FISA reform bill that I could ultimately support," said Chambliss. "It is critical that Congress enact FISA legislation to ensure that our Intelligence Community has the tools and the legal framework necessary to protect our country from terrorist attacks and to collect vital foreign intelligence information. I was also pleased to see the Committee take responsible action by providing our telecommunications carriers with liability relief. The government often needs assistance from the private sector in order to provide national security and in return they should be able to rely on the government's assurances. Although not perfect, this legislation is a step in the right direction and I look forward to continuing work on FISA."
