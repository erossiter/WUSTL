SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES ON-LINE VETERAN RESOURCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. today announced that Veterans and their families can now take advantage of a free eLearning program that teaches Veterans and their families the skills necessary to be successful entrepreneurs. 
  The program is available through The Veterans Corporation (TVC), a 501(c) (3) organization created by Congress in 1999. TVC's eLearning Center is an online program that offers more than a thousand courses designed to foster three essential kinds of business skills: basic skills, entrepreneurial skills, and career skills.
   The program receives support from several groups including the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, WestHall Alliance, Learning Express, Knowledge Institute, and Technology Business Solutions.
   "Creating the 'eLearning Center' is a team effort between entrepreneurial professionals and adult literacy experts providing Veterans with the best business courses and services that can be offered online," said Walt Blackwell, President and CEO of TVC.
  "The Veterans Cooperation's eLearning Center, along with other important programs they offer, is a very tangible expression of our appreciation for their service and sacrifice to this country," said Chambliss. "America's veterans have made great sacrifices for our freedom and it is only right that we do all we can for them."
   The online courses are free through October 15, 2005, to all who sign up. 
   For more information and to access the eLearning Center, visit TVC's homepage at www.veteranscorp.org.
