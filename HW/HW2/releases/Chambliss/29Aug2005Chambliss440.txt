SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES MIDDLE GEORGIA REGIONAL AIRPORT FUNDS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today announced that the Middle Georgia Regional Airport in Macon will receive grant funds in the amount of $507,691 from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   The funds will be awarded under the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP). Middle Georgia Regional Airport is the sole recipient in the state of Georgia. The grant is one of several issued by the SCASDP aimed at helping small airports confront local air service obstacles such as high fares and inadequate levels of service.
   "I am pleased to see Middle Georgia Regional Airport receive the money necessary to better serve Georgians and Georgia visitors," said Chambliss. "These funds will help attract business, improve efficiency and service in this thriving region."
   The project will create a marketing program to increase use of the air services at Middle Georgia Regional and promote financial incentives for airlines to serve the community. Local sources will contribute an additional $60,000.
