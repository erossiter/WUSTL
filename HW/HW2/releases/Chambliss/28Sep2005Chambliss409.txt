SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF AMERICA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Boys & Girls Club of America will receive $496,000 to support its "Bridging the Digital Divide for At-Risk Youth in Boys & Girls Clubs" program. 
   The U.S. Department of Education will distribute the funding as part of the Fund for the Improvement of Education Program.
   This project will provide local clubs with the technology, staff training and support systems they need to ensure their Club members can become successful and productive citizens. The project aims to decrease the negative impacts of the "digital divide" through the installation and use of new technology centers, and provide a comprehensive technology program that enables Club members to become computer and internet literate.
  "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "The young people of the Boys & Girls Club will now have the opportunity to learn the skills needed to advance in an increasingly digital world."
   "It is important for all of our youth to become well versed in computer and internet technology if they are to succeed in the future," said Isakson. "I am pleased to announce this grant for the Boys and Girls Club."
   The technology revolution currently does not reach a large segment of our population that has little or no access to personal computers or the internet. 
   For more information please contact the Chambliss press office 202-224-3423 or the Isakson press office at 202-224-7777.
