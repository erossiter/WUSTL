SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON PRAISE APPROVAL OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR CHARLTON COUNTY TO RESPOND TO WILDFIRES
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency's approval of a request for a Fire Management Assistance declaration for the Bugaboo Scrub Fire, currently burning uncontrolled near the Moniac and Saint George communities in Charlton County.  
   "This assistance is greatly needed and it is welcome news," said Senator Chambliss, who traveled to the Southeast part of the state last week to view the response efforts. "The wildfires have taken a tremendous toll on our state, and I commend the outstanding efforts of our firefighters, forestry rangers, officials, and the many others who have been working relentlessly to contain the fires and protect our communities." 
   "This is very good news for Charlton County and I commend the swift action by the Governor's office and by FEMA. I am grateful to all of the firefighters for their heroic work in continuing to battle this fire," Senator Isakson said.
   On Wednesday, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency Operations Director Charles Dawson made a request for the declaration. The state's request was based on the fire's threat to the communities, including approximately 200 residences, and other facilities, as well as other critical concerns.
