SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON COMMENTS ON CDC CONSTRUCTION FUNDS INCLUDED IN THE PRESIDENT'S 2006 BUDGET
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., commented on construction funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that were included in President George W. Bush's fiscal year 2006 federal budget.  
 The President's budget calls for $30 million in CDC construction and building improvement funds. 
   While the Senators said CDC funds included in the President's budget are historically lower than the amount Congress actually appropriates, both Chambliss and Isakson pledged to work hard throughout the year long federal appropriations process - as they do every year - to ensure the CDC has the resources it needs. For example, last year the President's budget called for $81.5 million in construction funds, yet Congress actually appropriated $272 million. 
   "We are only in the beginning of the process and we intend to work hard all year to ensure the CDC receives the critical resources they need," said Chambliss. "The CDC employs the best and brightest in the world and these hard working men and women carry out important missions. It's only right that Congress does our part to ensure they have the right resources." 
   "It is absolutely critical to the CDC and to our national security that this renovation moves forward," said Isakson. "We will work hard to ensure the CDC has the right resources to respond to public health emergencies."
   While the President's budget does not actually appropriate funds, it does kick off the year long federal appropriations process where Congress fills in the details.
