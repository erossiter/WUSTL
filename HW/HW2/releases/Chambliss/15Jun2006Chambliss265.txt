SEN. CHAMBLISS: SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE REPORT BETTER REFLECTS WAR PRIORITIES, FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today released the following statement regarding Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Supplemental Conference Report. Chambliss voted in support of the legislation, which has also been approved by the U.S. House and now goes to President Bush for his signature. 
  "I am pleased the House and Senate were able to negotiate a package the President will sign that reflects the critical needs of our military personnel who are fighting the war on terrorism but at the same time holds the line on spending. This bill provides the necessary funding for our continued operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terrorism, and additional emergencies. Our men and women in uniform carry out their missions each and every day with courage, dedication, and professionalism, and the resources provided for in this bill will ensure that they are able to fulfill their duties."
  Chambliss voted against the first version of the supplemental appropriations bill passed in May, citing the enormous cost of the bill due to spending unrelated to the war efforts and other emergency needs. President Bush had threatened a veto of the bill if the conference committee did not reduce the price tag of the bill.
