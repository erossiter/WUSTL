SEN. CHAMBLISS: DECADE OF DEMOCRAT OBSTRUCTION HAS CREATED ENERGY PROBLEMS OF TODAY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss today made the following statement following the release of the Republican Gas Price Relief and Rebate Act:  
  It is astounding to me that Democrats blame the President and Republicans for high gas prices when it is actually the Democrats who have been blocking new energy development for more than a decade. President Clinton vetoed domestic oil exploration in ANWR years ago, and Democrats in Congress have continued to obstruct efforts to move forward with this initiative. They have blocked numerous other proposals to expand our energy capacity such as expanding refining capacity and nuclear power. 
  Despite these many roadblocks, it is Republicans in Congress who took action to address our energy needs by passing a comprehensive energy bill that will allow us to become energy independent in the long term. The plan we have unveiled today will help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil, will shift that dependence to renewable energy sources and will provide relief to Americans who are feeling the pinch at the pump with a $100 gas rebate check and provide tax credits to those who purchase hybrid vehicles. 
  The high prices consumers are facing at the pump today are based on the simple laws of supply and demand, and time has proven that blocking all energy growth harms the American consumer and the American economy.
