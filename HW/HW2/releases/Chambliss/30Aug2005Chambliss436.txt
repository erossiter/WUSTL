SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR COLLEGE PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the College Park Police Department will receive a $32,198 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to aid in local law enforcement needs. 
   The U.S. Department of Justice's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) will distribute the funding. JAG allows local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. 
   The College Park Police Department will receive $32,198 in funds to purchase Digital In-Car Video Recorders for the Police Department's fleet and portable radios for the officers. 
   "This important program will fund a crucial community initiative in College Park to better equip our first responders," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
  "This funding will go a long way to help ensure that College Park's first responders have the resources necessary to protect their community," said Isakson. "This grant fills an important need for the Police Department."
