SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING RESIGNATION OF CIA DIRECTOR GOSS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today made the following statement regarding the resignation of Central Intelligence Agency Director Porter Goss: 
  "Porter Goss has been my friend, colleague, and mentor in the world of intelligence for many years, from the time we served together as House members and when we served on the House Intelligence Committee. The Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee I chaired was put at the forefront after the 9/11 attacks. As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Porter's breadth and depth of knowledge proved of immense value to us.
  "The tumultuous period that followed, with the intelligence community under the national and global spotlight, again placed Porter in a key leadership role. During that time, when intelligence deficiencies were highlighted by the misinformation regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Porter responded to the President's call to lead the CIA in a positive way through a difficult situation.
  "Porter has been a dedicated public servant for decades. He has worked tirelessly to implement much-needed reforms at the CIA under very difficult circumstances. He has done an excellent job at improving the capabilities of our intelligence community overall. There is no question he has always made the security of this country his top priority and to that end he deserves a great deal of credit. His leadership at this critical time in our history will be sorely missed."
