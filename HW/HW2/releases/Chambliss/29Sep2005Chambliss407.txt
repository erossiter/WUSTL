SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON HAIL NOMINATION OF BATTER TO SERVE AS DISTRICT JUDGE
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., hailed today's White House announcement that President Bush has nominated Timothy C. Batten, Sr. of east Cobb County, to serve as the United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia.  
 The position is vacated by Willis B. Hunt, Jr. who is retiring this year. 
   A native Georgian, Batten graduated with highest honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology and cum laude from the University of Georgia School of Law. After graduation from law school, Batten accepted a position with the firm Schreeder, Wheeler and Flint and became a full equity partner in 1993. 
   "Timothy Batten is an individual of high integrity and has given many years of service to Georgia and to the United States," said Chambliss. "His common sense dedication to the rule of law, intellect and experience make him a solid candidate for the federal bench in North Georgia." 
   "It is with great pride that I lend my strong endorsement to Timothy Batten as he begins the confirmation process in the Senate," Isakson said. "The President has nominated an exceptionally qualified individual."
   "When his nomination comes before the United States Senate, Timothy Batten can count on my strong support" said Chambliss. "He is the right person for the job."
