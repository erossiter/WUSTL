SEN. CHAMBLISS: 'NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO STAND ON THE STREET CORNER AND SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LEAVING IRAQ NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH, NEXT YEAR'
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, today made the following statement during a media availability with Senate colleagues: 
   "The president told us shortly after September 11 that the war on terrorism was going to be a long and enduring war, and he was right. Today, in Iraq, we have the focal point of the war on terrorism taking place. And we're at a critical juncture in Iraq. We're at a point in the war on terrorism today in Iraq where we've had success, we've had military successes, not only in taking down Zarqawi and a number of other bad guys, but as these gentlemen have just alluded to, we now have our hands on documents that give us not only an idea of where the bad guys are, but what they're up to, and what their mindset is. And that's critically important from an intelligence standpoint. 
  "I've been to Iraq four times now, and every time I go I'm more impressed with the training and the ability of the Iraqi army to assume control and protect Iraqis from outside influences. I'm more impressed with the training and the ability of the security forces inside of Iraq to protect the Iraqi citizens from domestic insurrection. And I'm more impressed with the leadership in Iraq when I see the unity of the government taking place over there, which is so critically important to that country moving ahead. 
  "Now is the time to give all of our support to the American military and to the Iraqi people when we are moving in a positive direction and we have positive signs on the ground of how we're winning that war. It's not the time to stand on the street corner and say that we're going to be leaving Iraq next week, next month, next year. That is absolutely the wrong message to send to the world and it's a wrong message to send to the terrorists."
