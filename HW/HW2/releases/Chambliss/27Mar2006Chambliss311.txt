SEN. CHAMBLISS DISAPPOINTED WITH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTE ON FEINSTEIN GUEST WORKER AMENDMENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today released the following statement:
  "I am extremely disappointed with the Judiciary Committee's vote today to provide a path to permanent citizenship for all currently illegal immigrants working in agriculture. This is not what Georgians or the American people want. When this debate reaches the Senate floor, I plan to offer an amendment providing an alternative that will address the needs of agriculture in a more responsible way.  
  "My proposal would streamline and modernize the H-2A program - the temporary worker program that currently exists - to make it more user-friendly to agribusiness nationwide. In addition, my proposal will provide an opportunity for those who are currently here illegally to come out of the shadows, return to their home country, and return to the U.S. on a temporary legal program without resulting in a work stoppage at our nation's farms. 
  "There is no question we need immigration reform. Agriculture has traditionally been the gateway for immigration to the United States, and historically, farms across the nation have relied on a seasonal workforce. However, the current H-2A program has not been able to accommodate the needs of America's farmers. As a result, many farming operations are forced to rely upon an illegal workforce to get food from the farm to the dinner table. We should provide our farmers with a stable, legal workforce when Americans cannot be found to do the jobs needed. However, we should insist on adherence to the rule of law. 
  "We have a real opportunity to make some serious reforms, but the many Georgians I have heard from on this issue want me to ensure that the Senate proceeds in a responsible manner that does not provide any advantage to those who violated our immigration laws."
