SEN. CHAMBLISS BLASTS UNION BOSSES' AGENDA TO DENY WORKERS RIGHT TO CAST SECRET BALLOTS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today blasted legislation pending in the U.S. Senate that would effectively deny workers the right to cast secret ballots in union organizing elections. Instead, unions would be officially recognized once a majority of employees signs cards publicly expressing their support. Democratic leaders have filed a motion to proceed to the so-called "Employee Free Choice Act." Chambliss joined the Republican Leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators during a news conference on Capitol Hill to denounce the legislation.  
   "This bill has absolutely nothing to do with 'employee choice' despite its highly deceptive name," said Chambliss, who noted that the bill has been endorsed by the Communist Party, USA. "I find it ironic that members of the United States Senate, who were elected by secret ballot, now want to take that right away from their constituents. It is simply not the American way and this legislation ought to be defeated.
   "A private ballot has been a cornerstone of our democratic process for more than 200 years, and for more than 60 years federal labor law has guaranteed workers the right to cast private ballots. This bill eliminates workers rights, will leave them vulnerable to intimidation, and it is just a terrible initiative - period. 
   "Americans are concerned about illegal immigration. They are concerned about rising gas prices. They are concerned about terrorism. They are not interested in the Democrats' blatant attempt to reward the union bosses for their support in the past election cycle," Chambliss added.
