SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., praised the unanimous passage of a United States Senate resolution celebrating Black History Month. The resolution, S.Res.380, passed the Senate late Thursday evening.  
  "As our nation celebrates Black History Month, we are not only recognizing America as a nation of hope and opportunity for all our citizens, but we are also recognizing the significant contributions African Americans have made throughout our nation's history," said Chambliss. "Individuals like Coretta Scott King and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were two key leaders whose great legacy never be forgotten." 
  The resolution honors the contributions of African Americans throughout the history of our country, reaffirms the Senate's commitment to the goals of liberty and equal opportunity for every American, and pledges to work to improve educational, health and job opportunities for African Americans and all Americans.
  "This is also a special time to recognize and honor African-American organizations who work day and night to make our communities better places to live," said Chambliss. "All across our state African American organizations are doing just that and it's important we commend them for their hard work and dedication toward improving the lives of our citizens."
