SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON INTRODUCE RESOLUTION HONORING COLUMBUS NORTHERN TEAM ON 2006 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today introduced a Senate Resolution honoring the members of the Columbus Northern Little League team from Columbus, Ga., who won the 2006 Little League World Series last month.  
  "These athletes' talent, hard work, and sportsmanship allowed them to become the second team from the State of Georgia to win the Little League World Series, and in doing so they captured the hearts of people across Georgia and in many parts of the Nation who love the game of baseball," said Chambliss. "As a former Little League coach, I am so proud to see Georgia youth secure this international distinction." 
  "These fine young men played wonderful baseball all the way through the tournament, but in those final two games against New Hampshire and Japan, they soared and played like true professionals," Isakson said on the Senate floor. "These young men brought great pride to their state, great pride to their parents and great pride to the great city of Columbus, Georgia."
  The Columbus Northern Little League team defeated Kawaguchi Little League of Kawaguchi City, Japan, by two runs to one run on August 28, 2006, to win the 60th Annual Little League Baseball World Series Championship. 
  Columbus Northern is only the second Georgia team to win the Little League Baseball World Series in the 60-year history of the series. A team from Marietta defeated Japan for the World Series title in 1983.
  Players for Northern include: Matthew Hollis; Ryan Lang; Mason Meyers; Matthew Kuhlenberg; Patrick Stallings; Josh Lester; Brady Hamilton; Cody Walker; Kyle Carter; J.T. Phillips; and Kyle Rovig. The team is managed by Randy Morris and coached by Richard Carter.
