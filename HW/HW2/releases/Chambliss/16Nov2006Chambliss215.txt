SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. AIRWAYS BID FOR DELTA AIR LINES
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement regarding an offer by U.S. Airways to merge with Delta Air Lines. 
   "Delta is taking great strides in their efforts to exit bankruptcy in 2007. The hard-working folks at Delta Air Lines continue to work tirelessly to meet their goals and objectives, and I am confident that they are taking the appropriate steps to prevail in emerging as an independent company next year. Delta and its more than 25,000 employees serve as an economic engine for Georgia and the Southeast. As a proud Georgian, it is my hope that Delta will continue its strong presence in Atlanta as it has done so for so many years."
