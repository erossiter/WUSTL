SEN. CHAMBLISS MOURNS PASSING OF REP. NORWOOD
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., made the following statement regarding the loss of Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who passed away Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. 
  "It is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that Julianne and I mourn the loss of our dear friend, Charlie Norwood. Charlie and I were both elected to Congress in 1994 and I will always feel privileged to have served the people of Georgia alongside such an outstanding American. Charlie was a strong conservative of high morals and integrity who never backed away from any of his beliefs. The Georgia congressional delegation just won't be the same without him. He added a great deal of candor to the legislative process that will be sorely missed in Washington and in Georgia. 
  "Even as he faced his personal adversity, he continued to stand up for his values and be the honest and outspoken public servant that his constituents loved. He was a true warrior who showed tremendous strength and courage during his battle with cancer, and his tenacity and enduring commitment to Georgia values will remain an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Gloria and Charlie's entire family, staff, and constituents during this most difficult time."
  Last week, after learning that Congressman Norwood had decided to return home to Augusta, Chambliss paid tribute to his friend and colleague on the U.S. Senate floor.
