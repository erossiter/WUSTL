SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON PRAISE PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION HONORING 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPELMAN COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of a resolution honoring the 125th anniversary of Spelman College in Atlanta. The resolution was introduced today and passed the Senate unanimously. 
   "I want to congratulate Spelman College on their success and developing thousands of young women into strong business and community leaders over the past 125 years, said Senator Chambliss. "I would also like to recognize the President of Spelman College, my friend, Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, and the administration, faculty, staff, students and alumnae of the College for their leadership, outstanding achievements, and contributions that have made Spelman such a fine institution. It is my most sincere hope that Spelman will continue to thrive and prosper for many years to come." 
   "This resolution commends the student body, the faculty, the founders and in particular Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum of Spelman College," Isakson said on the Senate floor. "It is both an honor and privilege for me today on behalf of the state of Georgia and the United States Senate to unanimously commend Spelman College on its achievement of 125 years of service to African American women."
   Spelman College was founded in 1881 by Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles as Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary. Its name was changed to Spelman Seminary in 1884 in honor of Mrs. Laura Spelman Rockefeller and her parents Harvey Buel and Lucy Henry Spelman.
   The school's curriculum was expanded to include high school and college classes, and the seminary conferred its first high school diplomas in 1887 and its first college degrees in 1901. In 1924, Spelman Seminary officially became Spelman College and grew to become a leading undergraduate institution for African American women.
