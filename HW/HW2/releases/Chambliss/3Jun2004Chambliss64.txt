SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON CIA DIRECTOR'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the resignation of Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet: 
   "I agree with President Bush that George Tenet has done a superb job for our country and his expertise will be missed. However, we must stay focused on the future and make sure that our intelligence capabilities are continually upgraded and improved so that the lives of the American people, and those of our allies, are safeguarded. To do this we need to win the war on terrorism. The Congress will work closely with the President in the weeks ahead to make sure we have the very best possible replacement for George Tenet. In the interim, John McLaughlin, whom I know well, will be the acting Director of Central Intelligence and I am confident he will do a great job. John is a career CIA officer with broad experience and has been serving as George Tenet's deputy for the past four years."
