SEN. CHAMBLISS CHOSEN FOR TOP HONOR BY AMERICAN FARM BUREAU
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today was presented with the American Farm Bureau Federation's (AFBF) top national honor, the 2006 Golden Plow Award, by Georgia Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall. The Georgia Farm Bureau nominated Sen. Chambliss for the award for his commitment to the private enterprise system, having sound agricultural policies and supporting fiscal conservatism. The Golden Plow Award is given to one Senator and one Congressman each year. 
   "This is a tremendous honor," said Sen. Chambliss, Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "It's been a privilege to work with the American Farm Bureau Federation and Georgia Farm Bureau over the years to establish ideals and principles to benefit American agriculture."
   "Senator Chambliss has a stellar record when it comes to supporting American agriculture," said American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman. "While he has always been a strong advocate on behalf of Georgia farmers, many of the programs and legislative initiatives carried out by Sen. Chambliss are equally relevant to all American farm and ranch families."
   "It is appropriate that our Senator receive the national recognition," said Zippy Duvall, President of Georgia Farm Bureau. "Senator Chambliss has always been a dedicated advocate for Georgia agriculture. During his tenure as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, his passion for agriculture benefited family farms across this country. As President of Georgia Farm Bureau and a member of the American Farm Bureau Board of Directors, I am proud to call him a friend of American agriculture."
   Farm Bureau is an independent, non-governmental, voluntary organization governed by and representing farm and ranch families. Georgia Farm Bureau has offices in each of the state's 159 counties and has a membership of more than 430,000 families.
