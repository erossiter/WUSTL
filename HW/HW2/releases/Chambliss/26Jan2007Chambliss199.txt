WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Chambliss supports Delta Air Lines during a rally in Washington, D.C.
   Dear Friends,
   This past week was a busy one in the U.S. Senate. Please take a moment to review the highlights below and please stay in touch. If I can ever be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 1-800-234-4208.
   DELTA AIR LINES RALLIES AGAINST HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID 
   On Tuesday, I joined Delta employees, retirees, and board council members in expressing my opposition to Arizona-based U.S. Airways' hostile takeover bid. The rally was held at the Upper Senate Park on Capitol Hill. My colleague, Senator Johnny Isakson, and I recently urged the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to hold a hearing to examine the potential effects of this proposal. The committee hearing was held on Wednesday, and senators had an opportunity to ask important questions.
   For more than 60 years, Delta Air Lines has thrived as a leading employer of countless Georgians and has established itself as an economic engine for the Southeast. Delta has met its challenges head-on and the hard-working folks deserve the opportunity to follow through with plans to emerge as an independent company.

   PRESIDENT BUSH DELIVERS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
   This past week the President delivered his annual State of the Union Address. I thought the President's speech was far-reaching and forward-thinking, and I was pleased that he addressed the many domestic issues that are on the minds of Georgians. We must secure the border; we must balance the budget; and we must reduce our country's dependence on foreign sources of oil so that Americans have access to abundant and affordable sources of energy. Whether it is providing affordable health care for our families or quality education for our children, Georgians are looking for action and results. I look forward to supporting the President on the issues where we agree.
   I am also pleased that the President underscored what is at stake in the ongoing war on terrorism, because we absolutely cannot lose sight of that. As the President pointed out, this is a generational struggle. We remain at war with extremists, and for the sake of future generations we must remain committed to defeating their ideology of hatred. Our dedicated and professional men and women in uniform make us proud, and our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families. They will continue to have my wholehearted support.
   ARMY GENERAL WILL CARRY OUT NEW IRAQ STRATEGY
   On Tuesday, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, including myself, questioned the Army general nominated to carry out the President's new strategy in Iraq. Lieutenant General David H. Petraeus, USA, was approved by the Armed Services Committee and confirmed by the full Senate, and he will serve as General and Commander of Multi-National Forces in Iraq. I questioned General Petraeus about the mission ahead, the commitment of the Iraqis, and the need to better utilize intelligence.
   I have had the opportunity to visit with General Petraeus on several occasions during my visits to Iraq as well as recently in my Washington office. He is a former division commander and has led Iraqi training missions.

   PUSHING FOR INCREASED CELLULOSIC ETHANOL PRODUCTION
   There is no question that we must reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil and look for ways to provide Americans with affordable and abundant sources of energy. This week, I introduced legislation that I believe will promote regional diversity in the production of biofuels. My proposal, The Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act of 2007, would increase the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) from 7.5 billion gallons in 2012, to 30 billion gallons in 2030.
   Additionally, it calls for accelerated production of cellulosic ethanol from a variety of resources such as wood chips in the Southeast to wheat straw on the Great Plains. Ever since the founding of our great country, farmers and ranchers have played a key role in growing the safest, most affordable food supply in the world. Now we can build upon their successes as we ask them to help grow an abundant source of energy.
