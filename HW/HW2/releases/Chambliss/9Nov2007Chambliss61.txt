SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  In honor of Veterans Day, U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement in honor of the many veterans across Georgia and across the country:  
  "This weekend we honor, thank and remember our veterans for their courage and sacrifice. Throughout our nation's history, generations of Georgians have defended our freedom against those who threaten our security and prosperity and for that we are truly grateful. Right now our military personnel in the Middle East and all around the world are serving valiantly, and they will continue to have my fullest support. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I remain committed to meeting our veterans' needs and to ensuring that they and their families receive the benefits they have earned as well as the quality medical care they deserve. These issues must remain a top priority in the U.S. Senate."
