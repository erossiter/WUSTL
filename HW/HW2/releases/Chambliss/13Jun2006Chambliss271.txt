SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO IRAQ TO MEET WITH IRAQI PRIME MINISTER
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, today made the following statement regarding President Bush's visit to Baghdad to meet newly named Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and discuss ongoing operations in Iraq. 
  "I am pleased to see our Commander in Chief on the ground in Iraq today. Our men and women in uniform who have put themselves in harm's way need to know that we support their dedication and professionalism in working with the Iraqi people to secure their country. Having been to Iraq on four separate occasions, I have seen firsthand the tremendous job they are doing, and I strongly believe that despite what you read or hear in the news sometimes, it is absolutely clear we are winning the war in Iraq. 
  "If we were to follow the lead of the naysayers and withdraw troops, al-Zarqawi would still be plotting against America. Our troops have worked tirelessly toward improving security and developing relationships with the Iraqis. Combined with the effective use of intelligence, al-Zarqawi was tracked down and removed as a threat.
  "Iraq is now at a critical junction as it continues to move forward in establishing a safe and secure environment for all its citizens. U.S. and Coalition support at this time is critical to providing the assistance that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's unity government needs in order to defeat the insurgency. We are a nation of our word, and we absolutely must stay committed to finish the job because the future of the Middle East as well as our own future security lies in the balance."
