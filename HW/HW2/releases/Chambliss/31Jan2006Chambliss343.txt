SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE HUD FUNDS FOR ST. JOHN'S VILLA APARTMENTS IN SAVANNAH, GA.
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced St.  
 John's Villa Apartments in Savannah, Ga. will receive a total of $111,009.45 to hire a multifamily housing service coordinator. 
   The funds will be distributed through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Service Coordinator program. 
   "I am proud to announce these funds for St. John's Villa Apartments. These important programs fund a wide range of community initiatives, such as housing and rehabilitation, support services, public improvements and economic development projects in Savannah," said Chambliss. "I will continue to work with my colleagues in support of the programs that mean so much to so many communities." 
   "I am pleased to announce these important funds for Savannah," said Isakson. "This valuable grant will ensure that there are enough staff members for residents to receive the proper amount of aid and attention they need." 
   The Service Coordinator Program provides funding for the employment of service coordinators in insured and assisted housing developments that are designed for the elderly and persons with disabilities. The coordinator is responsible for assuring that elderly residents, especially those who are frail or at risk, and those non-elderly residents with disabilities are linked to the specific supportive services they need to continue living independently in that development.
