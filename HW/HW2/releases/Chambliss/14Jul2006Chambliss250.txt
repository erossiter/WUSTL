SENATE RECOGNIZES WEEK OF SEPT. 10 AS 'NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK'
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, today announced the Senate has approved a resolution recognizing the week of September 10, 2006 as "National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week." 
   The resolution, introduced by Chambliss and Graham, was passed unanimously and calls on Americans to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). 
   "Historically Black Colleges and Universities provide quality educational experiences and play a vital role in an increasingly complex and highly technological society. HBCUs have a rich heritage and have played a prominent role in the history of the United States. Further, they have allowed many disadvantaged students to attain their full potential through higher education. We are pleased the Senate has come together in a bipartisan fashion to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of these institutions," said Chambliss and Graham. 
   Georgia is home to 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and South Carolina is home to 8. A complete list can be found at http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html.
