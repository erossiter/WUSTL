SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES GEORGIANS' EFFORTS TO FIGHT WILDFIRES FOLLOWING VISIT TO SOUTHEAST GEORGIA
  On Monday, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., visited areas of Southeast Georgia where wildfires continue to burn. Chambliss met with officials from the Georgia Forestry Commission, Georgia Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Forest Service, as well as other local and state officials. Chambliss visited the Incident Command site located in Ware County, observed air tanker operations, and viewed additional areas in Brantley, Charlton, and Atkinson counties.  
   Chambliss made the following statement upon his return to Washington: 
   "The wildfires have taken a tremendous toll on our state, and you simply cannot comprehend the shear magnitude of this devastation until you see it firsthand. I commend the outstanding efforts of our firefighters, forestry rangers, officials, and the many others who have been working relentlessly to contain the fires and protect our communities. Our folks on the ground are true heroes and the people of Georgia are grateful for their dedication and professionalism. 
   "I know the people of Georgia also appreciate Governor Perdue's vigilance and his efforts in helping our state. It is my sincere hope that the Lord will send us some rain in the near future to help our folks on the ground. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered tremendous personal and financial losses as a result of these fires." 
   The fires in Southeast Georgia started after a tree fell on a power line in rural Ware County, and has now spread to over 78,000 acres of federal, state, and private land.
