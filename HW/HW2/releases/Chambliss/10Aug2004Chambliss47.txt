   "The President selected the very best person to head the CIA at this critical time in our history. Porter Goss is a dedicated, capable, experienced, and bipartisan public official who has unique professional experience as an intelligence officer, both in the U.S. Army and in the CIA."
   "Porter's stewardship of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has been absolutely superb and his extensive experience in the Congress will prove to be an extremely valuable asset when he assumes his new position and carry's out President Bush's order for him to lead the CIA through the challenges and threats of a dangerous new century."
   "The security of the United States, which is so dependent on having accurate and timely intelligence, is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. I hope the Senate can act quickly in a bipartisan fashion to approve this important nomination. Porter Goss will play a vital role in defeating our enemies and protecting our great nation, our people, and our way of life."
