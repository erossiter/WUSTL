SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON HAIL MILITARY FUNDS FOR KINGS BAY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of the Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill, which provides important funds for military construction at Georgia's Bases and for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Bill includes $3 million for key military construction funds for Kings Bay.  
  Specifically, Kings Bay will receive $3 million to further improve their waterfront operations and security.
   "All the hard working men and women at Kings Bay play such an important role in the national security of the United States," said Chambliss. "These important funds will help or sailors do an even better job to further protect our nation's nuclear submarines." 
  "This investment at Kings Bay is very good news for Georgia," Isakson said. "Kings Bay plays a key role in the security of our nation, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington."
  Now that the bill has passed the Senate, the legislation will now move to a joint House-Senate Conference Committee, where differences between the two chamber's versions will be ironed out.
   Additionally, the bill includes over $70.7 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including key funds for the health care needs for America's Veterans.
   "I can think of no higher priority than caring for our nation's Veterans who were wounded in their service to our Nation," said Chambliss. "America's Veterans have made great sacrifices to ensure that we call live in a safe and secure America and for the Freedom we all enjoy. It's only right that we do all we can for our Veterans."
