SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR MUSEUM OF AVIATION IN WARNER ROBINS
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $200,000 in funding for the Museum of Aviation Foundation in Warner Robins.  
 The funds will go toward expanding the architectural design, construction, and exhibit installation to complete the new 60,000 square foot World War II Exhibit Hangar and an adjoining Depot Flight Line. 
   Chambliss and Isakson worked with Senate appropriators to secure these important funds for Georgia as part of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   "The Museum of Aviation is one of Middle Georgia's finest historical attractions," said Chambliss. "It's crucial that we continue to provide a place for future generations to learn about our Armed Forces and those brave men and women who fought for the freedoms we all enjoy today." 
   "The Museum of Aviation Foundation is a wonderful way to chronicle and commemorate aviation history," Isakson said. "With this new facility, history will continue to come alive for a whole new generation. It will be a lasting tribute and educational resource for many years to come."
   "This grant will go a long way towards making the World War II Exhibit Hangar a reality, and giving proper recognition to America's heroes of World War II," said Pat Bartness, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Museum of Aviation Foundation. "The sooner we do this the better. We offer our sincere thanks to Senators Chambliss and Isakson, for their long term support and dedication to the Museum of Aviation."
