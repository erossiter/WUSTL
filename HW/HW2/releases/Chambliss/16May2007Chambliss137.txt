SEN. CHAMBLISS: CONGRESS NEEDS TO DELIVER FUNDING FOR TROOPS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT STRINGS ATTACHED
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today made the following statement following the Senate's vote to reject a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq: 
   "I am pleased that today the Senate rejected attempts to micro-manage the efforts of our military leaders. The restrictions some senators proposed would create more hoops to jump through that would distract our military personnel from their mission. This political charade has been going on for three months. I just returned from my fifth trip to Iraq, and our men and women told me they are frustrated and confused by what's happening in Washington with regard to the supplemental funding bill. Our military personnel are committed to carrying out their mission in a professional manner, and they have made great strides in securing areas of the country, but they cannot continue this progress if Congress continues to delay their funding. 
   "We know that considerable challenges still exist in Iraq, but that does not mean that we should pull the rug out from under our troops when the new strategy has yet to be fully implemented. The Iraqis must step up and take control of their own country, but we should not short change our men and women in uniform who need the resources to not only do their jobs and train the Iraqis, but to protect themselves from harm as well."
