SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER PRAISE $20 MILLION HUD GRANT FOR ATLANTA'S MCDANIEL GLENN DEVELOPMENT
  Sens. Zell Miller (D-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today praised a $20 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the Atlanta Housing Authority to revitalize the deteriorated public housing at McDaniel Glenn.  
   The HOPE VI grant will be used to transform the 40-acre blighted, outdated public housing community in the Mechanicsville neighborhood into a mixed-use and pedestrian oriented community. The funds will contribute to the Authority's plan to demolish and rehabilitate 588 public housing units and replace them with 907 new and rehabilitated mixed-income units.
   "This is great news for Atlanta and Georgia. I am very eager to watch the transformation of McDaniel Glenn into an attractive, livable community for all families," said Miller, a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. "This is an example of the tremendous improvements that can be accomplished when the public and private sectors of a community work together." 
   "I am pleased that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is making these grants to Atlanta and other Georgia communities," said Sen. Chambliss. "A total of $26 million is being awarded to modernize housing which will go a long way in greatly benefiting the families living in these communities."
   Several other Georgia housing authorities also received HOPE VI funds to demolish severely distressed public housing units including: 
   * $4,777,472 for Atlanta's Grady Homes;
   * $1,050,311 for Marietta's Alexander Stephens Clay Homes;
   * $459,523 for Americus' Sumter Homes (A);
   * $270,000 for Montezuma's Riverview Apartments; and
   * $108,000 for Americus' Sumter Homes (B).
