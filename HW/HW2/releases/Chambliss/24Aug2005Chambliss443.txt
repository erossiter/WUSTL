SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON BRAC VOTE REGARDING NAVAL AIR STATION ATLANTA
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement today regarding the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's vote to uphold the Department of Defense's recommendation to close Naval Air Station Atlanta.  
   "The BRAC Commission's vote regarding Naval Air Station Atlanta is obviously extremely disappointing," said Chambliss. "Through numerous meetings, visits, phone calls and letters, members of Georgia's congressional delegation and Governor Sonny Perdue made a strong and forceful case to the Commission to keep Naval Air Station Atlanta open. Despite the fact that NAS Atlanta continues to play an important role in both the war on terrorism and the war on drugs with personnel now stationed in Iraq as well as the Caribbean, the BRAC Commission has made its decision, and we must now do everything we can to work with local redevelopment authorities to support their efforts to ensure that the base's closure will not have a negative impact on the community or the local economy." 
   The BRAC Commission's final recommendation regarding NAS Atlanta will be included in a list of recommendations nationwide that will be sent by September 8, 2005, to President Bush for his approval. President Bush will then have until September 23, 2005, to accept or reject the recommendation in its totality - without the ability to change pieces of the recommendation. If accepted, Congress will have 45 legislative days to reject the recommendation in its entirety or it becomes binding.
