SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS FOR GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and D.C. Appropriations Act, which includes important funds for Georgia transportation projects. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to work out a final version of the bill. 
   "These important transportation funds will help Georgia make many key improvements to our transportation needs in every corner of our state," said Chambliss. "This funding will enhance the quality of life for our citizens and boost job creation and economic development." 
   "These funds will help our state continue to attract industry, create jobs and remain a thriving economic center," Isakson said. "All of these funds will help improve transportation in Georgia." 
   Georgia transportation projects included in the bill are: 
   * $29 million for rail modernizations for Atlanta; 
   * $19.3 million in grant allocations for Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport; 
   * $4.5 million for Xpress Implantation Buses for the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority; 
   * $1.75 million for an automated Smart-Card fare collection system for MARTA; and 
   * $4.8 million for MARTA clean fuel buses. 
   The city of Athens will also benefit from $392,000 as part of the Essential Air Service program, which provides funds to air carriers serving small communities. The bill also gives priority to the development of a terminal building at Augusta Regional Airport at Bush Field, land acquisition and an access road at Gilmer County Airport in Ellijay and perimeter fencing at the Newnan Coweta County Airport.
   The bill also includes $12 million for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to complete their model impaired driving records information system pilot, assisting States in tracking repeat offenders. The DWI Online Reporting System is currently in its pilot stage in Texas. NHTSA will collaborate with the State of Georgia and develop an online DWI reporting system for the State by January 2006. 
   Finally, Georgia will also receive $91.9 million in formula grants for the state and local agencies. Grants will be distributed in several categories including urbanized areas, clean fuels, formula grants and loans for special needs of elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities, and formula grants for non-urbanized areas.
