  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the confirmation of Judge John Roberts to become the next Chief Justice of the United States.  
   "Today is a proud day for America," said Chambliss. "I am honored to join the majority of my colleagues in the United States Senate in a strong vote to approve Judge John Roberts to be our next Supreme Court Chief Justice. 
   "Judge Roberts is an able jurist and a decent man. His unwavering fidelity to the Constitution and commitment to the Rule of Law is evident both by his professional career and by his answers to questions during his nomination hearings."
   "As Chief Justice of the United States, Judge Roberts will not only serve as the chief justice of the Supreme Court, but he will also serve as the leader of the entire federal judiciary, setting the standard, showing the way and speaking for an entire branch of our federal government.
   "By nominating Judge Roberts to the Court, President Bush used sound judgment and great wisdom in fulfilling his Constitutional responsibility. I commend my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for working in a bipartisan fashion to approve Judge Robert's nomination, and I am confident that he will serve the American people with honor and dignity as Chief Justice."
