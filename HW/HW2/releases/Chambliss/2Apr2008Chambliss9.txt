MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA PRESENTS SEN. CHAMBLISS WITH COLONEL ARTHUR T. MARIX CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP AWARD
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Co-Chairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus, and a member of the Senate National Guard Caucus, on Tuesday evening was presented with the Colonel Arthur T. Marix Congressional Leadership Award by the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA). The organization recognized Chambliss in particular for legislation he spearheaded in the U.S. Senate to reduce the age at which members of the National Guard and Reserve can receive retirement pay. The legislation passed as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act and was signed into law by President Bush in January. 
   "If we're going to continue to call on the members of our Guard and Reserve who make tremendous sacrifices with respect to their family lives and civilian employment, we need to take action to show that we stand behind them and appreciate the tough challenges they face," said Chambliss. "I am concerned that those who would otherwise stay in until they reach 20 years of service are going to get out, particularly those who are experiencing repeat deployments. I will continue to work with the Armed Services Committee to address the critical needs facing our guardsmen and women, reservists, and their families."
   MOAA is the nation's largest veteran's organization that represents active duty and retired military officers and their families. The Colonel Arthur T. Marix Congressional Leadership Award is named after Colonel Marix, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret), who founded MOAA on February 23, 1929 and served as its first President.
