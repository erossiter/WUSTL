SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRAC COMMISSION VOTE REGARDING ATHENS NAVY SUPPLY SCHOOL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, issued the following statement regarding the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's (BRAC) vote today to uphold a Department of Defense recommendation calling for the closure of the Naval Supply School in Athens.  
   "The BRAC Commission vote is obviously extremely disappointing," said Chambliss. "Through numerous meetings, visits, phone calls and letters, members of Georgia's congressional delegation and Governor Sonny Perdue made a strong and forceful case to the Commission to keep the school in Athens. Unfortunately, despite the data being on our side which proved the Athens community provides the Navy with the lowest costs for its operations and a low cost of living for our sailors and their families, the Commission maintained the decision to move the school. 
   "Now that this decision has been made we must do everything we can to work with the Athens community regarding redevelopment efforts so that the school's closure will not have a negative impact on the community." 
   The BRAC Commission's final recommendation regarding Athens will be included in a list of bases and installations nationwide that will be sent by September 8, 2005, to President Bush for his approval. Once President Bush approves the Commission recommendations, he will send the list to Congress for their approval this fall.
