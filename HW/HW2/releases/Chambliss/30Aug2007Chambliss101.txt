WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Dear Friends:
   The Senate is in recess until Tuesday, September 4. Over the past few weeks I have enjoyed traveling the state and talking with Georgians about the issues on their minds. Please take a moment to review my notes from the road. 
  During the week of August 13th, I visited with members of the Carrollton Rotary Club and heard their concerns about immigration, No Child Left Behind, Iraq, and health care. 
  Additionally, I stopped by the Tanner Memorial Hospital in Carrollton to tour the expanding medical center as they accommodate for the continued growth in the area. The hospital is making impressive state-of-the-art improvements, and I look forward to seeing it flourish in the future. I also had the chance to speak with the medical personnel about local health care issues. As health care becomes a growing concern among Georgians, I appreciate the continued input from our medical community.

  I also attended the Paulding County Economic Development Award Ceremony in Villa Rica. I was pleased to join officials of the U.S. Department of Commerce in presenting the award, which recognizes the area for improving economic quality. This is a tremendous honor and I congratulate the local leaders for their dedication and innovation. 
  As the keynote speaker at the Gwinnett Chamber General Membership Luncheon, I updated members on the issues of Iraq, immigration, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I was also pleased to offer my congratulations to the Chamber for being recognized as one of the top three chambers in the United States. Gwinnett County is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation, and the Chamber has substantially contributed to this growth by creating, promoting, and sustaining a pro-business environment. The Chamber is a tremendous asset to the area.
  In Athens, I visited employees of Noramco Inc., the North American Chemicals Operations subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and toured the facility. Noramco manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients for therapeutic and other medical purposes.
  On Saturday, August 18th, I headed down to Brooklet for the 18th Annual Brooklet Peanut Festival Parade. 
  On Monday, August 20th, I visited the Albany Marine Corps Logistics Base to see first-hand what they are doing to ensure that our servicemen and women are well-equipped and protected from IEDs. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I appreciate the dedication and sacrifice on behalf of these individuals to ensure the equipment is continually upgraded to protect our troops overseas.

  I was also honored to speak at the 2007 Honorary Commanders Induction Ceremony in Warner Robins. It is always a privilege to visit the Robins Air Force Base and I was pleased to congratulate the commanders who were recognized at this event. 
  On August 21st, I visited Perry for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce's Annual Congressional Luncheon at the Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter where I gave an update on issues in Washington.

  Later in the week I toured the Pratt & Whitney and Precision Components International (PCI) Plants in Columbus. These facilities are major suppliers in the aerospace and defense industries, and they employ numerous Georgians in that area of our state.
  Additionally, I attended the 100 Black Men of Macon-Middle Georgia's Economic Development Symposium in Macon where the topic of discussion was health care. The feedback I receive from this organization is valuable to my decision-making in Washington, and I appreciate the continued working relationship.
