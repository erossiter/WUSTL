SEN. CHAMBLISS: IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE RECEIVES FINAL SENATE APPROVAL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. said the Senate has given final approval of an important funding bill for veterans' health care needs.  
 The $1.5 billion in emergency funds was included in the final version of the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations which the Senate approved today. 
   The funds were included in a direct response to requests made by the Department of Veterans Affairs, because the VA had underestimated the number of service personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who would be seeking medical treatment. The VA originally estimated that 23,553 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan would seek medical treatment; however, that number has been revised upward to 103,000 for the 2005 fiscal year. This rise in demand for VA health care created a billion dollar shortfall in operating funds for the current year. 
   "I am pleased Congress responded quickly to help the VA provide important health care needs for veterans returning from the global war on terrorism," said Chambliss. "Making sure we do all we can for our nation's veterans and especially those wounded during their service is an important priority."
