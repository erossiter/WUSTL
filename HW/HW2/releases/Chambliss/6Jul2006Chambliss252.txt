SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES ASSISTANCE FOR AVONDALE MILLS WORKERS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor will offer assistance to workers at the Georgia-based Avondale Mills plants that will be closing later this month. The State filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment (ATAA) petitions on behalf of the Avondale Mills workers. 
   Avondale Mills workers will be able to go the nearest One-Stop Career Services Center to apply for benefits. Approximately 700 Georgia workers will be eligible to apply for assistance and may be eligible to receive re-employment services, the Health Coverage Tax Credit and income support. The State will determine workers' eligibility. 
   "Many of the Avondale Mills employees have been there for many years and this assistance is critical to those folks who will lose jobs as a result of the plant closing," said Chambliss. "I'm pleased that the Federal Government will offer these services to support the many Georgians who will need help getting back on their feet." 
   Avondale Mills operates 20 plants across the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama. The 161 year-old Monroe, Georgia-based textile company announced in May its plans to close operations due partly to economic strains caused by a train derailment that occurred over a year ago. The train slammed into a chlorine gas tanker parked outside the Graniteville, SC plant, causing a gas leak which led to extensive damage to the plant and killed nine employees.
