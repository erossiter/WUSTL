SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES DELIVERY OF 50TH F/A-22 RAPTOR STEALTH FIGHTER TO USAF
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today praised the United States Air Force and Lockheed Martin on the successful delivery of the 50th F/A-22 Raptor air dominance fighter aircraft to the United States Air Force.  
   "The F/A-22 Raptor is the most sophisticated fighter aircraft in the world," said Chambliss. "While operating this aircraft, our American airmen are well protected and well equipped to defend our country and our interests world-wide. The men and women who help build this aircraft are creating superior aircraft for the United States Air Force and I know our Air Force will continue to rise above the enemy with this stealth weapon system."
   This 50th F/A-22 weapons system will join Raptors flying today as part of the 1st Fighter Wing's 27th Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB, Va. In addition to Langley, AFB, the F/A-22 Raptor is currently flying at three other bases across the United States. Testing is conducted at Edwards AFB, Calif., tactics development is ongoing at Nellis AFB, Nev., and a full squadron of Raptors is based at Tyndall AFB, Fla. for pilot and maintainer training.
