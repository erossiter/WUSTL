SEN. CHAMBLISS: FAVORABLE CORN EXPORTS DECISION POINTS TO NEED FOR SOFTWOOD LUMBER RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chambliss, the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, issued the following statement regarding an announcement the Canadian International Trade Tribunal made concerning the final word on a hotly contested trade dispute. Chambliss said the move should also spur Canada to resolve the dispute on a separate issue involving softwood lumber affecting Georgia. 
  "I am pleased to hear that the Canadian International Trade Tribunal announced a negative final injury finding regarding U.S. corn exports Tuesday. The decision comes in response to allegations made last fall that U.S. dumping and subsidizing of grain corn harms Canadian producers.
  "This is welcome news and effectively ends duties placed on U.S. corn exports to Canada. From the beginning I thought the antidumping and countervailing charges were without merit and the duties were incorrectly applied. This helps remove another potential irritant from cross border trade between our two countries. Extending the provisional duties forward with an injury finding would have harmed corn farmers and users on both side of the border.
  "With the conclusion of the investigation I look forward to working with my Canadian counterparts in strengthening our trade ties and resolving lingering problems like the debate over softwood lumber imports. More than ever, we need to find a negotiated solution and I urge both sides to come to a speedy conclusion. This issue is not only important to my constituents in Georgia, but to lumber producers and home builders across the country. I remain committed to this effort and remain hopeful a negotiated solution can be found."
