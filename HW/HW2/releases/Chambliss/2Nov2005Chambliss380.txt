SEN. CHAMBLISS MEETS WITH GUARD AND RESERVE COMMISSION ON CAPITOL HILL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Co-chairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus today met with members of the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve to discuss issues relative to the needs and role of the United States National Guard and Reserve. 
   Chambliss encouraged the commissioners to continue considering ways to equalize benefits for guardsmen and reservists in order to increase morale and retain current members and attract future members to service in the Reserve Components.
   "If we continue to call on the Guard and Reserve as we are today, we need to seriously consider ways to equalize their benefits closer to those of active duty service members," said Chambliss.
   During an August 2005 visit to Iraq, Chambliss met with members of the Georgia National Guard's 48th Brigade. He relayed his experience to the commissioners saying that he observed a seamless integration between guard and active duty soldiers relative to training programs and encouraged the commission to continue thinking of ways to maintain and encourage cooperation between the groups.
   Chambliss also emphasized the concept of his amendment pending to the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization bill that would lower the age at which guardsmen and reservists could collect retired pay based on the duration of their service, retroactive to September 11, 2001.
   "Every time I speak to members of the Guard and Reserve the one issue that always comes up is giving those who have served the longest the opportunity to collect retirement pay early and I assure you that more folks will commit to service with the Guard and Reserve if we can offer this benefit"
