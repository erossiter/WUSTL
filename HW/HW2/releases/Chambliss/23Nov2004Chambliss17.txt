SENATE APPROVES NOMINATION OF ATLANTA NATIVE TO SERVE AS U.S ATTORNEY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Zell Miller, D-Ga., announced today that the Senate unanimously confirmed the nomination of Atlanta native David E. Nahmias to serve as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  
   Earlier this year, President George W. Bush nominated Nahmias to fill the position vacated by William Duffey, who previously served as the United States Attorney for the Northern District. Duffey has since been confirmed by the Senate to serve on the United States District Court for the Northern District.
   "I am confidant that David Nahmias will serve the people in the Northern District with honesty and integrity," said Chambliss. "I am proud to have helped this highly qualified Georgian secure this important position." 
   "David Nahmias will serve Georgia and the nation very ably. I am so pleased he has won confirmation," Miller said.
   A Georgia native, Nahmias graduated summa cum laude from Duke University, ranking second in his graduating class, and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in Atlanta and currently serves as counsel to the Assistant United States Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. 
   Last year, Chambliss and Miller created a screening panel to review candidates' professional competence and qualifications and make recommendations on nominees to be considered by the White House in filling the vacancy. The screening panel is comprised of Frank C. Jones, a retired partner of King & Spalding in Atlanta, who now resides in Macon; the Honorable H. Arthur (Mac) McLane of Valdosta, Chief Judge of the Superior Courts for the Southern Judicial Circuit of Georgia; and William U. Norwood, III with Pope, McGlamry, Kilpartick, Morrison and Norwood, of Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia.
