SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL'S DEMAND THAT IRAN SUSPEND URANIUM ENRICHMENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee today issued the following statement regarding the U.N. Security Council unanimous approval of a statement demanding that Iran suspend uranium enrichment. 
  "Today, the U.N. Security Council took a positive first step in demanding that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment and cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has continually defied the international community's demands that it halt its nuclear weapons program. 
  "With Iran's history of supporting terrorism and its aggressive stance towards the West, Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons capability. This move sets the stage for further international actions to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons that could potentially be used to attack Israel, our European allies, or be provided to terrorists in Iraq, Palestine, or elsewhere."
