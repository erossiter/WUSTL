SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR CORDELE
 Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the City of Cordele will receive a $20,336 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's to aid in local law enforcement needs. 
   The U.S. Department of Justice's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) will distribute the funding. JAG allows local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. 
   The City of Cordele and Crisp County will use the funds to purchase law enforcement equipment, firearms and less than lethal weapons for the local law enforcement.
   "This important program will fund a crucial community initiative in Cordele and Crisp County to better equip our first responders," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
  "This funding will go a long way to help ensure that Cordele and Crisp County's first responders have the resources necessary to protect their community," said Isakson. "This grant fills an important need for the Cordele Sheriff's Department."
