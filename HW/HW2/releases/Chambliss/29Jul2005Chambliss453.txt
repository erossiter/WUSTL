SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR FUNDING FOR SOUTH GEORGIA
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today announced final Congressional approval of fiscal year 2006 appropriations for the U.S. Department of Interior, including funds for several important Georgia projects.  
   The City of Moultrie's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) will receive $350,000 for a rehabilitation project. The WWPT is a mechanical treatment facility with a point of discharge into the Ochlocknee River. The plant's most recent upgrade took place in 1984 and despite several minor upgrades and repairs, a major upgrade is needed to meet new limits established by Georgia's Environmental Protection Division and to meet demands of a new poultry processing facility and a new industrial park. 
   "This funding will allow the City of Moultrie to bring our wastewater treatment facilities up-to-date with current environmental standards and expand the city's ability to meet the demands of continued growth," said Chambliss.
   Other funding in the bill includes:
   * $350,000 - for the administration of the Augusta Canal National Heritage Area
   * $3,247,000 - for the construction of the Cumberland Island Plum Orchard Home 
   * $1,000,000 - for the Ox Bow Meadows Wastewater Improvements project in Columbus
   * $500,000 - for the West Area Combined Sewer Overflow Tunnel in the City of Atlanta
   * $2,000,000 - for the Altamaha River Corridor.
