WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  CHAMBLISS VISITS WITH GEORGIA SERVICEMEMBERS IN TIKRIT, IRAQ.
   Dear Friends,
   I hope that each of you had a wonderful Mother's Day weekend. After a very busy week in Washington, Julianne and I were grateful to spend Sunday in South Georgia with family, including our grandchildren. On Saturday, I briefly traveled to the coastal area of the state to address members of Leadership Georgia, including the current class and alumni, where I spoke about our country's national security. 
   The U.S. Senate is currently considering H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which authorizes Army Corps of Engineers projects dealing with flood control, storm protection, environmental restoration and inland navigation. The actual funding for the projects would come later during the appropriations process. 
   On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the Immigration Reform Bill (S. 1348).  
   IMMIGRATION UPDATE 
   I know that Georgians are anxious for an update regarding action on immigration reform. Folks have contacted my office over the course of many, many months expressing frustration with the immigration situation facing our nation and rightfully so. 
   Over the past few months, I have been part of a group of senators who have met regularly to negotiate this issue. My top priority in this debate is border security, because if we do not secure the border then we will fail to address a serious national security issue and we will fail to prevent future illegal immigration.
   Second, I will not support amnesty. I opposed the bill approved by the Senate last year because it put a greater emphasis on providing a pathway to citizenship for people who are here illegally than it did on border security, and that is the wrong approach. 
   Third, if the U.S. economy is to continue to grow, we must create temporary worker programs that enable employers to fill jobs that no American citizen will take. Further, we must ensure that American workers and American wages are not harmed by a temporary worker program. Employers must be provided with a fool-proof verification system to ensure that prospective employees are legal, and once this system is created, employers who refuse to verify the status of their employees or who knowingly hire illegal workers should be severely punished.
   Immigration is a federal issue, and that is why Congress needs to act now to implement comprehensive immigration reform that is responsible, reasonable, and respects the rule of law.
   TRAVEL TO IRAQ
   During the first weekend of May, I made my 5th visit to Iraq, where I met with Georgia soldiers, Iraqi leaders, and General David Petraeus, who is responsible for carrying out the new strategy. The most rewarding part of my trip was visiting with the Georgia soldiers stationed there. Their morale, dedication, and professionalism are truly inspiring, and they are doing a tremendous job. There is no question challenges persist in Iraq, particularly on the political side, and the Iraqi leadership must understand that U.S. forces cannot stay in their country forever. However, those of us who travel to Iraq have a responsibility to share the good works of our soldiers with folks here at home, because our military has had numerous successes that continue to be overshadowed. The soldiers I met with expressed concern that Americans are not hearing the good news but only the bad news, and they want Americans to know of their successes.
   A significant change from my first trip was the fact that this time, rather than flying directly to Baghdad International Airport and straight to the "Green Zone," which is the most secure area of Baghdad, we flew directly to Tikrit, the hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. 
   I also traveled to Ramadi, a city 70 miles west of Baghdad. Six months ago, Ramadi was all but lost to al-Qaeda, but since the new strategy has been implemented, we have seen remarkable signs of progress in securing the city, largely due to the efforts of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the Georgia-based Third Infantry Division of the United States Army. In fact, we were the first congressional delegation to travel into downtown; a year ago we would not have been allowed to do this. There are still attacks being carrying out, but the strategy of clearing and holding the areas once controlled by al-Qaeda is proving to be successful. Additionally, all 23 tribes in Ramadi are now cooperating with U.S. forces. 
   These are certainly complex and challenging times, and we must remain focused on what is at stake. The war on terrorism extends beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. We are living in an era where we are not only confronted by terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda, but we have seen recent plots thwarted here in our own county. For example, the recent arrest of six individuals and the disruption of a plot to attack the Fort Dix, New Jersey, military base just underscores the new "homegrown terrorist" threat that exists.

   WILDFIRE UPDATE
   As the wildfires continue to spread throughout Southeast Georgia, the safety of our citizens and communities remains at the forefront. Not only have the wildfires taken a tremendous toll on our state, the severe smoke continues to spread. The folks on the ground who continue to work around the clock to contain the fires are true heroes and the people of Georgia are grateful for their dedication and professionalism. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered tremendous personal and financial losses as a result of these fires. 
   This past week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved two requests made by state officials for Fire Management Assistance in Charlton and Atkinson Counties. This assistance is greatly needed and is welcome news. For situation reports you may visit the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) website at http://www.gema.state.ga.us
   FARM BILL HEARING ON ENERGY AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
   Last week the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, on which I serve, held a hearing on energy and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rural development programs. This hearing provided an excellent opportunity to gather suggestions for consideration as we construct the new farm bill. 
   I was pleased that Mr. Jimmy Mathews, representing the Georgia Rural Water Association, was one of the witnesses testifying before the committee on behalf of the National Rural Water Association.

   FARM BUREAU "GOLDEN PLOW" AWARD
   Last week I addressed the Georgia Farm Bureau during their annual meeting in Washington. I was humbled to be presented with the organization's top national honor, the 2006 Golden Plow Award, by Georgia Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall. The award is given to one U.S. Senator and one U.S. Congressman each year. As Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, it has been a privilege to work with the American Farm Bureau Federation and Georgia Farm Bureau over the years to establish ideals and principles to benefit American agriculture.

   LEGISLATION TO BENEFIT OUR TROOPS
   I recently introduced two bills to benefit our military personnel. The first bill, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, which I introduced with my Democratic colleague from Arkansas, Senator Mark Pryor, would ensure that the medical needs of wounded servicemen and women are properly met and that bureaucracy does not interfere with their progress. 
   To read the details of the legislation please visit: http://chambliss.enews.senate.gov/mail/util.cfm?mailaction=clickthru&gpiv=1999950088.30077.147&gen=1&mailing_linkid=2231.

   The second bill, the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, would create a program for National Guard personnel returning from combat to ensure that service members and their families receive the training and assistance they need in order to successfully transition from the battlefield back to civilian life. In this era of new threats, they are being called upon more and more, away from their families and their civilian employment for extended periods of time to defend and protect our nation.

   SAVANNAH, BRUNSWICK PORTS RECEIVE FUNDING
   After a great deal of dialogue with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, it was announced last week that the Savannah and Brunswick ports will receive much awaited funding as part of the Port Security Grant program. It is critically important that we do all we can to protect our ports from terrorism and other threats.
