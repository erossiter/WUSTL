SEN. CHAMBLISS VOTES IN FAVOR OF ONE-YEAR MORATORIUM ON EARMARKS
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., made the following statement after voting in favor of an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution that would place a one-year moratorium on congressional earmarks: 
   "We need to find a way to improve and provide greater transparency in the earmark process. If we do not get a handle on federal spending, we will pass this burden on to our children and grandchildren. I believe we need to hold the line on fiscal responsibility, and this amendment was a step in the right direction towards meaningful earmark reform."
   The amendment, offered by Senator Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, failed by a vote of 29 to 71.
