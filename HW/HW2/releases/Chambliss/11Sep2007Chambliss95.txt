SEN. CHAMBLISS: GEN. PETRAEUS, TROOPS DESERVE CONTINUED SUPPORT
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement after hearing testimony regarding the situation in Iraq from Commanding General David H. Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. Chambliss has traveled to Iraq on five different occasions, most recently in May of this year.  
   "I appreciate the straightforward and honest assessment given by both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker over the course of the last few days. While the situation in Iraq continues to be complex, it is an indisputable fact that the increase in troops has enhanced the security environment on the ground. When I was last in Iraq in May, I saw firsthand the progress that has been made, particularly in al-Anbar province. Our military has worked relentlessly under the direction of General Petraeus to pursue the enemy, disrupt al-Qaeda and uncover hidden weapons. However, to sustain this progress and continue improving security and political reconciliation, we need to give our full support to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in their current efforts in Iraq. 
   "Six years ago, the September 11th terrorist attacks completely altered our concept of war and the ways in which we address the threats facing our nation. Georgians are still very much concerned about their safety and security, and we can't afford to take our homeland security for granted. Our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America are true heroes, and it is because of their efforts and the efforts of intelligence and homeland security personnel that we have not suffered another attack on U.S. domestic soil since that day in 2001. We must continue to support them every day and show our appreciation for their sacrifice."
