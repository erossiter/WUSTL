GEORGIA-SOUTH CAROLINA LAWMAKERS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR SAVANNAH RIVER ECOLOGY LABORATORY
Georgia and South Carolina lawmakers today praised the Department of Energy's announcement of a long-term funding agreement for the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in Aiken, S.C. 
 The award guarantees $1 million in funding from the department in fiscal year 2007 for the operation and management of the lab by the University of Georgia. The school will also contribute an additional $1 million for operational costs. The cooperative agreement allows the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory the ability to seek funds from Department of Energy programs and other federal agencies to support individual tasks in future fiscal years. 
 U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Jim DeMint, R-S.C., along with U.S. Reps. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and Gresham Barrett, R-S.C., have worked together for nearly two years to ensure that the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory receives the necessary funding to remain operational. The lawmakers credit U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman for listening to their concerns and working with the Georgia and South Carolina delegations to maintain this important investment in the laboratory's critical work. 
 "In numerous meetings, phone calls and letters we jointly impressed upon Secretary Bodman the importance of this lab to our nation," said Sen. Chambliss. "The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory has been operated by the University of Georgia for over 55 years and has been widely recognized for its research, education and pubic outreach programs. I am thankful Secretary Bodman and his staff worked with us to address the laboratory's important funding needs."
 "I am very pleased Secretary Bodman and the Department of Energy have been willing to work with us to ensure that the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the University of Georgia can continue their critical research at Savannah River Site. Our Georgia and South Carolina delegations made a very strong case as to why the lab deserves to receive funding from the Department of Energy and I'm very pleased with the outcome," Sen. Isakson said.
 "The SREL has helped track the impact our Cold War missions have had on the environment," said Sen. Graham. "The data they collect provides a public health service and the funding agreement will allow the lab to continue to operate. I'm pleased we were able to work with our friends from Georgia, the lab, and DOE to come to an equitable solution for all concerned parties."
 "These funds will provide the seed money we need for SREL to become self-sufficient in coming years, and began providing world-class environmental research services to a broad-based clientele," said Rep. Norwood. "It has been a real battle to lock these funds in place, and I am very relieved that we have finally completed this first step towards a permanent fiscal foundation for this important facility." 
 "I thank Secretary Bodman and the Department of Energy for listening to the concerns of the South Carolina and Georgia delegation, and working with us on this issue," said Rep. Barrett. "There is no doubt the government is operating under tight budget constraints and I appreciate the fact that tough choices have to be made, but I am pleased the Department agrees with our belief that the research and educational programs at the Savannah River Ecology Lab contribute greatly to our nation and should continue."
 "Secretary Bodman and the Department of Energy did a great job working with the Georgia and South Carolina delegations to ensure funding for the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory," Congressman Jack Kingston stated. "I'm pleased that the important and critical research SREL conducts will be able to continue under the long term funding agreement" 
 "We are really pleased to have the opportunity to continue our long-term partnership with DOE conducting important Environmental and Ecological Research on the Savannah River Site and Elsewhere," said Dr. David C. Lee, Vice President for Research University of Georgia. 
 The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory provides an independent evaluation of the ecological effects of the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site operations through a program of ecological research, education and outreach. Its program involves basic and applied environmental research with emphasis on expanding the understanding of ecological processes and principles and upon evaluating the impacts of industrial and land use activities on the environment.
