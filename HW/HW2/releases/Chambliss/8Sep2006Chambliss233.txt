SEN. CHAMBLISS SADDENED BY PASSING OF FRIEND ERSKINE 'ERK' RUSSELL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss today released the following statement regarding the death of his friend, Erskine "Erk" Russell, the legendary head football coach at Georgia Southern University and the architect of some of the greatest defenses in the history of University of Georgia football. 
  "Erk Russell was a very good friend of mine for many years, even before I was elected to Congress, and I am truly shocked by his death. It really is hard to recall a time I was in Statesboro that I didn't visit with Erk at Snookys, where he was known to drink his coffee every day. And if Erk wasn't there, we'd put in a call and he'd come by. I will truly miss those visits with him. 
  "Julianne and I certainly mourn this great loss. We'd often run into Erk when we were at the beach with our family or at a banquet, and it was always a treat to see him. He was beloved by so many folks, and I know that his legacy will remain in the memories of the young men he molded into tenacious, spirited football teams year after year. He instilled such pride in people that will no doubt live on for generations to come."
