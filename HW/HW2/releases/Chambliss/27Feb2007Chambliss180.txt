SEN. CHAMBLISS TOUTS FOCUS ON BIOFUELS IN NEXT FARM BILL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today addressed members of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition at their annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Sen. Chambliss, a strong supporter of renewable fuels, outlined his work to promote regional diversity of commodities used to make biofuels while increasing America's energy security. The Coalition was established in 1991 to promote ethanol market expansion and 35 governors are members of the organization. 
  "One of the greatest successes of renewable energy production has been ethanol," said Sen. Chambliss. "The industry has experienced tremendous growth over the past year and production is out pacing requirements under the Renewable Fuels Standard. As the Agriculture Committee begins work on the Energy Title in next farm bill, we will focus our efforts on expanding research and development of new technologies like cellulosic ethanol. Our future depends on promoting homegrown renewable energy and decreasing our dependence on foreign sources of fuel." 
  Last month, Sen. Chambliss introduced the Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act, which would promote regional diversity in the production of biofuels. The plan requires a minimum level of production within a particular region to accelerate the production of cellulosic ethanol from a variety of resources such as wood chips in Southeast to wheat straw on the Great Plains. The legislation would also accelerate the minimum quantity derived from cellulosic biomass in the Renewable Fuels Standard, currently 250 million gallons, from 2013 to 2010.
  Plans are underway to build Georgia's first wood-based ethanol plant in Treutlen County. Range Fuels, Inc., a Colorado-based cellulosic ethanol company, made the announcement earlier this month and will have the capacity to create nearly 70 new jobs.
