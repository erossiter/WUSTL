SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE NEW TRAINING PROGRAM FOR DISLOCATED FORD, GENERAL MOTORS WORKERS IN ATLANTA AREA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that Ford Motor Company and General Motors employees affected by plant closures and reductions in the Atlanta area will have the opportunity to participate in a new demonstration project to develop job skills through training and education.  
  The project, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, will allow affected employees to procure new skills through self-managed, government-funded accounts, called Career Advancement Accounts. Recipients may use their accounts at their discretion to cover expenses directly related to education and training. 
  "This new innovative program will give employees affected by the Ford and GM plant closures and reductions the skills required to successfully enter and advance themselves in the ever-changing job market of the 21 st century," said Isakson.
  "This is an important initiative for those affected by the shift from the traditional manufacturing sector to the increased demand for high-tech jobs," said Chambliss. "I'm proud that we are able to offer these resources which will lead to increased opportunities and further success."
  All workers impacted by the Ford and General Motors plant closures and reductions are eligible to receive Career Advancement Accounts. Beginning on October 1, 2006, eligible Georgians may receive up to $3,000 per account by contacting their local career center. The accounts are renewable for an additional year, meaning workers could be eligible for a total of $6,000.
  The project is the first test of this new program that aims to give dislocated workers more flexibility and ownership over their efforts to be re-trained for new jobs.
