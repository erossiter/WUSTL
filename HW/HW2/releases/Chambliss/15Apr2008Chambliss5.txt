SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNOUNCED MERGER OF DELTA, NORTHWEST
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement regarding the merger between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines: 
   "For more than 60 years, Delta Air Lines has been a leading employer of countless Georgians and has established itself as an economic engine for the Southeast. Delta has met its challenges head on and is in a strong position to continue its service to people all over the world. The bottom line is Georgia has always been home for Delta and that is the way it should remain for many more years. I look forward to further details on this merger and will continue working to ensure that the interests of all parties involved, the employees and the customers in particular, are met in the strongest way possible."
