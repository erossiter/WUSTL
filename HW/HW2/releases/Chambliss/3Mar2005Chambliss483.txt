DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS PROGRAM ACCEPTING GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR FISCAL 2005
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, today announced that Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Preparedness will begin accepting electronic applications March 7, 2005, thru April 8, 2005, for funding under the Department's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program.  
   The purpose of these grants is to assist local fire departments and non-affiliated emergency medical services providers with the acquisition of equipment, vehicles and training. Program guidance for FY 2005 is available at www.firegrantsupport.com. Interested applicants may call the Fire Grant Helpline toll free at (866) 274-0960 for additional information. 
   "I encourage Georgia Fire Departments and Rescue Centers to apply for this grant program," Chambliss said. "These funds have been influential in helping to train and equip first responders in Georgia."
   The Assistance to Firefighter program authorization allows the Department to make grants on a competitive basis. Applications will be screened for consistency with program priorities which are included in the published program guidance available at the website noted above. Those applications best focused on program priorities will be subject to peer review and scored on their own merit.
