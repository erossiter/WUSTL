SEN. CHAMBLISS ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., announced today that he is accepting applications through Friday, OCTOBER 20, 2006 at 5:00pm for nominations to the nation's service academies.  
  "I am always excited to work with young people who are interested in attending one of our United States Service Academies. To help with this process, I have set up a Military Academy Selection Board, which helps select nominees using the competitive selection process for each academy. The Military Academy Selection Board will hold interviews the first Saturday in November, and nomination decisions will be made by the end of the year. This is a highly competitive process for a highly coveted nomination, and only the most qualified young men and women are chosen for this honor." 
  In order to help interested young people with their nominations, detailed information is available below to help answer questions about the nomination process and about submitting an application through my Senate office. Applications can be obtained on my website: www.chambliss.senate.gov or on the following links to our nation's service academy websites. 
  * U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, www.usafa.af.mil
   * U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, www.usma.edu
   * U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, www.usna.edu
   * U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, www.usmma.edu
   * U.S. Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut, www.cga.edu
  Please note that all applications for a nomination through my office are due by 5:00pm on Friday, OCTOBER 20, 2006. Because there is a great deal of information required by the service academies for a nomination, this is not a process to be taken lightly. Applications received after the deadline will not be considered, and no exceptions can be made.
  "Because of the lengthy time needed to complete and process all necessary paper work, applicants should submit a nomination application immediately," said Chambliss. "Those who are considered for a service academy appointment should demonstrate academic achievement in high school, leadership potential, physical fitness, and personal motivation."
  The academies make the final appointments, but Chambliss' nominations are critical for all Georgia students because candidates cannot be accepted to the academies without a nomination from their senator, congressman or the Vice President or the President. 
  All applicants must be U.S. citizens, legal residents of Georgia, at least 17 years old but not beyond their 22nd birthday on July 1, 2006, and unmarried with no children.
