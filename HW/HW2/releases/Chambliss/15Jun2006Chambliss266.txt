SEN. CHAMBLISS COSPONSORS LEGISLATION TO CUT FEDERAL SPENDING
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., has cosponsored legislation to bring more discipline to the federal budget process in order to reduce federal spending, reduce the deficit, and balance the budget.  
  "If we don't get a handle on federal spending and make serious reforms now, we will pass this burden on to our children and grandchildren," said Chambliss. "When I travel around the state of Georgia, I hear directly from folks who are concerned about their tax dollars - and for good reason. I believe this package makes much-needed reforms to our broken budget process, puts an end to wasteful spending, and implements the fiscal responsibility my constituents demand."
  The "Stop Over-Spending (S.O.S) Act," introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg, R-NH, includes line-item veto authority for the president; the reinstatement of caps on discretionary spending enforceable through automatic across-the-board spending reductions; creates two commissions to study the accountability and efficiency of government programs as well as examine and provide solutions to the impeding entitlement crisis; and institutes biennial budgeting to make the current process more efficient.
