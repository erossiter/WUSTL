SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES NEW VETERAN'S CENTER FOR MACON
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today applauded the Department of Veterans Affairs' decision to open a new clinic in Macon in 2008. This new facility will serve as a critical resource for all Macon area veterans, particularly those who have recently returned from the Global War on Terror and for their families by providing readjustment counseling and outreach services. 
  "We must do all that we can to meet the needs of our veterans," said Chambliss, "It is critical that these men and women have access to the services provided by the veterans' centers. This announcement underscores the significant contributions and sacrifices being made by Georgia's military community and I am proud to announce that our veterans in middle Georgia will have access to these important resources." 
  Combat veterans and their families will have access to community-based services such as mental health and employment counseling, services on family issues and education, bereavement and outreach assistance. The center in Macon will be staffed by a small team of counselors, outreach specialists and other specialists. 
  The veterans' center program was established by Congress in 1979 for veterans who served in combat and are eligible for care at a VA veterans' center at no cost, as are their families for military-related issues. 
  Currently, VA maintains 209 veterans' centers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
