WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Dear Friends: 
  This week the U.S. Senate debated the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am proud to work each day on behalf of our servicemen and women and their families. The current bill includes several provisions I sponsored such as improved care for wounded warriors and retirement benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserve. The bill also authorizes a pay increase for military personnel, funding for much-needed equipment, as well as infrastructure at Georgia military installations and funding for Georgia-made weapons systems.
  I am disappointed that Democratic leaders pulled this bill from consideration after an attempt to impose a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq was defeated. To read my full statement on this issue, click here.

   BORDER SECURITY
  Last week, Senator Isakson and I sent a follow-up letter to President Bush urging him to send an emergency supplemental spending bill to Congress to fund border security. Although the Senate has turned to other legislative priorities, illegal immigration still remains the most pressing domestic issue affecting our communities.

   GEORGIA ON SHORT LIST FOR NATIONAL BIO AND AGRO-DEFENSE FACILITY
  Athens, Georgia has been included in the short list of candidates for the proposed National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week narrowed the field to five states. I have been working with Governor Perdue, Senator Isakson, and many others to keep the Athens site at the top of the heap, and I am extremely pleased with this announcement. We are proud of the fact that Georgia is a research hub, and the location of this proposed facility would further enhance the already outstanding reputation and stature of our state as a place for medical, bio and agricultural research.

   LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR DISASTER DECLARATION SENT TO USDA 
  This week Senator Isakson, Congressman Kingston, and I sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Mike Johanns requesting swift approval and support of the Georgia State Emergency Board's request for a disaster declaration for all 159 counties in Georgia affected by extreme drought conditions. 
  We need to do everything we can to help Georgia farmers recover from one of the driest growing seasons in recent memory. Our agricultural community has had a number of weather-related disasters already this year, including the devastating freeze this spring and the wildfires that continue to burn in southern Georgia as a result of no or little rainfall. I urge Secretary Johanns to swiftly approve the request so our farmers can get the help they desperately need.

  NEXT WEEK?
  Next week the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1642, the Higher Education Authorization Act.
