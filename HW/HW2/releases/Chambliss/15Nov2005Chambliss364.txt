SENS. CHAMBLISS-ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $4.4 MILLION IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FUNDS FOR THE STATE OF GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the State of Georgia will receive a $4,485,848 grant to improve state and local security programs. 
   The funds will be distributed through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness as part of its Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Management Performance Grants Program. Each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and seven territories will receive funding from the FY 2006 Appropriations Act for the Department of Homeland Security.
   Specifically, the funds will support comprehensive state and local emergency management to enhance the improvement of preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities for all hazards.
   "These funds will help strengthen Georgia's emergency programs and ensure that we are up-to-date and ready to respond in any urgent situation," said Chambliss. "It is crucial that we continue to maintain our response programs and protect the safety of Georgians and all Americans."
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for emergency and first response activities in Georgia," said Isakson. "As we have been recently reminded, we must be able to respond as quickly and effectively as possible for unexpected circumstances."
