SENS. MILLER, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE OVER $260 MILLION FOR GEORGIA MILITARY CONSTRUCTION NEEDS
  Sens. Zell Miller (D-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today announced that an important annual funding bill for America's military construction projects nationwide includes key funds for Georgia's military construction needs. The legislation is scheduled to come before the Senate for a vote as early as next week. 
   This appropriations bill provides funds for construction and housing at U.S. military installations across the nation. The House of Representatives passed a companion bill earlier this week. 
   "I'm very pleased that Congress is poised to approve these funds for our Georgia bases. We have the finest military installations in the U.S., and they have performed extraordinarily well for this country and in the war in Iraq," Miller said. "Senator Chambliss and I will continue to work hard to ensure they have the resources necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of our service members and their families."
   "Funds allocated for military construction at Georgia military installations are a down payment on future national defense," said U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. "While many of these facilities will help our troops do their job of protecting this nation, others will improve the quality of life of the brave men and women who have volunteered to serve the nation."

   * $49.56 million at Fort Benning for a Barracks Complex at Kelly Hill;
