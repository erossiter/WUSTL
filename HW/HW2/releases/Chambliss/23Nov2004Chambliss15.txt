SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER HAIL SENATE APPROVAL OF ST. SIMONS ISLAND ATTORNEY TO SERVE AS U.S. ATTORNEY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Zell Miller, D-Ga., announced today that the Senate unanimously confirmed the nomination of St.  
 Simons Island attorney Lisa Godbey Wood to serve as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. Earlier this year, Wood was nominated by President George W. Bush to this position. 
   "Mrs. Wood is highly qualified and I am honored to have played a role in making this possible," said Chambliss, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Lisa Wood will be a tremendous asset to the people of Georgia as a U.S. attorney." 
   "Mrs. Wood will serve Georgia and the nation very ably. I am so pleased she has won confirmation," Miller said.
   Before assuming responsibility as Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District in July, Mrs. Wood practiced law at the Brunswick-based law firm of Gilbert, Harrell, Sumerford & Martin. Mrs. Wood is a resident of St. Simons Island. She received her Juris Doctor when she graduated summa cum laude from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1990. Her undergraduate degree was also earned at the University of Georgia. 
   Last year, Chambliss and Miller created a screening panel to review candidates' professional competence and qualifications and make recommendations on nominees to be considered by the White House in filling the vacancy. The screening panel is comprised of Frank C. Jones, a retired partner of King & Spalding in Atlanta, who now resides in Macon; the Honorable H. Arthur (Mac) McLane of Valdosta, Chief Judge of the Superior Courts for the Southern Judicial Circuit of Georgia, and William U. Norwood, III with Pope, McGlamry, Kilpartick, Morrison and Norwood, of Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia.
