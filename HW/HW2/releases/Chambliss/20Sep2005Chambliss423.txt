SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $3 MILLION FOR GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR KATRINA-RELATED RELIEF
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Georgia Department of Labor will receive a $3 million grant to provide a wide range of assistance for Hurricane Katrina evacuees in Georgia. 
   The funds will be distributed through the Workforce Investment Act National Emergency Grant Funds.
   This grant will help fund temporary employment to assist disaster relief efforts, including supporting shelter operations, and assisting with humanitarian efforts. It will also provide needs-related payments for those not eligible for or who have exhausted either Disaster Unemployment Assistance or unemployment insurance.
   The funds will be used for short-term vocations training that could be useful in rebuilding or resettlement efforts, job search assistance and temporary unsubsidized employment opportunities in the private sector. Additionally, the grant will be used for dissemination of information on how to access Disaster Unemployment Assistance or Unemployment Insurance, the establishment of temporary shelters and crisis and financial counseling.
   "I am so pleased to announce these important funds for Georgia as citizens across the state continue to aid victims of this terrible storm," said Isakson. "The evacuees of Hurricane Katrina need all the support we can give them, and the state of Georgia cannot handle this burden without federal assistance."
   "These important funds for the Georgia Department of Labor will help citizens affected by the storm begin the process of rebuilding. In addition to the destruction of residential homes across the state, a number of businesses were severely impacted. This funding will provide people in need the resources to find employment opportunities," said Chambliss. "I will continue to work with my colleagues in support of the programs that provide aid to communities in need."
