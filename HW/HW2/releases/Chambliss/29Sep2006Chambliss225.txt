SEN. CHAMBLISS SECURES FUNDING FOR ROBINS AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Friday announced funding for a $21 million software support facility at Robins Air Force Base which he secured in the National Defense Authorization Act which will pass the Senate today.  
  This project will enable the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center to bring in additional core capability to support the current shortfall in software support by providing additional software work capacity. The new software facility will provide valuable support and upgrades to a wide range of weapon systems, including the F-15, C-5, C-17, C-130, and F-22 and will result in increased throughput and decreased work in progress of software modifications and development in support of multiple weapon systems. 
  "As a conferee on this bill, I am pleased that we were successful in securing the $21 million for this facility which will ensure that Robins remains on the cutting edge of software work and that our warfighters receive the best and most up to date systems available," said Chambliss.
  The software facility will allow for the continuation of lean and process improvement initiatives which will reduce development costs for future capabilities, reduce operating costs for software operations, reduce maintenance and licensing costs for hardware and software, provide infrastructure to allow further establishment of public-private partnerships to support core mission capabilities, avoid necessity to rent off-base space to support core software missions, and provide a software "campus" by co-location of all software facilities.
