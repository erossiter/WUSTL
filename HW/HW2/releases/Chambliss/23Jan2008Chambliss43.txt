SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement regarding the push for an economic stimulus package. 
   "I am in support of a stimulus plan to jump start our now sluggish economy. I will support a plan that makes a real effort to reach those who are struggling the most, and at the same time I want to make certain that we do not implement a plan that will simply stimulate retail sales and support the economies of trading partners. We should seek to enact policies that will promote American manufacturing. We must also enact measures that will benefit the small business community in this country as that is where the majority of the jobs in this country come from. I look forward to a quick, bipartisan solution, but whatever package surfaces should not raise taxes or increase the size of government."
