  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the City of Atlanta will receive a $225,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Operation Weed and Seed program.  
   The Community Capacity Development Office will once again distribute the funding that supports Operation Weed and Seed and other programs with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of violent crime and drug offences, in public and federally-assisted low-income housing.

   "This important program will fund a wide range of community initiatives, such as housing and rehabilitation, support services, and public improvements for the Vine City site in Atlanta ," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live." 
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for Atlanta's Vine City site," said Isakson. "Operation Weed and Seed is an important initiative for our communities and at-risk youth."
   Operation Weed and Seed is a community-based initiative that encompasses an innovative and comprehensive multi-agency approach to law enforcement, crime prevention, and community revitalization.
