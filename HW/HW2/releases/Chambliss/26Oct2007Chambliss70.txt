WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Dear Friends:
   This week the Senate approved the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3043). This bill is the largest non-defense appropriations bill that provides funding for important health and education-related programs, including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Social Services programs, job training programs, the administration of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as many other programs. Also this week, the Senate Agriculture Committee, on which I serve as Ranking Republican Member, approved the 2007 farm bill, which is expected to be considered on the Senate floor in early November. 
   GEORGIA FACES WATER CRISIS  
  Georgia is currently experiencing the most unprecedented drought in many, many years. This crisis threatens our water supply that provides for our residences and businesses, drinking water, hydropower, recreation, and many other needs. Simply put, our lakes and river basins are at dangerously low levels. 
  This morning, Senator Isakson and I joined Governor Sonny Perdue in a meeting at the Georgia State Capitol with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne and James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, to discuss a way to relieve our state from this current crisis.
  Governor Sonny Perdue has requested that President Bush declare the State of Georgia a disaster and has asked the president to exempt us from the Endangered Species Act during this time of crisis. This Act was enacted in 1973, and requires that certain amounts of water from Georgia be released downstream to protect mussels and sturgeon in Florida. 
  We have varying needs throughout our river basins, and striking the right balance requires the cooperation of many different stakeholders. However, in times like these, when the health and safety of our human population is threatened and we have exhausted all means to find a solution, it is a logical conclusion that the provisions of the Endangered Species Act should be temporarily suspended so that a short term fix can be provided.
  This week during a meeting at the White House, I underscored to President Bush the dire implications of the drought and expressed my support for Governor Perdue's emergency declaration request. 
  I will continue to work in Washington to do everything I can from a federal standpoint to make sure we reach a fair solution as soon as possible.

   2007 FARM BILL
  This week the Senate Agriculture Committee approved the 2007 farm bill. As Ranking Republican Member of the Committee, I am looking forward to debating the 2007 farm bill in the U.S. Senate. America has a very diverse agricultural landscape, and every part of the farm bill has a large impact on agribusiness and the U.S. economy as a whole. I am proud to represent the hard working men and women who get dirt under their fingernails each and every day to provide the highest quality agricultural products in the world. It is my hope the Senate will pass a bill that does not require raising taxes to fund new spending, does not disregard existing trade agreements, and protects the safety net of American farmers and ranchers, who are the backbone of this country.
