LAWRENCEVILLE NATIVE RECEIVES NATIONAL ANGEL IN ADOPTION AWARD
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., announced Lawrenceville native Gregg Dickson has been selected as a recipient of the 2005 congressional Angels in Adoption awards.  
   Each year, members of congress are given the opportunity to select individuals, families or organizations from their home sates, who have demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of children in need of permanent, loving homes. 
   "It is an honor to announce Gregg's Angel in Adoption award," Chambliss said. "The Dickson family deserves recognition for their compassion and generosity, and I know that others will be inspired by their commitment to children in need."
   Gregg Dickson is the Director of Document and Content Management for Wells Real Estate Funds, a national real estate investment management company. Dickson is a Computer Science graduate of Clemson University and a member of the Association for Information and Image Management and a member of the Association for Computing Machinery.
   Dickson's family has a long history of supporting the foster care system. His wife, Vicki, and two daughters, Whitney and Brantley, have fostered nine children in the last 13 years and adopted a son, Jamie, from Romania in 2000. In addition, they have opened their home to many troubled teenagers.
