SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR FUNDING FOR NORTH GEORGIA
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today announced final Congressional approval of fiscal year 2006 appropriations for the U.S. Department of Interior, including funds for several important Georgia projects.  
   "This important bill will help make continued improvements for the sewer systems in Columbus and Atlanta," said Chambliss. "The bill also funds a number projects that will preserve important lands, help Georgia's key historical areas and help our water needs." 
   The City of Atlanta will receive $500,000 to improve the west area combined sewer overflow tunnel. The purpose of the project is to capture, convey, store, and treat combined sewer overflows in a portion of the City of Atlanta.
   The Georgia Department of Natural Resources will receive $2,000,000 through the Forest legacy Program for The Altamaha River Corridor. This funding will specifically protect 7.5 miles of the Altamaha River, containing high quality natural areas including bottomland hardwood forests, freshwater tidal cypress-tupelo forests, high quality bluff forests, and remnants of longleaf pine forests. 
   Paulding County will receive $250,000 from the Forest Legacy Program to go towards purchasing lands currently leased by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and managed as the Paulding Forest Wildlife Management Area, Georgia's third most popular Wildlife Management Area.
