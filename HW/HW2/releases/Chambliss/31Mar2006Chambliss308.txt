SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE SUPPORT OF GEORGIA BID FOR NATIONAL BIO, AGRO-DEFENSE FACILITY
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced their strong support for the State of Georgia's proposal to locate a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Georgia.  
  The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility will research high-consequence biological threats involving human and foreign animal diseases as well as diseases transmitted from animals to humans. The new facility will replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York, which was built in the 1950s and is nearing the end of its lifecycle.
  "With the CDC, USDA facilities and our top-ranked health institutions, Georgia is the ideal location for the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility," Isakson said. "Senator Chambliss and I will do everything we can to help in the effort to bring this facility to Georgia."
  "Georgia is the best location for these new facilities - bar none," said Chambliss. "Our job now is to ensure the Department of Homeland Security understands what a win-win selecting Georgia would mean. Our highly skilled, well educated work force and first class infrastructures would be a perfect match."
  Existing federal research and development facilities in Georgia include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and several USDA Agriculture Research Service facilities. Georgia is also home to the fourth-largest university system in the country as well as state-of-the-art health research institutions at Emory University and the Medical College of Georgia.
