SEN. CHAMBLISS: C-17 HAS LONG HISTORY CONTRIBUTING TO SUCCESSFUL MILITARY OPERATIONS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement after the Boeing Corp.'s announcement to close the C-17 production line in Macon.  
  "The C-17 is a critical aircraft and has contributed to the success of multiple military efforts throughout its history with the Air Force. This cargo plane has not only helped our soldiers on the battlefield, but has played a critical role in delivering supplies to assist relief efforts in disaster areas after hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in south Asia and the earthquake in Pakistan. 
  "Employing the use of the C-17 would not have been possible had it not been for the large number of civilian and military employees who help build this aircraft at the Boeing facility in Macon. These men and women do an outstanding job, paying close attention to detail and taking very seriously their role in production of this important aircraft. 
  "Throughout my tenure in Congress I have always been a very strong supporter of the C-17 program. I am disappointed with today's announcement, but will continue to support the C-17 for our military."
  Chambliss joined Sen. Jim Talent (R-MO) in sending a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld urging that more C-17 aircraft be included in the FY08 defense budget. The Senate Armed Services Committee, of which Chambliss is a member, has added C-17 aircraft and opposed termination of the production line in the current version of the FY07 defense budget. Furthermore, the FY06 Defense Appropriations bill includes language that would direct the Department of Defense to continue funding the C-17 in next year's defense budget.
