SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE BUDGET
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement regarding the passage of the Senate Budget Resolution.  
  "Today the United States Senate passed a Budget that seeks to restore fiscal responsibility in Washington. The Budget seeks to reign in federal spending, and at the same time, provides support for the protection of our ports and the protection of our citizens by increasing funding for homeland security. The Budget also restores funds for the Community Development Block Grant program for our cities and our counties, and ensures our law enforcement officials have the right tools by restoring funds for the Byrne grants program. 
  "This is a very positive Budget. It's one we can look at and say we are moving in the right direction when it comes to deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility."
  The Budget includes a Chambliss authored provision that provides key resources for America's local law enforcement by restoring funds for the Byrne Grant program.
