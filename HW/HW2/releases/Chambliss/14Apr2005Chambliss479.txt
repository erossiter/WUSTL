SEN. CHAMBLISS PARTICIPATES IN FAIRTAX PRESS CONFERENCE
  Today, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, and Rep. John Linder, R-Ga, held a FairTax (H.R. 25/S.25) press conference on Capitol Hill. Joining them were Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Rep. Steve King (R-IA). The press conference focused on the need for Congress to enact fundamental tax reform legislation. 
   "Every April people across the country spend countless hours and billions of dollars preparing their taxes in order to be in compliance with a tax code that is complicated and outdated," Chambliss said. "There is a better plan on the horizon, a plan that is fair, simple, honest, and consistent. That plan is the FairTax."
   The FairTax would shift the federal government's method of revenue collection from income to personal consumption. The FairTax repeal all federal personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes, and gift and estate taxes and replace these taxes with a revenue-neutral 23 percent personal consumption tax on all retail sales of new goods and services. 
   "I urge every worker in America to get out your pay check stub and look at the Federal taxes that are being withheld," Chambliss continued. "Under the FairTax plan, you would put that amount of money back in your pocket. Then you, as an individual, could determine how much money you pay in taxes based on how often you go to the store and make purchases. That's about as fair and simple as you can get."
   In the 108th Congress, the FairTax had 54 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, more than any other fundamental tax reform bill. A bi-partisan version of the FairTax was also introduced in the U.S. Senate for the first time in the 108th Congress by U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) and Zell Miller (D-GA), S.1493.
