  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement following his tour of storm damage in South Georgia with President Bush. 
   "You simply cannot comprehend the magnitude of what mother nature can do to communities until you see the devastation first-hand, on the ground, and among those affected by it. That's why I am pleased the President made the visit to South Georgia today, because Georgians are going to need help in rebounding from this situation. I stand ready to assist our citizens and I applaud our folks down here who responded quickly and continue to work tirelessly to move us forward through this process."
