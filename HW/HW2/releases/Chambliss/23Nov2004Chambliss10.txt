SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER ANOUNCE INTERIOR FUNDS FOR GEORGIA
  Sens. Zell Miller (D-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) announced today that several Georgia projects for interior will receive funding as part of the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which the Senate passed Saturday.  
   "I am extremely pleased with this bill, which invests in Georgia's rich natural resources," Miller said. "The funds for the Georgia Mountains Project will go a long way in helping to maintain our environment and preserve this land for future generations to enjoy." 
   "Restoring our historical landmarks and refurbishing our recreational areas is a wise investment in the future of our great state," said Chambliss. "I am proud to help secure funds for these important Georgia projects. 
   The bill includes $1 million for the Georgia Mountains Riparian Project. These funds will be used by the Nature Conservancy to help purchase several tracts of land adjacent to or surrounded by the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. The land will eventually be donated to the Forest Service for inclusion in the National Forest System.
   The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge will receive $600,000 in construction funds for work on facilities in the Visitor Center and Swamp Boardwalk areas. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport's Port of Entry will receive funding to help in adequately staffing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Inspectors to meet import and export cargo regulatory requirements.
   The Augusta Canal National Heritage Area will receive $400,000 from the National Park Service's Heritage Partnership Program for general operations and future expansion. The Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission will receive $500,000 to help with cooperative agreements for streambank restoration.

   * $2,459,000 to restore Ebenezer Baptist Church 
   * $2,125,000 for the Chattahoochee River National recreation Area
