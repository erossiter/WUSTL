SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., tonight released the following statement regarding President Bush's State of the Union address.  
  "Tonight President Bush highlighted a number of America's international and domestic accomplishments, as well as, outlined his plans to improve health care, reduce our dependency on foreign oil, and maintain our competitive edge in the world economy. 
  "We are making tremendous strides in the War on Terror. In the past year alone, the Iraqi people have held three free, open, and democratic elections, an unprecedented event for the citizens of this country. This great accomplishment would not have happened if not for the brave sacrifice on the part of the United States Armed Forces under the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief. 
  "Despite what some skeptics are saying, unemployment is at an all time low--in fact it's the lowest it has ever been in my lifetime. Our economy continues to grow stronger as more jobs are created. 
  "I am also pleased to see President Bush address the need for affordable health care for all Americans. There is no more important asset to a family than to make sure that they have a good health care insurance and that's not present in every household in America today. 
  "I look forward to hearing more about all of the President's initiatives in the days to come and look forward to tackling these issues as they come before the United States Senate."
