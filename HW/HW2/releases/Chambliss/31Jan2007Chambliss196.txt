SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS EFFORTS TO KEEP AGRICULTURE RESEARCH FACILITY OPEN
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, today was pleased with the announcement that the University of Georgia College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences Southeast Research and Education Center, located near Midville, will remain open. The facility conducts research on drought and pest resistance of a variety of crops.  
  "I am pleased that through the efforts of Dean Angle the Southeast Research and Education Center will remain open," said Sen. Saxby Chambliss. "The research conducted at this facility serves farmers across the state, particularly those located in Southeast Georgia who farm in soil conditions only found in this part of the state. Some of the most advanced agriculture science and technology research in the state is conducted here and I commend all those at the University for taking the necessary steps that will allow the research center to stay in operation."
  The Southeast Research and Education Center, established in 1952, has produced some of the states most extensive cotton research. Today, the center conducts a variety of research projects on row crops, insect pest and disease control and plant variety evaluations.
