SEN. CHAMBLISS WORKS TO OPEN JAPAN'S MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF
  Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) issued the following statement as a cosponsor of legislation by Sen.  
 Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) to authorize appropriate action if negotiations with Japan to allow the resumption of United States beef exports are not successful:
   "In October of 2004, the American and Japanese governments signed a written agreement that detailed the final steps necessary to reopen the beef trade between our two countries.
   "At this point, a year has passed since that agreement, and Japanese officials are dragging their feet. This is being done despite the fact that the panel of BSE experts on the Japanese Food Safety Commission has concluded that beef from U.S. cattle less than 21 months of age is just as safe as their own Japanese domestic beef.
   "I, for one, have lost patience with the obvious foot-dragging of the Japanese bureaucracy. The Japanese government agrees that U.S. beef is safe. They have said U.S. beef is safe, and they've said it publicly. Now they need to stop delaying and normalize trade in beef and beef products on the basis of their own scientific determination.
   "I believe in the power of free and fair trade, and I regret that inaction of the Japanese bureaucracy has created a situation where retaliatory measures are warranted. However, this bill still gives the Japanese time to act on the basis of internationally-accepted science and avoid sanctions. It is my hope that they will respect sound science, reopen their market to US beef promptly, and that we can all get back to the business of mutually-beneficial trade."
