SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $200,000 in funding for the Morehouse School of Medicine for the school's community development initiative in Atlanta's West-End neighborhood. 
   Chambliss and Isakson worked with Senate appropriators to secure these important funds for Georgia as part of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   "This important program will fund a wide range of community initiatives, such as housing and rehabilitation, support services, educational opportunities, and public improvements for the West-End area," said Chambliss. "I am honored to support Morehouse School of Medicine in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for the Morehouse School of Medicine," Isakson said. "These funds will help the school rejuvenate the West-End district and initiate a variety of community opportunities for its residents."
   In an effort to boost the West-End neighborhood and expand its institutional capabilities, Morehouse School of Medicine is working with two of its sister institutions to acquire an 11-acre plot of public housing land directly across from its campus. The acquisition and revitalization of this property holds great promise for increasing the institutional capacity of the medical school and restoring the West-End community through greater economic, educational, and health care opportunities for its residents.
