SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES IRAQI ELECTIONS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement about his trip to Iraq to observe the elections: 
   "I was fortunate enough this week to be one of four members of the United State Senate to be an official election observer for the elections in Iraq. It was truly a historic day for the people of Iraq. The excitement and the enthusiasm on the faces of the Iraqi people was so emotional, and so exciting to those of us who were there on the ground in both al-Hilla and in Baghdad. We were able to see history in the making.
   "The number of people who turned out was overwhelming. It was much greater participation than what we have seen in the two previous elections. The people who we saw at the polls brought their children, and the children were excited.
   "The fact that Iraqis provided security for the polling places, and the absence of violence are further signs that we are making real progress. When Iraqis are able to provide overall security in the country, then we are going to be able to bring our troops home.
   "It was a truly great day from the election standpoint, and it was also a great from a security standpoint in Iraq. Now we are going to look forward to the process moving ahead next year. The election will have to be certified, the government will have to be put in place, the constitution will have to be rewritten, and at that point in time our goal is that we see the Kurds, the Shi'as, and the Sunni's working together for one unified Iraq."
