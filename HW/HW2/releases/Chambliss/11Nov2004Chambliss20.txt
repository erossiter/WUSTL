VETERANS DAY MESSAGE FROM SEN. CHAMBLISS
  On Veterans Day we honor and remember those brave and courageous men and women who have served our Nation and defended our freedom.    
   For Georgians, Veterans Day is especially important because our state is home to more than 700,000 veterans, thirteen military installations, and home to thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. 
  It is with great honor and the deepest respect that our Nation says a very special thank you to our veterans. I have always said every veteran who served our Nation and defended our freedom is a true American hero and today this couldn't be more true. 
  So let us commemorate Veterans Day by pledging ourselves to thank those who served and say a special prayer for those fighting men and women serving right now in our armed forces. God bless America and God bless our Nation's veterans.
