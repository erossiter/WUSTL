BATTEN CONFIRMED FOR NORTHERN DISTRICT JUDGESHIP
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced final Senate confirmation of Timothy C. Batten, Sr., President Bush's nominee to serve as the United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia.  
  The position is vacated by Willis B. Hunt, Jr. who took senior status last year. 
  A native Georgian and resident of east Cobb County, Batten graduated with highest honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology and cum laude from the University of Georgia School of Law. After graduation from law school, Batten accepted a position with the firm Schreeder, Wheeler and Flint and became a full equity partner in 1993. 
  "Timothy Batten was a strong candidate for this appointment and I am proud my Senate colleagues unanimously approved his nomination," said Chambliss. "His commitment to the rule of law and sound temperament are qualities that Georgians can rely on as he serves on the federal bench in north Georgia." 
  "The Senate has confirmed an exceptionally qualified individual," Isakson said. "Timothy Batten will serve the people in the Northern District with honesty and integrity."
