SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GRANT FOR ATHENS-CLARKE COUNTY
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Athens-Clarke County Unified Government will receive a $225,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Operation Weed and Seed program.  
   The Community Capacity Development Office will distribute the funding that supports Operation Weed and Seed with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of violent crime and drug offences, in public and federally-assisted low-income housing. The initiative also assists at-risk youth residing in public housing with educational attainment and life skills training. 
   The Athens-Clarke County Weed and Seed site in the Hancock Corridor received official recognition in March 2003. This is the site's second award to implement its strategy. During this project period, Athens law enforcement officials will combine robust enforcement and prosecution efforts with social service programs that are used as crime prevention tools. 
   "This important program will fund a wide range of community initiatives, such as housing and rehabilitation, support services, and public improvements for Athens," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live." 
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for Athens-Clarke County," said Isakson. "Operation Weed and Seed is an important initiative for our communities and at-risk youth." 
   Operation Weed and Seed is a community-based initiative that encompasses an innovative and comprehensive multi-agency approach to law enforcement, crime prevention, and community revitalization.
