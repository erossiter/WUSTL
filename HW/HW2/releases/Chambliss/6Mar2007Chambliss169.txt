SEN. CHAMBLISS DISCUSSES CHILD NUTRITION AT SENATE AGRICULTURE HEARING
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today received testimony during a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing that focused on child nutrition and the school setting. In his opening remarks, Sen. Chambliss said that school nutrition programs are good for families, good for farmers and good for the future of America. 
   "Good nutrition is not only important for good heath but also for proper cognitive development in our children," said Sen. Chambliss, Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Our school nutrition programs are a key component in our efforts to provide healthy, nutritious meals to our nation's school children. We appreciate the efforts of our school nutrition professionals, many of whom are visiting with us today, for the job they perform to ensure that our young people have a healthy start on life."
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service administers the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs which serves more than 30 million lunches and more than 9 million breakfasts each school day. In fiscal year 2006, these programs received $12.2 billion in federal funding. Sen. Chambliss said that he is committed to making certain the nutrition assistance programs have the funding it needs to adequately serve school children.
   "Nutrition programs have been and continue to be an important part of the farm bill," said Sen. Chambliss. "Although the Committee will be facing budgetary pressures from all interested parties when writing the farm bill, I look forward to working together in a bipartisan way to address the nutritional issues, which are critical to the well being of so many of our nation's children."
   Also present for the hearing were members of the Georgia School Nutrition Association (GSNA). The organization is headquartered in Tucker, Georgia, with over 7,000 members statewide.
