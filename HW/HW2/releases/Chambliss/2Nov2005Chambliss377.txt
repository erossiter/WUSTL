SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $3.9 MILLION IN FUNDS FOR HEAD START PROGRAMS IN NORTH GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., announced today that the Family Resource Agency, Inc. of North Georgia, based in Rossville, Ga., will receive $3,908,577 through the Head Start program to increase the school readiness of young children in low-income families.  
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Region IV Office for Children and Families will distribute the funding.
   "Head Start is one of the best ways to advance education for young children. The younger children are exposed to learning the better they will do later in life," said Chambliss. "The biggest investment we can make as a nation is in our youth. As the husband and father of two public school teachers, I understand the need for important initiatives such as Head Start, and I commend the Family Resource Agency of North Georgia for their commitment to education. 
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for Head Start at the Family Resource Agency of North Georgia," said Isakson. "Our children need every opportunity for a good, strong education and Head Start gets many children started on the right path to that goal."
   Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. 
   The Head Start program has a long tradition of delivering comprehensive and high quality services designed to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start grantee and delegate agencies provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education and early childhood development; medical, dental, and mental health; nutrition; and parent involvement. In addition, the entire range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each child's and family's developmental, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage and experience.
