CONGRESS PASSES REP. CHAMBLISS' VISA REFORM BILLS
  The U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate passed the L-1 Visa (Intracompany Transferee) Reform Act of 2003 to stop the use of a loophole in our immigration laws. "I've been working on this legislation for two years and it is an important protection for American workers," Chambliss said. 
   Without this fix, some firms use the L-1 visa to act as international "job shops," bringing in foreign workers essentially for their labor and outsourcing those workers to third-party companies. As a result, some U.S. workers are being displaced by foreign workers. 
   While the legislation does not harm the legitimate use of the L visa by most U.S. companies, the bill will stop firms from circumventing the original intent of the visa. 
   "My bill targets the problem, plugs the loophole, and protects U.S. jobs," said Chambliss.
   Chambliss' L-1 Visa Reform Act:
   Requires any specialized knowledge employee who is petitioning for a L-1 visa and who will be located at an off-site workplace to be:
   * Controlled and supervised by the petitioning company; and
   * Provided in connection with an exchange of a product or service.
   Mandates the Department of Homeland Security to provide statistics about which L-1 workers are employed off-site in order to discourage fraud uses of the visa.
   Additionally, Congress passed reforms for the H-1B visa program which allows U.S. companies to employ highly-skilled foreign workers. Unlike the L visa program in which a company must employ the worker in advance, the H-1B program includes a number of safeguards to ensure that U.S. workers are not disadvantaged. Overall, the H-1B visa is important to U.S. companies who must compete against global businesses. 
   The legislative reforms exempt up to 20,000 Masters and PhD graduates of U.S. universities from the annual 65,000 H-1B cap. These workers comprise the "best of the best" among the highly-skilled professionals that are critical to U.S. companies. 
   "This bill ensures we build our competitive strength and keep jobs here in the U.S.," Chambliss said.
   The H-1B legislation includes a number of U.S. worker protections such as:
   * Increases the fee to $1,500 fund for each applicant for education and training programs for U.S. workers;
  * Adds a $500 anti-fraud fee to every H-1B visa (and L visa) application to better protect against inappropriate uses of the visa program; 
   * Requires companies must attest that the H-1B worker will not displace a U.S. worker; 
   * Increases the prevailing wage requirement to 100% so that companies must pay foreign workers an equivalent salary to their U.S. counterparts; and 
   * Expands the Department of Labor's authority to conduct investigations and enforcement actions against inappropriate uses of the H-1B visa program.
   This is a balanced bill that provides for the needs of U.S. businesses and protects the interests of U.S. workers. Importantly, this legislation will increase our competitiveness and promote job growth for America's future.
