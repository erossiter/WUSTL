SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS URGE PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT GOV. PERDUE'S REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOLLOWING SEVERE STORM DAMAGE
  U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today expressed their strong support for Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue's request for an expedited major disaster declaration from President Bush to assist the City of Atlanta and Fulton County, which were affected by this weekend's devastating tornadoes. 
   A federal disaster declaration will make the state eligible for federal funding for emergency response measures and aid for losses. The senators have been in communication with local and state emergency officials following the storms. On Wednesday, Chambliss and Isakson will tour the affected areas in downtown Atlanta.
   "My prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy, and I want to thank the emergency personnel who responded so quickly. I also want to thank Governor Perdue and Mayor Franklin for their continued leadership during this disaster," Isakson said. "I fully support the Governor's request for federal disaster assistance for communities in Georgia affected by these devastating tornados, and I hope the President will approve this request quickly so all of our Georgia communities can begin the recovery process."
   "We support Governor Perdue's request and stand ready to assist our fellow Georgians in need," said Chambliss. "There are certainly many areas that are going to need a helping hand and it is imperative that the President approve this request so our communities can begin the rebuilding process. I commend Mayor Shirley Franklin, our citizens and emergency personnel who responded quickly to help those in need. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Georgia who have lost loved ones as a result of this natural devastation."
