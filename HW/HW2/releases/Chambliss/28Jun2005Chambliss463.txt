SEN. CHAMBLISS SAYS ENERGY BILL IS GOOD FOR GEORGIA
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised final Senate passage of a comprehensive, common-sense Energy package for the United States.  
 This legislation will help reduce America's dependency on foreign sources for oil, stabilize rising fuel costs and provide security for future generations. 
   "We are a country that has the most abundant supply of natural resources of any other country in the world, yet today we are dependent on a handful of foreign countries for almost 60% of our petroleum products. There is something not right about that."
   "This energy bill is going to give us the opportunity to put in place a long-term energy policy that has been sorely lacking in America. We need to make sure that we stabilize gas prices at the pump, natural gas prices for heating homes, and ensure that we have a reliable energy supply. However, it is just as important that we take the steps necessary to preserve nature and our natural resources for our children and grandchildren."
