SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR CITY OF DOUGLASVILLE
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the City of Douglasville will receive a $12,396 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to aid in local law enforcement needs. 
  The U.S. Department of Justice's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) will distribute the funding. JAG allows local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. 
  The City of Douglasville will utilize the funds to purchase communications and personnel protection equipment for the Police Department.
  "This important program will fund a crucial community initiative in Douglasville to better equip our first responders," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
  "This funding will go a long way to help ensure that Douglasville's first responders have the resources necessary to protect their community," said Isakson. "This grant fills an important need for the City of Douglasville."
