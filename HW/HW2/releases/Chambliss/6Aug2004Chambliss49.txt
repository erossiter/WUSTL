SEN. CHAMBLISS UNDERGOES TREATMENT FOR DIAGNOSED PROSTATE CANCER; FULL, COMPLETE RECOVERY EXPECTED
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today announced that this week he underwent a successful radiation seed implant procedure for treatment of his recently diagnosed prostate cancer.  
 The procedure was performed by Dr. Gregory S. Merrick at the Schiffler Cancer Center at Wheeling Hospital and Wheeling Jesuit University in Wheeling, West Virginia.
   "Senator Chambliss underwent Prostate Brachytherapy, the procedure was uneventful, his prognosis is outstanding, and we expect a full and complete recovery," said Dr. Merrick. 
   "I am very appreciative of the professional service rendered by Dr. Merrick and his entire staff. Also, I am thankful for the encouraging thoughts and prayers received from all over the country, most especially from Georgians," said Chambliss who is recuperating in the Washington, DC area and will resume a normal schedule within the next several days.
   Chambliss also said, "Once again I would remind all males over the age of forty to be checked annually for prostate cancer because early detection means a high probability of cure."
