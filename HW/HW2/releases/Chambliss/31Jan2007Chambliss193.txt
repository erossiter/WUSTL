SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON USDA FARM BILL PROPOSALS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement after U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced the Administration's farm bill proposals.  
  "I appreciate Secretary Johanns and the Department of Agriculture bringing new ideas to the table as Congress begins to debate the next farm bill," said Sen. Chambliss. "My goal is and always has been to make certain that the American farmer's voice is heard and their concerns are addressed in this process. I value the Secretary's recommendations; however, ultimately it is up to Congress to write comprehensive farm policy. Most importantly, this proposal should not be seen as a revision of our offer in the Doha Round. Congress will have the final say and set the final spending limits in the farm bill. It would be unproductive for our trading partners to assume otherwise. I look forward to working together with members of the committee to conquer the challenges we have ahead this year."
