SEN. CHAMBLISS NOT SATISFIED WITH IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE; WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS AGRICULTURE TITLE
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today made the following statement during a news conference on Capitol Hill with Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and Jeff Sessions (R-AL): 
  Excerpts from Chambliss' remarks are below.
  The major difference in what was agreed to last night and what was on the floor yesterday is the fact that the amnesty provision is now made very clear. And the amnesty provision is simply that if you have been here more than two years you've got a direct pathway to citizenship - the only difference is how you get there. Some of them have to go back to a point of entry and some of then can stay here and move forward. But there's another direct path in this bill that was in the other bill and that's in the agriculture title. 
  The agriculture title of this bill is one of the most important titles in there because the overwhelming majority of folks here illegally started out in agriculture working in our economy, and moved into other jobs. And that's been one of the major issues we've talked about during the limited amount of debate we have had thus far. History has proven that when these folks come over here in agriculture, that as soon as they can move out of agriculture into another area of employment they're going to do it.
  We're going to have a number of amendments that we are going to still seek to offer and those seek to clear up this issue of what is the requirement for someone to work in agriculture to get priority status.
  We can have a real meaningful bill that will not grant amnesty and that shows compassion for folks who have come here for the right reasons but at the same time provides the security on our borders that the American people demand.
