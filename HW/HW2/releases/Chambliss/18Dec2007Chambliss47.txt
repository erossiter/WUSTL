SENATE APPROVES SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON RESOLUTION HONORING VALDOSTA STATE UNIVERSITY BLAZERS
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised passage of a Senate Resolution they introduced honoring the Valdosta State University football team as the 2007 NCAA Division II National Champions. The Senate unanimously approved the resolution Monday evening. 
  The Valdosta State University Blazers defeated the Northwest Missouri State University Bearcats 25-20 on December 15 to clinch the national title for the second time in the past four years.
  "It takes a great deal of dedication, teamwork and sportsmanship to become a successful powerhouse, especially in college sports," said Chambliss. "I'm proud of Head Coach David Dean, all the players, and fans who have played an integral role in their journey to the National Championships. Football is a great American sport, and I know all Georgians join me in congratulating the team on their tremendous season." 
  "This team's talent and tremendous dedication allowed them to overcome an early deficit and earn a hard-fought victory in the final minutes," Isakson said. "These young men and their coach David Dean have brought great pride to their state and to their university with this triumphant win in the National Championship."
  Valdosta State University Coach David Dean is the second first-year head coach in NCAA history to lead a team to the Division II title. Seven players were named to the All-Gulf Conference team, including wide receiver Cedric Jones and safety Sherard Reynolds, who were also named to the All-American team. The Valdosta State University Blazers finished the season with a 13-1 record.
