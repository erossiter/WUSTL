SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, today applauded Senate passage of the Child Custody Protection Act. The legislation, which Chambliss cosponsored, makes it a federal offense to transport a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion and avoid home-state parental consent or notification laws.  
   "This bill is a common-sense measure that underscores the importance of families, parents, and children and ensures the American public that we will protect them," said Chambliss. "It demonstrates the importance of respecting our citizens who have spoken in state after state by the adoption of parental notification and parental consent requirements before a minor child can be subjected to invasive medical procedures with both physical and emotional consequences. Too often, outside third parties have intentionally sought to circumvent these pro-family state laws and invade the parent-child relationship by transporting children across state lines for the purpose of having an abortion. This bill will serve as a real deterrent to such efforts, and it reaffirms the parent-child relationship which is so important to the overwhelming majority of Americans."
   Thirty-four states have enacted parental consent or notification laws.
