SEN. CHAMBLISS HAILS SENATE APPROVAL OF LEGISLATION TO PREVENT PROTESTERS FROM DISRUPTING MILITARY FUNERALS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today hailed approval of legislation to prevent protesters from disrupting the funerals of fallen soldiers. The "Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act," H.R. 5037, was approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate. 
   The legislation prevents protesters from disrupting military funerals at national cemeteries beginning 60 minutes before and continuing for 60 minutes after the service. The measure would also keep protestors at least 300 feet from the entrances and exits and 150 feet from the paths and roads leading into and out of the cemetery. While the measure only applies to national cemeteries, it does include a "Sense of Congress" that all 50 states should adopt similar legislation for all military funerals. 
  "Our military men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation deserve to be buried with dignity and respect," said Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "This measure will ensure that grieving families and friends of these true American heroes will be able to say their final good-bye without the worry of protester disruptions." Chambliss, who was the author of similar legislation in the Senate along with Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., said he was pleased that Congress moved quickly to complete its work on the legislation in light of recent protests that have occurred at some military funerals across the nation. 
   "I am pleased the Senate gave final congressional approval of this measure and I am confident President Bush will sign this important bill into law on behalf of our fallen American heroes and their families," said Chambliss.
