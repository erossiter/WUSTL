SEN. CHAMBLISS DISAPPOINTED WITH SENATE FAILURE TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL DEATH TAX
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today expressed disappointment with the failure of the U.S. Senate to move toward consideration of the Death Tax Repeal Permanency bill. 60 votes were needed to move debate forward; however, the measure failed 57-41. Chambliss has been a strong supporter of repealing the federal death tax during his 12 years in Congress.  
  "The death tax is an unnecessary, burdensome taxation on American families, small businesses, and family farmers, and I think it is simply wrong that the federal government seeks to tax individuals and their possessions at the time of their death," said Chambliss. 
  "This is a basic matter of fairness, and folks should be able to plan for their future without worrying about the death tax. People work hard their entire life in hopes of passing their family business or farm on to their children and grandchildren. Doing so is something Americans throughout our history have worked toward for many years. I strongly believe the death tax needs to be permanently repealed," Chambliss added. 
  BACKGROUND
  Five years ago Congress enacted a phase-out of the federal estate tax - or "death" tax - as part of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, with its complete repeal scheduled to occur in 2010. However, due to Democrat opposition to the 2001 tax relief bill, the repeal is only temporary; the death tax will be resurrected in 2011 at a tax rate of 55 percent after a $1 million exemption.
