SEN. CHAMBLISS: HOMELAND SECURITY BILL PROVIDES KEY FUNDS FOR BORDER, PORT, AIRPORT, MASS TRANSIT SECURITY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., praised the final passage of the fiscal year 2006 funding bill for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which provides essential funding to improve the security of our borders, ports, airports and mass transit systems. The bill now moves to the White House to be signed by the President. 
   "This bill provides much-needed resources to improve the security of our nation's borders and help stem the tide of the massive flow of illegal aliens crossing our borders undetected and undocumented every single day," said Chambliss. "This bill also allocates critical funding to beef up security for America's ports, mass transit systems and airports. For example, the bill includes funds for additional airport screeners and explosive detection devices which will improve security and make air travel safer for passengers at our nation's airports, including Hartsfield-Jackson."
   The bill also includes $282.4 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. This is an increase of over $55 million from the level funded in fiscal year 2005.
   "FLETC plays a key role in the war against terrorism," said Chambliss. "The hard working men and women at FLETC are playing critical roles in keeping our country safe, and they should be commended for their hard work ensuring our federal law enforcement personnel are well prepared and trained. The funding in this bill shows that the folks in Washington know how essential their work is and what an outstanding job they all do."
   Chambliss said highlights of the bill include:
   * $5.9 billion for Customs and Border Protection and $3.8 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which provides for 1,000 new border patrol agents, 250 new criminal investigators, 460 new detention and removal officers, $10.2 million to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles on the southwest border, $340 million for the US-VISIT program, $40 million for grants to state to implement the REAL ID Act, and funding for over 40,800 positions dedicated to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws
   * $2.5 billion for state and local preparedness programs
   * $3.9 billion for securing transportation
