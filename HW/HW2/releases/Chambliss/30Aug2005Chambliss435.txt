SEN. CHAMBLISS, REP. GINGREY ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR CEDARTOWN NORTH INDUSTRIAL PARK
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., today announced that the Cedartown North Industrial Park will receive a $469,978 Local Access Grant award for its Davis Road project.  
   The Appalachian Regional Commission will provide the funding. The funds will be used specifically to widen and improve conditions of Davis Road which will provide better access to the Industrial Park. 
   "I am pleased to see Cedartown North Industrial Park receive the money necessary to improve its facilities to better serve the area and its customers," said Chambliss. "It is important that we keep our roads properly maintained to ensure safe and easy travel in the region as it continues to thrive."
   "This grant will benefit Cedartown's businesses and citizens by stimulating economic growth and making travel easier for those in the area," said Gingrey. "I'm glad the community will get the funding it needs to make these important improvements."
   Cedartown officials state that this project is vital to support existing business as well as future expansion of the park and economic growth in the Cedartown and Polk County area. They state that over 650 jobs now exist within the industrial park, and that new and expanding business is contingent on the success of this project.
   An award ceremony will take place Friday September 2, 2005 at 10:00AM at the Cedartown, GA site to celebrate the funding.
