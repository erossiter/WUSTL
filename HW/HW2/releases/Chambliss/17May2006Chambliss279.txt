SEN. CHAMBLISS: 3 MILLION GEORGIANS TO BENEFIT FROM TAX RELIEF BILL SIGNED BY PRESIDENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today applauded President Bush for signing legislation to extend key tax relief provisions that will benefit more than three million Georgians. Chambliss said the legislation will also continue contributing to our nation's strong economic growth.  
  "Extending this important tax relief is good news for Georgia's working families, small businessmen and women, and farmers," said Chambliss. "Not only will extending this tax relief help keep more money in the pockets of hard working Georgians, but it will continue contributing to America's economic growth." 
  Specifically, President George W. Bush signed The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 into law today. The bill extends key tax relief provisions that are set to expire under legislation that the Congress approved and Chambliss supported in 2003. 
  The tax relief legislation reduces the Capital Gains and Dividend tax rate reductions. It also increases the exemption threshold for the Alternative Minimum Tax, meaning that fewer working Americans will be subjected to this hidden and creeping tax increase. The bill also increases important expensing for small businesses; eliminates the income limits on conversions to Roth Individual Retirement Accounts; and accelerates the application of $20 million capital expenditure limitation on tax-exempt state and local bonds used to finance private business manufacturing or the acquisition of land and equipment by certain farmers.
