SEN. CHAMBLISS MEETS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE ROBERTS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today met United States Chief Justice Nominee Judge John Roberts in Chambliss' Washington office. At the conclusion of the meeting, Chambliss released the following statement expressing his support for Judge Roberts. 
   "I continue to be very impressed with Judge Roberts and I could not be more excited about any other nominee to the Supreme Court. As a lawyer, I very much admire Judge Roberts because of his knowledge of the law and I find his ability to express that knowledge to be significantly impressive. In his presentation last week I thought he did a superb job in giving his understanding of the law and the reasoning for the law. I thought he did an outstanding job and he is going to make an outstanding Chief Justice on the Supreme Court. 
   "I think Judge Roberts is going to get excellent support from both Republicans and Democrats across the board. I think he will get a big vote, I don't know if it will be 60 or 90 votes, but I would hope he gets 100 votes because I think he deserves it. If integrity counts, if honesty counts, if knowledge of the law counts, if family values count, if being a true American counts, you can't vote against Judge Roberts.
   "As a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was present for Judge Roberts' hearing when he was nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He impressed me then and I continue to be impressed with him today. Judge Roberts brings a wealth of judicial background and knowledge, as well as, a practical background to the Supreme Court. I am excited to have his nomination come to the floor next week for debate and I look forward to supporting Judge Roberts on the floor of the United States Senate."
