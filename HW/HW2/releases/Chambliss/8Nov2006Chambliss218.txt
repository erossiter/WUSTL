SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY RUMSFELD, NOMINATION OF GATES TO SERVE AS NEW SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, today made the following statement following the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The President today announced the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed Rumsfeld, and that nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
  "There has been no Secretary of Defense in recent times that has had to deal with as many complex military issues and as fast-changing world as Donald Rumsfeld, and to his credit, I believe he is one of the reasons we have not suffered another attack on U.S. domestic soil since September 11, 2001. While he and I have had some very public and tough battles, he has always been fair as well as straightforward, respectful, and professional in our interactions. He deserves our nation's appreciation for his commitment to serving us and our men and women in uniform as Secretary of Defense for the last six years.
  "We are at a critical juncture in Iraq, and I believe that a new face and fresh approach will help us in our efforts to move forward toward victory. Our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to have my highest admiration and praise for their good works, and we will continue to do everything necessary to help them succeed in their mission and win this war on terrorism. 
  "I believe Robert Gates is a good choice to be our next Secretary of Defense and I look forward to the confirmation process. His extensive experience within our intelligence community, his knowledge of national security policy, and his previous service to presidents of both political parties will serve him, the Department of Defense, and our nation well."
