SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL OF BRAC LIST
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today released the following statement regarding President Bush's decision today to endorse the recommendations of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. 
   "Today, as expected, the President endorsed the recommendations of the independent Base Realignment and Closure Commission to close 22 major military bases and realign 33 others. Although the State of Georgia will still gain over 4000 jobs as a result of this process, I am disappointed that the President did not more closely examine the recommendations to close Naval Air Station Atlanta, Ft. McPherson, Ft. Gillem and the Navy Supply School in Athens, as well as the Commission's reversal of new missions for Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. During the review process, the Georgia Delegation demonstrated beyond a doubt that military value would be lost, not gained by closing these bases and that by not consolidating submarines at two East Coast bases, the Navy would continue to have excess infrastructure far into the future, resulting in a continued, unnecessary burden to U.S. taxpayers."
   "Georgia will continue to play a major role in hosting and supporting our Nation's military men and women. Additionally, several Georgia bases such as Fort's Stewart, Benning and Gordon stand to gain additional troops as Army units from Europe and Korea continue to relocate to the Continental United States."
   "The entire Georgia Delegation did everything we could to ensure the case was made for Georgia installations. I offer my thanks to all the communities and U.S. Congress Members in Georgia, Senator Isakson, and Governor Perdue for their hard work over the past several years in preparing for this process and working especially hard over the last several months to make the case for Georgia bases."
