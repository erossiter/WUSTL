SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRAC COMMISISON VOTES REGARDING KINGS BAY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement today regarding the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's vote today to reverse a recommendation by the Department of Defense that would have added additional resources, missions and personnel at Kings Bay Naval Submarine base.  
   "While today's vote is disappointing, it in no detracts from the fact that Kings Bay Submarine Base plays a vital role of the national security of the United States and will continue to do so for many years to come."
   "Through numerous meetings, phone calls and visits, Georgia's congressional delegation and Governor Perdue vigorously impressed upon the Commission that the best course of action was to maintain the recommendation for Kings Bay to gain new missions and personnel. Georgia's lawmakers, as well as the Camden Partnership and members of the Southeast Georgia community, all made an extremely forceful case to the Commission. Although the data was clearly on our side, the Commission still chose to reverse the recommendation." 
   The BRAC Commission's final recommendation regarding this issue will be included in a list of recommendations nationwide that will be sent by September 8, 2005, to President Bush for his approval. President Bush will then have until September 23, 2005, to accept or reject the recommendation in its totality - without the ability to change pieces of the recommendation. If accepted, Congress will have 45 legislative days to reject the recommendation in its entirety or it becomes binding.
