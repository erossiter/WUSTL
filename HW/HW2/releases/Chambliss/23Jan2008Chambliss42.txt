SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DELTA AIRLINES
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today released the following statement regarding news reports of a potential airline merger: 
   For more than 60 years, Delta has thrived as a leading employer of countless Georgians and has established itself as an economic engine for the Southeast and I stand ready to do all I can to ensure that this remains the case for many years in the future.
   Background:
   On January 18, 2008, Chambliss sent a letter to Delta CEO Richard Anderson urging the airline to keep its headquarters in Atlanta.
   Text of the letter is below:
   Dear Mr. Anderson:
   I have been following the merger speculation in the press and I know that you and your great company may be facing many opportunities and decisions during the next few challenging weeks.
   Delta is a worldwide leader in aviation with a well-deserved reputation built over many years. To be sure, your Board and executive leadership must act in the best interest of your shareholders and other stakeholders with financial and legal relations with the Company.
   Moreover, I hope that you and your leadership will keep uppermost in your evaluations the important and significant position Delta occupies in Atlanta and Georgia.
   Your dedicated and loyal employees have impressed all Georgians and, indeed, all of your customers with their steadfast commitment to the customer and to the Company through the good and difficult years. This is especially true during the recent uncertainty of the bankruptcy period.
   Whatever the future holds, I hope that Georgia will continue to benefit from Delta's tradition of excellence in corporate citizenship. It is my hope that if an agreement is made, you and your Board will keep Delta's headquarters in Atlanta and that Delta will continue to benefit from the thousands of talented Georgia citizens and employees who consider Delta- "My Delta."
   Very truly yours,
   Saxby Chambliss
