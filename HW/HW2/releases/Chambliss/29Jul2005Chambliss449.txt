SEN. CHAMBLIS: ENERGY BILL IS GOOD FOR GEORGIANS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised passage of a comprehensive, common-sense Energy package for the United States. The legislation will help reduce America's dependency on foreign sources for oil, stabilize rising fuel costs and provide security for future generations.  
   "Our nation has the most abundant supply of natural resources in the world, yet today we are dependent on a handful of foreign countries for almost 60 percent of our petroleum products and that's simply not in our economic or national security best interests," said Chambliss. "This bill puts a long-term energy policy in place and will help stabilize gas prices at the pump and natural gas prices for heating homes, and ensure that we have a reliable energy supply." 
   To help reduce our dependency on foreign energy sources, the bill helps to increase production, increase conservation, diversify fuel supply and employ new technologies. 
   Specifically, the bill:
   * Addresses our dependency on foreign oil and rising gasoline prices by promoting a greater refining capacity to bring more oil to market; and encouraging additional domestic production of oil with incentives such as a streamlined permit process. 
   * Seeks to determine U.S. energy resources by calling for a Department of Interior inventory of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. Doing so will enable the federal government to better assess the extent of these resources and includes coastal impact assistance of $1 billion over four years for energy-producing states to assist in coastal enhancement and conservation programs. 
   * Enhances production of clean natural gas to help ease soaring prices for environmentally friendly fuel. 
   * Authorizes the Department of Energy to accelerate programs for electricity production and supply through additional nuclear and hydropower production. 
   * Establishes new efficiency standards for federal facilities, and efficiency standards and product labeling for battery chargers, commercial refrigerators, freezers, unit heaters and other household appliances that would improve conservation.
