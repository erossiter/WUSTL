SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS PRAISE DOT'S DECISION TO AWARD NEW U.S. ROUTE TO CHINA TO ATLANTA-BASED DELTA AIR LINES
  U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the announcement by the U.S. Department of Transportation that Delta Air Lines had been awarded a new direct route from Atlanta to Shanghai, making it the first airline to fly that route.  
  "Delta Air Lines continues to be an integral part of helping Atlanta become a global destination," Isakson said. "I am very pleased that Delta will become the first U.S. carrier to fly directly from Atlanta to Shanghai."
  "This is great news for the employees of Delta and a big win for all Georgians," said Chambliss. "The direct service between Shanghai and Atlanta will bring enhanced economic opportunities to our state, furthering growth and innovation throughout the region. I commend the folks at Delta for working to bring this service to Atlanta."
  The Department of Transportation also announced that United Airlines was awarded a direct route from San Francisco to Guangzhou, to begin flying in 2008. Both the Delta and United awards represent final decisions by the agency.
  In July, the U.S. and Chinese governments signed an agreement to open up airways between the two countries and double the number of daily flights allowed between the U.S. and China over the next five years. The agreement also allows for new cargo flights operating to and from the United States and China.
