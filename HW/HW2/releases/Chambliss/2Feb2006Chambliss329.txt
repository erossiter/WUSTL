ATLANTA'S YMCA HELPS GEORGIA'S HEAD START PROGRAM EXCEL
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., announced today that the YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta has been awarded $8,075,363 for its Head Start program.  
  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Region IV Office for Children and Families will distribute the funding to the YMCA. The department operates several child care programs including the Head Start program. 
  Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs that serve children from birth to age five, pregnant women and their families. They are child-focused programs, and their overall goal is increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
  "Georgia has a strong Head-Start program that impacts thousands of children and their families each year," said Chambliss. "I know this funding will provide the resources needed by the YMCA to continue providing this valuable service to Metro Atlanta communities." 
  "I am pleased to announce these funds for Head Start at the Metro Atlanta YMCA," said Isakson. "Our children need every opportunity for a good, strong education and Head Start gets many children started on the right path to that goal."
