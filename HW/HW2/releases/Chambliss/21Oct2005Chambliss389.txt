SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CRITICAL PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Senate has approved $200,000 for the Mercer University - Warner Robins Air Logistics Center partnership to form the Critical Personnel Development Program, which is designed to encourage and enhance study in scientific disciplines.  
   Chambliss and Isakson worked with Senate appropriators to secure these important funds for Georgia as part of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and D.C. Appropriations Act. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to work out a final version of the bill.
   "This partnership between the base and the university is important because it provides engineering students and aspiring scientists the hands-on training they need to enter the workforce," said Chambliss. "I am pleased to help the folks at Mercer University and Warner Robins Air Logistic Center achieve the funding they need to pursue this opportunity." 
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for the Mercer University School of Engineering in support of its partnership with the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center," Isakson said. "Their partnership and this funding will enable the University to create a first class facility to encourage and enhance study in scientific disciplines." 
   The funding will go toward construction of a training facility. The new state of the art building is specifically designed to provide academic training and laboratory research in support of Air Logistics Center mission requirements and to create regional economic development opportunities.
