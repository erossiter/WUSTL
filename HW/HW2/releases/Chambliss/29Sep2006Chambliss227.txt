SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR GEORGIA BASES, GEORGIA-MADE WEAPONS SYSTEMS, MILITARY PERSONNEL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, today praised the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Conference Report, which authorizes funding for our military men and women and their families, critical military construction projects at Georgia bases and Georgia-made weapons systems. The bill was approved by the House late Friday and is expected to be approved by the Senate before adjournment. Chambliss was a member of the House-Senate conference committee which crafted the final bill. Once approved by the Senate it will go to the President for his signature.
  "We must do all that we can for our military men and women and their families, who continue to make great sacrifices so we can fight and win the global war on terrorism," said Chambliss. "This bill addresses the critical needs of our troops and includes key resources for military construction improvements at Georgia's military installations. The bill also validates the crucial role Georgia-made weapons contribute to our nation's national security." 
  The conferees authorized funding of $462.8 billion in budget authority for defense programs in fiscal year 2007, an increase of $21.2 billion - or 3.6% in real terms - above the amount authorized by the Congress for fiscal year 2006. The conferees authorized $84.2 billion in procurement funding, a $1.3 billion increase above the President's budget request; $73.6 billion in funding for research, development, test and evaluation, a $452.0 million increase over the request; $155.3 billion for operation and maintenance and other programs; and $110.1 billion for military personnel. 
  The conferees also authorized $70.0 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fiscal year 2007 for activities in support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism. The emergency supplemental funding includes $23.8 billion to help reset Army and Marine Corps equipment, $2.1 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, $1.7 billion to help train and equip Iraq Security forces, and $1.5 billion to help train and equip Afghanistan Security forces.
  The bill supports our service members and families by improving health care and increasing military pay and benefits and expands eligibility for TRICARE to all members of the Selected Reserve and their families without regard to active duty service, and prohibits increases in TRICARE fees until we can complete a study of TRICARE costs. 
  The bill provides a 2.2 percent pay raise for all military personnel plus targeted pay raises for senior enlisted personnel and warrant officers, authorizes expansion of eligibility for TRICARE to all members of the Selected Reserve, prohibits any increase in TRICARE enrollment premiums under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Reserve Select in fiscal year 2007, prohibits any increase in co-payments for pharmaceuticals dispensed through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program during fiscal year 2007.
  The bill includes a provision authored by Senator Chambliss to require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on a plan to assist local non-DoD schools experiencing growth because of relocation of military families. 
  Additionally, the bill includes Chambliss' provision which provides authority for a 3 year multi-year procurement contract for the U.S. Air Force to acquire 60 additional F-22 aircraft.
