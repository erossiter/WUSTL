SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, today made the following statement regarding news that Coalition forces killed al-Qaida terrorist leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and one of his key lieutenants, spiritual advisor Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman, yesterday in an air strike north of Baqubah. 
  "The reported death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is great news, not only for the people of Iraq, but for the world. The elimination of Zarqawi, the terrorist who killed indiscriminately and sought to defeat America and Coalition forces, is a major victory in the ongoing Global War on Terrorism. There still are tough times ahead for our men and women who serve each and every day with courage and professionalism, but the death of Zaraqwi is promising news and presents an opportunity for the new Iraqi Defense Minister, Abdul Qadir Obeidi, and new Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad Bulani to seize the initiative in securing their country. 
  "Iraq is now at a critical junction as it continues to move forward in establishing a safe and secure environment for all its citizens. U.S. and Coalition support at this time could not be more important in providing the assistance that Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's unity government needs in order to defeat the insurgency. 
  "This operation proves the importance of information sharing between our intelligence agencies and the necessity to get critical intelligence to those who can use it. It eliminates the artificial distinction between national and military intelligence and demonstrates that when organizations collaborate and share valuable data we can be successful in winning the war on terrorism."
