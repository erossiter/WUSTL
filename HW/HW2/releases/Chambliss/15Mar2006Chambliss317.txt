U.S. CHAMBER HONORS SEN. CHAMBLISS WITH 'SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE' AWARD
  The United States Chamber of Commerce today presented Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) with its prestigious "Spirit of Enterprise" award for his strong support for a pro-economic growth legislative agenda in the first session of the 109th Congress. 
  "Saxby is a leader who has fought for legislation to spur job creation, increase productivity and keep our economy growing." said Thomas J. Donohue, Chamber President and CEO. "We're proud to present him with this award on behalf of America's businesses, both large and small."
  The Chamber awards the "Spirit of Enterprise" based on rankings it gives members of Congress for key business votes outlined in its annual publication, How They Voted. Sen. Chambliss scored 94 percent with the Chamber last year and has compiled a 92 percent cumulative ranking during his tenure in Congress. 
  Chamber-designated "key votes" are recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities by the Chamber's board of directors and on which the Chamber communicates its position prior to the vote. Members of Congress who support the Chamber's position on at least 70 percent of key votes receive the "Spirit of Enterprise" award. 
  For the first session of the 109th Congress, the Chamber scored 18 Senate votes and 27 House votes as key votes. Key votes for 2005 included the class action reform, bankruptcy reform, a comprehensive energy bill, transportation reauthorization legislation, and the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement.
  The U.S. Chamber is the world's largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector and region.
