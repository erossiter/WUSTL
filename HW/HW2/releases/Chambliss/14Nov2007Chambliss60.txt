SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON STATUS OF SENATE FARM BILL DEBATE
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the status of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 currently before the Senate:  
  "Today the Majority Leader again rejected our proposal for a reasonable compromise to move forward with amendments, thus ushering us into another day of lost opportunity. For two weeks we have repeatedly requested that all senators, Republican and Democrat, simply be afforded the opportunity to offer amendments in regular order and to have a debate on those amendments. The farmers and ranchers we represent are depending on us as policy makers to get our work done. It is my sincere hope that both sides can come together to move this farm bill forward in the Senate."
