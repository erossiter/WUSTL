SEN. CHAMBLISS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH UNIFIED COMBATANT COMMAND FOR MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Forces Committee, will introduce legislation today that would establish a unified combatant command for military intelligence within the Department of Defense.  
   Chambliss' bipartisan bill is designed to work with and be incorporated into several other pieces of intelligence reform legislation that have been, or will be introduced. Chambliss' bill calls for the creation of a National Intelligence Director who will oversee our intelligence community and be separate from the position of Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Senator's bill seeks to bridge the gap between the National Intelligence Director and the many military intelligence organizations which exist. The Department of Defense has a number of agencies providing intelligence support to our combat forces, plus each of the armed forces has its own intelligence capabilities, and these all need to be coordinated within the national intelligence community to ensure they are responsive to both the National Intelligence Director and our combat commanders. 
   "We need to make the National Intelligence Director as effective as possible while ensuring our military men and women get the best intelligence possible when they are risking their lives to protect our freedoms, and to better integrate our military and civilian intelligence officials into one team," said Chambliss. "The National Intelligence Director will need one point of contact in the military, not eight."
   The bill will strengthen the overall intelligence collection and analysis of the United States. Specifically, there are currently 15 recognized members of the intelligence community, eight of which are in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is not only the largest user of intelligence; it is the largest collector. 
   "I want to give the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and our Unified Commanders one person to turn to for their military intelligence needs," said Chambliss. "I want the military services to resource and support a unified command for intelligence in the same way they are supporting other functional commands such as our Special Operations Command and the Transportation Command." 
   Highlights of the Chambliss bill as they pertain to the responsibilities of the commander of military intelligence, especially as they relate to the responsibilities of the National Intelligence Director include:
   * Represent the Department of Defense in the Intelligence Community under the direction of the National Intelligence Director; 
   * Carry out intelligence collection and analysis activities in response to requests from the National Intelligence Director; 
   * Prepare and submit to the Secretary of Defense and the National Intelligence Director recommendations and budget proposals for military intelligence forces and activities; 
   * Establish priorities for military intelligence in harmony with national priorities established by the National Intelligence Director and approved by the President. 
   * Ensure the interoperability of intelligence sharing within the Department of Defense and within the intelligence community as a whole, as directed by the National Intelligence Director, and 
   * Respond to intelligence requirements levied by the National Intelligence Director.
   "This command will make the National Intelligence Director more effective, better represent the needs of our war fighters to the National Intelligence Director, and create synergies and economies of scale within the Department of Defense on intelligence issues," said Chambliss.
