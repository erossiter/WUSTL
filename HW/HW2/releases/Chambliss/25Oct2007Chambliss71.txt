SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF SENATE FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement after the Committee approved the Senate version of the 2007 farm bill: 
  "I am pleased the Committee approved the Chairman's mark of the 2007 farm bill with broad bipartisan support. We have worked diligently to make certain this legislation includes provisions to strengthen existing programs, while at the same time staying within budgetary constraints. This is a good bill and it deserves the support of the entire Senate. The package we put together is notable in that it does not raise taxes to pay for new programs or deny our farmers and ranchers a strong safety net. I look forward to the Administration's support and working with my colleagues to get a bill to the President before the end of the year."
