SEN. CHAMBLISS, REP. BURNS SEEK DISASTER RELIEF FOR GEORGIA FARMERS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Rep. Max Burns, R-Ga., today urged the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to expedite the State of Georgia's disaster assistance requests due to crop damage caused by Hurricane Charley. 
   "Agriculture is a key component of Georgia's economy, and our farmers have been hard hit by the recent storms," said Chambliss. "I am joining with Congressman Max Burns in calling on the USDA to act quickly in approving disaster assistance to our farmers."
   "Our agribusiness was already in a state of disaster last week after the previous storms," said Burns. "This damage from Ivan makes immediate disaster relief for all Georgians a dire necessity, and I have full confidence that the President will give this his top priority." 
   This week Chambliss and Burns signed letters to USDA asking that Georgia be a top priority as the department determines the amount of crop damage caused by the recent hurricanes.
