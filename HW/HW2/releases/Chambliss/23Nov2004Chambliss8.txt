   "The Infantry has always been a leading protector of our freedoms, stopping at nothing to preserve the American way of life," Chambliss said. "The National Infantry Museum and Heritage Park will be a place for all generations of Americans to remember, respect and carry on the legacy of service and sacrifice that exemplifies the soldiers of the Infantry." 
   "The National Infantry Museum is a wonderful way to record and honor the lives and contributions of our nation's foot soldiers," Miller said. "With this new facility a new generation will be able to experience our military's greatest moments. It will be a lasting tribute and educational resource for many years to come."
   Specifically, the bill includes: 
   * $97,000 to the National Infantry Foundation in Columbus for construction of New National Infantry Museum and Heritage Park. 
   * $1 million for Columbus Water works for Biosolids Flow-Through Thermophilic Treatment Demonstration Project.

   * $250,000 to Eatonton for wastewater infrastructure improvements.
   The bill also includes $20.7 million to modernize wards at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Atlanta. 
   "These important funds will make needed modernization improvements for the VA medical center in Atlanta, which cares for thousands of Georgia's veterans," said Chambliss. "Our nation's veterans have made great sacrifices for our freedom and it's only right we do all we can for them."
   The bill has been sent to President George W. Bush for his signature.
