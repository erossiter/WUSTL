SEN. CHAMBLISS APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS FOR TROOPS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, today praised final passage of the FY05 Department of Defense Appropriations legislation.  
 This bill will now be sent to the White House for final approval by President Bush.  
   "I am pleased my colleagues in both the House and the Senate were able to move quickly on final passage of this important legislation," said Chambliss. "Right now all over the world our brave young men and women and their families are counting on us to provide the support they need to carry out their missions. The quick passage of this legislation sends a clear message to our troops that they have our unyielding support back home and are proud of their selfless dedication to protecting freedom."
   "This bill funds critical projects and missions at our Georgia bases including an additional $63 million for an Amphibious Assault Vehicle upgrade program to be performed at the Marine Corps Logistic Base in Albany, full funding for the F/A 22 Raptor program at Lockheed in Marietta, and the purchase of an additional Gulfstream G-5 for the Navy."  
   The bill also includes pay raises for service members, extensions of active duty special pay and bonuses, and increases in family separation allowance, and hostile fire and imminent danger pay.
