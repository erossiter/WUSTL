   "It is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that Julianne and I learned of the passing of Chief Justice Rehnquist. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Rehnquist family at this sorrowful time.
   "Chief Justice Rehnquist was dedicated to America's judicial system and he made significant contributions to our nation's highest Court. It was Rehnquist's leadership that kept the Court together through so many cases before the Court and he will be sorely missed.
