SEN. CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCES $20 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER IN ATLANTA
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Congress passed legislation authorizing $20.5 million in funding to expand and upgrade infrastructure needs at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta.  
  "Our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services we can offer, especially at a time when so many of our wounded warriors are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan," said Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "This is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor. I applaud my colleague, Senator Isakson, for his leadership on the Veterans Affairs Committee and all the members of the Georgia Congressional Delegation for their support for this bill."
  Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) introduced the expansion bill which passed the Senate last week. Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill and it goes to the president's desk for his signature. The funding for this project will improve medical inpatient wards, address accessibility requirements, meet women veterans' needs, and correct patient privacy issues to help improve the quality of life of our veterans receiving care.
