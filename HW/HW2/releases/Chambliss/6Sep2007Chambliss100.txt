  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill, which provides important funds for construction at the nation's military bases and for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation includes $481 million for construction at military bases in Georgia, which is the sixth largest amount in the nation. 
   "As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to help secure these critical military construction projects that will benefit the brave men and women who make the sacrifices to protect our national security," said Chambliss. 
   "These funds will greatly benefit our bases, our troops and their families," Isakson said. "Georgia's military facilities play a key role in the security of our nation, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington."
