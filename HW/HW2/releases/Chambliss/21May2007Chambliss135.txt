SEN. CHAMBLISS: DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE FAIR, TRANSPARENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement following a vote to proceed with debate on immigration reform legislation. The vote (69-23) was on a procedural motion to begin debate on S.1348, which is placeholder legislation to be substituted by legislation reflecting the bi-partisan agreement reached last week. Chambliss' vote indicated his willingness to take up the issue of immigration reform for consideration before the full Senate. Chambliss indicated his support for a final bill will be contingent on certain criteria being included in the legislation.  
   This is an important issue that will affect every single person in this country and everyone in the world seeking to come to this country and it must be debated. This is an emotional and complex issue, and we have to get it right for the sake of our children and grandchildren. We cannot pass the buck and simply agree to disagree. We must take up the hard issues, address them head on, and govern. However, we must also recognize the seriousness of this issue by ensuring that people have enough time to study and understand the proposals being put forth and ensuring a fair and transparent process. 
   What was announced last week was a meeting of the minds. Both Senator Isakson and I fought hard during the negotiations to ensure that conservative principles, including a border security first provision to eliminate illegal immigration, are included in the legislation. If a final bill does not meet this and other specific criteria important to me and important to Georgians, I will not support it. There are a number of things in this bill that I don't agree with and Georgians don't agree with. However, we will never get a chance to improve the bill if we can't get an agreement to debate the bill. Georgians did not elect me to sit on the sidelines. I look forward to taking part in this important debate.
