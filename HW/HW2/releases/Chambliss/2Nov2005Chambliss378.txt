SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR DEKALB COUNTY BOARD OF HEALTH
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the DeKalb County Board of Health will receive a $90,000 grant to identify toxic risks that go undetected in the community. 
   The funds, which will be distributed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, will be used to form three coalitions of community-based organizations to represent North, Central and South DeKalb. The Board of Health will work with the coalitions to identify toxic risks that go undetected and are not commonly known by most communities. An education workshop will be held to provide information to the coalition on toxic risks in the county. This cooperative agreement is one of a number of agreements being awarded across the country.
   "This important program will fund a crucial community initiative in DeKalb County to cleanup the region and educate members of the area," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
   "It is important that our communities work to keep their areas clean and safe for the population," said Isakson. "I am pleased to announce these important funds for DeKalb County."
   EPA's voluntary programs focus on reducing exposure to toxic pollutants, such as programs that reduce emissions from diesel engines, clean abandoned industrial sites, improve the indoor environment in schools, and use pollution prevention to protect drinking water supplies. EPA is launched this grant program to help communities understand and reduce the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. Through Community Action for a Renewed Environment, EPA is offering communities financial and technical assistance to reduce releases of toxic pollutants and minimize exposure to them.
