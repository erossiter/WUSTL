SEN. CHAMBLISS PRAISES FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER ON 35TH ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the hardworking men at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Ga., for 35 years of professional and outstanding training services to the military, law enforcement, and first responder community.  
 FLETC's 35th anniversary is tomorrow, September 14, 2005. 
   "I could not be prouder of the hard working men and women at FLETC on their 35th anniversary. I still remember the birth of FLETC and its location at the former Glynco Naval Base in Brunswick which is very close to my former hometown of Darien. 
   "I have had the opportunity to visit with Connie Patrick and all the folks at FLETC on a number of occasions. They are very professional folks, they do an outstanding job and that's why you've seen more and more responsibility for the training our law enforcement community, particularly the training of those individuals involved in fighting and winning the war on terrorism, going to FLETC. I know this respected institution will continue to provide outstanding training services for many years to come. 
   "I am very, very proud of them and on this 35th anniversary I say congratulations to each and every individual involved with FLETC and congratulations to the community of Brunswick for the great support you continue to give to this important organization."
