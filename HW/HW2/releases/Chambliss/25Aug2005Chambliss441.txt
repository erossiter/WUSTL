SEN. CHAMBLISS: COMMISSION VOTES TO REVERSE RECOMMENDATION TO MOVE AIR FORCE RESERVE RECRUITING SERVICE FROM ROBINS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement today regarding the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's vote to reverse a recommendation by the Department of Defense to move the Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service at Robins AFB to Randolph AFB, TX.  
   "All the hard working men and women at Robins AFB play a very important role in the national security of the United States. By reversing DoD's recommendation to move the Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service from Robins AFB, the Commission has acted in the best interest of the Air Force and Air Force Reserve Headquarters. This action will ensure that the Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service continues to take advantage of synergy with Air Force Reserve Command which is headquartered at Robins AFB. This decision will retain approximately 60 jobs at Robins AFB."
   "Today's good news also can also be credited to the outstanding support from members of the entire Middle Georgia community - including the 21st Century Partnership - who continue to support the base and our military men and women and their families." 
   The BRAC Commission's final recommendation regarding this issue will be included in a list of recommendations nationwide that will be sent by September 8, 2005, to President Bush for his approval. President Bush will then have until September 23, 2005, to accept or reject the recommendation in its totality - without the ability to change pieces of the recommendation. If accepted, Congress will have 45 legislative days to reject the recommendation in its entirety or it becomes binding.
