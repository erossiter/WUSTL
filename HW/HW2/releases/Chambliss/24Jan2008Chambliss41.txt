SEN. CHAMBLISS: GOV. SHAFER TO BE NEXT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today received testimony from former North Dakota Governor Ed Shafer for consideration to be the next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The President nominated Shafer for the position last October following the resignation of Secretary Mike Johanns. 
   "The position of Secretary is critically important not only to's agricultural producers, but to every citizen that consumes the products our farmers produce," said Sen. Chambliss. "I look forward to reporting the nomination favorably out of committee and quickly approving the nomination on the Senate floor. A swift confirmation will ensure that the Department of Agriculture has the necessary leadership to fulfill its mission on behalf of the American people."
   Sen. Chambliss noted during his opening remarks that Congress and the Administration must work collaboratively to pass a farm bill. Both the House and Senate approved farm bills last year and hope to pass a farm bill into law this spring. Under the direction of the Secretary, the USDA is responsible for implementing provisions in the new farm bill.
   "In addition to implementing the farm bill, the Secretary must represent the interests of American agriculture in the negotiation of free-trade agreements; work tirelessly to further open foreign markets to our agricultural products; support international economic development through the provision of food aid; and expand job opportunities for our citizens in rural America," said Sen. Chambliss. "I fully trust that Gov. Shafer is the right man to take on the challenges that characterize this Cabinet position."
   After the Senate Agriculture Committee approves Shafer for the post, the nomination will then go before the full Senate. Chambliss said he is hopeful the Senate will move to confirm him as quickly as possible.
