  "It is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that Julianne and I learned of the passing of General Scott. General Scott has been a very dear friend and a personal hero of mine for many years and I will miss him a great deal. General Scott will forever be remembered as a true patriot, exceptional soldier and great American hero.
