SENS. CHAMBLISS, MILLER ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR MEDICAL COLLEGE OF GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Zell Miller, D-Ga., today announced that the U.S. Congress has approved key funding for the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. 
   The $500,000 for the College were included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which both the House and Senate recently approved. Specifically, the funds were included in the labor, health and human services portion of the bill and can be used for facilities and equipment for a cancer research building at the Medical College of Georgia.
   "The Medical College of Georgia is among the very best in the nation," said Chambliss. "These important funds will be a great benefit to the college, the entire region and for the prevention, research and treatment of cancer." 
   "These funds are extremely important for the development of the Medical College of Georgia's Cancer Research Building," said Miller. "This project will help the college play a significant role in cancer prevention, treatment and research."
   The bill now awaits President George W. Bush's signature.
