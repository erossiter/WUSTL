SEN. CHAMBLISS MEETS WITH COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS EXTRADITION AMENDMENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., met this week with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Velez to discuss an extradition amendment that Chambliss authored.  
   The Colombian President requested to meet with Chambliss about his legislation, which would prevent funds from being made available to any country which has refused to extradite individuals who have been indicted for a crime in the United States. The provision was inspired by Corporal Josiah Ray Fulton of Hampton, Ga., a United States Marine, who was murdered on the streets of Washington, D.C. and whose killer fled to his home nation of Nicaragua. 
   "The President of Colombia and I discussed our shared goal to ensure that those who commit crimes receive justice," said Chambliss.
   Additionally, Chambliss and President Uribe discussed America's and Colombia's shared efforts to fight and win the global war on terrorism and discussed border security issues affecting the United States. 
   Chambliss' extradition amendment has been included in the annual funding bill for foreign operations, which is currently being finalized by House and Senate conferees. Chambliss' amendment has also been endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Association.
