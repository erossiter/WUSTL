SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON MILITARY HOUSING
  Mr. President, I rise to discuss a very important matter to me, to my home state of Georgia and to the nation. A few years back this Congress authorized the military housing privatization initiative. This program, which brings to bear private sector experience and financial strength to improve the quality of life for our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and their families, has been a resounding success. To date, the U.S. Armed Forces have privatized over 60,000 housing units, leveraging more than ten dollars for every government dollar which was invested. Out-dated, and World War II era, housing is being replaced with modern homes and amenities that our servicemen and women so richly deserve. This process is taking place across the country, from the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base in California to the Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina. 
   An issue has arisen, however, which threatens the livelihood of this great program and the Congress must act now. First, we must raise the so-called "cap" to make available an adequate funding stream to see this program through to completion. The Department of Defense has established a master plan which will privatize approximately 160,000-170,000, or over 70%, of existing family housing units. Currently, we are about half way towards completion of that goal. Second, the authorization of continued funding must be done in such a way that does not cause the program to become cost prohibitive. We must follow the traditional scoring guidelines which we have used for the past five years in this regard.
   Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to rise today to discuss this very important issue and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the relevant defense committees to address this situation in a positive manner.
