SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON: DEFENSE FUNDING BILL BENEFITS GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate passed fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill saying that the bill strengthens our national security, addresses important quality of life issues for our troops and includes funds for weapons systems made in Georgia. 
   "Georgia plays a major role in the national security of the United States," said Chambliss, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Not only do our military installations contribute to our strong national defense, but we also play a key role building the best weapon systems that help our men and women in the armed forces fight and win wars. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to help secure these important funds for our troops and for important weapons systems built in Georgia that our military needs."
   "Georgia's military bases and defense systems manufacturers are critical to our national security and have played a key role in the war in Iraq, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington," Isakson said.
