SEN. CHAMBLISS: DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PROVIDING IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR GEORGIA BASES, GEORGIA-MADE WEAPONS SYSTEMS, MILITARY PERSONNEL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, today praised the Committee's approval of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization bill, which authorizes funding for our military men and women and their families, critical military construction projects at Georgia bases and Georgia-made weapons systems. 
  "We must do all that we can for our military men and women and their families, who continue to make great sacrifices so we can fight and win the global war on terrorism," said Chambliss. "This bill addresses the critical needs of our troops and includes key resources for military construction improvements at Georgia's military installations. The bill also validates the crucial role Georgia-made weapons contribute to our nation's national security."
  The Committee authorized $517.7 billion for defense, including $50 billion in emergency supplemental funding for activities in support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism.

  Specifically, the committee recommended funding of $467.7 billion in budget authority for Department of Defense and Department of Energy non-emergency programs in fiscal year 2007, an increase of $26.2 billion - or 4.1% in real terms - above the amount authorized by the Congress for fiscal year 2006.
