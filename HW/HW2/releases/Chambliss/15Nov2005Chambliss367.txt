SEN. CHAMBLISS MEETS WITH JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today met with United States Supreme Court Nominee Judge Samuel Alito in Washington.  
 At the conclusion of the meeting, Chambliss released the following statement expressing his support for Judge Alito.
   "Judge Alito and I had a positive meeting today, and I believe he has the integrity, temperament, and sound legal judgment necessary in a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. His credentials certainly speak well of him as a jurist; however, I am also impressed with his commitment to family and strong American values that I believe we need in the next Supreme Court Justice. 
   "Judge Alito is an honorable man who Americans can count on to be fair and just as he administers the rule of law. After having the opportunity to visit with him this morning, I can truly say that he is a man with very deep convictions about his family as well as the law--qualities I both admire and respect in Judge Alito. 
   "Prior to assuming the federal bench, he argued 12 Supreme Court cases, at least two dozen court of appeals cases and handled at least 50 others. Judge Alito's experience, including 15 years serving on the bench of the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, makes him a well qualified candidate to fill the vacancy on the United State Supreme Court. 
   "I look forward to continuing this process and hope that my colleagues will work in a bipartisan manner through the completion of his Senate confirmation. I have all the confidence in the world that at the end of the day Judge Alito will be our next Supreme Court Justice.
