SEN. CHAMBLISS WORKS TO END HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., has co-sponsored legislation to strengthen the national effort to end homelessness among veterans. Well over 5,000 veterans in Georgia are homeless, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says estimates close to 200,000 homeless veterans nation-wide.  
  "Veterans of the United States Armed Forces have sacrificed their all for the sake of our freedom and it's a tragedy that such a large number of these men and women can't find shelter or a place to get a warm meal," said Chambliss. "I implore my colleagues to take this matter seriously and quickly move to protect the men and women who once protected all of us." 
   The "Comprehensive Homeless Veterans Assistance and Prevention Act of 2006", S.3545, authorizes permanent appropriation authority by Congress for general treatment, property transfers after foreclosures, and additional services for veterans. It also mandates inter-agency coordination and outlines specific programs for rental assistance vouchers and financial assistance for low income veteran households in permanent housing.
