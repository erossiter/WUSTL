SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTE TO LIMIT SENATE FARM BILL DEBATE
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement after the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007: 
  "Let it be known that the Majority Leader shut down the farm bill debate last week, by offering amendments so that no one else can, well before the process even started. I have urged the other side to work with us to come up with a reasonable compromise - the Democrats are choosing which amendments will be offered to this bill by using parliamentary practices, which is simply not agreeable to my Republican colleagues and me. Despite the progress we made, the majority still refuses to dismantle their strategy to block a full debate on the farm bill. Our farmers and ranchers deserve a good farm bill and it is our duty to produce the best possible framework we can that strengthens the food and energy security of the United States."
