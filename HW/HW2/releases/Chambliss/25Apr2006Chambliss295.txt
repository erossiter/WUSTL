SEN. CHAMBLISS: INCREASING ALTERNATIVE FUELS, ENERGY RESOURCES, EXPANDING REFINERIES WILL HELP EASE FUEL PRICES
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today issued the following statement in support of President Bush's call to ease the burden of high energy prices.  
  We must do everything possible to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil so that all Americans have access to abundant, affordable energy. To this end, we must work to promote new technologies, develop reliable domestic energy resources, expand refining capabilities, and increase alternative sources of fuel like ethanol and biodiesel. Interest in biofuels has significantly increased in this country and for good reason. And I am pleased that the state of Georgia has an opportunity to play a role in addressing this critical need in numerous capacities. 
  The energy bill signed into law by the President will continue to help the nation move in the right direction to address this critical issue for the long term. The reality is that there is not an overnight solution; however, we can take steps to ease the burden for the short term. For instance, it is widely known that the price of energy is affected by futures trading. If Congress authorized drilling in ANWR, this would send a clear message to other oil producing countries that we are serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil imports. 
  I applaud President Bush for his continued push to address the current supply-demand problem that has resulted in high gasoline prices affecting so many people right now. It's unfortunate that folks on the other side of the aisle are once again resorting to blame game politics when they have, for years, obstructed attempts to increase our domestic energy supply. All they have offered in the past is to raise taxes, which would increase prices for consumers. This is not what Americans want or deserve.
