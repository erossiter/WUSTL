WEEKLY REPORT FROM WASHINGTON BY SEN. CHAMBLISS
  Dear Friends:
   This week the U.S. Senate will consider the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Reauthorization bill. 
  Last week the U.S. Senate passed the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill as well as the Higher Education Authorization Act. I voted in support of both bills. 
  BORDER SECURITY
  I am pleased the Senate voted in favor of an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that Senator Isakson and I offered which calls on President Bush to submit an emergency supplemental spending bill to Congress to fund border security. We heard during the immigration debate that while we need to take steps toward immigration reform, the first thing we need to do is take action to secure the border. I am pleased to have the support of our colleagues on this urgent matter.

  Additionally, I supported an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill offered by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, that would provide funding to immediately pay for some of the manpower and technology necessary to secure the U.S. border. This amendment is a step in the right direction, but the President still needs to send an emergency supplemental bill to Congress.

   WOUNDED WARRIOR BILL PASSED IN SENATE, INCLUDES PAY RAISE FOR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN 
  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am proud to work each day on behalf of our servicemen and women and their families. Last week the Senate unanimously passed the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act (S. 1606). 
  The bill incorporates various pieces of legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate into one bill, including provisions from the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act I introduced on May 3 with my Democratic colleague, Senator Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas. The legislation is in response to shortcomings identified recently in the treatment of wounded service members at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other locations.
  The Senate also approved a 3.5% pay increase for military personnel with passage of this bill.
  Addressing the needs of our military personnel is a bipartisan issue, and I applaud the movement by the Senate leadership to call up and pass this important legislation so that improved care of our wounded warriors and a much-deserved pay raise for our troops will not be delayed any longer.
   DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PULLED FROM SENATE FLOOR
  I am disappointed that last week Democratic leaders pulled the Defense Authorization bill from consideration after an attempt to impose a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq was defeated. This bill provides funding for much-needed equipment, as well as infrastructure at Georgia military installations and funding for Georgia-made weapons systems. Additionally, the Defense Authorization bill includes my proposal to lower the retirement age for member of the National Guard and Reserve.

  DISASTER DECLARATION URGED TO ADDRESS DROUGHT CONDITIONS
  Recently I sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Mike Johanns requesting swift approval and support of the Georgia State Emergency Board's request for a disaster declaration for all 159 counties in Georgia affected by extreme drought conditions. I signed this letter along with my colleagues Senator Isakson and Congressman Kingston. 
  We need to do everything we can to help Georgia farmers recover from one of the driest growing seasons in recent memory. Our agricultural community has had a number of weather-related disasters already this year, including the devastating freeze this spring and the wildfires in South Georgia. I urge Secretary Johanns to swiftly approve the request so our farmers can get the help they desperately need.

  GEORGIA FIRE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS
  Many of our Georgia fire departments and volunteer fire departments have been awarded grants as part of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.

  FEMA TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SUMTER REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN AMERICUS
  I am pleased the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide $9.3 million in funding for a temporary replacement for Sumter Regional Hospital in Americus. The hospital was severely damaged and the adjacent HealthPlex was destroyed during the storms and tornadoes that hit the area on March 1, 2007. 
  The storms and tornadoes that hit Southwest Georgia took a tremendous toll on the Americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on. It is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that Georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve. I commend David Seagraves and the many folks at the Sumter Regional Hospital for their leadership and service as well as the numerous local officials and citizens who have been an integral part of the rebuilding effort.
