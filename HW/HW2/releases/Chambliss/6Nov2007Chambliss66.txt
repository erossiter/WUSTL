SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY AND FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement following receipt of a Statement of Administration Policy regarding the farm bill currently before the Senate:  
  "I am deeply disappointed that the Administration has expressed such strong discontent with the farm bill reported out of the Senate Agriculture Committee and substitute amendment from the Senate Finance Committee. Our committee worked for months to craft a strong bipartisan farm bill while remaining fiscally responsible. I truly believe we have made serious reforms and meaningful improvements to current law considering the budget constraints we are facing. However, we will make an effort to address their concerns as we continue to debate the measure on the Senate floor. It is our job as legislators to authorize farm policy and given the tax provisions in the House and Senate farm bills, we have a challenging process ahead."
