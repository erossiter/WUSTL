GENERAL HAYDEN: CONCEPT OF COMMAND FOR MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ?WOULD BE A REAL VIRTUE'
  Today, at the Senate confirmation hearing for the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, Gen.  
 Michael Hayden told Senators that he liked the concept of a military intelligence reform bill offered by Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Bill Nelson, D-Neb. 
   The Military Intelligence Reorganization Act of 2005, S. 640, would create, for the first time, a unified command for military intelligence (INTCOM) to bring the majority of the intelligence capabilities in the Department of Defense under a single commander.
   Specifically, at the hearing Chambliss asked Hayden if he saw benefit in creating INTCOM, which would harmonize the intelligence activities of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Gen. Hayden responded that: 
   "To the degree that Defense can package up the tactical intelligence activities of the military departments and present them in a unified, integrated, coherent way to the DNI ... would be a real virtue and something that would be very welcome."
