SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DELTA BANKRUPTCY
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss today released the following statement following the announcement that Delta Air Lines will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy: 
   "Delta Air Lines has a longstanding history of service to airline passengers throughout the world and has been a great corporate citizen for the state of Georgia. The unfortunate reality of our current economic climate is that some businesses, particularly the airlines, are taking devastating financial hits as a result of unforeseen circumstances. 
   "While this announcement is not unexpected, I fully expect that Delta will take all means necessary to protect its employees and I will do what I can to help the airline and its employees during this critical time."
