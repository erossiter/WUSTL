SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING EXECUTION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today made the following statement regarding the execution of Saddam Hussein: 
  "Today justice has prevailed, and Saddam Hussein has been held accountable for the oppression, torture, and murder of innocent Iraqis. The process carried out by the Iraqi people underscores their desire to reject tyranny and embrace the rule of law. It is a vital step in burying the dangerous and brutal regime that once ruled, as a free Iraq moves forward on the road to sovereignty. We all remain eternally grateful to the soldiers who have sacrificed so much to liberate the people of Iraq, find Saddam Hussein and bring him to justice, and establish freedom and democracy in a region that is in great need of stability."
