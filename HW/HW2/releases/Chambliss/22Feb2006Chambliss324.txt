SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON U.S. SEAPORT OPERATIONS
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement regarding the possible transfer of major U.S. seaport operations to a company owned by the United Arab Emirates: 
  "This is a serious issue and I am personally very concerned. I believe Congress should be consulted before this particular contract is finalized. 
  "Congress and the American people deserve an explanation regarding this issue and how it could affect the national security of the United States. 
  "While the United Arab Emirates is a partner in the global war on terror, the Administration should come to Congress immediately to explain why a country that has recognized the Taliban as legitimate should be entrusted with the operation of six U.S. ports that are so crucial to our economy and has the potential for terrorist infiltration. After all, two of the 9-11 hijackers were from the UAE, some of their financial institutions have been used to support the al Qaeda network, and their ports have been used to transfer critical WMD related technology to rouge states, such as Iran and North Korea. 
  "Congress needs to know what safeguards are being taken to ensure that this proposal will not provide this foreign company access to information and operations that we would normally want to restrict."
