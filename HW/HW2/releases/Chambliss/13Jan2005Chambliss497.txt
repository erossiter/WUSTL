24 SENATORS URGE BUSH TO SPARE C130J
  Twenty-four U.S. Senators have urged President George W. Bush to restore proposed cuts to the C130J Hercules aircraft in the President's soon to be announced fiscal year 2006 budget. Sens.  
 Saxby Chambliss, R-GA, Johnny Isakson, R-GA, and Mark Pryor, D-AR., and nearly two dozen colleagues have sent President Bush a letter expressing their deep support for the C130J and the significant contribution the aircraft makes to the national security of the United States and the warfighter.
