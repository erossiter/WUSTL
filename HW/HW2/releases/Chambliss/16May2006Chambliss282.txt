SEN. CHAMBLISS: SEN. ISAKSON BORDER SECURITY AMENDMENT CRITICAL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today took to the Senate floor to express his support for Sen. Johnny Isakson's border security amendment to the immigration reform bill. Chambliss is a cosponsor of the measure. The Isakson amendment would prohibit the implementation of any guest worker program until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies in writing to the President and to Congress that border security investments included in the immigration legislation have been implemented.  
  "This is a very simple amendment," said Chambliss. "I do not see how any senator who is serious about border security and enforcing our immigration laws can disagree with it. To disagree with this amendment sends the message to the American people that we are more eager to give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship than we are to secure our borders from further illegal immigration and the smuggling of illegal drugs and weapons. That is not the message my constituents in Georgia want to hear. 
  "Regardless of where Georgians stand on dealing with the current illegal population, the constant refrain I hear from folks back home is 'secure the border.' If we do not secure the border and have serious interior and worksite enforcement, then we have accomplished nothing."
  Chambliss also underscored his opposition to including a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the immigration reform bill currently being considered by the U.S. Senate.
  "I do not believe we should provide illegal immigrants with a new path to citizenship through this bill," said Chambliss. "I do not think it is the right way to address the presence of a large number of illegal immigrants. If we are willing to travel down the same path that has proven not to work before, surely we must ask ourselves - 'what didn't work with the 1986 amnesty that will work today? What has changed?'"
