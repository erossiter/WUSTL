  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of a resolution honoring the life of Coretta Scott King.  
 The resolution was introduced yesterday and passed the Senate unanimously.
  "I had the privilege of knowing Coretta Scott King since my days in the Georgia legislature," Isakson said. "She was an equal with Dr. King in the civil rights movement, and she was a tireless advocate in ensuring that the legacy of Dr. King and his movement is perpetuated in American history."
