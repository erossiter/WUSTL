SENS. CHAMBLISS-ISAKSON ANNOUNCE NEARLY $1.1 MILLION FOR GEORGIA FARMERS, RANCHERS
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded nearly $1.1 million in new Value-Added Producer Grants to help Georgia farmers and ranchers add value to their agriculture products. The USDA is sending the grants to help producers access the capital they need to market the value-added products they produce. 
   "This is good news for Georgia's producers," said Sen. Chambliss who pushed for funding of the projects. "Our producers will be able to use these funds to help create jobs and spur economic growth in Georgia's agriculture sector by helping producers capture more of the consumer dollar by adding value to their commodities."
   "This is great news for agriculture producers around the state and will help to improve economic growth and create additional jobs for Georgia's leading industry," Isakson said.
   A value-added product is created when a producer takes an agricultural commodity, such as milk or vegetables, and processes or prepares it in a way that increases its value to consumers. Previous value-added grants have resulted in several new businesses for the agriculture industry in Georgia.
   The six projects funded in Georgia include: Organihharm, LLC in Dalton - $109,000; Quality Growers Gin & Peanuts in Tifton - $100,000; Russell Johnston in Newborn - $70,475; Sparkman's Cream Dairy in Moultrie - $300,000; Still Pond Winery in Arlington - $208,533; and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton - $300,000.
