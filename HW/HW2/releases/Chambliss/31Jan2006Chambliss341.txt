SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR FITZGERALD FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Fitzgerald Fire Department will receive a $45,745 grant as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's (AFGP), Fire Prevention and Safety Grant (FP&S).  
   "I spent my summers growing up in Fitzgerald and I am pleased that the Fire Department has received this important funding, which will go a long way to help ensure that Fitzgerald's first responders have the resources necessary to protect families and communities across the state," said Isakson. 
   "Local firefighters and emergency workers provide our first defense to natural disasters, accidents and terrorist attacks," Chambliss said. "It is because these brave men and women are often the first on the scene of any incident that we must continue to ensure they have the tools and training they need to do their jobs safely and efficiently. I look forward to continuing to work with local fire departments and emergency responders across the state to ensure they have the resources they need." 
   Congress reauthorized and appropriated $650 million for the AFGP this year. Of that amount, $32.5 million has been set aside for Fire Prevention and Safety grants. The primary goal of the program is to reach high-risk target groups in order to decrease the high incidences of death and injuries. 
   The AFGP was created to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs. To qualify for funding, applicants must demonstrate financial need and articulate the benefits they will get if awarded the grant.
