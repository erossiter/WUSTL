SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., this evening released the following statement regarding President Bush's address to the Nation on immigration reform: 
  "I am pleased to see the President take this aggressive step toward strengthening our borders, because we need to make clear that America is serious about border security. The American people demand it and deserve no less.
  "The men and women of our National Guard play a critical role in our homeland security efforts. They have been called upon more and more, and they continue to serve with honor and professionalism. The Guard is playing and can continue to play a supportive role in securing our borders by freeing up the Border Patrol to pursue illegal immigrants, drug traffickers and weapons smugglers. 
  "My top priority in the Senate's debate on immigration reform is to ensure that our borders are secure. Our attempts to establish or reform temporary worker programs are futile if we do not have operational control of our borders and serious interior enforcement. As this debate moves forward, I will continue to oppose amnesty and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. I do not believe there should be a connection between immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship."
