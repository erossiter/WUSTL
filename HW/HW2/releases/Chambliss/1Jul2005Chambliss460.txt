SEN. CHAMBLISS COMMENTS ON ASSOCIATE JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S RETIREMENT
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., issued the following statement on the retirement of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: 
   "Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is an outstanding jurist and has made valuable contributions to our nation's judicial system. Aside from the impact Justice O'Connor made as the first female justice, her pragmatic and reasoned voice on the bench helped her become a leading coalition-builder on many challenging and controversial decisions. After serving for almost a quarter century, it is clear that Justice O'Connor has made an indelible mark on the history of the Court.
   "I now look forward to working with my colleagues as the United States Senate begins its important work to consider President Bush's upcoming nomination to fill the vacancy Justice O'Connor leaves behind."
   Justice O'Connor was nominated to the Court by President Reagan and was sworn in on September 25, 1981.
