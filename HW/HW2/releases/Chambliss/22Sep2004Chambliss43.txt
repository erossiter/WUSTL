SEN. CHAMBLISS ISSUES STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF REP. GOSS
  Mr. President:
   I strongly support my colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who have endorsed the President's nominee to be the next Director of Central Intelligence, Porter Goss. The selection of the head of our intelligence community is always an important one, but it has never been as critical to the security of the United States as it is right now.  
   Two months ago on July 21st, I said in this chamber that, "Intelligence is our first line of defense against terrorism, and we must improve the collection capabilities and analysis of intelligence to protect the security of the United States and its allies." It follows that whoever heads our intelligence community bears enormous responsibility for the safety of our country. Confirming the next Director of Central Intelligence is a serious decision and I believe the American people have every right to know as much as possible about Porter Goss and why the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has recommended that he be confirmed by the full Senate to head up our entire intelligence efforts.
   Porter Goss was selected by the President for several important reasons:
   * He has "hands on" experience as a professional intelligence officer and as a member of Congress with intelligence oversight responsibilities. Porter Goss was an officer in the Army's Military Intelligence Corps, a clandestine case officer in the Central Intelligence Agency, and more recently the Chairman of the House Intelligence Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  
   * Porter Goss personally knows the heads of intelligence of our major allies. His personal credibility with these foreign intelligence agencies will be enormously important as we continue to work with our allies to confront shared threats.
   * He is committed to providing intelligence to the President on a non-partisan basis. In response to questions raised during his confirmation hearings, Porter Goss made it absolutely clear that he understands the necessity of keeping politics out of intelligence and he is a man of his word.
   * Porter Goss is prepared to take the necessary risks to fix the weakest of our intelligence disciplines, human intelligence or HUMINT. 
   * Finally, Porter Goss is committed to reforming our intelligence community and he is the right person to enthusiastically implement the reforms that Congress will legislate.
   Mr. President, the confirmation of Porter Goss will provide us with a professional intelligence officer, with vital international connections, who is non-partisan, not afraid to take risks, and is committed to intelligence reform. 
   Under his leadership, our great intelligence professionals will continue to strengthen the security of the United States and our allies. 
   Mr. President, I have known Porter Goss for over ten years and I have served with him on the House Intelligence Committee. I know his capabilities and his character. There is no one more qualified person to head up our intelligence community and I urge the Senate to confirm his as our next Director of Central Intelligence.
   Thank you Mr. President.
