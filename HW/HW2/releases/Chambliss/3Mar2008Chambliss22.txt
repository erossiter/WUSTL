SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO REIMBURSE FIREFIGHTING COSTS FROM SWEAT FARM ROAD FIRE
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide $6 million in federal funding to help reimburse the Georgia Forestry Commission for firefighting costs incurred during April 2007's Sweat Farm Road Fire in Ware County. 
   The Sweat Farm Road Fire ravaged southeast Georgia and Florida in April and May of 2007. It destroyed over 80,000 acres, including five homes, threatened 800 homes and businesses in the city of Waycross and forced about 2,100 people to evacuate.
   "This assistance is greatly needed and it is welcome news," said Senator Chambliss. "The wildfires devastated the southeast area of our state, and I commend the outstanding efforts of our firefighters, forestry rangers, officials, and the many others who worked relentlessly during that time to contain the fires and protect our communities. With this funding, our communities can continue the process of restoring and rehabilitating what was lost."
   "I am grateful for the heroic efforts of the emergency personnel and the firefighters who battled this unwieldy and fast-spreading fire and protected our citizens," Senator Isakson said. "This funding is welcome news, and I am very pleased the Georgia Forestry Commission will be able to take advantage of this federal assistance as the state continues to recover from these widespread fires."
   FEMA has contributed approximately $16.2 million in funding for firefighting costs associated with the Sweat Farm Road Fire. Under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act's Fire Management Assistance Grant program, FEMA reimburses states for 75 percent of their approved firefighting costs such as equipment, materials, labor, food and lodging.
