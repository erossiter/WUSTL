SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR PULASKI FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isaskon, R-Ga., today announced that the Pulaski County Fire Department will receive a $124013 grant as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program" (AFGP).  
   "Firefighters perform a selfless public service to their communities," Chambliss said. "I am pleased that Pulaski County will now have these additional funds to help train and equip first responders."
   "This funding will go a long way to help ensure that Georgia's first responders have the resources necessary to protect families and communities across the state," said Isakson. "This grant fills an important need for firefighters in Pulaski County."
   Each year, the AFGP awards one-year grants directly to firefighters. President Bush authorized a $750 million for the 2004 program. The Pulaski County funds are awarded through the Fire Prevention Program and can be used for public education and awareness activities, fire code enforcement activities, fire inspector certifications, purchase and instillation of smoke alarms and fire suppression systems, wildland mitigation, and arson prevention and detection activities. 
   The AFGP was created to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs. To qualify for funding, applicants must demonstrate financial need and articulate the benefits they will get if awarded the grant. This year DHS received more than 20,000 applications for AFGP grants submitted, of those, 430 were submitted for the Fire Prevention Program.
