SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO REPAIR KATRINA DAMAGE AT STENNIS, GULFPORT/BILOXI AIRPORTS
  Federal funding totaling $1.4 Million is approved for use at Stennis International Airport to repair damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   \"Getting airports in this region fully functional is very important, especially in a hard-hit area like Hancock County and Bay St. Louis,\" Senator Lott said. \"Stennis Space Center and Stennis Airport are a huge part of the Gulf Coast's economy, and this funding will help repair critical airport systems.\"
   Specifically, this package will help acquire aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicles, install or replace navigational equipment, rehabilitate the aircraft rescue and fire fighting building, rehabilitate the runway lighting, and rehabilitate the taxiway lighting.
   The tidal surge from Hurricane Katrina flooded Stennis International Airport, near Bay St. Louis causing considerable damage to these facilities. This grant will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration.
   It joins an almost $1 million grant also approved today for repairs at Gulfport-Biloxi Airport which includes continuation of a terminal apron expansion which was underway prior to Katrina.
