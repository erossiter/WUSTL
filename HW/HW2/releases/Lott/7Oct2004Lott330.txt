SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN, REP. WICKER: DESOTO COUNTY GRANTED FOREIGN TRADE ZONE DESIGNATION
  The U.S. Foreign Trade Zones Board has granted authority for establishing a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in Southaven, DeSoto County, Mississippi, Sens.  
 Trent Lott, Thad Cochran and Rep. Roger Wicker said today. The Northern Mississippi FTZ Inc., a Mississippi non-profit corporation, made application to the board earlier this year requesting FTZ establishment within the Memphis, Tennessee customs port of entry area.
   "This is an important step forward in our state's effort to build upon the economic growth of this already very vibrant region," Senator Lott said. "This foreign trade zone will be a very attractive attribute for DeSoto County, giving the area a decided advantage, particularly in terms of attracting international companies to invest and create jobs, as well as for domestic companies who depend on international markets to sustain existing jobs."
   By definition, FTZ procedures allow duty-free export and deferral of customs duty payment on items used in domestic commerce, helping to offset customs cost advantages available to plants abroad. FTZ activity is conducted under the supervision of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security. 
   The designation of DeSoto County as a foreign-trade zone will attract investments by foreign and domestic industries," Senator Cochran said. "I am pleased the Department of Commerce has provided an opportunity for increased employment in North Mississippi."
   Congressman Wicker stated:
   "I was pleased to be able to work with Senators Cochran and Lott on this effort to help expand opportunities for Mississippi businesses to compete in the global marketplace."
