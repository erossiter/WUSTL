  Federal grant funding totaling $3,210,000 is approved for use at both the Jackson International Airport and the Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport, Sens.

"By continually improving airports at Jackson and the Coast we are positively impacting air travelers throughout the majority of our state, and we're helping set the stage for additional improvements including ongoing air service expansions."
   At Jackson, $1,750,000 will be used to improve the terminal building, rehabilitate runway lighting and acquire an interactive training system.
