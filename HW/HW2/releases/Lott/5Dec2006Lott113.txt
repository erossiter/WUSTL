SEN. LOTT TAPS MANNY ROSSMAN TO LEAD WHIP OFFICE IN 110TH CONGRESS
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the incoming Senate Republican Whip, has tapped his senior policy advisor Manny Rossman to serve as Chief of Staff for the Senate Republican Whip office in the 110th Congress.  
 Rossman will be Senator Lott's primary Whip strategist and floor advisor for the Whip organization. He joined Senator Lott's staff almost two years to handle issues specific to the Senate Finance and Budget committees including taxes, trade, health care, pensions and social security. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Rossman assisted Senator Lott in drafting the Gulf Opportunity Zone and other incentives included in the Katrina tax relief bills. Rossman also implemented Senator Lott's agenda on the tax titles of the energy, highway, pension and tax reconciliation bills. 
 "Manny is a studied professional whose experience in getting the votes and getting results will be an asset not only to me but to the entire Republican conference and the Senate as a whole," Senator Lott said. "The Senate will benefit from his energy and determination." 
 Prior to joining Senator Lott's staff, Rossman served as Legislative Director to former Representative Phil Crane of Illinois, and was a staff assistant to former Representative Bill Archer of Texas. 
 Rossman received his B.A. in political science, cum laude, from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, and his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
