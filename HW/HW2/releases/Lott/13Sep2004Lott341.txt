FUNDS APPROVED FOR U.S. 49 IN RANKIN, HARRISON COUNTIES ROAD WORK
  Federal funding totaling more than $600,000 is approved for two important Mississippi transportation projects in Rankin and Harrison counties, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said.
   "These two counties are some of our fastest growing areas, and their transportation needs are evolving rapidly," Senator Lott said. "Improving Highway 49 in Florence and creating the Canal Road Intermodal Connector in Harrison County will improve traffic flow and quality of life in these areas. I was pleased to help secure these funds in the federal budget process, and I look forward to completion of these two projects soon."
   In Harrison County, $360,526 in federal grant funds will be used toward ongoing construction of the Canal Road Intermodal Connector. This project received a $1 million earmark by Senator Lott in the previous fiscal year. When complete the connector, built to interstate standards, will facilitate a smoother north and south traffic flow from Highway 90 to Interstate 10, and improve access to the Port of Gulfport.
   In Rankin County, a federal grant of $288,422 will be used for U.S. 49 from Florence to Interstate 20 improvements. The project will alleviate congestion, reduce travel times, and make the adjacent communities more livable by improving access in, out and through the Jackson Metro Area. The project received an $800,000 earmark requested by Senator Lott in the previous fiscal year.
   All funds will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.
