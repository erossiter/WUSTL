SEN. LOTT: $20 MILLION GRANTED FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL, INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR
  Today Hancock and Jackson counties were granted more than $20 million to restore public infrastructure and remove debris as the Hurricane Katrina recovery continues, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said.  
   "This is grant funding that will be put to immediate use in these areas," Senator Lott said. "In addition to the debris pickup, of particular note is the importance of reestablishing public infrastructure to its pre-Katrina capability and beyond. This funding will do that by helping to restore a wastewater treatment facility, and it will contribute to reestablishing Hancock County's communications system."
   Specifically the funding breaks down into three separate awards:
   * $7,119,375 to Jackson County to restore a wastewater treatment plant to its pre-disaster design, capacity and function;
   * $6,504,350 also to Jackson County for ongoing debris removal;
   * $6,583,159 to Hancock County to offset costs of leasing temporary communications equipment for six months while the county reestablishes a permanent communications system.
   The grants will be administered through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
