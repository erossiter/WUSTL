SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $6 MILLION TO IMPROVE AIRPORTS STATEWIDE
 Federal funding totaling more than $6 million is approved for use at airports throughout Mississippi, including refurbishment for the Jackson-Evers International Airport terminal, Sen. Trent Lott said today.  
   "Grants like these are always important, but they are especially needed as we rebuild our economy following Hurricane Katrina," Senator Lott said. "Airport improvements have a direct impact not only on commercial or private passenger air travel, but also on a community's ability to attract new investment and new jobs, which is especially important right now. These facilities already play a significant role in Mississippi's economic life, and these enhancements will ensure that role continues to grow."
