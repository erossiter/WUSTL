SEN. LOTT: $26 MILLION MADE AVAILABLE FOR KATRINA RECOVERY PROJECTS
  Today Federal grant reimbursements totaling more than $26 million have been approved for use in several Mississippi Gulf Coast communities hard hit by Hurricane Katrina, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.
   " Mississippi will continue working aggressively to secure federal support for our recovery and rebuilding effort," Senator Lott said. "Our state's Congressional delegation will ensure that our nation continues seeing Hurricane Katrina as a national disaster with an impact far beyond the coast or even the coastal states."
   Said Senator Thad Cochran:
   "I am encouraged that federal funding is coming to our state to repair public buildings and complete the work of debris removal. Mississippi has made tremendous progress in the last 15 months since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast ." 
   The reimbursement package includes funds to rebuild or repair buildings damaged by the storm, and repayments for debris removal. The funds will be dispersed through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the FEMA project descriptions are as follows:
   * $1,380,400.20 (Federal share) - Gulfport , City of - E. Public Buildings. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to the region's buildings and infrastructure. Among the damaged facilities is the 29,789 square foot Gaston Hewes Recreation Center in Harrison County . Approximately 1/3 of the structural support beams were destroyed and several others damaged along with over 1/2 the roof completely destroyed and the remainder damaged. Several interior and exterior concrete walls were toppled and destroyed. Most of the major components of the facilities mechanical systems were destroyed in the collapsed section or damaged by flying or falling debris. The damage was so extensive that the estimated repair cost is greater than 50% of the estimated replacement cost, making this facility eligible for complete replacement. In order to account for all possible costs associated with the construction project, FEMA staff applied the Cost Estimating Format (CEF) to arrive at a more accurate estimate of the final cost to rebuild this facility. This $1,533,778 represents the cost associated with the factors and components of the CEF, which FEMA will provide in addition to the previous $1,388,802 funded when this grant was first prepared. The applicant's insurance policy is expected to pay the remaining $1,914,896.
   $1,267,179.90 (Federal share) - Bay St. Louis School District - E. Public Buildings. Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast . Among the damaged buildings and infrastructure was the Second Street Elementary School building, which is a 43,365 SF facility built in 1923 and listed on the National Historic Register of Historic Places. The storm surge flooded the building with 4 to 5 ft of contaminated salt water causing damage to the walls, floors, doors, window, trim, ceiling tiles and heat pumps. These damages resulted in the building being 37.5% damaged. This $1,407,971 represents the cost to remove and replace gypsum plaster walls, floors, exterior and interior doors, windows, millwork trim, ceiling tiles and heat pumps, as well as, paint and or finish the walls, doors, windows and trim.
   * $1,656,645.19 (Federal share) - Mississippi State Port Authority - F. Public Utilities. Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast . Prior to the storm the Mississippi State Port Authority (MSPA) property was a bulk, break-bulk and container seaport. The primary electrical system feeding both the East and West terminal of the Port of Gulfport was disabled from the loss of key distribution components such as transformers and the above ground power delivery lines, as well as the flooding, shorting, and salt water corrosion of underground power distribution lines. The permanent work to restore this facility include repairs to the underground wiring to the transformer dock and the tug dock, thirty (30) reefer plugs on the West terminal, a combination of above ground and underground medium voltage distribution lines that feed multiple switchgear and step-down transformers, as well as general facilities lighting and HVAC repairs. This $1,840,716.88 represents the estimated cost to restore the facility to its pre-disaster design, capacity, and function, less insurance proceeds.
   * $19,564,610.61 (Federal share) - Catholic Charities Housing Association of Biloxi - E. Public Buildings. Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast . Among the damaged buildings and infrastructure was the Santa Maria de la Mer, which is a 13 story, 209 unit low income apartment complex for the elderly. The storm surge and high wind destroyed the entire first floor of the facility, including the windows, doors, block walls, and other structural components. On the first floor were five apartment units, offices, lounge, laundry room, maintenance room, equipment room, elevator, and rest rooms. The chilling tower and compressor for the air conditioner system and the fire pump for the sprinklers were located in two buildings on the East side of the building, and were all damaged beyond repair. Windows on the East side of the building on all 13 floors were either broken or dislodged and leaked in every apartment. The mechanically attached rubber roofing was also damaged, as well as the nine commercial power vent fans and rooftop air handler. The water intrusion from the storm surge and wind-blown rain also saturated much of the porous materials and building components, which will now require extensive mold remediation work. The estimated cost to repair the damaged building components, replace the destroyed mechanical and electrical equipment, and to rebuild the entire first floor is $21,738,456.23, net of insurance proceeds. This applicant applied for and was denied an SBA loan. This represents the cost to restore the facility to its pre-disaster design, capacity, and function.
   * $1,273,970.01 (Federal share) - Jackson County - Debris Removal. Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast , which uprooted trees, scattered limbs, damaged buildings and infrastructure, and deposited debris throughout Jackson County . An estimated 1,222,636 cubic yards of vegetative, construction, and concrete debris remained along the rights of way after June 30, 2006, as well as over 70 hazardous stumps, and 341cubic yards of hazardous waste. The applicant had removed all stumps, hazardous waste, and nearly all scattered debris at the time of grant preparation, leaving only an estimated 30,000 cubic yards of debris to be removed from along the rights of way. This $1,415,522.23 represents both the actual costs for the work completed, as well as the estimated cost to collect the remaining debris.
   $1,363,339.00 - Biloxi , City of - Debris Removal. Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which uprooted trees, scattered tree limbs, damaged buildings and deposited debris throughout the City of Biloxi, causing a threat to public health and safety. In addition to scattered debris, there were roughly 22,000 hanging limbs, 1,600 leaning trees, and over 250 hazardous stumps of various diameters and sizes that required removal at a cost of $1,363,339. The PW covers work completed from 2/21/06 through 4/6/06.
