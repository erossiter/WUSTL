SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $40 MILLION FOR KATRINA RECOVERY
  Today Federal reimbursements totaling about $40 million have been approved for several Mississippi communities and utilities tasked with removing debris and restoring services following Hurricane Katrina, Sens.  
 Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.
   "Though this seems like a lot of money, it is only a fraction of the investment Mississippi needs to recover from Hurricane Katrina," Senator Lott said. "Senator Cochran and I continue working with federal officials to secure much needed grant funding for our state."
   The grant package, which will be administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), comes on the heels of a similar federal grant packages for debris removal and infrastructure repair which Senators Lott and Cochran have announced in recent weeks. Today's funding includes:
   * $3,678,150.00 to Stone County for debris removal;
