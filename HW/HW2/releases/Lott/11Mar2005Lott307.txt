SEN. LOTT PRESENTED WITH 'SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE' AWARD
 The United States Chamber of Commerce has presented Sen.  
 Trent Lott with its "Spirit of Enterprise" award for what the Chamber terms his "strong support for a pro-economic growth legislative agenda" during the second session of the 108th Congress.
   "I am very honored to be recognized by the U.S. Chamber," Senator Lott said. "It's been a privilege to work with Mississippi's elected leaders and our state and our nation's business community to promote job growth in my state. Economic growth means new opportunities for Mississippians, and we've seen a significant amount of success in recent years. I'll continue this effort, and I look forward to new opportunities to promote business investment in Mississippi and a healthy business climate nationwide."
   The Chamber awards the "Spirit of Enterprise" based on rankings it gives members of Congress for what it considers "key votes" during each session. Score votes for the 108th Congress included decisions on medical liability reform, pension reform and tax relief.
   Senator Lott earned a 100 percent score last year, and he has an almost 90 percent cumulative ranking during his tenure in Congress.
   The U.S. Chamber represents about 3 million businesses and organizations.
