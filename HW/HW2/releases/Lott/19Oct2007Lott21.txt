SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR GREENVILLE AND COLUMBUS AIRPORTS
  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded grants totaling almost $1 million for Mid-Delta Regional Airport in Greenville and Golden Triangle Regional Airport in Columbus, U.S. Senators Trent Lott, Thad Cochran and U.S. Representative Roger Wicker said today. 
   "As Ranking Member of the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, I was pleased to work with administrators of both these facilities to secure this funding," Senator Lott said. "This is part of a flexible federal initiative specifically designed to maintain and increase commercial passenger service at small community airports like Mid-Delta and Golden Triangle. It can be used for a variety of purposes related to promoting regional airport connections and ensuring competitive ticket prices."
   Today's award specifically includes $450,000 for Greenville/Mid-Delta Airport and $500,000 for Golden Triangle Airport.
   Senator Cochran stated:
   "Our airports in Mississippi are essential to attracting jobs and improving the quality of life of our citizens. The Greenville Municipal Airport serves as an air-travel gateway to the Delta, while the Golden Triangle Airport has become the centerpiece of some of the most exciting economic development in the Southeast. I am pleased the Department of Transportation has recognized the importance of these airports by providing them with resources to attract additional service and reduce fares."
   Congressman Roger Wicker said:
   "This Air Service Grant will play an important role in helping Golden Triangle Regional Airport create new routes and schedules to assist the growing economic development activities under way throughout the Golden Triangle."
   Congress established this grant program as part of the Aviation Investment and Reform Act, passed in 2002. The grants are part of a $9 million package being announced nationally.
