$12 MILLION APPROVED FOR POST KATRINA JOB TRAINING
  Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran today praised the Bush Administration's decision to make $12 million in emergency job training grants available to Gulf Coast states hit by Hurricane Katrina, including Mississippi. 
   "With an extensive community college system, Mississippi can put these dollars to immediate use," Senator Lott said. "Replacing jobs for people who've lost them due to the storm, and getting new reconstruction jobs funded is a priority for our state."
   Senator Cochran stated:
   "The funding provided by the Department of Labor will help ensure that Mississippi workers receive the training and resources they need to rebuild our state. These grants will not only help individuals regain fiscal independence, but will also put our state on the road to economic recovery."
   Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao made the funds available today, saying the grants will be used for short-term training that provides a quick return to employment, as well as for longer-term career training using community college programs.
   This follows an initial pledge by Secretary Chao for more than $50 million to fund temporary Katrina cleanup and recovery jobs in Mississippi, which Senator Lott, Senator Cochran and Secretary Chao announced on September 2nd.
   The grants are being awarded as part of President Bush's High Growth Job Training Initiative. For more information, please visit www.doleta.gov/BRG/JobTrainInitiative. Or, for additional information on the Department of Labor's employment and training resources, please visit www.doleta.gov.
