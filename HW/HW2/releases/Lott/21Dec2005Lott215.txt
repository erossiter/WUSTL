SEN. LOTT: DEBRIS REMOVAL DEADLINE EXTENDED
  At the urging of Mississippi's Congressional delegation including Sen.  
 Trent Lott, President Bush today extended until March 15, 2006, the deadline during which Mississippi's disaster counties can receive 100 percent federal reimbursement for Katrina debris removal.
   "President Bush realizes that Mississippi's recovery from this unprecedented disaster will take additional time, and this certainly is good news to local governments faced with the considerable expenditures of removing debris and taking emergency precautions," Senator Lott said.
   All Mississippi counties designated under the federal disaster declaration are eligible for this assistance.
   Before Katrina's landfall last August, the President declared most of Mississippi a disaster area, making federal assistance available to both individual households and to local governments, depending upon the amount of damage received in each area. 
   Today's action will enable disaster counties to continue receiving federal reimbursements administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for their entire debris removal and also for emergency protective measure expenses through March 15, 2006, Senator Lott said. 
   In addition, Senator Lott has asked that Congress and the President consider raising individual per-household disaster assistance caps, and that Congress consider requiring FEMA to pay reimbursements sooner.
