$1.1 MILLION APPROVED FOR DOLPHIN RESEARCH ALONG GULF COAST
 Federal funding totaling $1,104,962 is approved for use by Gulfport, Mississippi's Institute for Marine Mammal Studies for continuing research involving the Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said.
   "This organization's work is an invaluable resource for understanding the Gulf Coast's marine environment and preserving it," Senator Lott said. "Our marine resources are important for Mississippi's economy, and they are part of the Gulf Coast's unique identity. These studies are helping to protect an important species of dolphin that is especially important to the entire North Central Gulf of Mexico region."
   This funding award will included in the Fiscal Year 2004 budget with the support of Senator Lott. The award will fund Phase III of a study specifically dedicated to learning about the biology, natural history, ecology, behavior, immunology, parasitology, physiology, diseases, and taxonomy involving this species. The program also includes aspects of both public education and conservation relating to the bottlenose dolphin.
   The funds will be administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and were included in last year's Commerce, Justice and State Departments Appropriations Bill, which funds NOAA and several other federal agencies.
