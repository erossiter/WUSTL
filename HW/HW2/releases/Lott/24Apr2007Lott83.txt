SEN. LOTT: $4.4 MILLION AVAILABLE TO HELP RE-TRAIN DISPLACED SARA LEE WORKERS
  Following a conversation with U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao today, Sen. Lott said the U.S. Department of Labor will release up to $4.4 million for worker retraining benefiting about 1,200 workers displaced by the closure of West Point's Sara Lee facility.  
   "I've been working with Secretary Chao to secure this very important funding, and I am very pleased that this program will be geared toward helping these men and women obtain new jobs at the new industries which are growing in this area."
   The area has successfully recruited a number of higher-paying jobs in the automotive, aerospace and steel fabricating sectors. 
   The Department will make an initial release of $1.4 million to the Three Rivers Planning and Development District, which will administer the funding locally along with the Mississippi Department of Employment Security.
   The workers will have access to a full array of dislocated worker services including career and occupational skills training. 
   "Through Sara Lee's closing was a disappointment, this area of Mississippi is working very aggressively to not only rebound but to sculpt a stronger economy with more and better opportunities for its citizens. This funding will help Sara Lee's former employees benefit from this new momentum, helping these Mississippians to remain in our state and further contribute to Mississippi's growth."
