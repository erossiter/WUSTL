SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $8 MILLION FOR KATRINA REPAIR
 Federal funding totaling more than $8 million is approved for post-hurricane cleanup and repair efforts along the Gulf Coast, Sen. Trent Lott said today. The individual grants include funds to restore water and sewer infrastructure and to continue removing debris.  
   "Of course this funding is but a fraction of what the total expenditure will be when the recovery is complete, but with each obligated dollar our counties and cities can get a little closer to financial and physical recovery," Senator Lott said.
   Today's awards, which will be administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), include:
   * $3.2 million in public assistance funds to help repair or replace elements of the Henderson Point Water and Sewer District. This amount is part of the total contract const to replace pumps, wells and destroyed components of the electrical power system
   * $2.1 million in public assistance funds for the City of Long Beach. Due to the extent of the hurricane's damage, the water distribution system below the debris line along Highway 90 must be replaced. This replacement cost includes hydrants, valves, and other key parts of the system.
   * $2.8 million in public assistance for Jackson County to cover the contract cost of debris removal.
