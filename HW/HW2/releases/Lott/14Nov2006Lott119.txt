SEN. LOTT SENDS SENATE COMPUTERS TO MISSISSIPPI SCHOOLS
  As part of the U.S. Senate's "Computers for Schools Program," Sen. Trent Lott has sent 25 surplus U.S. Senate computers to the Pearl River, Poplarville, Picayune and Pascagoula school districts. The computers are expected to arrive this week.  
   "This is a program which seeks to put surplus Senate equipment to good use," Senator Lott said. "These are good, modern units made available by routine upgrades in the Senate, and I'm sure that these school districts will find them very suited for educational instruction in the coming years." 
   Each U.S. Senator is given an opportunity to participate in the program by the U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms, and he or she is allotted surplus computers based on seniority. 
   To finalize awards, Senators then consult a list of participating public schools in their home states which have registered with the program. 
   "I note that these are districts which were on the front line of Hurricane Katrina's assault on Mississippi," Senator Lott added. "For that reason, I know the administrators, teachers and students in these schools will be especially happy to receive these computers, and I am confident they'll use them well."
