SEN. LOTT: ALMOST $3 MILLION APPROVED FOR MARINE MAMMAL INITIATIVE
  Federal funding totaling $2,718,359 is approved for use by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, Inc., located in Gulfport, Mississippi, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   "The sea life found along our Gulf Coast is a vital asset to our state's recreational and commercial economy, and this natural resource helps define our unique region," Senator Lott said. "These funds will help us better understand the dolphin population and contribute to our efforts to protect them. "
   Specifically the funds will help the Center for Marine Education and Research provide a place for research activity and a facility for the rescue and rehabilitation of marine mammals in the Mississippi-Alabama sub region of the North Central Gulf of Mexico. Information for the various studies conducted will help provide answers to many questions regarding dolphins which are still being studied extensively. 
   NOAA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The initiative is one of the agency's Congressionally identified construction projects.
