SEN. LOTT'S AIRPORT REBUILDING BILL HEADS TO PRESIDENT
  Legislation authored by Sen. Trent Lott to repair airports damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has passed the U.S. House by a 340 to 0 vote, and is expected to be signed by the President. The legislation, which was overwhelmingly passed the Senate last week, gives the Secretary of Transportation authority to use millions of dollars in existing federal grant funds to make emergency airport repairs throughout the disaster zone. 
   "To get our economy and jobs going again we need fully functional airports." Senator Lott, a senior member of the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said. "I expect the President will act quickly to sign this bill into law because this legislation will restore our airports by making millions of dollars immediately available for repairs and refurbishment. It will help restore passenger and commercial air traffic throughout the Gulf region."
   Senator Thad Cochran stated, "I'm pleased to have cosponsored this bill that will enable the Department of Transportation to provide funding to airports in the Hurricane devastated areas. It is integral to the economic recovery of the entire Gulf Coast region that these airports be restored to their full operational capacity as soon as possible."
   Senator Lott drafted the legislation in consultation with representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
   Senator Lott's bill specifically permits the Transportation Secretary to make project grants for capital costs to repair or replace public use facilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Katrina that were incurred by a public use airport in Mississippi, Louisiana, or Alabama that is listed in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. The bill also permits grant funding to cover emergency operating costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Katrina by these airports.
   The U.S.'s share of the funding is 100 percent. State and local governments will not be required to match the funds. "This 100 percent funding is very important," Senator Lott said. "State and local governments impacted by Katrina are cash-strapped, and some municipalities are totally destroyed. This bill takes considerable pressure off local taxpayers at a time when it's needed most."
   Joining Senators Lott and Cochran as original cosponsors of the legislation are Senators Mary Landrieu and David Vitter, both of Louisiana, and Conrad Burns of Montana.
