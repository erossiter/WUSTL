AVIATION CHAIRMAN LOTT: ALMOST $1 MILLION APPROVED FOR GOLDEN TRIANGLE, GULFPORT-BILOXI AIRPORTS
  Federal funding totaling $739,500 is approved for use at Golden Triangle Regional Airport and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, Sen.  
 Trent Lott, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Aviation Subcommittee, said today.
   "Good airport facilities enable communities to better develop their local economy and attract new jobs," Senator Lott said. "These are two of our state's most promising airports. Each one has proven its worth to the local economy by helping to accommodate more business investment and tourism within Mississippi."
   At Golden Triangle Regional Airport, the airport authority will use a U.S. Department of Transportation grant of $389,500 to rehabilitate an apron, terminal and to install a lifting device for disabled customers.
   At Gulfport-Biloxi International, the airport authority will us a $350,000 grant administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation to help construct a perimeter road. The road will increase accessibility to the southwest side of the airfield and greatly reduce the danger of potential runway incursions.
