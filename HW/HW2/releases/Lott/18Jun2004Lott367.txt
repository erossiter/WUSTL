FY 2005 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL CONTAINS PROJECTS FOR MISSISSIPPI MILITARY CONTRACTORS, INSTALLATIONS
  The Senate's version of the Fiscal Year 2005 Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization bill is nearly complete. The Senate's 2005 (DoD) Authorization bill currently contains a number of key projects impacting Mississippi's military installations and defense contractors, Sen. Trent Lott said today.
   "The DoD Authorization is always one of the most important annual federal budget bills to the State of Mississippi," Senator Lott said. "Defense contracting and military activity makes up a major portion of Mississippi's economy. The bill supports many important initiatives across the entire state of Mississippi, and it will benefit a broad cross section of our industrial sector, our universities, and military bases." 
   Unfortunately, the House of Representatives plans to cut the DDX program by $200 million. DDX is the Navy's next generation destroyer, and Senator Lott believes it is criticial not only the men and women of Ingalls Shipbuilding, but to the entire nation's security. 
   "I am hopeful that members of the House will recognize the importance of DDX and agree to fully support the program. I have also introduced an amendment to the authorization bill that would eliminate the option for the Department of Defense to mothball bases during the next round of BRAC. I have never supported the BRAC process, and believe that mothballing a base is the worst possible option since it would hinder redevelopment of a base."
   The following are highlights of this year's Senate Authorization bill:
