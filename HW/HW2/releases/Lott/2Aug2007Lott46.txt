SEN. LOTT ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE SOUTHWICK'S SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTE
  Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi issued the following statement on the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote of support for Judge Leslie Southwick: 
   "This is a victory for fairness. Judge Southwick is a principled man and deserves - as did the two highly respected nominees before him - to sit on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
   "Judge Southwick is a man of faith and a strict constructionist who will interpret the law as written and not attempt to legislate from the bench.
   "I am grateful that Senator Feinstein took an objective look at Judge Southwick's record. Her vote to allow the full Senate the opportunity to consider this just nominee is admirable, and I know that when all Senators examine his exemplary record as a jurist, his honorable service as an Iraq War veteran, and his leadership in the State of Mississippi, he will be confirmed overwhelmingly."
