SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $5 MILLION FOR GULFPORT/BILOXI AIRPORT UPGRADES
  Federal funding totaling $5 million is slated for improvements at Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport, specifically in support of an ongoing noise abatement program, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. 
   "We've been very successful in expanding Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport's service offerings and the facility has undergone a major expansion effort," Senator Lott said. "So, certainly, this project complements the growth of the airport, and it will help ensure that South Mississippi's premier gateway will be ready for future growth during the Hurricane Katrina recovery and well beyond."
   Senator Cochran said:
   I am pleased the Federal Aviation Administration has recognized the need for noise reduction around Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport. This facility is poised to continue to be an important asset to citizens and businesses along the entire Gulf Coast, and this assistance will help ensure that the airport is a good neighbor to the surrounding communities and environment."
   The project funds will be administered under the U.S. Department of Transportation pursuant to the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21), which Senator Lott has championed on the Senate Aviation Committee.
   It is designated for Phase II of a land acquisition project, to mitigate noise levels impacting nearby residential areas.
