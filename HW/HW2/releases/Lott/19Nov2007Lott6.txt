SEN. LOTT ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING SELECTION OF MISSISSIPPI TO HOST FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN 2008
  Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi issued the following statement after the announcement by the Commission on Presidential Debates in Washington, D.C., that the first Presidential Debate of 2008 will be held at The University of Mississippi in Oxford on September 26: 
   "Since 1968, no candidate has captured the Oval Office without winning the South. The University of Mississippi, our state's first public university, is honored by its selection to host the first of these three prestigious debates.
   "This selection is a testament to Chancellor Robert Khayat's leadership and vision for Ole Miss. The University of Mississippi has garnered its fair share of firsts for Mississippi, and this is another accomplishment of which all Mississippians are proud.
   "Ole Miss and Oxford is an ideal location for candidates to interact with a cross-section of students and citizens often overlooked by America's media markets."
   "During my time in Congress, I've made it a point to bring both national and international leaders to Mississippi. By bringing this debate to Mississippi we're not only continuing this tradition, but taking it a step further by showcasing all of these very capable, qualified candidates on a single stage for Mississippians and the entire nation to see.
   "The selection of Mississippi highlights our strong recovery from Hurricane Katrina and the importance we, and other rural states, hold in America's political system. The debates might be the first visit many make to Mississippi, but I am confident it will not be their last."
