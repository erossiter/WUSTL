SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN, REP. WICKER: ALMOST $2 MILLION APPROVED FOR DESOTO, STONE COUNTY WATER PROJECTS
  Federal funding totaling almost $2 million is approved for separate water projects in DeSoto and Stone Counties, Sens.  
 Trent Lott, Thad Cochran and Rep. Roger Wicker said today.
   "Improving water and waste water infrastructure is an essential part of ensuring Mississippi's growth and maintaining a good standard of public health for our state's citizens," Senator Lott said. "DeSoto and Stone counties are both growing, and these projects will provide infrastructure needed to sustain and attract jobs and residents."
   In DeSoto County, the Belmont Water Association, Inc. will use a $1,530,000 direct federal loan to replace existing piping with larger mains. This will help alleviate overloading, assisting almost 700 users
   In Stone County, the Sunflower Utility Association, Inc., will use a federal loan of $106,500 and an accompanying federal grant of $274,500 to construct a back-up well. It also will help the association provide service to additional residents that currently rely on shallow wells.
   Both packages will be administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural Development.
