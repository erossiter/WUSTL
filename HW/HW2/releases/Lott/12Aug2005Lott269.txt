SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR HISTORIC, ARTISTIC PRESERVATION PROJECT
  Federal funding totaling $100,000 is approved to restore the Ocean Springs Community Center, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said. The funding will be administered through the Save America?s Treasurers grant program, which Sen. Lott helped advance through Congress, and this particular project was approved as part of this year's Interior Appropriations Bill, which recently passed Congress. 
   "I was pleased to work with Ocean Springs leaders to obtain this federal support," Senator Lott said. "Ocean Springs is really one of our state's top places to live. It has a bright future, but also a rich history that it is determined to preserve, and this grant program certainly seems tailor made for this project."
   The Save America's Treasures program provides federal funding to preserve and protect our nation's threatened cultural and historic treasures. The interior walls of the Community Center are adorned with the artwork of Mississippi artisan Walter Anderson. The murals have an estimated value between $8 and $10 million. 
   "The Ocean Springs Community Center adds to the character and charm of the town," said Senator Lott. "It is an integral part of the cultural fabric of Mississippi which we must both preserve and promote."
