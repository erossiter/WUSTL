SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES NEW MISSION, JOBS AT MERIDIAN AIR NATIONAL GUARD'S 186TH AIR WING
 Today U.S. Sen. Trent Lott said Meridian's 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Mississippi Air National Guard will receive two new missions and 180 jobs to replace the refueling mission slashed last year by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC).  
   "The BRAC process did put the 186th Air Refueling Wing on the BRAC list, but we knew immediately that there probably could be other opportunities there," Senator Lott said. "The late Congressman Sonny Montgomery, Congressman Chip Pickering, Senator Thad Cochran and I have worked for years to make sure we had the best possible facilities there. We had a lot to offer, and now we see that jobs are now actually being added there. It's a very good development for the Meridian area, for Mississippi and for our nation's defense." 
   Senator Lott said by 2011, the Air Refueling Wing will be replaced by two missions, including eight new "Joint Cargo Aircraft," now being developed, and the "1st Air Force Warfighting Headquarters," which will be responsible for providing command and control staffing to United States Northern Command, which plans, organizes and executes homeland defense and civil support missions. 
   The action will mean the unit actually adds jobs, going from 480 positions to support refueling to about 660 in support of both new missions.
