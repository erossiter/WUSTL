SEN. LOTT: $18 MILLION IN HURRICANE REPAIR FUNDS HEADED TO WAVELAND
  Federal funding totaling $18,619,709 is approved for use by the City of Waveland to repair its sewer collection system which was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.  
   "Waveland was one of the communities hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina, which caused unprecedented damage to the city's infrastructure," Senator Lott said. "As a result, the city's entire sewer system must be replaced. This grant will be a huge help to Waveland's public officials and its citizens as they restore homes, businesses and public facilities." 
   Senator Cochran stated: 
   "The Waveland community suffered catastrophic damage because of Hurricane Katrina. This grant will enable the City of Waveland to replace its sewer system, which is an essential part of rehabilitating the infrastructure of Waveland." 
   Hurricane Katrina's massive storm surge was primarily responsible for extensive damage to the city's sewage system below the CSX railroad track. Two independent damage assessments have deemed the damage beyond repair and recommend total replacement. 
   The funding will be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA and the State of Mississippi.
