SEN. LOTT HIGHLIGHTS MISSISSIPPI PROJECTS IN DEFENSE BILL
  The U.S. Senate by an overwhelming vote of 97-0 Friday morning passed its version of the fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Bill, Sen. Trent Lott said today.
   The bill, which now goes to conference with the House-passed DOD bill, could bring billions of dollars in new military programs for Mississippi, including procurement dollars for Mississippi's defense contractors, equipment, operations and maintenance to the state's military facilities, and research and development funding for universities in our state, Senator Lott said.  
   "Not only will these contracts have a significant impact on our military's future capability, but also on the future of our state's economy, as Mississippi recovers from Hurricane Katrina," Senator Lott said. "One of the best ways to get paychecks back into Mississippians' pockets is to get businesses and jobs going again. This bill impacts some of our state's largest public and private employers."
   Mississippi's funding covers the operation and maintenance of the state's military bases, weapons systems built at Mississippi's defense contractors, and youth oriented programs such as the Naval Sea Cadets. 
   Nationally, the Senate version of the DOD Appropriations Bill recommends $445 billion in military spending for fiscal year 2006.
   The bill specifically includes funds for construction of the Navy's DD(X) destroyers and LPD amphibious ships at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems' Ingalls Operations of Pascagoula. It also provides advance procurement money for the Navy's LHA(R) ship program. The LHA is a large deck ship designed to carry out amphibious operations and capable of supporting several helicopters and thousands of sailors and Marines. The bill funds the Arrow missile program, C-130J aircraft, ship propellers, and a broad range of research programs benefitting Mississippi universities and industry.
   The bill's highlights for Mississippi follow:
