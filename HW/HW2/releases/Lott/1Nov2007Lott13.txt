SEN. LOTT ISSUES STATEMENT ON BILOXI/OCEAN SPRINGS BRIDGE OPENING
  Statement of U.S. Senator Trent Lott 
  Regarding: Opening of the new Biloxi/Ocean Springs Bridge today.
   "This is a huge step forward in our recovery and rebuilding process. It's a beautiful bridge, a great design and the people that built it really deserve credit. It'll help speed our recovery and growth, and I'm glad we were able to get the federal funds that made this construction possible.
   "This is more than a compilation of concrete and steel comprising a physical structure. It's the embodiment of Mississippi's spirit, a "can-do" attitude that has become Mississippi's hallmark since Katrina. If anyone may doubt Mississippi's recovery, renewal and higher ascent, let them see this bridge and talk to the men and women who built it.
   "As this bridge will surely be long serving, it'll also be a testament to future generations of how Mississippians met and overcame our state's most daunting challenge."
