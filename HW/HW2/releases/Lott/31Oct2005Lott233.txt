SEN. LOTT PRAISES PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION OF JUDGE ALITO, JR. FOR U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi issued the following statement upon President Bush's nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "President Bush has hit a home run. Judge Alito is a highly qualified nominee. His credentials are superior. In terms of judicial philosophy, he has a well-documented understanding of the limited constitutional role of the courts, and he has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court. Judge Alito is no stranger to the Senate, having twice been unanimously confirmed by this body, first to become U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey and most recently to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. While a new confirmation process now must proceed, I enthusiastically look forward to supporting Judge Alito's nomination."
