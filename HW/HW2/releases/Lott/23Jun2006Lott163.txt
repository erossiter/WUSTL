DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION PASSES SENATE, INCLUDES MISSISSIPPI PROJECTS
  Sen. Trent Lott is pleased with the Defense Authorization Bill as passed by the Senate 96 to 0 late Thursday. Authorization bills are a basic outline for what projects Congress intends to fund next fiscal year, and to what extent. The amounts are subject to change, yet the Authorization Bill is a critical part of the defense budgeting process, and this year's authorization bodes well for Mississippi's defense contractors and military installations. It further authorizes a 2.2 percent pay raise for all the nation's uniformed personnel. 
   "When you consider both the military installations in Mississippi and the various military contracts ranging from manned and unmanned aircraft production to ship construction, this bill ensures that our nation's ongoing defense needs will be met, and it shows Mississippi-based military personnel and contractors will continue to play a pivotal role in America's defense." 
   Some highlights of the FY 2007 Defense Authorization Bill include:
   * DD(X) - $2.57 billion for the split procurement of two DD(X) ships. One of the lead ships will be built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in Pascagoula MS.
