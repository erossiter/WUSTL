  Senate Republican Whip Trent Lott issued the following statement regarding the passing of Sen. Craig Thomas: 
   "Craig Thomas brought to the Senate a down-to-earth Wyoming wisdom reflective of the unique part of the country he represented so well. He kept the Senate on point when we strayed from the big picture with his goodness, com mon sense and affable manner.
