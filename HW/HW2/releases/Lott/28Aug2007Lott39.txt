SEN. LOTT ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA
  Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi issued the following statement about Hurricane Katrina's second anniversary on August 29, 2007. 
   "Two years ago the worst natural disaster in American history ripped through the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina's impact did not stop at the shoreline. 
   "A wave of destruction continued for miles, but in the following months, a much stronger wave, a wave of hope washed across the nation. On this anniversary, I would like to join every Mississippian in thanking the volunteers for their tireless efforts continuing to this day.
   "Amazing things are happening in Mississippi, and more is still on the horizon. Communities have come together and the silver lining of Katrina's cloud is emerging as we continue our long-term recovery. We are not done yet, and much work lies ahead. But together there is no challenge too large for our resilient state."
