SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN: ALMOST $5 MILLION APPROVED FOR MARINE RESEARCH ALONG GULF COAST
  Federal funding totaling more than $4.6 million is approved for marine research along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Sens.  
 Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. The funds will be administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and include funds for oyster reef restoration as well as general funds for continued data collection on recreational and commercial fisheries in the Southeast. 
   "Maintaining our coastline's unique fisheries habitat is an important part of supporting our state's economic as well as our ecological vitality," Senator Lott said. "The Gulf State's Marine and Fisheries Commission and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources will utilize these two separate awards in our ongoing efforts to preserve and enhance the marine environment along the coast."
   $1,545,000 will be used by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources for a five-segment oyster reef restoration project that will map public oyster reefs and potential cultivation sites. The department will also develop a stewardship program to better educate and promote the active involvement of oyster harvesters and the industry in good harvest practices.
   A separate $3,117,000 award to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission will assist with that department's ongoing Cooperative Fisheries Statistics Program. The scope of work includes coordination and administrative support for more efficient and effective data collection and management of Southeastern commercial and recreational fisheries.
