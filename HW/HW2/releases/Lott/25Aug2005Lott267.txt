SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO ENHANCE MISSISSIPPI'S AIR SERVICE
  Federal funding totaling $750,000 is approved for use by Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport (GBIA) and its efforts to attract new air service, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today. The grant will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Small Community Air Service Development Program, part of more than 37 nationally distributed grants totaling almost $19 million being announced by Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta.
   "Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport has seen a dramatic increase in its air traffic during the past decade, and we want that to continue," Senator Lott, a former chairman of the U.S. Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, said. "I've worked aggressively to promote this facility and to improve it because GBIA is not only a gate for much of Mississippi's air travelers, but also a tool for South Mississippi's continuing economic development and job creation efforts."
   Specifically, the grant will be used to recruit and market new service to Cincinnati, Ohio, a major U.S. airline hub. The program helps communities address the challenges of local air service, including high fares and insufficient levels of service. The grants also can be used to offer financial incentives for air carriers, conduct studies to determine needs and promote local air service availability.
   "Last year, I held a field hearing of the Aviation Subcommittee in Gulfport, and airport officials from throughout our region voiced strong support for this type of federal incentive program," Senator Lott said. "This program has helped many communities greatly improve their transportation links to America and the world, which is important as Mississippi seeks more attention from national and international business investors and tourists."
