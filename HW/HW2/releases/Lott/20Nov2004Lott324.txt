OMNIBUS BILL INCLUDES HERITAGE AREA DESIGNATION FOR MISSISSIPPI COAST
  The Conference Report of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, expected to pass the U.S. Senate today, contains earmarks by Senator Lott, including funds for statewide projects including the University of Southern Mississippi's new center for economic development and language designating Mississippi's coastal counties as a national heritage area as well as funds to establish a multi-cultural leadership program at the University of Mississippi. 
   "As in each year's federal appropriations process, Mississippi's interests are well represented in this funding bill," Senator Lott said. "Most of these items have a direct impact on our education and transportation systems, which can lead to better job retention and job creation throughout our state. These initiatives will help Mississippi in our ongoing efforts to create a new economy with more opportunities available to our citizens." 
   This year's Omnibus Appropriations Measure is a consolidation of several annual appropriations bills, all of which have significant interests in our state.
   The following pages highlight some projects impacting Mississippi which Senator Lott specifically helped secure during development of the measure.
   * Mississippi Gulf Coast National Heritage Area Bill - This heretofore separate bill was included in the Omnibus package. It establishes a National Heritage Area to include the six counties in southern Mississippi located on the Gulf of Mexico and in the MS Coastal Plains (Peal River, Stone, George, Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson). The Department of Marine Resources will administer the program which will assist local communities and residents in preserving the unique cultural, historical, and natural resources of the area.

It will be a one-of-a-kind, state-of-the-art center of excellence.
