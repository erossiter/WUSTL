SEN. LOTT ACTS TO PROTECT HURRICANE RELIEF WORKERS FROM LAWSUITS
  Sen. Trent Lott joined with Texas Sen. John Cornyn to introduce the Good Samaritan Liability Improvement and Volunteer Encouragement Act of 2005, the "Give Act." The legislation protects hurricane recovery volunteers and relief workers from unreasonable liability.  
   "I thank Senator Cornyn for authoring this legislation, and I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor," Senator Lott said. "The United States is a generous nation, and we've seen ample evidence of that selfless giving since Katrina's deadly impact as people from throughout our nation are giving of their time and talents to help Katrina's victims. Yet, as these men and women who work to protect life and property need protection, too. In the aftermath of Katrina and with yet another hurricane headed for the Gulf, we must make sure our relief workers can operate unimpeded without fear of unreasonable liability."
   Specifically, the "Give Act" ensures that:
   * Disaster relief volunteers, generally, are not liable for harm caused in carrying out their volunteer activities in connection with disaster relief unless their act or omission constitutes willful, knowing or reckless misconduct; 
   * Medical and other professionals can volunteer their services for disaster relief services based on being licensed in their home state regardless of where the declared disaster occurred; 
   * A disaster relief volunteer is protected from liability even if the volunteer is not working for a specific non profit organization; 
   * Disaster relief volunteers can offer their services without subjecting their business partners or employers to liability; 
   * Disaster relief volunteers are protected from punitive damages and non-economic damages are apportioned according to percentage of fault; 
   * Non-profit organizations are not liable for the acts or omissions of their volunteers unless the organization has willfully disregarded or is recklessly indifferent to the safety of the individual harmed. 
   * All donors of goods or equipment - whether businesses, non-profits, or individuals - are not liable for harm caused by donating those items unless they acted with willful, knowing or reckless misconduct; and 
   * All litigation that proceeds despite any protections under this Act or under the Volunteer Protection Act requires a high level of specificity and documentation in the claim and a review by a judge that the claim raises - as a matter of law - a genuine issue of material fact.
