SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN: ALMOST $2 MILLION APPROVED FOR PERRY, HOLMES COUNTY WATER PROJECTS
  Federal funding totaling almost $2 million is approved for three separate water projects in Perry and Holmes counties, Sens.  
 Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.
   "These funds will help provide residents with better water service and give local officials a better foundation for economic development and job creation," Senator Lott said. "Rural water and waste water infrastructure improvements are a key part of making communities more attractive to residents and business alike."
   In Perry County, the Arlington Community Water Association will receive a federal loan totaling $309,600 and an accompanying federal grant of $891,200. This will help disconnect residents from unsafe private wells and reconnect to a community water system which is monitored by the Mississippi Department of Health for water quality, lessening the health risks to the impacted residents.
   In Holmes County, the South Holmes Water Association, Inc. will use a federal loan of $134,500 and an accompanying federal grant of $373,500 to construct a new well. The well is needed to meet supply demands and to give the system reserve capacity for growth. The improvements will immediately serve 20 new users.
   Also in Holmes County, the Town of Cruger will use an approved federal grant totaling $37,500 to construct a deeper well and improve drinking water. 
   All these federal funds will be administered via the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Rural Development.
