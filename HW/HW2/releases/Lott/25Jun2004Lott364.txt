ALMOST $4 MILLION RELEASED FOR UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER PROJECT
  Federal funding totaling $3,976,400 is approved for use by the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) in establishing its National Center for Excellence in Economic Development and Entrepreneurship, Sen.  
 Trent Lott, who earmarked these funds in a previous federal appropriations bill, said today.
   "This center will help enhance USM's already pioneering economic development curriculum, providing our state with one of the first such centers of its kind," Senator Lott said. "As Mississippi strives to sustain jobs and attract new economic investments, this center will give our state additional leverage in the competition for the high-skilled, good-paying jobs we seek to build Mississippi's 21st Century economy."
   Specifically these funds will help acquire the furnishings, fixtures and equipment, including technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems needed to support the National Center's programs in excess of items not provided in the building when delivered under the facility construction contract.
   The grant funds will be administered by the U.S. Department of Education and the University of Southern Mississippi through June 30, 2005.
