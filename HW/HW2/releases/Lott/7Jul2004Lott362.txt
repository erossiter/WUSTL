KEITH STARRETT NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIP, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI
  President George W. Bush has nominated the Honorable Keith Starrett to serve as U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, Sens.  
 Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. If confirmed by the Senate, Starrett will fill the seat once held by Judge Charles Pickering, who is serving a one-year term on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals following a recess appointment by President Bush.
   "I am very pleased the President has chosen to nominate Judge Keith Starrett," Senator Lott said. "Judge Starrett is an outstanding jurist who will interpret the law as written, respecting the U.S. Constitution and our nation's longstanding traditions of fair and impartial justice."
   Senator Cochran stated, "I am pleased the President has nominated Judge Keith Starrett to serve as a U.S. 
   District Court Judge. He is very well qualified and will reflect credit on the federal judiciary."
   Starrett, of McComb, currently serves as Circuit Court Judge for Mississippi's 14th Judicial District, which serves Pike, Lincoln and Walthall counties. His name was submitted to the President by Senators Lott and Cochran for Presidential consideration earlier this year. The Senate must now confirm Starrett's nomination. The U.S. District Court for Mississippi's Southern District has jurisdiction in 45 Mississippi counties.
