SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN: STENNIS SELECTED FOR NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER
  Today Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott congratulated the Stennis Space Center for being selected as the location for a new NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC). This Center will consolidate common services performed agency-wide in the areas of financial management, human resources, procurement and information technology. 
   According to NASA, the total value of the contract is approximately $230 million over a 10-year period.
   Senator Thad Cochran said, "The selection of the Stennis Space Center to lead NASA in its consolidation efforts reflects well upon the reputation the citizens of Mississippi have established as world class workers and service providers. I credit many factors, including the hard work of the staff at Stennis, as well as Governor Barbour and his economic development team, in earning this recognition."
   "Stennis Space Center is an engine for Mississippi's economic growth, and this decision by NASA is the latest example of how the unique facilities that NASA Stennis offers can work to attract various types of jobs," Senator Lott said. "From the most advanced aerospace manufacturing and testing to service style usages such as this one, Stennis Space Center is a multi-use facility that's a catalyst for job growth, and I am confident the states of Mississippi and Louisiana will fully support this very beneficial project."
   The purpose of the new Center will be to consolidate a variety of transactional and administrative activities that are currently split among the different Centers. NASA hopes this new Shared Services Center will serve as a common industry model for achieving cost and efficiency savings. NASA has projected annual savings at an estimated $6 million per year after stabilization of the new Center. 
   Stennis was selected from among six research and space centers that submitted proposals.
