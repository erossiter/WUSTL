SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $5 MILLION FOR KATRINA RECOVERY PROJECTS
  Today Federal reimbursements totaling more than $5 million have been approved for use in two Mississippi counties hit hard by Hurricane Katrina, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.  
   "It's very important that we continue seeking federal reimbursements for public entities which were damaged by the hurricane or which were charged with emergency services vital to the initial relief and recovery effort," Senator Lott said. "As Mississippi rebuilds, Senator Cochran and I will continue to persistently pursue every dollar of federal support for which Mississippi may be eligible." 
    Senator Cochran stated: "It is vitally important for the long-term economic recovery of our state that the federal government's commitment to rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina does not diminish. I am pleased that FEMA is releasing additional federal funding to help rebuild public buildings in Pearl River County and to reimburse Harrison County for emergency response services." 
   $2,704,005.00 (Federal Share) Pearl River County - Public Buildings. Hurricane Katrina produced strong wind and heavy rain causing extensive damage to public buildings and infrastructure in Pearl River County, Mississippi . Among the damaged structures was the Chimney Square administrative building in Picayune. High wind tore off over half of the center raised roof, which allowed rain water to intrude saturating the building elements and its contents. The original estimated cost to replace this building was $2,392,860. Of this, $1,899,610 was funded by FEMA in a previous project worksheet, with the rest covered by the applicant's insurance policy. This version to the grant was prepared to reflect a new scope of work which was devised based on a different building type, and new dimensions that were more similar to the original 35,186SF structure. 
  $2,446,720.00- Harrison County - Emergency Protective Measures. At the time of the Katrina disaster, Harrison County had an ordinance in place that made American Medical Response the lead provider of emergency response services. AMR provided ambulance service to Harrison County with between 16 and 37 units per day from August 27 through September 27, 2005, for a total of 861 unit days. The rate for their services is $160/hr for 24hrs/day, for each of the 861 unit days. This totals $3,306,240, of which, MEMA has provided $859,520 pursuant to a memorandum of agreement with the State. This $2,446,720 represents remainder of the costs for this emergency work eligible for FEMA reimbursement.
