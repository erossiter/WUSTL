SEN. LOTT OFFERS RESOLUTION PERMITTING SOLICITATION IN SENATE BUILDINGS FOR KATRINA VICTIMS
  The U.S. Senate Wednesday was expected to pass a resolution authored by Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, to permit the solicitation of donations in Senate buildings for the relief of victims of Hurricane Katrina. The measure is cosponsored by more than 50 Senators.  
   "Current Senate regulations prohibit any soliciting within Senate buildings," Lott said. "This resolution suspends these regulations for non-cash solicitations among our Senate family to make donations of food, clothing, medical supplies and other needed materials for victims of Hurricane Katrina. It's my hope that this measure will demonstrate the generosity of Senators and staff and will help ease the suffering of the millions of people along the Gulf Coast whose lives have been devastated by this unprecedented disaster." 
   Lott, whose introduction of the resolution was prompted by Senators' and Senate staffers' requests to help, called the temporary waiver of Senate rules "a modest effort at a time of great suffering. We need to do more right now and not allow inflexible rules to prevent us from helping our citizens at a time of crisis."
   The text of the resolution follows:
