SEN. LOTT OMNIBUS BILL MARKS $10 MILLION FOR SIX MISSISSIPPI COUNTIES THROUGH NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA DESIGNATION
  The final overall budget bill for fiscal year 2005, the Omnibus Appropriations Bill contains language designating Mississippi's six contiguous coastal counties as a National Heritage Area, giving communities in these counties additional leverage and incentive to preserve this region's unique natural and cultural heritage. 
   "This is a huge achievement for Mississippi's six coastal counties and the communities within them," Senator Lott said. "It makes this area eligible for increased federal funding to preserve our coast's rich natural and cultural heritage. From historic preservation initiatives to those impacting our natural environment, this is a very flexible program that will help us to maintain and enhance one of Mississippi's most attractive areas."
   The program will be administered by the Department of Marine Resources, and it makes available $10 million for heritage preservation in these six counties during a 10-year period, to be made available at the rate of $1 million each year.
   The designation was part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill passed this weekend by the U.S. Senate with a 65-30 vote. This measure is a compilation of several major budget bills which fund the federal government for the next year.
