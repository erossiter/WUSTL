SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Federal funding totaling almost $1.5 million is awarded to 18 Mississippi fire departments, Sens.  
 Trent Lott, Thad Cochran and Rep. Chip Pickering said today. The funds will be administered through the Department of Homeland Security's 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.
   "Providing quality fire and emergency response is a crucial part of any community's ability to promote public safety, economic development and competitive fire insurance rates," Senator Lott said. "The Assistance to Firefighters Program has certainly benefitted Mississippi, and I will continue to support these types of grant applications submitted by both volunteer and career firefighting operations within Mississippi."
   Congressman Pickering stated:
   "Our first responders must have the training and equipment necessary to fulfill their mission. Firefighters sacrifice for their communities and I commend their work and honor their service. I am proud to announce these resources"
