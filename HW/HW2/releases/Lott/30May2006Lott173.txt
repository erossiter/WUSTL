SEN. LOTT PRAISES SNOW, WELCOMES HENRY PAULSON
 Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi today praised outgoing Treasury Secretary John Snow as a bold leader who achieved pro-growth tax relief for the Bush Administration and presided over a strong economy that is the envy of the world. 
   "It was Secretary Snow who in December 2002 urged President Bush to embrace a groundbreaking pro-growth plan for zero tax on corporate dividends, rather than piecemeal approaches," Senator Lott said. "President Bush proposed that plan a month later in his State of the Union Address, and Secretary Snow worked to see it enacted into law just four months later. That critical legislation which also quadrupled small businesses expensing and lowered the cost of capital for all businesses purchasing equipment, has been the key to the sustained economic growth we've witnessed."
   Senator Lott, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee where he worked closely with the Treasury Secretary, credited Snow with providing the key impetus for the extension of the preferred rates on dividends and capital gains this month.
   "As a result of John Snow's shepherding good, pro-growth policies, the U.S. economy is back on the right track," Senator Lott said. "It rebounded from recession, terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina to create over 5.2 million jobs, cut unemployment below the average of the previous four decades and provide all Americans with a brighter future."
   Secretary Snow visited Mississippi in April, when at Senator Lott's invitation, he addressed students and faculty at the University of Mississippi in Oxford and taught classes in the Trent Lott Leadership Institute there.
   Senator Lott said that he has had the opportunity to meet Henry Paulson, President Bush's nominee to succeed Snow, on several occasions. "Hank's credentials are outstanding, and I look forward to his confirmation hearing before my committee," Senator Lott said.
