SEN. LOTT: $251,500 APPROVED FOR LEAKESVILLE WATER IMPROVEMENTS
 Federal funding totaling $251,500 has been approved to facilitate water system improvements in Greene County, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today. The funds will be administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Rural Development and will extend water service to 83 new users served by the Town of Leakesville.
   "Improving Mississippi's water and waste water systems is one of the most important tasks which face many of our rural communities," Senator Lott said. "Upgrades like these must be done in order to sustain public health and to provide the basic foundations for bringing new growth and jobs to our state."
   The grant will be used to extend service to an area outside the town limits for 30 service connections and eight miles of distribution lines supporting 83 new users north of Leakesville.
   The project allows for reasonable growth and provides a reliable source of drinking water.
