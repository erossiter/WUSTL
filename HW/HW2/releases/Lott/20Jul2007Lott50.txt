SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES 40 MISSISSIPPI COUNTIES ELIGIBLE FOR USDA DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns today designated 40 Mississippi counties eligible for Farm Services Administration (FSA) disaster assistance stemming from unseasonably freezing temperatures which took place April 6, through April 8, 2007, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said.  
   "I'm pleased Secretary Johanns acted on this request, and I know farmers in these areas will be happy to hear the news," Senator Lott said. "Mississippians are accustomed to dramatic weather and temperature fluctuations, but this year we've experienced notable extremes, and this assistance will help offset farm losses associated with the cold weather we had last spring." 
   Senator Cochran said: "Many farmers in Mississippi suffered significant yield and quality loss do to unseasonable freezing temperatures throughout April. I commend Governor Barbour on his prompt response to the needs of Mississippi agriculture." 
   The designation makes farm operators in the following counties eligible to apply for low interest emergency loans from FSA, providing they meet all eligibility requirements as outlined by the agency. 
   Alcorn Grenada Panola Tishomingo Benton Itawamba Pontotoc Tunica Bolivar Lafayette Prentiss Union Calhoun Lee Quitman Webster Chickasaw Lowndes Tallahatchie Winston Clay Marshall Tate Yalobusha DeSoto Monroe Tippah
