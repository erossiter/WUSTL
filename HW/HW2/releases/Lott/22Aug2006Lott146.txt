SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN ANNOUNCE $12 MILLION FOR ONGOING KATRINA RECOVERY EFFORT
 Federal funding totaling almost $12 million is slated for Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts in the Pascagoula and Biloxi/Gulfport area, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.
   "A year after Katrina, we have a long way to go, but Mississippi is making progress, and in many ways we're showing the nation how to recover from a natural disaster," Senator Lott said. "This funding will certainly be a welcome addition to the Gulf Coast's recovery effort, and I know this money will be well used, reestablishing vital public infrastructure that is essential to reviving these communities." 
   Senator Cochran stated:
   "As we prepare to observe the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, it is important that the citizens of the Mississippi Gulf Coast understand that the federal government is still committed to helping our state recover from the storm. The federal government's regular release of funding through grants such as these serves not only to repair physical damage but also important to sustain the momentum Mississippians have created in the long process of recovery."
