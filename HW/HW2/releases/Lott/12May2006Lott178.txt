SEN. LOTT ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEATH OF LONGTIME REP. MONTGOMERY
 Sen. Lott's statement regarding the may 12th death of longtime Rep. V. 'Sonny' Montgomery:  
  "'Mr. Veteran,' a 'Congressman's Congressman,' 'author of the Montgomery GI Bill' - there are so many honorable, revered names that have been given to Sonny throughout his long, productive and exemplary career, but I choose to call him 'friend.' He was an inspiration not just to other public servants, but to everyone he came across. He was a confidant of Presidents who had a down-home relationship with Mississippians that all of us who served with him tried to emulate. 
  "He could have run for a 'higher' office, and he had ample opportunities to advance his career. But he chose to exclusively serve the men and women who elected him for three decades as their Representative, with a zeal and determination that was as strong his last day in Congress as it was his first. 
  "Thirty years in Congress, ten years in the Mississippi State Legislature before that - Sonny served his constituents from the 1950s through the 1990s, leading us through dramatic and sometimes difficult change. Through it all, he provided steady leadership, homespun wisdom and sure statesmanship up to his last day. A half century is a long time to serve, but it's a mere prelude - a fraction of the time that he will be remembered, respected and loved. Rest in peace, friend."
