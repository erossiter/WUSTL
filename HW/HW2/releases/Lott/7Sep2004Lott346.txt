SEN. LOTT MOURNS DEMISE OF FORMER MISSISSIPPI GOV. FORDICE
  Statement of Sen. Trent Lott regarding the death of former Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice:
   "Our prayers are with the Fordice family as all Mississippians join them in mourning the loss of former Governor Kirk Fordice.
   He was a leader who helped Mississippi make unprecedented and dramatic strides toward improvement. 
   As Mississippi's first Republican governor since Reconstruction and the first in our time to serve a second term, he helped pave the way for a true two-party system in our state. 
   Kirk Fordice's legacy will always be one of strength, accomplishment and steadfast determination."
