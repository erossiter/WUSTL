SEN. LOTT: BILOXI CLEARED TO RECEIVE $7.8 MILLION EMERGENCY NATURAL DISASTER GRANT
  Today, the City of Biloxi was cleared to receive a $7.8 million emergency federal grant to help its public housing recovery effort following Hurricane Katrina, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said. Senator Lott worked personally with officials at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to secure the funding. 
   "This is yet another very important step in the Gulf Coast's recovery and rebuilding effort," Senator Lott said. "It is critical that the city of Biloxi make repairs to its public housing infrastructure and get people back into decent, long-term housing."
   The grant is intended for immediate preservation work, including debris removal, roof repair and other physical needs.
   "I will continue working with Mayor Holloway on Biloxi's requests, as well as other local and state officials throughout the disaster area," Senator Lott continued. "The needs are still great, but by working together I am confident that we will continue finding sources of funding and all other resources needed to rebuild Mississippi."
