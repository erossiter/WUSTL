SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $10 MILLION TO IMPROVE GULFPORT/BILOXI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Federal funding totaling more than $10 million is approved for use at Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. The funding is composed of two separate awards which will be administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation.  
   "Air traffic at Gulfport/Biloxi International Airport has been steadily increasing for more than a decade, and as we recover from Hurricane Katrina this facility's importance is perhaps greater than ever," Senator Lott said. "I'll continue working to improve this facility, particularly as a major terminal renovation and expansion is currently underway."
   Senator Cochran stated:
   The importance of the Gulfport-Biloxi Airport to the Gulf Coast and, in particular, to our hurricane recovery efforts cannot be overstated. I am pleased that we have been able to provide the funding necessary to make the Gulfport-Biloxi airport a leader in commercial air service. This grant award will allow the airport to be expanded and upgraded to meet the growing needs of travelers to and from Mississippi's Coast." 
   Specifically, today's funding breaks down as follows:
   $5,302,915 to conduct an underground drainage study; expand the terminal building and widen a taxiway;
   $4,750,000 to acquire an easement for noise compatibility. This funding will help purchase easements and sound proof 60 homes and 105 apartment units in a specified area around the airport. The project is expected to reduce interior noise exposure impacting almost 400 residents.
