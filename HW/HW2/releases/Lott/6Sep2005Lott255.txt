SEN. LOTT: NAVY HOSPITAL SHIP ?COMFORT' TO ARRIVE ON MISSISSIPPI COAST THIS WEEK
  Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi Tuesday said he has been notified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that some 300 travel trailers and 100 mobile homes now staged in Selma, Alabama, are being moved to South Mississippi for Hurricane Katrina victims who have lost their homes. 
   Lott said he has been advised that FEMA plans to start processing applicants for the temporary homes as early as Wednesday, September 7.
   The announcement follows the Senator's Monday appeal to President Bush to authorize the immediate transport of available trailers staged outside the Katrina disaster area.
   "Mississippians who have been without roofs over their heads for more than a week are grateful to the President, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) and FEMA that this first installment of shelter is on the way, and we're hopeful that a much larger wave will be close behind," Lott said.
