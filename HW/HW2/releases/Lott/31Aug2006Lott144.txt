SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $300 MILLION NAVY CONTRACT FOR MISSISSIPPI'S LARGEST EMPLOYER
 Today the U.S. Navy Awarded Northrop Grumman Ship Systems a $95.8 million contract for designing the Navy's next generation destroyer, DDG 1000, formerly called the DD(X), Sen. Trent Lott said.  
   "This is another huge step forward for the DDG 1000 program and for America's future at sea," Senator Lott said. "This is a landmark ship that's poised to begin a new chapter in naval technology and tactics. I'm pleased the Navy has shown commitment to the DDG 1000 program and has again bestowed its confidence in the employees of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems at Pascagoula and Gulfport."
   The contract runs through September 2007, and when fully funded it will total more than $307 million by 2013.
   Senator Lott continues to be one of the groundbreaking DDG 1000's strongest advocates calling the stealthy ultra-modern vessel an essential project for maintaining not only America's edge at sea but to also ensure America remains a maritime nation with a skilled industrial base capable of constructing the world's best surface combat fleet.
   "This is a ship that can change naval warfare and technology as we know it," Senator Lott continued. "Every few decades there is a class of ships that leads the way, setting new standards and rendering older conventions and designs obsolete. DDG 1000 is that ship for our time, and it is without question the world's first truly 21st Century surface combatant.
   "As we continue to fight terrorists and face global challenges requiring more of our Navy, I will continue working steadfastly to ensure that DDG 1000 is much more than a 'technology demonstrator,' and that it is fully funded taking its rightful place among our fleet deterring enemies and defending freedom."
