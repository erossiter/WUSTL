SEN. LOTT: ABOUT $1.6 MILLION SLATED FOR STATE VETERANS' HOME IN JACKSON
 Today, Sen. Trent Lott praised the awarding of federal grant funding totaling up to $1,671,429 or 65 percent of funds needed for various improvements to the Mississippi State Veterans' Home in Jackson. 
   "I am pleased the Bush Administration has acted to provide a significant federal package in support of this effort," Senator Lott said. "Our nation's veterans are owed a tremendous debt by us all, and we should strive to provide them with the best care and facilities that our nation can provide."
   The funds will be used for general renovations, and will be administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The grant can cover up to 65 of the project total, and could vary with actual construction costs.
