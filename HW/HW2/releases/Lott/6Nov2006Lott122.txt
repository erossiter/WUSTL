SEN. LOTT: $1.4 BILLION NAVY CONTRACT MODIFICATION AWARDED TO NORTHROP GRUMMAN INGALLS OPERATIONS
 Today the United States Navy awarded a $1,454,286,932 contract modification calling for construction of another Amphibious Transport Dock Ship, LPD 24 and for materials and labor to support LPD 25, Sen. Trent Lott said. 
   "In the Senate I've been a champion of advanced procurement to support ongoing upgrades and modernization efforts for our fleet," Senator Lott said. "As we retire ships, we must make sure that our replacement rate is robust and capable of meeting the global deployment needs presented by the War on Terror."
   The work will be performed at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls Operations in Pascagoula, Mississippi and at the company's Avondale yard in New Orleans, Louisiana.
   "Obviously, this contract is very important for our region as thousands of skilled and dedicated shipyard workers are depending on good jobs as we recover from Hurricane Katrina," Senator Lott continued. "But, even beyond benefitting Mississippi's largest employer, this type of investment is good for America, too. Shipbuilding is an industry in which America must maintain leadership because it is directly linked to our ability to protect America. It's an vital domestic industrial capacity on which our long-term security heavily depends."
   The nine ships in this class are crucial to the Navy's efforts to project power globally and onto specific shores. The class replaces more than 40 ships providing the Navy and Marines with forward-projection capabilities that meet the mobile, fast deployment requirements demanded by 21st century military doctrine.
   Each ship can carry 800 troops as well as vehicles that may include various types of landing craft or helicopters and vertical take-off aircraft. The ships are expected to serve almost 50 years.
