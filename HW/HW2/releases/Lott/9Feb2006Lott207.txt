SEN. LOTT: $6 MILLION FOR PASS CHRISTIAN, WAVELAND
  Federal funding totaling almost $6 million is approved for post-hurricane recovery efforts in the Pass Christian and Waveland communities, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. The funds will be used to repair school facilities and remove debris. 
   "These communities were ground-zero for Hurricane Katrina, and certainly ever dollar of this package is needed to help repair basic public infrastructure in these communities," Senator Lott said. "We've got a long way to go, and a lot more work to do, but certainly the residents of these areas have shown the nation their enduring strength, and I am confident this funding will be well spent."
   Senator Cochran stated:
   "The Cities of Waveland and Pass Christian suffered substantial damage from Hurricane Katrina. This funding will provide relief to the ongoing efforts to clear roads, bridges, and railways of the debris that is hampering recovery efforts."
   The funding breakdown is as follows:
   * $1,641,636 to demolish and rebuild the Pass Christian School District maintenance facility to pre-disaster design, capacity and function. Federal funding is 75 percent of total project cost with the State of Mississippi providing the remainder.
   * $4,245,953 to the City of Waveland for debris removal. This is in addition to $3,650,000 previously funded bringing the total awarded to the city to $7,895,953.
   The funds will be administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and distributed through the state government to the specified local entities.
