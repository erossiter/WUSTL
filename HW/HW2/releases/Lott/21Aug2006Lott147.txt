   "Clinton was an outstanding, charismatic leader and tireless advocate for the 3,500 students at Alcorn State as well as for the seven other historically black colleges and universities in Mississippi . I valued our relationship and mutual commitment to make Alcorn State a world class institution by bringing additional federal funding and opportunities to the university and by making physical improvements at this proud institution. 
   "Working together we instituted an Alcorn State intern program in the Senate Majority Leader's office that brought many incredible Alcorn scholars to Washington and helped launch their careers. I regularly sought Clinton's counsel on jobs and the importance of education in Mississippi 's being able to attract businesses to our state and preparing the work force that makes those businesses successful. "Clinton was a Mississippi treasure, and we shall miss him terribly."
