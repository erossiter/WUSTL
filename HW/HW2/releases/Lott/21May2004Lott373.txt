SEN. LOTT: $4.5 MILLION APPROVED FOR WEST JACKSON COUNTY WATER IMPROVEMENTS
  Federal funding totaling $4,525,300 is approved for water system improvements in the West Jackson County Utility District which will extend community water service to almost 1,000 residents, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   "This loan will help ensure that Jackson County's residential and economic growth continues," Senator Lott said. "Rural water and waste water projects help communities develop by sustaining good public health and by promoting jobcreation."
   The funds will be used by the district to help construct a distribution system, a 500 gallon-per-minute well and a 100,000-gallon elevated water storage tank. The project will provide potable water to an area which is not served by a public or community water supply extending water service to 970 residents.
   The funds will be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of Rural Development.
   "Our agency was delighted to work with Senator Lott to secure these funds," USDA Rural Development State Director Nick Walters said. "Providing potable water for rural Mississippi is an important part of our work."
