SEN. LOTT LAUDS STENNIS VISITOR CENTER UNVEILING
  Sen. Lott praised today's first public glimpse of what will become a major new tourist attraction along the I-10 corridor.  
 INFINITY, will be an entirely new $35 million visitors center near NASA's Stennis Space Center showcasing research relating to the Earth, space and oceans, much of which takes place at NASA Stennis.
   "This facility is expected to draw more than 250,000 visitors annually, providing an enjoyable and educational experience for people of all ages," Senator Lott said. "I was pleased to help secure funds toward this project in the federal budget, and I look forward to its scheduled completion in 2007."
   The current Stennis Visitors Center, the "StenniSphere," is located within the space center's campus. The new I-10 site near the Mississippi-Louisiana border will be more accessible by the large numbers of travelers along the Gulf Coast. 
   The project's concept and design results from a public/private partnership between NASA and MAST, Inc., a nonprofit organization. MAST, an acronym for "Mississippi Attraction for Science and Technology," was formed in 2001 by a group of area business leaders to develop and promote the project.
   Since that time, Senator Lott has worked to secure legislative language that enables Stennis Space Center to use timber sale revenues toward the project. Additionally, Senator Lott helped secure $2.7 million in the fiscal year 2003 NASA budget appropriations for the visitors' center relocation and expansion, followed by another $1 million in fiscal year 2004.
   MAST, Inc. is raising money with public and private gifts from business, foundations and other interested parties. Site preparation is expected to begin later this summer.
