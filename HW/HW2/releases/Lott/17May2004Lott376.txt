SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $103,733 FOR BULLETPROOF VESTS
  Today Rep. Chip Pickering announced $103,733 in Department of Justice funds for Mississippi's Third Congressional District. The awards will go to twenty-three law enforcement agencies to assist the purchase of bulletproof vests.  
   "Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to keep our families and communities safe, and they should be properly equipped and protected," Pickering said. "I'm glad these funds will go toward providing more bulletproof vests to keep these police officers safe." 
   Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott joined in the statewide announcement that provided over $350,000 for 75 jurisdictions across the state. Senator Cochran said, "I am very pleased that our state has received this funding to help protect first responders as they provide emergency assistance for the citizens of Mississippi." 
   "This funding will give our law enforcement personnel more peace of mind as they do their essential and very difficult job," Senator Lott said. "These vests can help save lives and enable our law enforcement professionals to operate with the latest in personal protection equipment." 
   Each third district award provides half of the requested amount, with the remainder costs to come from state, local or private funding.
