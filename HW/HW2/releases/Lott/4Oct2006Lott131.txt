SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION FOR MISSISSIPPI FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Federal funding totaling almost $3 million is approved for use by more than 23 volunteer and full-time fire departments throughout Mississippi, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. 
   "These grants are important to ensure Mississippians have good fire protection and competitive fire insurance rates," Senator Lott said. "Our firefighters do more than combat typical house fires. They are first responders who're called upon to perform many intense emergency functions. I've been pleased to support these requests, and I'll continue to support federal initiatives which enhance both small and large fire departments across our state."
   Senator Cochran stated:
   "I am pleased that twenty three of Mississippi 's fire departments are receiving these grants. They provide an invaluable service to the communities that they serve, and these funds will help them to further improve safety, lower response time, and save lives."
   The funding will be administered through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Program. The awards may be used for a variety of improvement measures including purchasing new fire department vehicles and personal protective gear for firefighters.
