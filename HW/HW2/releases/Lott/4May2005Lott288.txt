SEN. LOTT: PRESIDENT SHOWS 'COURAGE, LEADERSHIP' WITH SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSAL
  Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi today praised President Bush for showing "courage and leadership" in his proposal to reform the Social Security retirement system. 
   Lott's comments followed President Bush's visit Tuesday to Canton, Mississippi, where Bush held a town hall meeting with Mississippians to get their views on the future of the Social Security program.
   "This is a huge undertaking," Lott said. "We've got to do something to make sure Social Security is preserved and protected."
   Lott said that the Congress will "eventually" take action on a balanced Social Security reform package which hasn't yet taken shape, adding that "I am prepared to cast a tough vote."
   "We've got to be prepared to deal honestly in how inflation and benefit increases are calculated," Lott said about the substance of the reform package which will emerge from the Senate Finance Committee on which he sits. "We've got to deal with the reality that people are living longer. We've got to do something to ensure that the investment of young people like my children and grandchildren will be there when they retire. And we must deal with all these factors in a combination."
