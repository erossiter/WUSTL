SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $191 MILLION CONTRACT FOR MISSISSIPPI SHIPYARD
  Today the United States Navy awarded Northrop Grumman Ship Systems a $191,119,037 contract modification to the existing contract calling for construction of the DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class next-generation destroyer.  
   "This program, previously called DD(X), is one of the most forward thinking, technologically advanced projects in shipbuilding history," Senator Lott said. "It will usher in a new generation of naval vessels designed around stealth and mobility, ensuring that the U.S. Navy remains the world's strongest and most advanced sea borne force, able to project power and protect American interests wherever needed." 
   Specifically, this contract provides for production planning, labor, logistics support, and engineering to support detail design and construction of DDG 1000. 
   "This contract reflects our Navy's unwavering commitment to design and build the DDG 1000 and remain at the forefront of capability and innovation," Senator Lott continued. "I am delighted that Mississippians continue our state's strong shipbuilding tradition, and I am confident that Pascagoula's Northrop Grumman employees will deliver the world's best destroyer to the world's best navy."
