SEN. LOTT: $2.7 MILLION APPROVED FOR WATER PROJECTS IN JONES, MONROE COUNTIES
  Federal funding totaling more than $2.7 million is approved for separate water projects in Jones and Monroe counties, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   "These projects will improve the quality-of-life for residents in these areas, and the funds will provide local officials additional leverage in economic development and job creation efforts," Senator Lott said.
   In Ellisville, the city will use a federal loan of $1,216,200 and an accompanying grant of $795,300 to make repairs to the system that will increase its capacity. Funds will be used to repair the elevated tanks, wells and sewage lagoon. This project will allow for reasonable growth of the system.
   In Monroe County, a federal loan of $732,000 to the Hamilton Water District, Inc. will be used to rework the treatment plant for one of two systems. The systems are not adequate during peak loading. The district will also construct a 200 gallon-per-minute well and a water main to connect standpipe with the elevated tank for system number two.
   Funds for both projects will be administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural Development.
