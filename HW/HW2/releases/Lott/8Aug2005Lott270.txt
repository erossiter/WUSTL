GOOD GRAZING
  My wife Tricia and I keep goats at our place near Jackson. As many Mississippians know, goats are affectionate, thrifty, hardworking animals. If you provide a goat with water and a good home, the goat will return the favor, grazing on your property, eating it clean of any pesky weeds, vines and briers.  
   Our economy is kind of like that, too. If government understands and respects taxpayers, tries to be good and fair to them, if it creates a welcome home for entrepreneurship, the rewards can be many. Those sticky briers of unemployment, inflation and skyrocketing interest rates are easily devoured by busy workers, free-spending consumers and profitable businesses.
   In the Senate, we've recently passed a number of bills aimed at giving businesses and taxpayers plenty on which to graze, making them feel more at home in America, encouraging the private sector to reinvest and create jobs, and gobbling up vines bad for the economy before they can grow. 
   Payroll employment in June increased by 146,000 jobs nationwide, capping 25 consecutive months of gains, totaling 3.7 million new jobs. Though unemployment is just five percent, we want to get that number even lower and have been working on several new bills to complement the President's continued commitment to tax relief.
   * The energy bill passed by Congress last month , by no means perfect, is America's first national energy policy. It caps a six-year effort by the Senate to pass a comprehensive energy plan that will help secure our economy by making America less dependent on foreign oil and by encouraging more domestic energy production.
   * CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, will open new markets to American goods, reducing heavy tariffs, giving American farmers and manufacturers new leverage in the lucrative Central American market.
   * The budget, passed earlier this year, promotes economic growth by cutting taxes even more, keeping us on track to halve America's deficit by 2009.
   * Class action reform, another recent legislative accomplishment, will help curtail frivolous lawsuits which threaten American jobs.
   * Finally, bankruptcy reform, recently signed into law following Congressional passage, will help ensure that folks with good credit who pay their bills, no longer will have to subsidize those who don't with higher interest payments.
   * The Highway Bill, which I co-authored and which was passed by Congress last month, could be the biggest economic impetus yet. In addition to making our roads safer, it will encourage the creation of millions of additional construction jobs, as well as jobs associated with new businesses which depend on highways as America's veins of commerce and growth.
   Some liberals in Washington don't always value the taxpaying American worker or entrepreneur, and they're usually working against bills like these. When they look at small businessmen and women in middle America or at taxpaying workers, they don't see American businesses and employees as assets of America but as adversaries of government. Instead of allowing America's entrepreneurs to graze on fertile grounds, they try to hem them in with high taxes, over-regulation and unnecessary bureaucratic burdens. That's when the weeds, briers and vines take over.
   The Washington beltway crowd would do well to learn a lesson from nature that applies to animals and humans alike: When people are treated right, when government gives America's workers and businesses more on which to graze, Americans can more easily keep the scourge of unemployment, inflation and high interest rates at bay with their incredible appetite for hard work, ingenuity and determination.
