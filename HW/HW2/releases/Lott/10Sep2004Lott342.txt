SENS. LOTT, COCHRAN: $2.1 MILLION APPROVED FOR INTERSTATE-69 PROJECT
  Federal funding totaling $2,136,122 is approved for use toward construction of I-69, a new interstate that will stretch from Canada to Mexico, traversing the Mississippi Delta in the process, Sens.  
 Trent Lott and Thad Cochran announced today.
   "This project has the capacity to transform the Mississippi Delta, bringing more jobs and hope to this struggling region and connecting the American heartland with two of America's largest trading partners," Senator Lott said. "I-69 will put the Delta in the cross hairs of commercial traffic and economic activity that can lead to an infusion of investment and jobs."
   The grant will be administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and will help fund work that will bring the existing State Route 304 to interstate standards, enabling this segment to be eventually incorporated into a complete I-69.
   "Mississippi is the first state to begin earnest construction on I-69, and I will continue working within the federal budgetary process to fully fund this very important project," Senator Lott continued. "Good transportation systems give local, state and federal leaders better leverage in attracting new industries. With such tremendous potential for our state and nation, I-69 must remain one of Mississippi's top transportation priorities."
