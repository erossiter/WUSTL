SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES FIRST DIRECT AIR SERVICE BETWEEN MISSISSIPPI, NEW YORK METRO AREA
  Today, U.S. Sen. Trent Lott - who serves on the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee - and Continental Airlines jointly announced what will be the first nonstop commercial air service between the State of Mississippi and the New York City metropolitan area.  
   The flight between Jackson/Evers International Airport and Continental's New York hub at Newark, NJ will commence in September. Senator Lott and the Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce worked with the airline to establish the service. 
   "This will give Mississippians a direct link to our nation's business center and one of America's top tourist destinations," Senator Lott said. "It'll also enable visitors and investors to better access Mississippi and see firsthand the many opportunities for growth our state now provides." 
   The first daily flight from Jackson will take off September 6th aboard a 50- passenger regional jet operated by ExpressJet, Continental's regional partner. 
   Customers may now contact Continental Airlines for reservations.
