SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $6.1 MILLION FOR TUNICA AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Federal funding totaling more than $6.1 million is approved for use at Tunica Municipal Airport, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.  
   Senator Lott, who serves as ranking member of the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, said the grant will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and will help extend a runway and taxiway. 
   "We've worked very hard to improve Tunica Municipal Airport in order to help facilitate and compliment the rapid economic growth going on in this area," Senator Lott said. "This is an important facility that serves Tunica and the greater Memphis area in a variety of ways, and we'll continue working to ensure that Tunica's airport is equipped to handle a broad array of aircraft." 
   The airport is currently planning a 1,500-foot runway extension, as well as a 35-foot taxiway extension.
