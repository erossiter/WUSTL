SEN. LOTT INTRODUCES 'HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE NONCOVERAGE DISCLOSURE ACT'
  A bill requiring insurers to fully disclose property insurance coverage and noncoverage in plain language contained on the front page of each homeowner's policy was introduced in the U.S. Senate Thursday night by U.S. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
   "Insurance policies are notoriously hard to read and understand because they're primarily written in complex legalese," Senator Lott said. "While insurance is a legal contract, it also is a product purchased by consumers. That's why I believe every insurer should include a plain-English description of a homeowner's policy, prominently displayed on the policy's first page."
   Senator Lott's bill will require this basic description be contained in a "noncoverage disclosure" box stating in bold font, twice the size of the body of the policy's text, all conditions, exclusions and other limitations pertaining to the individual policy's coverage.
   The bill further requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce this disclosure requirement, and it establishes penalties for insurers who fail to comply through the FTC's existing laws governing unfair or deceptive practices.
   Senator Lott contends his bill would save money and time associated with insurance policy disputes.
   "Consumer groups have estimated a provision like this could have saved consumers anywhere from $55 billion to $65 billion in Hurricane Katrina's aftermath," Senator Lott said. "Having a clear, concise description of every policy serves the best interest of consumers, insurers and taxpayers."
