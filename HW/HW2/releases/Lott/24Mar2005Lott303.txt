SEN. LOTT: BAE DEFENSE, HATTIESBURG TO HELP FULFILL $834 MILLION ARMY CONTRACT
  Two Mississippi defense contractors have been impacted by separate federal actions today, Sen. Trent Lott said.
   "Mississippi's role in America's defense is growing," Senator Lott said. "From tailoring uniforms for our military to the construction of ships, aircraft, sophisticated electronics and major battlefield pieces, Mississippians are building freedom's arsenal in many different ways. Perhaps no state has such a varied defense-related job base ranging from staple items to high-tech systems which will serve our military for decades." 
   Today the U.S. Army awarded BAE Defense Systems, a British company which operates a howitzer assembly facility in Hattiesburg, with a 4-year, $ 834 million contract for the production of M777A1 lightweight howitzers.
   This state-of-the-art artillery piece was designed and developed by BAE in the United Kingdom and is a joint project between the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to replace the M198 towed howitzer. It's the first ground combat system to make extensive use of titanium, reducing the weight of the gun by 7,000 pounds.
   Workers at BAE, Hattiesburg will share the work with BAE facilities in six other U.S. states and the United Kingdom. The estimated contract completion date is March, 30, 2009
   In a separate award from the United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural Development, has awarded the Singing River Electric Power Association with a $450,000 economic development loan. This will help construct a facility to be leased by Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems for the production of the "Fire Scout" Unmanned helicopter. Senator Lott and Northrop Grumman officials, as well as local officials announced this project last year, and last month announced that the facility, when complete, will also construct the company's "Global Hawk" unmanned, fixed-wing aircraft.
