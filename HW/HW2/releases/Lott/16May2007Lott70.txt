SEN. LOTT: WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT BILL CONTAINS $50 MILLION FOR MISSISSIPPI PROJECTS
  As passed by the Senate today in a 94 to 4 vote, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA ab) contains out $50 million for water projects impacting Mississippi, Sen. Trent Lott said.  
   The measure includes language that will increase oyster bedding off the Mississippi Gulf Coast and improve water and waste water systems in DeSoto, Jackson and Alcorn counties. 
   "As this bill continues through the legislative process, I'll work to make sure these projects are included in the final conference report, and we hope to add additional projects, specifically to address Jackson area flood control," Senator Lott said. 
   The bill includes a historic agreement on the Bonne Carre Freshwater Diversion Project, which Senator Lott has sought for more than two decades. Senator Lott worked with Louisiana's Senators to craft language providing that more freshwater from the Mississippi River be introduced into the Western Mississippi Sound, ensuring better spawning grounds for Gulf oysters. 
   "This is good news for so many oystermen in Louisiana and Mississippi whose livelihoods depend on having fertile oyster beds in the Mississippi Sound," Senator Lott continued. "This will be very helpful to an important Gulf industry as our coastal states recover from Hurricane Katrina." 
   * E Environmental Infrastructure Projects - This is about $50 million in new authorizations for water supply and wastewater projects across the state. 
   * DeSoto County Regional Wastewater Program, Mississippi - Increases authorized funding level for this program to $75,000,000 (from $55,000,000). 
   * Jackson County, Mississippi - This is an ongoing county-wide water infrastructure project. This bill modifies Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to increase non-Federal Credit limit to $9,000,000 and increases authorized funding level to $32,500,000 (from $20,000,000). 
   * Section 592 program - Increases authorized funding level to $110,000,000 from ($100,000,000). This is a fund set aside for water projects in various Mississippi communities, administered though the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Vicksburg. 
   * Alcorn County Surface Water Program - Authorizes program for funding level of $7,500,000 (new authorization). This is for developing a dependable water supply for the City of Corinth and Alcorn county. 
   * Pearl River Basin Mississippi (Jackson Area Flood Control) - Increases authority to design and construct a comprehensive flood control plan, like the Jackson area's LeFleur Lakes plan. This section is in the House passed bill, but is not in the bill the Senate passed today. Including this in the final WRDA bill will be a high priority for Senator Lott as a final bill is crafted in conference.
