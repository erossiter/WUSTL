SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $10 MILLION FOR MISSISSIPPI UNIVERSITIES
  Federal disaster reimbursement funding totaling more than $10.6 million is approved for use by Mississippi institutions of higher learning damaged by Hurricane Katrina, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.  
   "This is part of a $30 million Katrina recovery supplemental package that our state's delegation helped pass, and it will be welcome news at our colleges and universities still recovering from the storm" Senator Lott said. "Mississippi's campuses, particularly those on the Coast and in South Mississippi, were hit very hard by Hurricane Katrina, and I'm pleased our state will be getting a fair share of these funds." 
   Senator Cochran stated: 
   "These emergency funds will help colleges and universities on the Mississippi Coast recover 
   from damages and expenses incurred during immediate recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi's universities worked hard to reopen as quickly as possible after the hurricane and I am glad these funds have been made available to help them recover some of the losses they suffered." 
   The funding will be administered through the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education. Allocations are based on an institution's relative share of expenses and lost tuition. The department collected information from the schools on tuition revenue lost in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 as well as any expected costs associated with hurricanes Katrina or Rita. 
   The maximum grant amount per school is $6 million. In Mississippi the funding will be distributed as follows: 
   Jones Junior College $64,438 
   Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College $1,077,174 
   Mississippi State University $541,249 
   Pearl River Community College $2,024,051 
   University of Southern Mississippi $6,000,000 
   William Carey College $969,469
