SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $94 MILLION FOR NORTHROP GRUMMAN INGALLS SHIPBUILDING CONTRACT
  The U.S. Navy has awarded a $93.8 million contract modification to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems of Pascagoula, Mississippi, Sen. Trent Lott said today. The modification is to an existing contract for the construction of the LHA (R), also known as LHA-6 -- an amphibious carrier for U.S. Marine personnel and equipment. 
   "As America begins to reemphasize and rebuild our Navy, the employees of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems will certainly play a pivotal role," Senator Lott said. "This contract, and the options it contains, demonstrates the Navy and Marine Corps' continued confidence in the men and women of Ingalls, and I am confident that this award will significantly contribute to Mississippi's economy and to our nation's long-term security."
   The LHA (R) is much like its predecessor at the yard, LHD 8. However, LHA (R) will contain a larger hanger bay and carry more jet fuel and cargo.
   "The War on Terror has reminded us how important it is to have very nimble global force projection capability," Senator Lott continued. "Since the beginning of our nation, the U.S. Marine Corps has personified this capability, and these amphibious assault ships will ensure that our Marines continue to have the best equipment to execute that enduring mission."
   Specifically, this contract will initiate engineering and detail design for the ship and procure additional material in support of ship construction. The work will be entirely performed at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Operations in Pascagoula, and the work is expected to be complete by December 2006.
