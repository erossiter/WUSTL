SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR REPAIRS TO GULFPORT/BILOXI REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Federal funding totaling $950,000 is approved for use at Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   \"Getting this airport back to pre-Katrina status is very important to our state's recovery effort,\" Senator Lott said. \"This airport and the Jackson International Airport are our state's busiest airport facilities, serving as the gateway for passengers and commerce to our state. I know this money can be put to use immediately, and I'll continue working to secure more airport repair funding to address similar needs throughout Mississippi.\"
   Specifically, this package will fund measures to mitigate losses associated with the hurricane. The terminal apron was being expanded prior to Hurricane Katrina. As a result of the state of construction before the storm hit, there is a need to redo portions of work that was done as part of the expansion.
   The grant will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration.
