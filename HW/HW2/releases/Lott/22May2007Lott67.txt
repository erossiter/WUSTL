SENATE REPUBLICAN WHIP LOTT COMMENTS ON IRAQ EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
  Sen. Lott: Just a word.  
   I think we're close to getting a result that we've been seeking for 106 days, as Senator McConnell indicated. That is funds for the troops without timelines that would try to dictate military actions based on some specific date. 
   Now, that's a very important achievement. 
   And we also need to get it done this week. We need the certainty that the funds will be there to provide the training, the readiness, the equipment, that our men and women in uniform need. 
   Those are very important things that we could accomplish this week, and hopefully we will. 
   I do want to emphasize, with regard to the Warner language, that there's broad support for benchmarks. We've been talking about that for quite some time. The President has indicated he thinks benchmarks can be beneficial. 
   And for Congress to get reports about what's happening, shouldn't we be getting that anyway? And I think we will. 
   I hope that Senator Reid and others will help us get this to a conclusion in the next couple of days. 
   Of course, there are other factors. But I think right now it appears that we could achieve what we've wanted all along, and that's to get the funds for the troops without timelines.
