SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $400,000 TO HELP OBTAIN DIRECT FLIGHT BETWEEN JACKSON, NEW YORK CITY
  Federal funding totaling $400,000 is approved for the city of Jackson's efforts to secure air passenger service between Jackson and New York City, Sens. Trent Lott, Thad Cochran and Rep. Chip Pickering said today.  
   The funding is part of almost $10 million being awarded to local airports and governments nationwide today under the U.S. Department of Transportation's Small Community Air Service Development Program, specifically designed for helping rural and non-hub air passenger markets enhance service.
   "We've made some dramatic improvements in Jackson's air passenger service by securing new airlines and new flights to serve our region," Senator Lott said. "But, as Mississippi's air passenger market continues to grow, we'll need more facilities and flights, and certainly direct service to America's largest city and our nation's financial and business center should be considered. This funding will help local leaders market the airport and hopefully obtain this new connection."
   Congressman Pickering stated:
   "Mississippi's business and finance sectors would find a direct flight to New York convenient and useful for our expanding state economy. And a direct flight would provide tourists in that area of the country a quick way to visit Mississippi and experience our Southern culture and hospitality. These funds will further compliment the growing Jackson airport." 
   Local entities will contribute another $300,000 in matching funds. The program helps communities address the challenges of local air service, such as high fares. The grants may be used for financial incentives to air carriers, studies to determine air service needs and for marketing programs that encourage communities to use commercial carriers offering local air service.
