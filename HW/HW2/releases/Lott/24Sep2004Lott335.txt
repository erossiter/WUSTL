SEN. LOTT: HATTIESBURG AREA TECHNOLOGY CENTER APPROVED FOR $1 MILLION
  The Veteran's Administration/Housing and Urban Development Appropriations (VA/HUD) Bill for FY 2005 contains $1 million for ongoing development of the Innovation and Commercialization Center, (ICC) a joint project of the region's Area Development Partnership (ADP) and the University of Southern Mississippi (USM).  
 When complete, the center will help the Hattiesburg area, including Forrest, Lamar and Perry counties, to build upon its polymer industry and attract additional technology companies.
   "I was pleased to request this funding in the federal budget process, and I look forward to further development of this initiative," Senator Lott said. "This facility will have a far-reaching impact, helping to attract good jobs to the designated I-59 technology corridor which impacts several major Mississippi communities."
   The purpose of the ICC is to enhance the Hattiesburg area's competitiveness in attracting new technology and research-based companies to the technology corridor, which spans a 170-mile stretch from the Picayune to Meridian areas, with Metro Hattiesburg at its center. Additionally, the ICC will support spin-off from nearby college and university related research programs.
   The Greater Hattiesburg Area is already home to a growing cluster of polymer-based companies thanks to the unique technology and workforce resources provided by nearby institutions such as the University of Southern Mississippi, Pearl River Community College, Jones Junior College and Petal High School.
