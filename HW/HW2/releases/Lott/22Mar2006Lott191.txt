SEN. LOTT SENDS SURPLUS SENATE COMPUTERS TO MISSISSIPPI SCHOOLS
 Sen. Trent Lott has selected two hurricane-battered school districts to receive 25 surplus U.S. Senate computers as part of the U.S. Senate's "Computers for Schools" program. The initiative enables Senators to donate surplus units to public schools.  
   "The Senate frequently upgrades our computer systems to increase capacity, security and speed," Senator Lott said. "Our latest upgrade will allow me to send 25 machines to Mississippi. These are modern units that can be very useful in educational settings."
   Senator Lott said he was pleased to make these resources available to Thomas Reeves Elementary School and to the Bay Waveland School District, both in areas which were obviously hit hard by Hurricane Katrina. 
   "I know these computers will be especially appreciated this year by students, faculty and administrators who're working hard to rebuild and recover from this storm," Senator Lott continued.
   The donations were shipped from Washington on March 17 and should begin arriving at their destinations in Long Beach and Bay St. Louis within days.
   The computers will be split between the two selected districts.
