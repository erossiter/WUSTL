SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $200 MILLION CONTRACT AWARDED TO MISSISSIPPI SHIPYARD
 Today the U.S. Navy awarded VT Halter Marine, Inc., of Pascagoula, Mississippi, a $200 million contract to build the T-AGM(R) -- a new Navy construction ship that will carry the nation 's next generation radar to collect data on ballistic missiles in flight.  
   The "Cobra Judy" replacement program will allow retirement of the current U.S. Naval Ship "Observation Island," which is scheduled to leave service no later than 2012.
   "This is an important ship that will service a major transition which will significantly upgrade America's missile defense capability," Senator Lott said. "To support this critical mission, the Navy has chosen Mississippi's skilled shipbuilding workers for execution of this contract, again demonstrating its confidence in our shipyards and affirming the dramatic progress Mississippi has made in our Hurricane Katrina recovery."
   The 700-foot vessel will be capable of using all current T-AGM 23 "Observation Island" facilities and ports. It will be capable of performing its mission in waves as high as 13-feet, and surviving in wave heights as high as 26-feet. T-AGM(R) will carry up to 88 crew members. 
   To avoid vulnerabilities in our national security, it is imperative that the Navy replace its existing radar system in a timely manner. Studies have determined that a ship-serviced radar replacement program is the quickest and most cost-effective radar replacement plan.
