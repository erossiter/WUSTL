SEN. LOTT SAYS $2 MILLION SLATED FOR GULFPORT/BILOXI AIRPORT
  Federal funding totaling $2 million has been released in support of ongoing upgrades to Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. The funds are part of a continuing series of federal appropriations designed to help expand the airport and increase both passenger and cargo capacity there.  
   "This is an important airport for the Gulf Coast and for all of South Mississippi," Senator Lott said. "In many respects, it is the Gulf Coast's gateway, stamping the first impressions upon people who're working and visiting in our region. "The airport is a critical part of our recovery and rebuilding effort, and as we revitalize our economy and strengthen it, this airport is bound to play an ever growing role in the Gulf Coast's future." 
   This project will provide funds to help reconstruct Taxiway F. This taxiway is the key link to the new general aviation area being developed with federal funds. When the new general aviation area opens, Taxiway F will be required to handle dramatically more traffic, and this funding will enable work to be completed on the taxiway before the new general aviation facility is complete. 
   The grant funds are being administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with the strong support of Senator Lott as ranking member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee.
