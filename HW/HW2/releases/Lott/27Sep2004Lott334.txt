SEN. LOTT: PRAISES NOAA'S DECISION TO EMPLOY ALMOST $800,000 CONTRACT OPTION IMPACTING VT/HALTER MARINE
  Today, Sen. Trent Lott praised a decision by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to exercise a $795,000 contract option to develop a contract design of a small waterplane area twin-hull (SWATH) vessel, as part of NOAA's ongoing fleet modernization efforts. 
   "This busy hurricane season reminds us of just how important NOAA's services are to our nation's safety and to saving lives," Senator Lott said. "This is an important step forward for NOAA's modernization program, and it is particularly good news for the men and women employed by VT/Halter in Pascagoula."
   VT/Halter has done very well in its competition with other firms to design this vessel, and, ultimately, this Mississippi company could be selected to not only provide the design for SWATH, but to actually construct it. Experts have concluded that VT/Halter's design for SWATH would go faster and farther before returning to port, have a reduced draft for shallower operation and include equipment for carrying a survey launch.
   The decision comes on the heels of Senator Lott and Senator Judd Gregg's (R-NH) visit to VT/Halter earlier this year. Both Senators have been at the forefront of NOAA improvements supporting the agency's fleet modernization efforts by securing $8.3 million in the federal budget to support the SWATH program during past three fiscal years.
   When complete the SWATH vessel will be homeported in Portsmouth, N.H. and will replace an almost 40 year-old NOAA ship. SWATH will be designed to operate in waters along the East and Gulf coasts, Caribbean and Great Lakes. The vessel will provide a more stable platform for surveys because it is less responsive to wave action than existing mono-hull ships. Its reduced motion will result in a more reliable collection of data.
