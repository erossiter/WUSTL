SEN. LOTT: $1 MILLION APPROVED FOR GREENVILLE AIRPORT
  Federal funding totaling more than $1 million is approved for airport upgrade projects at Mid-Delta Regional Airport, in Greenville, Sen.  
 Trent Lott, Chairman of the U.S. Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, said today.
   "Airport improvements like these are a major part of Mississippi's continued effort to sustain existing jobs and attract new jobs and investment," Senator Lott said. "This facility is an important part of the Delta's transportation infrastructure, and these upgrades will help ensure public safety, lay the groundwork for more capacity and provide local leaders with more leverage in their economic development efforts."
   Specifically the grant funds will enable Phase II of improving the airport's terminal building. The funds also will help install guidance signs, rehabilitate the runway, install apron lighting and rehabilitate an emergency generator.
   The funds will be administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the City of Greenville.
