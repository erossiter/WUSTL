SEN. LOTT SENDS COMPUTERS TO SCHOOLS
  Schools in five Mississippi communities will receive surplus U.S. Senate computers under the Senate's "Computers for Schools Program," Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today. Each Senator is eligible to participate in this program, which seeks to make good use of excess Senate computers following routine upgrades. 
   "This initiative puts surplus public equipment to good use for the benefit of American taxpayers and for the children who will use them," Senator Lott said. "This is good equipment that will be a welcome addition in these school districts."
   This year's recipients were chosen from a pool of public schools who've registered for the program through the U.S. General Services Administration website. Each school will receive five computers.
   This year's grantee schools include:
   * Pearl Junior High School, Pearl;
   * Scott Child Development Center, Oxford;
   * Gaston Point Elementary School, Gulfport;
   * Lucedale Elementary School, Lucedale;
   * Lumberton High School, Lumberton.
   The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1997, authorized the Senate to participate in this program, and it gave the U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms power to transfer educationally useful surplus equipment to public schools. Throughout the year, the Sergeant at Arms has hundreds of desktop computers which are no longer useful to the Senate but which still have years of service life available for lighter duty applications. 
   Senators are provided surplus machines on the basis of seniority. The members then utilize a list of public schools who've registered for the program from their home state to finalize the awards.
