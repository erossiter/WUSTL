SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $13.5 MILLION FOR KATRINA RECOVERY
  Federal grant funding totaling more than $13.5 million is approved for hurricane recovery initiatives in the municipalities of Gautier, Biloxi, Gulfport, Waveland and Harrison County, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today. 
   "This is primarily reimbursement funding from FEMA for the intense infrastructure repairs and debris removal required in these communities," Senator Lott said. "Harrison County and these cities have worked hard to clean the area and restore basic services, and the area will certainly benefit from this federal support. I will continue working with all appropriate federal agencies to ensure Mississippians get the funding we need to complete our recovery and rebuilding effort."  
   Senator Cochran stated: 
   "I am pleased the federal government continues to provide financial support for debris removal and infrastructure repair along Mississippi's Gulf Coast. In order for life and commerce in South Mississippi to return stronger than before Hurricane Katrina, we must ensure that critical thoroughfares along the Coast are free from obstruction." 
   Specifically, today's package includes: 
   * $1.7 million to the City of Gautier: 
   Hurricane force winds and tidal surges caused significant damage to the functioning lift stations for the gravity sewer system throughout the city. Damages to these stations includes meter boxes, disconnect switches, transfer switches, control panels, pumps, and motors. This $1,964,888.00 provides additional funding to replace 14 grinder pumps and to replace 42 damaged lift stations. 
   * $1 million to the City of Biloxi: 
   Severe winds, storm surge, and wave action fractured piles and broke apart the Back Bay Fishing Pier requiring a complete removal. The Fishing Pier was the South section of the old D'Iberville bridge built in 1925 and converted into a fishing pier when the new I-110 Bridge was built to connect Biloxi to the Interstate Highway 10. The pier consisted of a 28 ft wide 2,080 ft long concrete structure resting on a system of piles. This $1,136,927.20 represents funding to remove and dispose of all remnants of the damaged bridge located both above and below the water line. The total amount of debris to be removed and disposed of has been estimated at 5881 cubic yards. 
   * $1 MILLION TO THE CITY OF GULFPORT 
   This resulted in an estimated 3,070,000 cubic yards of debris to be produced within the City of Gulfport. The City of Gulfport contracted with R.W. Beck to monitor the huge debris removal and disposal operation including landfill tower monitoring, field monitoring including the issuance of load tickets, creating and maintaining daily reports, scheduling operations and providing backup documentation. This $1,001,444.00 funds the monitoring operation for the Right of Entry Leaners and Hangers at 100% Federal Cost Share within the period of December 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. 
   * $1.2 MILLION TO THE CITY OF WAVELAND 
   Hurricane force winds of Katrina and a storm surge of over 23 feet devastated the City of Waveland and caused huge amounts of debris to be scattered in public Right of Ways. The piles of debris halted Law Enforcement, Emergency and Ambulance services to meet the critical needs of the people and city. To protect public health and safety and ensure safe operations, the City of Waveland contracted R.W. Beck to monitor the pick up and disposal of debris North of the CSX Rail Tracks. It is estimated that 400,000 cubic yards of Right of Way debris in this area needed to be picked up, hauled and disposed. This $1,250.003.00 funds the debris monitoring operations at the 100% Federal Cost Share over a 5 month period which covers February 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006. 
   * $8.6 MILLION TO HARRISON COUNTY 
   Debris generated by the high winds, heavy rains, and flooding from Hurricane Katrina blocked roads and entrances to critical facilities within Harrison County. In order to reopen critical roadways and local governmental facilities as soon as possible after the storm Harrison County had to clear and dispose of debris from the roadways and building entrances immediately. Harrison County contracted with a debris monitoring company to coordinate most aspects of the debris removal and disposal process including disposal site monitoring, field monitoring including the issuance of load tickets, creating and maintaining daily reports, scheduling operations and providing backup documentation. This $8,696,515.50 funds the monitoring operation for the Right of Way debris at a cost of $6,604,128.50 and the monitoring of Right of Entry Leaners and Hangers debris at a cost of $2,092,387.00 at 100% Federal Cost Share from August 29, 2005 to June 30, 2006.
