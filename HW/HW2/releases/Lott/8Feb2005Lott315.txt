SEN. LOTT OF MISSISSIPPI TO CHAIR SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND MERCHANT MARINE SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi has been appointed chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee under the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.  
   The Surface Transportation Subcommittee has the most extensive jurisdiction of any of the Commerce Committee's ten subcommittees with authority over automobiles, trucks, railroads, Amtrak, maritime and ports, driver safety, transportation of hazardous materials, pipelines and transportation research.
   Senator Lott, who chaired the Aviation Subcommittee in the 108th Congress, said Tuesday that he welcomed the responsibility of overseeing improvements in the administration of highway, rail and maritime transportation and safety.
   "One of our first priorities will be the reauthorization of the trucking and automobile safety titles in the overdue highway bill," Senator Lott said. "It's vital that these programs have the stability of being renewed in a multi-year reauthorization so that the states can get to work on their implementation."
   Chairman Lott said the Subcommittee also would be looking at freight rail and railroad safety issues early in this Congress. "Port security also continues to be an issue, and we want to make certain that our ports aren't vulnerable," he said.
