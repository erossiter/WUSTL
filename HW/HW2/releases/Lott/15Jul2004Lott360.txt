SEN. LOTT: ROLLS-ROYCE NAVAL MARINE OF PASCAGOULA AWARDED NAVY PROPELLER CONTRACT
  The U.S. Navy has awarded a $1.3 million contract to Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, Inc., of Pascagoula, for the manufacture of aircraft carrier propellers and included a contract option for more, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   "Earlier this year, I helped Rolls Royce Naval Marine break ground on a significant expansion and upgrade to the propeller plant that will result in a leading-edge 18,000 square foot facility," Senator Lott said. "The Rolls-Royce propeller plant is a vital part of our shipbuilding industrial base and community."
   The contract calls for Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, Inc., which manufacturers Bird Johnson brand propellers, to produce one set of aircraft carrier propellers. The contract also includes an option for one additional set. 
   Senator Lott praised the company for its longstanding commitment to Mississippi and to Jackson County.
   "This company gets it right when it comes to corporate responsibility, integrity and leadership," Senator Lott continued. "As we saw with their commitment to expanding their operation in Mississippi's skilled shipbuilding community, they are not hesitant to make investments that are necessary to maintain the highest standards of quality and competitiveness."
