SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $2.7 MILLION FOR GULF COAST, NESHOBA COUNTY PROJECTS
  Federal funding totaling $2.7 million is approved for separate projects impacting the Gulf Coast and the Choctaw Reservation in Neshoba County, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.  
   "These are funds to improve water and waste water infrastructure, promote new commerce and to encourage growth of existing businesses," Senator Lott said. "As we continue rebounding from Hurricane Katrina, this investment will certainly help propel our state's economy forward, helping create new jobs and a better quality of life for Mississippi's citizens."
   Senator Cochran stated: "These projects are important to the citizens of Neshoba County and Hancock County. The grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is critical for the tribe's water and sewer infrastructure improvements and the funding granted to Hancock County will help accelerate economic recovery and assist with repairing damaged property." 
   Today's awards include both loans and grants which will be administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural Development. Specifically, the funding includes:
   * $1,000,000 to the Mississippi Band of Choctaws, for water system development. The grant will be used to construct an elevated water storage tank, a water and sewer distribution system and a pump station which will serve 775 tribe members, a new school and health clinic, a day care facility and 75 homes (25 existing and 50 new residences.);
   * $1,040,000 to Hancock County Port and Harbor Commission.. A $740,000 loan, payable in 10 years, will support construction of a 20,000 square-foot, 2-story office complex at Stennis Airport Industrial Park, creating twenty new jobs and retaining two. The $740,000 loan will be accompanied by a $300,000 grant;
   * $740,000 to Coast Electric Power Association. This loan, payable in 10 years, will help Gulf Coast Supermarkets, LLC to finance costs associated with renovating and opening a 33,000 square-foot disaster-damaged commercial building. The project will create an estimated 100 jobs in Hancock County.
   Federal funding totaling $2.7 million is approved for separate projects impacting the Gulf Coast and the Choctaw Reservation in Neshoba County, U.S. Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran said today.
