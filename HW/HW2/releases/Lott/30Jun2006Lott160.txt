SEN. LOTT ANNOUNCES $13 MILLION FOR JOB CREATION, WORKER TRAINING
  The Mississippi Department of Employment Security has been awarded a $13.4 million National Energy Grant from the Department of Labor to provide jobs creation and worker training in the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran announced Thursday. 
   The grant is a follow-on to a $50 million award from DOL last year which enrolled more than 7,100 Mississippians in temporary jobs or work training programs, Senators Lott and Cochran said. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao personally called the Senators Wednesday morning to notify them of the wide array of services that the grant will fund, including the creation of temporary jobs that will put Mississippians to work on cleanup and restoration projects on public properties, and vocational training to return workers displaced by the storm to full-time employment.
   "Getting back to full-time jobs and permanent pay checks is what Mississippians impacted by Katrina most need right now," Senator Lott said. "Funding for these vital employment training services is crucial to Mississippi 's recovery."
   "This funding is great news for Mississippi 's ongoing recovery efforts," Senator Cochran said. "It will allow people who lost their jobs in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to return to work, which is an important step in the full economic recovery of our state."
