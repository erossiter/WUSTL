SEN. LOTT: STENNIS SPACE CENTER COMPANY AWARDED $12 MILLION MILITARY CONTRACT
  Power Dynamics, LLC, of Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, has been awarded a $12.3 million contract to refurbish 37 U.S. Navy light amphibious resupply cargo craft - a move expected to create 15 new jobs, Sen.  
 Trent Lott said today.
   "I am pleased that a Mississippi company like Power Dynamics will be performing this work," Senator Lott said. "Throughout my years in Washington, I have worked hard with local state and other federal officials to bring promising companies to Stennis Space Center where they can grow and create jobs using Stennis' technology and research base as a catalyst. This is certainly a successful example of these efforts."
   The work will consist of improving the propulsion system by selecting and installing a new diesel engine; improving the towing capability; improving the watertight integrity; and improving technical documentation and spare part logistical support for these craft.
   Work is expected to last until April 2009. The contract was competitively procured through the Navy's e-solicitation website with four offers received. The company presently employs 37 people, with employment expected to climb to 52 to fulfill the contract.
