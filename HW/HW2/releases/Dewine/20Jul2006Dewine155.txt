SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION MONEY FOR RICKENBACKER
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which includes federal funding for projects in Ohio. Next, the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration. 
   "I am proud to have secured funding for these important military construction projects. We need to ensure that Ohio's men and women in uniform have all the resources they need to effectively do their jobs, including the modernization and expansion of facilities," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veteran's Affairs. "Our military protects us from terrorism and other threats both at home and abroad and they deserve nothing less. I look forward to working to make sure funding for these projects is retained in the final version of the bill."
   Senator DeWine secured Senate funding for the following regional project:
   Rickenbacker Airport
   * Security Forces Complex/Communications Building - $7.2 million for the construction of a Security Forces Complex and Communications Building for the 121st Airlift Wing Security Forces Squadron. This new facility will permit the Security Forces Squadron to train fully, maintain their weapons, and achieve the readiness required to perform their missions.
   The appropriations bill funded other Ohio military construction projects including $900,000 for the design and planning of a state-of-the-art Information Technology Complex at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, and $1.5 million for construction of bachelor quarters for the Ohio National Guard's Training and Logistics site in Ravenna.
