SEN. DEWINE PLEASED PREVENTION PARTNERSHIP RECEIVES DRUG CONTROL GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Sandusky County Health Department's Prevention Partnership, a recipient of a $100,000 Office of National Drug Control Policy's Drug-Free Communities Support Program Grant.  
 This is the first year the Health Department was awarded this competitive grant. 
   "Working together at the community level could truly make a difference in combating illegal drugs in our neighborhoods," stated Senator DeWine. In a letter of support for the grant application, Senator DeWine wrote, "The program's goal is to provide important funding and training to support local substance abuse prevention coalitions ... This grant funding is an important step in matching local efforts to reduce local efforts to reduce substance abuse and promote positive youth behavior in Sandusky County." 
   The Sandusky County Health Department, along with the Sandusky County Family and Children First Council and the Sandusky County Prevention Partnership, has laid the groundwork for an effective prevention partnership program. With the help of the local community they have completed a strategic action plan, "Partnerships for Success," and a thorough needs assessment and planning process. 
   The Drug Free Communities program has awarded more than $320 million in grants in seven years to support local community efforts to prevent and fight drug abuse. This year, 13 Ohio coalitions were named grant recipients by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
