SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION MONEY FOR OHIO BASES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, today announced the Senate passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which includes federal funding for projects in Ohio and provisions to help Ohio's veterans. The bill now goes to a Conference Committee to reconcile differences with the House version.
   "I am proud to have secured funding for these important military construction projects. We need to ensure that Ohio's men and women in uniform have all the resources they need to effectively do their jobs, including the modernization and expansion of facilities," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veteran's Affairs. "Our military protects us from terrorism and other threats both at home and abroad and they deserve nothing less. I look forward to working to make sure funding for these projects is retained in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine secured Senate funding for the following Ohio projects:
   Rickenbacker Airport
   * Security Forces Complex/Communications Building - $7.2 million for the construction of a Security Forces Complex and Communications Building for the 121st Airlift Wing Security Forces Squadron. This new facility will permit the Security Forces Squadron to train fully, maintain their weapons, and achieve the readiness required to perform their missions.
   Ravenna Training and Logistics Site
   * Bachelor Quarters - $1.5 million for construction of bachelor quarters for the Ohio National Guard at the Ravenna Training and Logistics Site. This will permit the facility to serve jointly the training and readiness needs of the Ohio Air Reserve National Guard and other active and reserve component organizations. The existing barracks facility is open-bay, with no private or semi-private rooms for officers or senior enlisted personnel. Further, the severe shortage in the total number of beds often results in senior personnel arranging their own housing, off post and at their own expense.
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
   * Information Technology Complex, Phase II - $900,000 for the design and planning of a state-of-the-art Information Technology Complex that will provide the computing, collaborative modeling and simulation environment required to rapidly enhance weapon system life-cycle acquisition and support capabilities. Currently, the IT facilities are housed in several substandard buildings scattered around the base without appropriate computing and security capabilities.
   Senator DeWine secured the following provisions in the bill that support Ohio's veterans:
   * Mental Health & Services Study - Provision requires the VA to complete a study on the long term effects of combat exposure on mental health and social assistance requirements for Vietnam veterans. The results of the study could also help prepare the VA for the long-term needs of returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are returning in record numbers with PTSD.
   * Medical Equipment - Provision allows the VA to purchase medical equipment from companies that are not on the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule if the equipment meets all specifications and warranty requirements while providing a more economical solution, which will benefit PartSource in Twinsburg, Ohio. This could save the VA an estimated $25 million to $50 million per year.
   * Services for Blinded Veterans - Provision expands VA outpatient services for blinded veterans. With the language and associated funding in the bill, Ohio will gain outpatient specialists to service veterans in Cleveland, Chillicothe, Dayton, and Cincinnati to serve its 4700 blinded veterans.
