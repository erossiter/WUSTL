SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL MONEY FOR SOUTHWEST OHIO ENERGY AND WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water bill, which includes funding for regional projects, is expected to pass the House of Representatives and the Senate.  
   "Ensuring that the Fernald site is safe for Ohio families and that former workers at the site are receiving the services they need are some of my priorities on the Senate Appropriations Committee," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased that my colleagues agreed and that funding for these projects has been included in the final bill. I am also pleased that funds have been included for Cincinnati to continue work on its Riverfront Park. The Cincinnati Riverfront Park is a perfect finishing touch to the development and revitalization of the Queen City's downtown." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional projects: 
   Fernald Environmental Management Project 
   * Fernald Site Cleanup* $327 million to complete the cleanup of the Fernald site in Harrison, Ohio. The cleanup project is expected to be complete in 2006. 
   Cincinnati Riverfront Park Project 
   * Cincinnati Riverfront Park Project - $250,000 to help continue work on Cincinnati's "new front yard", a park that will complement riverfront development projects totaling $2 billion. 
   Senator DeWine helped secure money for the following national project: 
   Former Worker Medical Screening 
   * Former Worker Medical Screening Program - $12.5 million for the national program and specifically $1 million for former workers employed after 1985 at the Fernald site. This screening program is a proven program that saves lives. 
   Once the bill has passed the House and Senate, it goes to the President for his signature.
