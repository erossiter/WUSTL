SEN. DEWINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON AIR FORCE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
  After today's vote by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission, Sen.  
 Mike DeWine (R-OH) released the following statement: 
   "The Commission's decision today is great news for Wright-Patterson and Dayton area families," said Senator DeWine. "The Commission recognized the importance of the tailored education being delivered, coupled with the unique resources at Wright-Patt, and I'm happy to see that AFIT will continue its mission in Ohio. By establishing the Joint Oversight Board, the Commission has solidified the cooperation between AFIT and the Naval Postgraduate School, allowing the schools to streamline curriculum and provide the best education for America's warfighter. The Dayton Development Coalition and the local community made a great case for AFIT during the BRAC process, and I am glad to see their hard work pay off."
