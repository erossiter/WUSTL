SEN. DEWINE WORKS TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today introduced the Peace Corps Volunteers Health, Safety, and Security Act of 2004 designed to increase the safety and security of Peace Corps volunteers.  
 This bill is a result of reports by the General Accounting Office and the Dayton Daily News chronicling of the Peace Corps' poor performance in responding to volunteer concerns, ensuring safe and secure housing and worksites, and planning for emergencies.
   "This legislation is necessary to enhance the safety of our Peace Corps volunteers around the world," said Senator DeWine. "We must ensure the safety of our citizens, regardless of where they live or work. I hope my colleagues, and the Peace Corps itself, will see the necessity of this legislation and help it pass quickly."
   The bill would create an Ombudsman's Office and strengthen the safety and security framework of the Peace Corps Inspector General. Additionally, the bill would permanently eliminate the current five-year term limit for those individuals responsible for ensuring the safety of Peace Corps volunteers and permanently establish a new Office of Safety and Security.
   The bill is cosponsored by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) and was originally introduced in the House by Representative Henry Hyde (R -IL 6th).
