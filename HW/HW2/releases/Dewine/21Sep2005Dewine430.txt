SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS OHIO STATE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds The Ohio State University's Nisonger Center for receiving a grant from the United States Department of Education for the Steppingstones of Technology Innovation for Students with Disabilities Program.  
 In April of this year, Sen. DeWine wrote to Department of Education officials supporting the grant request and explaining that the $299,940 grant would help educators and students evaluate and refine EnvisionIT, a computer-based curriculum that teaches essential academic standards and valuable career skills. 
   "It is essential that we equip all of our children with the skills necessary to succeed in high school and beyond," said Senator DeWine. "By targeting students in eighth through tenth grades, EnvisionIT will serve as an early career and academic proficiency intervention. Early intervention is particularly crucial for students with disabilities in Ohio and throughout America. With this grant, the Nisonger Center will be able to expand educational opportunities, improve post-school outcomes, and increase access to important educational technologies. I applaud the administrators at The Ohio State University for their efforts and thank the Department of Education for recognizing and funding such a deserving project." 
   The Steppingstones of Technology Innovation for Students with Disabilities is a program designed to improve educational results for children with disabilities by promoting the development, demonstration and use of relevant technology.
