SEN. DEWINE JOINS SENATE CAUCUS ON INDIA
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that he joined the Senate Caucus on India to address the concerns of Ohio's growing Indian population and build stronger ties with India.  
   "The growing community is part of the ever-changing face of Ohio," said Senator DeWine, "I look forward to working with my colleagues on issues that are important to the Indian American Community." 
   Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) chair the Senate Caucus on India. The caucus' main goal is to develop a closer cooperation between the United States and India. 
   An estimated two million people of Indian descent reside in the United States. According to the 2000 census, both Cleveland and Cincinnati have some of the largest Indian American communities in the nation. According to census estimates, more than 12,500 Indian Americans call Cleveland home and more than 7,800 Indian Americans live in Cincinnati.
