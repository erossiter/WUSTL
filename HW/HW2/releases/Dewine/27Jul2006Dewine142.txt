PRESIDENT REAUTHORIZES VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN SOUTH LAWN CEREMONY
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), today attended the presidential bill-signing of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization, which reauthorizes expiring provisions of the landmark legislation protecting Americans' constitutional right to vote for 25 years. Sen. DeWine, an original cosponsor of the bill, joined other senators, representatives and civil rights leaders for the bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. 
   "I am pleased to stand with my Senate and House colleagues as the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization is signed into law. While there is still work to be done, this Act goes a long way in assuring that all citizens are guaranteed the rights promised in the 15th Amendment," said Senator DeWine. "I truly hope that after this 25 year renewal is completed, we will find that no more congressional action is necessary, and that as a society we have fulfilled the promise enshrined in our Constitution - that every American will have the equal right to vote."
   The Voting Rights Act was originally passed in 1965 to protect the 15th amendment right to vote, which was illegally being denied to many citizens based on their race or ethnicity. The bill was last renewed in 1982 and some of the provisions are expiring. It has been an extraordinary success and we can see its results in towns, counties, and states across the country. The Voting Rights Act has helped minority voters get their voices heard, and votes counted. This bill will help assure that all citizens have the opportunity to exercise this critical right freely and easily. The Voting Rights Act reauthorizes expiring provisions for another 25 years.
