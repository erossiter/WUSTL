SEN. DEWINE SECURED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHWEST OHIO PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that a Northwest Ohio project that he secured funding for was included in the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development and Judiciary Appropriations Conference Report. 
   "This project will improve Defiance County's Senior Center, thereby improving the quality of life for the growing senior population in the area," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Aging and Retirement Security. "This Center would provide social, educational, and welfare opportunities for older adults living in the area to ensure they continue leading active lives."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following regional project:
   Defiance County Commissioners for Defiance County Senior Services
   * Defiance County Senior Service Center - $300,000 for the construction of a new one-story senior center for older adults. The center has outgrown its current location and a new building would provide additional space for a library/computer lab, meal prep area, dining/community room, craft/exercise area, storage area, reception area, and office space.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following statewide project:
   Ohio Public Transit Association
   * Bus Program - $5.6 million for the replacement of buses and other vehicles across the state to maintain existing levels of transit service and to provide services to people with disabilities. A portion of these funds will be allocated to the Toledo Area RTA (TARTA) for bus programs.
