SEN. DEWINE HELPS SECURE CONSERVATION GRANT FOR CINCINNATI MUSEUM CENTER
  Sen. Mike DeWine today applauds the Cincinnati Museum Center for receiving a Conservation Project Support Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The $17,855 grant will be used to conduct a general conservation survey of the Museum's 2.5 million-piece collection. Museum Center officials will use part of the grant for their public education program "Basics of Preventive Conservation." 
   "I am pleased the Institute understood the importance of the Cincinnati Museum Center's planned conservation survey," said Senator DeWine. "The Center's collection documents Ohio's natural and cultural history, and this grant will help make long-term preservation plans so future generations can see Ohio's rich history come alive."
   In October 2005, Senator DeWine wrote a letter to the Institute of Museum and Library Services supporting the Cincinnati Museum Center's grant request. Forty projects out of 144 applications were chosen to receive matching grants.
   The Institute's Conservation Project Support program awards matching grants to help museums identify conservation needs and priorities and perform activities to ensure the safekeeping of their collections.
