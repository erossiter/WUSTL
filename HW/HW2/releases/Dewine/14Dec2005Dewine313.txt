SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS EUCLID FOR RECEIVING FIREFIGHTING STAFFING GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Euclid Fire Department for receiving $1 million as part of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant Program, which provides competitive grants to local fire departments to meet industry minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing.  
 As Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Caucus, Sen. DeWine plays an active role in securing resources for firefighters and rescue workers throughout Ohio and elsewhere. 
   "I am pleased to know that Euclid families and the Euclid Fire Department will benefit from this grant," said Senator DeWine. "I acknowledge the many sacrifices that firefighters and rescue workers make each and every day while protecting our families, homes, and businesses from the devastating effects of fire. By working to pass and fund the FIRE Act and the SAFER Grants, we have ensured that fire departments in Ohio and elsewhere will have the resources to meet future service demands." 
   Senator DeWine wrote and passed the FIRE Act (S. 1941) in 2000, establishing a grant program dedicated to providing federal assistance to local fire departments. Senator DeWine's legislation increased the federal commitment to firefighting and emergency response services. During the fiscal year 2005 appropriations process, Senator DeWine, a member of the Appropriations Committee, helped secure $650 million for the FIRE Act. 
   According to the United States Fire Administration, more than 2,500 children age 14 or younger were injured or killed in residential fires in 2004. Of these casualties, approximately 50 percent were under the age of five. Overall, fire is responsible for killing more Americans than all natural disasters combined.
