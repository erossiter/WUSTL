SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON DEVELOPMENT AND FIELDING SYSTEMS GROUP
  After today's vote by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission, Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) released the following statement: 
   "This is great news for Miami Valley, not only did the community come together to save military jobs at Wright Patt, but civilian contractor jobs will remain in Dayton," said Senator DeWine. "I fought for DFSG to stay in Miami Valley and I am proud that this work combined with tremendous community support for our service men and women and their civilian support staff, convinced members of the Commission that Miami Valley is a good location for the military of the 21st century."
