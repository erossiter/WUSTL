SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS WTO SUIT AGAINST CHINA FOR UNFAIR TREATMENT OF U.S. AUTO PARTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauded the decision by United States Trade Representative (USTR), Ambassador Susan Schwab, to file a suit within the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China for unfair treatment of U.S. auto parts. Through both a personal meeting and a letter, last March Sen. DeWine urged then-U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Rob Portman, to pursue action against China for these practices. 
   "I am very happy to hear that litigation will be brought against China for their continued violation of WTO agreements, violations that put Ohio auto parts manufacturers and their workers at a serious disadvantage," said Senator DeWine. "Last March, I expressed my belief to Ambassador Portman that litigation was necessary to ensure both free and fair trade. I am hopeful that the WTO will rule in our favor and bring much needed relief to our auto parts industry."
   When China joined the WTO in 2001, they specifically agreed to eliminate all local content requirements and to lower tariffs on auto parts. Since that agreement, China has refused to do so and has continued to unfairly treat foreign auto-parts. The Chinese discriminate against imported parts by assessing an additional charge on imported parts if they are incorporated into a car that does not meet minimum levels of domestic content. This is particularly objectionable because it provides an incentive for U.S. and other foreign auto parts markets to relocate to China while also exacerbating America's bilateral trade deficit by discouraging U.S. exports.
