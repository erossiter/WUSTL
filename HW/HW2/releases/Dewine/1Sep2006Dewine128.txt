THREE OHIO COURTS RECEIVE MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS GRANTS THROUGH SEN. DEWINE BILL
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the officials in the Hamilton and Columbiana Counties' Juvenile Courts and the Mansfield Municipal Mental Health Court for receiving Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program grants created through his Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Sen. DeWine also thanks the U.S. Department of Justice for recognizing the importance of the planned programs to help offenders with mental illnesses. 
   "I am very pleased these grants will help end the cycle of non-violent, mentally ill offenders who are arrested and put in jail repeatedly and I am especially pleased that three court systems in Ohio received these grants," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Judiciary Committee. "I wrote this bill to offer hope by creating a chance for them to receive the treatment they need to break the cycle of arrest, release, and re-arrest."
   The following courts in Ohio received funding:
   * Hamilton County Juvenile Court - $250,000 to establish a diversion model program for youth with serious emotional disturbances who are at risk for on-going criminal behavior, but do not have a history of extensive contact with the juvenile justice system. The program will divert youth to services before their trial to assess and address emotional and behavioral issues for treatment.
   * Columbiana County Juvenile Court - $50,000 to design a collaborative plan for the identification and treatment of juveniles with mental illness in order to ensure earlier identification and treatment to prevent youth from becoming involved in the juvenile justice system and/or reduce recidivism and the length of time youth are involved with the juvenile justice system.
   * Mansfield Municipal Mental Health Court - $199,981 to accept referrals from entities in which potential participants meet the criteria of severe mental illness and have exhibited criminal behavior problems which are manageable in an outpatient, non-jail setting.
   In October of 2004, President Bush signed Senator DeWine's Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004 into law. The bill addresses the problem of disproportionate numbers of mentally ill individuals in the criminal justice system. It provides incentives such as grants to the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health and substance abuse treatment systems to provide treatment to non-violent mentally ill offenders. The grants, which are available to state, tribal, and local governments, may be used to develop and implement a variety of programs designed to improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness involved in the criminal justice system.
   In the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, Senator DeWine helped secure nearly $5 million to fund the grant program. Currently, he has secured an additional $5 million for the grant program in the fiscal year 2007 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, which has passed the Appropriations Committee and is awaiting approval on the Senate floor.
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that over 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders.
