SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SECURE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR OHIO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated funding for a statewide transit project when it passed the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill.  
 The bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration. 
   "Ensuring that Ohio's public mass transit programs are updated and accessible is important for Ohio families," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "New vehicles that all residents can use make a visible difference in the lives of people that use mass transit. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure this project receives funding in the final version of the bill." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that all of Ohio's citizens, including those with disabilities, have access to convenient and reliable transportation. By updating Ohio's mass transit system, we can help those who rely on public transportation by making sure their days revolve around family and work, and not their commutes," said Senator Voinovich. 
   Senators DeWine and Voinovich secured funding for the following statewide project: 
   Ohio Public Transit Association 
   * Bus Program - $12.58 million for the replacement of buses and other vehicles across the state to maintain existing levels of transit service and to provide services to people with disabilities.
