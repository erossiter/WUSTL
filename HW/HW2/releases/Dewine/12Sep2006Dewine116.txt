SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SECURE OVER $5 MILLION FOR GREATER CLEVELAND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority has received $5,031,962 from the Federal Transit Administration for its Paratransit District/Call Center project and transit centers. This center is part of an effort to coordinate senior and disabled transportation services throughout Cuyahoga County. The senators secured these funds through the appropriations process. 
   "In our fight for energy independence, we must continue to expand and improve our public transportation systems so that they are an attractive alternative for all Ohioans," Sen. DeWine said. "This is particularly important for Ohio seniors and Ohioans with disabilities, who often rely on public transportation for their livelihood and independence."
   "Due to our current energy crisis, it is critical that we continue to improve our public transportation systems," Sen. Voinovich said. "We must promote usage and make our public transportation systems more efficient, affordable and accessible. This is especially important for seniors and those with disabilities."
   The call center will provide a one-stop shop for seniors to call for services and will provide a seamless connection between local, circulator, bus rapid transit, inter-community, regional and downtown transit-oriented services.
