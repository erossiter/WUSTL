SEN. DEWINE BILL RECOGNIZES WRIGHT BROTHERS', DUNBAR'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN DAYTON REGION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) introduced a bill to rename the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park to the Dayton Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park to better reflect the accomplishments and contributions of Wilbur and Orville Wright and Paul Lawrence Dunbar. 
   "Renaming this National Historical Park recognizes the significant contributions three Ohioans made in aviation and the arts," said Senator DeWine. "Ohio's rich aviation heritage is epitomized in Dayton where the Wright Brothers worked, lived, and invented. Dayton is truly the birthplace of flight. Their friend, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, broke through racial barriers and became the first nationally-acclaimed African-American poet career. Dayton was where this acclaimed writer's career took off. The new name more accurately reflects the Dayton area's rich heritage, draws appropriate attention to their great accomplishments, and links Dayton to these three great men who called the area home."
   Besides renaming the Park, this bill would also allow the Secretary of the Interior to provide public and private organizations grants for the preservation, development, use, and interpretation of properties within the boundaries of the park. Senator DeWine also sponsored a bill that was included in the 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill that created the National Aviation Heritage Area to help bring together the aviation community around Dayton, including the Park, and offer them the opportunity to work together to promote tourism and improve historic preservation of sights.
