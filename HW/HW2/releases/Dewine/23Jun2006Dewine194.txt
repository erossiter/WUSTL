SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR CENTRAL OHIO, STATEWIDE AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill that includes $4.16 million for projects to help Central Ohio. 
   "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have helped these worthy projects receive funding," said Senator DeWine. "With the knowledge gained from agricultural research and the benefits from conservation and preservation projects we can help Ohio's agricultural community remain strong."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following regional projects:
   The Ohio State University
   * Ohio Aquaculture Research and Development Initiative - $891,000 for the OSU Extension Center at Piketon to improve fish health and genetic characteristics, production techniques and recirculating aquaculture systems for yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, and baitfish.
   * Emergency Detection and Response Research Program - $564,000 to research newly emergent plant and animal diseases, and develop responses to those diseases to protect human health and the agricultural economy.
   * Dietary Intervention - $1.237 million for the University of Toledo, The Ohio State University, and the Medical University of Ohio to research the health benefits of specific foods.
   Small Farm Institute
   * Seasonal Grazing Dairy Research Project - $100,000 for the establishment of a seasonal grazing research dairy farm in Coshocton. The North Central Ohio Dairy Grazing Council, the Department of Agriculture and The Ohio State University will work together to research the needs for a grazing dairy in the Appalachian region. The dairy would be managed as a self-sustaining operation providing researchers with a typical model of grazing farms that are being established in Ohio and other areas of the United States.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture
   * North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) - $ 1,450,313 for the research station in Coshocton to conduct research on hydrology, surface runoff, groundwater quality, and erosion for agricultural and other purposes. This research will help develop safe pesticide strategies and improve water quality.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following statewide project:
   The Ohio State University
   * The Ohio Center for Farmland Policy Innovation - $396,000 for The Ohio State University to develop a land policy laboratory that will work with local governments and area farmers to help preserve farmland.
   "This center would help Ohio's farmers work with local governments to develop farmland policy that meets the specific needs of the area," added Senator DeWine.
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
