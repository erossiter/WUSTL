SEN. DEWINE'S BILL TO HELP SPUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN HAITI PASSED BY SENATE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced Senate passage of his Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act (HERO), designed to improve the economic and political situation in Haiti by promoting trade.  
 This legislation would use trade incentives to encourage the interim government to make much needed reforms, while encouraging foreign direct investment, a powerful tool of development. 
   "Despite the problems that Haiti is facing, U.S. assistance has reached its lowest level in over a decade," said Senator DeWine. "This legislation will promote trade with Haiti and help them gain a firmer footing in the global economy. I am proud of my colleagues for choosing to stand with this fledging country in their time of need." 
   The bill amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act by granting duty-free status to Haitian apparel articles. Haitian apparel accounts for less than one half of one percent of all U.S. apparel imports, and the bill would cap the duty-free imports at 1.5 percent growing modestly over time to 3.5 percent. In order for Haiti to be eligible for the benefits, the President of the United States must certify to Congress that the new Haitian government is making significant political, economic and social reforms. 
   The bill was co-sponsored by Senators Bob Graham (D-FL), Richard Lugar (R-IN), Max Baucus (D-MT), Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), Bill Nelson, (D-FL), George Voinovich (R-OH), Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Joseph Biden (D-DE), John Breaux (D-LA), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Tom Daschle (D-SD), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Gordon Smith (R-OR), and John Sununu (R-NH). U.S. Representative Clay Shaw (R-FL) introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives.
