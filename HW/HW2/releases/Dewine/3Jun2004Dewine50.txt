SEN. DEWINE ISSUES STATEMENT ABOUT TENET RESIGNATION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement about the resignation of George Tenet from his post as Central Intelligence Director:  
   "Director Tenet's long tenure at the Central Intelligence Agency should be understood in the proper context. While he was present during major intelligence failures, it is necessary to understand that he inherited an intelligence community that was clearly under-funded for many years. He also showed great foresight in his early warnings of the threat the United States faced from al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. 
   I wish Director Tenet all the best and I know President Bush will select another highly qualified replacement who will also work very closely with the President in order to protect Americans from the terrorist threat."
