SENS. DEWINE, KOHL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PROPOSED AT&T, BELLSOUTH MERGER
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Herb Kohl (D-WI), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, today issued the following statement regarding the AT&T/BellSouth merger:  
   "This is an important deal, and we will be holding hearings to examine its implications. A key question will be, simply, is bigger going to be better for consumers?" said Senators DeWine and Kohl. "We need to see whether the increased size of the new AT&T will bring consumer benefits, or harm competition." 
   The proposed $67 billion merger of AT&T and BellSouth is yet another step in the historic re-combination of the old "Ma Bell" system and will bring under one roof the largest phone company, largest cell phone service and largest DSL provider in the country. As this industry-wide consolidation continues most consumers will find themselves dealing with only one or two very large, very powerful integrated telecommunications companies, which raises concerns but also offers opportunities for consumer benefit, because these companies will have an enhanced ability to offer a greater number of consumer products.
