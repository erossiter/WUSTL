SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON SUDAN-FY 2005 FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Mr. President, I rise to support the Corzine-DeWine amendment.  
 I will be very brief. This bill, as I said earlier today, already contains additional money to assist the humanitarian mission in Darfur, in the Sudan. I think everyone in this Chamber knows why this money is necessary. This amendment, that is currently pending that my colleague Senator Corzine and I have submitted, would provide an additional $75 million to be used to support the African Union's mission in Darfur. It would help support these troops. This would be our share of that support. Their mission is necessary. As my colleague said earlier, spending this money now would certainly save us spending money in the future. 
   It is the right thing to do. Anyone who has seen the pictures of what is going on in Darfur - anyone who has read about this genocide - understands the need to have the African Union troops in there as monitors and for other purposes. They need to be in there. This will contribute and make this money available. So I ask my colleagues for their support. I thank the Chair.
