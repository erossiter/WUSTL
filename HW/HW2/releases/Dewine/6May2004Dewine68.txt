  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that they recommended Judge Christopher Allan Boyko, of Parma, Ohio, to President George W. Bush for the position of U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio.  
   Judge Boyko has served as a judge on Ohio's Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas since 1996. In the City of Parma, he served as Assistant Prosecutor from 1981 to 1987, Prosecutor and Director of Law from 1987 to 1993, and as a judge in the Parma Municipal Court in 1993. Boyko graduated in 1976 from Mount Union College with a Bachelor of Arts degree and received his Juris Doctor Degree in 1979 from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. 
   "We are pleased to recommend Christopher Allan Boyko to the President," said Senators DeWine and Voinovich. "We are confident that he is prepared to serve on the bench in the Northern District of Ohio." 
   Judge Boyko, if nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, will fill a vacancy on the court set to occur at the end of this year. Judge Paul R. Matia has informed the President that he intends to take senior status.
