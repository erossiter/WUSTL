SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON RESTORE AMERICA: SALUTE TO PRESERVATION GALA
  REMARKS: (AS PREPARED) RESTORE AMERICA: SALUTE TO PRESERVATION GALA
   Thank you, Senator Clinton.  
 I am honored to share this podium tonight with past award recipients like you and my friend and colleague Congressman Ralph Regula and this year's honorees. I am humbled to be here tonight and to join in such distinguished company. 
   I have always had a love and respect for history. My parents taught me that. They instilled in me an appreciation for history and an understanding of its importance and relevance to everything we do in the present. 
   Ohio is known as the "Mother of Presidents" and the "Birthplace of Aviation." I grew up with incredible American history all around me. And that is why I believe it is so important to protect that history and preserve it for future generations. 
   Thank you again for this incredible honor tonight. I look forward to working with all of you to continue historic preservation around our great Nation.
