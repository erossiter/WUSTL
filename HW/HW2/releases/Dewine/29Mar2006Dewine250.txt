ASHTABULA RIVER CLEANUP: OHIO'S FIRST GREAT LAKES LEGACY PROJECT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), Co-Chairman of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, today applauds the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ashtabula Port Authority, and the Ashtabula River Partnership, as they celebrate moving forward on cleaning up the Ashtabula River. In 2002, Sen. DeWine was the lead Senate Republican sponsor of the Great Lakes Legacy Act which was signed into law to authorize funding for the clean up of polluted rivers, like the Ashtabula River, that flow into the Great Lakes. The Act allows the EPA to clean up contaminated sediments to protect human and ecosystem health. 
   "Cleaning up the contaminated sediment in the Ashtabula River ensures clean water for Ohioans and improved recreational opportunities, like fishing. I worked to enact the Great Lakes Legacy Act and secured funding to help us improve Ohio's waters and to finally make progress on removing contaminants from areas like the Ashtabula River," said Senator DeWine. "I have personally discussed this project with EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson on several occasions, and I am pleased that the Ashtabula River clean up is Ohio's first Great Lakes Legacy Project. We need to protect and restore the Great Lakes and its tributaries for our children and grandchildren."
   The project will reduce PCB sediment in a portion of the Ashtabula River, and is expected to cost $50 million. The Great Lakes Legacy Act provides $25 million for the project through the EPA. The state of Ohio and local contributions will cover the remaining costs. The project is expected to be completed in 2009.
