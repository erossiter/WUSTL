SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MIAMI VALLEY PROJECTS
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the fiscal year 2005 Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, which includes $14.8 million dollars for projects in Ohio overall, including $1.2 million in funding for projects in Miami Valley.  
   "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, it is one of my priorities to secure funding for worthy projects," said Senator DeWine. "These projects are important for development in Ohio and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure funding is retained in the final bill." 
   "These funds will help boost Ohio's recovering economy, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the funding is maintained in the final version of the bill," said Senator Voinovich. 
   The Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill includes funding for Miami Valley projects in the following areas: 
   Springfield
   * $250,000 to Springfield Center City Association for the construction of a business incubator to attract technology-based businesses to the area. 
   Dayton
   * $250,000 to Improved Solutions for Urban Systems, Inc. to create a new model for economic, community and workforce development. 
  * $450,000 to Development Projects, Inc., for the creation of a development-ready site in the Downtown Dayton Northeast Quadrant. 
   Xenia 
   * $250,000 to First Frontier, Inc. for revitalization of the amphitheatre. 
   The full Senate must consider the bill. Once the bill passes the full Senate, it goes to a conference committee where differences will be worked out with the House version. Then the final version goes to the President for his signature.
