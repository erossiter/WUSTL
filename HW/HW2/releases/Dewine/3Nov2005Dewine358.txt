SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR EASTERN OHIO, STATEWIDE AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Senate passage of the final Fiscal Year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill that includes $500,000 for projects to help the region.  
   "I am pleased my colleagues in the House and Senate saw the important research and policy-making initiatives these projects provide," said Senator DeWine. "These projects will help preserve our rich agricultural heritage while allowing farmers to benefit from the latest agricultural research happening in Ohio." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following regional projects: 
   Small Farm Institute 
   * Seasonal Grazing Dairy Research Project 
   * $100,000 for the establishment of a seasonal grazing dairy in Coshocton. The North Central Ohio Dairy Grazing Council, the Department of Agriculture and The Ohio State University will work together to research the needs for a grazing dairy in the Appalachian region. For small and mid-size producers, dairy grazing is profitable, and protects area soil and natural resources. 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following statewide project: 
   The Ohio State University 
   * The Ohio Center for Farmland Policy Innovation 
   * $400,000 for The Ohio State University to develop a land policy laboratory that will work with local governments and area farmers to help preserve farmland. 
   "The proposed Center will help local governments statewide to test new techniques for protecting farmland and better serving area farmers," added Senator DeWine. 
   The bill now goes to president for his signature.
