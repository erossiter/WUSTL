SEN. DEWINE, REP. TURNER APPLAUD DAYTON-REGION FOR SELECTION AS NEW HOME FOR AIR FORCE CLAIMS SERVICE CENTER
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Rep. Mike Turner (R-3rd) applaud the Department of Defense announcement that the Dayton-region was selected to receive the Air Force Claims Service Center as part of a service-wide consolidation to improve processes across the Air Force and to create a more efficient, effects-driven organization. This move will initially create 100 new jobs in the area, with the possibility of more positions in the future. 
   "I am pleased that the Department of Defense saw the great resources Dayton region has to offer," said Senator DeWine. "Workers in the area have a wealth of experience in call center operations. I look forward to seeing this new Center thrive and grow in the Dayton region."
   Rep. Mike Turner said, "I'm pleased with the DoD's decision to name Dayton as the site of its proposed Call Center. As a result of the BRAC process our community showed a net gain in jobs. The Dayton region is rich with personnel trained in call center operations, making this a logical place for the Air Force to locate its Call Center. The Air Force's decision today, builds on the success the community achieved during the BRAC process."
   The Air Force Claims Service Center will provide one-stop service for all personal property claims normally filed at the base level, including, claims for household goods damaged during change-of-station moves. The Center will provide convenient service whenever and wherever needed my airmen who experience losses due to military service. The Air Force estimates that the Center will save the Air Force more than $60 million over the next 10 years. The Center is scheduled to open in 2007 with 100 personnel and be fully operational by 2008.
