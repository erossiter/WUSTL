SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOUTHWEST OHIO PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that includes $2.9 million to help Southwest Ohio.
   "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have helped many worthy projects receive funding," said Senator DeWine. "I am particularly glad that money will be going to a number of programs that will help improve healthcare for the residents and, in particular, the children of Southwest Ohio. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure this program funding is included in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional project:
   Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
   * Proteomics for Research and Clinical Diagnostics - $700,000 to purchase equipment that will allow doctors to measure and translate a patient's proteins into understanding how they reflect their disease. It is expected that this application will impact the most important pediatric diseases, including congenital heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and epilepsy, allowing doctors to precisely diagnose, prescribe and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in patients.
   Community Blood Center / Community Tissue Services (CTS)
   * Phase 1 Tissue Processing Automation - $700,000 to develop the software and processes that allow Community Tissue Services to collect and store information about the processing of tissue grafts in an electronic format. Community Tissue Services is the largest nonprofit provider of skin grafts to surgeons for severe burn patients in the United States. It provides tissue grafts for transplant to all Dayton area hospitals and distributes tissue grafts throughout the United States and worldwide.
   Mary Scott Nursing Center
   * Mary Scott Nursing Center Expansion and Renovation - $400,000 to construct additional resident rooms, lounge and general storage area. It will also fund staff training in the area of dementia and memory impairment.
   Miami University
   * Research on Childhood Diseases - $400,000 to purchase equipment that can be applied to detect the early onset, progression and treatment of targeted children's diseases.
   National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education
   * Undergraduate Credit Discipline Education and Mentoring - $400,000 to fund a pilot program at Wilberforce and Central State Universities that will help students establish responsible financial behavior.
   Southern Ohio Health Services Network
   * Technology Infrastructure Upgrade - $300,000 for technology infrastructure upgrades that will allow the network to not only improve its management of patient health information but to improve its operation and the delivery of care.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following statewide project:
   Ohio Council of Urban Leagues
   * Mentoring Best Practices Model - $500,000 for a program that allows young people between the ages of 12-18 years of age to receive holistic mentoring, providing them with a well rounded set of life skills development. The project is a proven model that will be implemented by the Urban Leagues in the State of Ohio, including those in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Lorain County, Stark County, Toledo, Warren and Trumbull County, covering the entire state and touching the lives of over 500 young people.
   "All of our children need mentors and I am very pleased that this money will be used for a statewide program with a proven track record for helping our children develop the skills they need to succeed," said Senator DeWine.
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
