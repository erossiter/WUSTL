SEN. DEWINE WORKS TO SECURE FUNDING TO HELP CHILDREN, IMPOVERISHED NATIONS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that he helped secure assistance for developing nations and disadvantaged children in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Conference Report passed today by the full Senate.  
   "These measures provide help to some of the world's most disadvantaged," said Senator DeWine. "By providing aid to Haiti, the poorest nation in our hemisphere, we can offer Haitians hope for a more stable future. The Child Survival Health and Maternal Health Program will go a long way in providing millions of children with the basic necessities. Every child deserves to have a chance to grow up in a healthy environment where their medical and nutritional needs are met." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following projects: 
   Haiti 
   * $116 million in assistance to Haiti. This funding will be crucial in aiding Haitians after their elections scheduled for this winter. The Haitian government is going through a process of change and providing assistance is in our national security interest. 
   Child Survival Health and Maternal Health Program 
   * $360 million in assistance to the Child Survival Health and Maternal Health Program. The Lancet, a British medical journal this year published a study indicating that the lives of 6 million children could be saved for as little as $1.23 per child. This money, if administered properly, could go a long way to save the lives of millions of the world's disadvantaged children. 
   This bill has also passed the House of Representatives, and will now go to the President for his signature.
