SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS RESIDENT HOME FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO HELP PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds Resident Home Corporation (RHC) in Cincinnati for receiving an $872,400 grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The HUD grant is from the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, a program that allows persons with disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services. In May of 2006, Sen. DeWine wrote to HUD officials supporting the grant request and explaining that the grant would help expand services for people with disabilities in Hamilton County. 
   "The RHC supports over 500 individuals with disabilities and their families so that they can live full and independent lives," said Senator DeWine. "This money will help the RHC expand on their good work by funding the construction of two affordable and fully accessible homes in Hamilton County. I applaud the administrators at the RHC for their efforts and I thank the Department of Housing and Urban Development for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   HUD's Section 811 Program awards interest-free capital advances to nonprofit sponsors to help them finance the development of rental housing such as independent living projects, condominium units and small group homes with the availability of supportive services for persons with disabilities. The capital advance can finance the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition with or without rehabilitation of supportive housing. The advance does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years.
