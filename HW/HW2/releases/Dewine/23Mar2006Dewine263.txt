SEN. DEWINE SPONSORED BILL SECURES $58.6 MILLION IN LOW-INCOME HOME HEATING FUNDING
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that Ohio will receive $58,595,555 in additional Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding as part of a $1 billion measure aimed at increasing funds for low-income energy assistance. 
   "This additional funding will be essential to helping families, senior citizens, and people with disabilities pay their home heating costs this winter," said Senator Mike DeWine. "I cosponsored this legislation because I know how important this safety net is for so many individuals. LIHEAP is a worthy program that people in Ohio and across the country rely on to improve their quality of life."
   Senator DeWine cosponsored the measure which was signed into law March 20, 2006.
   It provides $36.5 million in emergency funding to Ohio, as well as, $22.1 million of formulary distribution. LIHEAP funds are distributed by the Ohio Home Energy Assistance Program. With this money, Ohio's total LIHEAP funding for fiscal year 2006 reaches $164.225 million.
   Since 1974, the federal government, in conjunction with the states, has been providing assistance to low-income households to help with either their heating or cooling costs through LIHEAP. In Ohio, the program is currently assisting more than 300,000 households.
