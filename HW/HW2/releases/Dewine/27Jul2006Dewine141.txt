SEN. DEWINE SECURES $700,000 FOR OHIO NORTHERN UNIVERSITY'S MASTER OF LEGAL LETTERS PROGRAM
  Sen. Mike DeWine today announced that officials at Ohio Northern University will begin receiving funds to help establish their Master of Legal Letters (LL.M.) in Democratic Governance and the Rule of Law within the Claude W. Pettit College of Law. Sen. DeWine secured $700,000 in the FY06 State/Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for the LL.M. program. 
   "This funding will help lawyers from transitional countries and emerging nations develop skills to help build stable democratic institutions in their own countries while developing systems that will help support the rule of law," said Senator DeWine. "With the help of the skilled faculty at Ohio Northern, these lawyers will be able to lead their nations as they help improve the political situation and move their home countries forward on the path to democracy."
   The program's first class will begin their studies this fall. The 12 students are government or public sector lawyers working in Ukraine, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. As the program evolves it will be targeted towards young lawyers in government service or working for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the Caribbean, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa, and Central Asia and will focus on training for enhancing transparency and accountability within their home governments. Each student will be asked to make a two year commitment to work in their government or NGO after completing the program.
