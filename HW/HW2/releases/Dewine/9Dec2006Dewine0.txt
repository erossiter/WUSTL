SEN. DEWINE-BACKED HAITI TRADE MEASURE GOES TO PRESIDENT FOR HIS SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds his Senate colleagues for their passage late Friday of the Trade and Tax Extenders bill that passed the House earlier in the day. The bill includes Sen. DeWine's provisions that provide Haitian goods duty-free access to the United States. The bill now goes to the President's desk for his signature.  
   "I have tried for many years to get Haiti trade legislation enacted, and finally thanks to House and Senate leadership, the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, and a number of other supportive members, we were able to get this done," said Senator DeWine. "My wife, Fran, and I have traveled to Haiti many times over the years; in fact we just returned last week from a recent trip there. Again, we saw first hand the immense poverty throughout the country. We know these measures will bring hope to so many people." Senator DeWine's provisions will use trade incentives - including duty-free access of goods to the United States - to encourage foreign direct investment in Haiti. This investment will result in abundant job opportunities for Haitians. 
   "In a country where there is a 70 percent unemployment rate, this bill is needed. Haitians are hard workers - they line up for jobs. These provisions will create those jobs. It is not an answer, but a start. These measures will bring thousands off the streets, feed more children, and create more security and stability. No other nation in our hemisphere is so impoverished. After years of work trying to pass this measure," Senator DeWine added. "I am pleased my colleagues realized that passing Haiti trade preferences is the right decision - it's the right economic decision and above all the right moral decision." 
   Senator DeWine has introduced Haiti trade preferences every year since 2002.
