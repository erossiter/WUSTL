SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN CINCINNATI REGION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Committee-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $956.7 million in funding for Cincinnati-area projects. 
   "I am proud to help secure funding for these very worthy projects," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I want to make sure the defense community in Ohio has proper funding to do their job to protect us at home and abroad. Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedoms, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding is retained in the final version of the bill."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following area projects:
   O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company
   * Up-Armored HMMVW Program - $614.7 million for production of Up-Armored HMMVWs. The Up-Armored HMMWV was developed to provide improved soldier protection with primary use by military/security police, special operations, and scout units. It is a proven system with documented evidence of saving lives. It is the primary vehicle of choice for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and provides the highest level of protection in its class
   General Electric Aviation
   * F-136 Alternative Engine for the Joint Strike Fighter - $340 million to fund the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter.

   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national programs:
   Defense Health Program
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.

   * Prostate Cancer Research Program - $80 million for the prostate cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
