SEN. DEWINE SECURES ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee announced that his amendment to increase funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by $100 million was adopted unanimously into the Department of State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which was passed by the Appropriations Committee. In addition, Senator DeWine helped secure assistance for developing nations and disadvantaged children. 
   "In 2005, 38.6 million people were living with HIV and 2.8 million people died as a result of AIDS - 350,000 of them were children. These funds will ensure the United States meets its commitment to the Global Fund for ongoing care and treatment programs. It will also allow new programs to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria to begin. The child survival and maternal health programs are incredibly important to ensure children are given a fair chance, and are able to grow up in a healthy environment while receiving the medical attention they need. Providing funds to worthy children's health programs is one of my priorities on the Appropriations Committee. In addition, providing assistance to these programs will help developing nations overcome disadvantages so they can focus on caring for their own citizens and continue to grow economically," stated Senator DeWine. "I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding for these programs remains in the final version of the bill."
   Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria
   * $600 million in assistance to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Senator DeWine's amendment added $100 million to the $500 million provided in the Committee taking the United States closer to its commitment to the Global Fund for FY07.
   Haiti
   * $163 million in assistance to Haiti. This funding will be vital to help stabilize and strengthen democracy in the country while helping its new government during this critical time.
   Child Survival Health and Maternal Health Program
   * $465 million in assistance to the Child Survival Health and Maternal Health Program. The United States Agency for International Development estimates that of the 11 million annual child deaths across the globe, 7 million are preventable. This crucial funding will go a long way in preventing those child deaths.
   The Department of State and Foreign Operations Funding Bill now goes to the entire Senate for consideration.
