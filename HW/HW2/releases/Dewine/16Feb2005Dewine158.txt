SENS. DEWINE, DODD CONTINUE FIGHT TO PREVENT UNDERAGE DRINKING
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Chris Dodd (D-CT), together with a bi-partisan group of representatives, today introduced a bill to help prevent underage drinking. The Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act would coordinate relevant federal agencies to work collectively combating underage drinking and increasing prevention activities in states and local communities, including college campuses. The bi-partisan bill would authorize a public service media campaign increasing adult awareness of the threat alcohol poses to their children, as well as increase research and data collection done at the federal level on adolescent alcohol use and brain development.  
   "The STOP Underage Drinking Act will go a long way to expand and coordinate our nation's fight against underage drinking," said Senator DeWine. "This is a problem that is not going away. We have an obligation to do more, and this bill will work to lower underage drinking in both the short and long term." 
   "The road to adulthood isn't an easy one, but when it comes to alcohol and children, it's a dead-end street," said Senator Dodd. "This measure will - for the first time - help lead a national effort to combat underage drinking." 
   "Limiting youth access to alcohol is essential to solving the underage drinking problem and this legislation will help reach adults with the cold hard facts: the earlier teens drink the more likely they are to become alcohol dependent and to drive drunk," said Wendy J. Hamilton, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) national president. "We owe it to our youth and to American families to make underage drinking prevention a top public health priority." 
   The companion House Bill will be introduced by Representatives Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), Frank Wolf (R-VA), Tom Osbourne (R-NE), Zach Wamp (R-TN), and Rosa DeLauro (D-CT).
