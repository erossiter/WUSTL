SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES LOAN GUARANTEE TO HELP TINKER CREEK DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that Cuyahoga County will be awarded a $4 million loan guarantee from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The loan will be coupled with a Brownfields Development grant of $2 million to help finance the remediation and redevelopment of a 50-acre abandoned and underutilized former industrial property to be named Tinker Creek Commerce Park. In July 2004, Sen. DeWine sent a letter of support for the funding to HUD Secretary Jackson. 
   "This is good news for Cuyahoga County as this money will help to make a vacant, former industrial property, thrive again," said Senator DeWine. "The redevelopment of this property will allow the Taylor Chair Company to remain in Bedford and able to construct a new manufacturing headquarters facility there, retaining and creating jobs locally."
   The project is a part of 200 Egbert LLC's larger Tinkers Creek Commerce Redevelopment, which will comprise 400,000 square feet of new office and commercial/industrial space upon complete build-out. Cuyahoga County expects the completed Tinkers Creek Commerce Redevelopment initiative to generate over 500 jobs with average annual wages of approximately $36,000.
   Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Under this section, HUD offers communities a source of financing for housing rehabilitation, economic development and large-scale physical development projects.
