"This project is important for preservation in Franklin County and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure funding is retained in the final bill." 
   "These funds will help boost Ohio's recovering economy, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the funding is maintained in the final version of the bill," said Senator Voinovich. 
   The Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill includes funding for the following Central Ohio project:
