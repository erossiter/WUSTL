SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN NORTHWEST OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $232.5 million in funding for projects in Northwest Ohio. 
   "Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedom, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools to perform their mission. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I am proud to help provide them with the resources they need to succeed," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased that Ohio's defense community is able to greatly contribute to necessary projects that support our men and women in uniform."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following area project:
   General Dynamics
   * System Enhancement Program for M1A2 Tanks - $225 million to refit existing M1A2 tanks with more capable computer systems, night vision capabilities and improved targeting systems.
   Camp Perry
   * Renovations - $7.5 million for barrack renovation at Camp Perry.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national program:
   Navy Family Lines
   * COMPASS - $300,000 for a team mentoring program designed to educate new Navy spouses, enabling them to understand the military lifestyle and realistically meet the challenges that lie ahead.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national programs:
   Defense Health Program
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
