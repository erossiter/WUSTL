SEN. DEWINE SECURES REGIONAL DEFENSE FUNDING
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the committee passage of the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense Appropriations bill, which includes $6.6 million in funding for Northwest Ohio projects. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.  
   "I am proud to help secure funding for these very worthy projects," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I want to make sure the defense community in Ohio has proper funding to effectively do their jobs. As our service men and women are combating terror at home and abroad, we need to give them the proper tools as they protect our freedoms. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding is retained in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure $6.6 million in funding for the following Northwest Ohio projects: 
   Brush Wellman, Inc. 
   * Beryllium Supply Industrial Base - $3 million for the maintenance of the country's domestic supply of beryllium through public-private partnerships. A 2004 Department of Defense report stated strategic and critical metal beryllium plays a key role in systems that support the Transformational Armed Services. The domestic supply of beryllium is in danger of being depleted because Brush Wellman, the only domestic supplier, closed its primary metal production facility. This money will help maintain the domestic supply of beryllium. Lima Army Tank Plant 
   * N-STEP Enables Manufacturing Cell for FCS - $3.6 million for the development of a flexible, reconfigurable manufacturing cell to replace the manual task of welding structural mounts on each large military vehicle. Developing this new technique will result in multifunctional applications on one integrated manufacturing cell, achieving stricter dimensional accuracy. 
   Senator DeWine also worked on securing $224.309 million in funding for national projects in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. "These programs will keep our military and the medical research field on the cutting edge. I hope my fellow Senators will realize the importance of this funding and retain these programs in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national programs: Defense Health Program 
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $10 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   Lockheed Martin 
   * C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) - $15 million for the procurements of 8 AMP kits to modernize C-5s. AMPs replace difficult-to-maintain components and upgrade the C-5 cockpits. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program. Beginning this month the C-5 will replace the C-141 which is currently being flown by the 445th. - C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP) - $15 million for the replacement of engines and systems on C-5s with modern ones. This replacement will save the Air Force more than $1 million per day in operations and support costs. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program. Beginning this month the C-5 will replace the C-141 which is currently being flown by the 445th. 
   Metals Affordability Initiative (MAI) 
   * MAI Consortium - $7 million for continued initiative implementation. The MAI consortium has improved the military's war fighting capability while reducing life-cycle cost through technology innovation. Several Ohio companies participate in this initiative. 
   U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps 
   * Operational Funding - $300,000 for funding the Sea Cadet Corps program that promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation, as well as moral character and self-discipline, for youth ages 11 - 17. 
   Procurement Technical Assistance Program 
   * Assistance Program - $27.009 million for Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs). These PTACs form a network of dedicated procurement professionals who provide assistance to small businesses seeking to participate in the Department of Defense and other federal agencies procurement contracts. PTAC clients are small businesses, including disadvantaged, minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses that can not afford a fulltime marketing and procurement staff. There are 18 PTACs in Ohio.
