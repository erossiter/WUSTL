SEN. DEWINE'S BILL WOULD PLACE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN PRESIDENTIAL LINE OF SUCCESSION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today reintroduced legislation that would include the Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of presidential succession immediately after the four other major cabinet members (the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney General).  
 Current law under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 does not include the Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of presidential succession. Sen. DeWine's bill would correct that omission, while also breaking with tradition by placing the Secretary of Homeland Security higher in the line of succession than other departmental secretaries. Traditionally, the secretaries of newly created departments are placed at the end of the line of presidential succession. 
   The Department of Homeland Security, one of the government's largest departments, is responsible for disaster relief, security, and emergency preparedness of the nation. In the event of a catastrophe that takes the lives of the top seven presidential successors, the Secretary of Homeland Security, because of his or her post at the head one of the most powerful and wide-ranging executive branch departments, would be the most qualified and experienced individual to lead the nation. 
   "In today's world, our government needs to be prepared for all scenarios, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the head of one of the largest and most powerful departments, would best be prepared to lead the nation. It makes sense to break with tradition and elevate this new cabinet secretary in the presidential line of succession," said Senator DeWine. 
   U.S. Representative Tom Davis (R-VA) plans to introduce companion legislation in the House.
