SENS. DEWINE, KOHL ISSUE STATEMENT REGARDING PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN SPRINT, NEXTEL
  Statement by Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Herb Kohl (D-WI), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights:  
   "With more and more people choosing wireless phones, the merger announced today by Sprint and Nextel will impact millions of consumers. To date, the wireless phone market has been a model of vigorous competition, with consumers benefiting from lower prices and improved quality of service. Sprint and Nextel contend that the proposed deal-which would create the third largest wireless firm-will bring increased competition and innovation to the market that neither Sprint nor Nextel could achieve alone. But coming on the heels of the merger between Cingular and AT&T Wireless, the proposed merger-which would result in the number of wireless competitors being reduced from six to four in the last year-is another step towards increased consolidation in the wireless market and therefore merits close review. We look forward to holding hearings to examine how this merger will affect competition in the telecommunications market."
