SENS. DEWINE, DODD EFFORT TO PREVENT UNDERAGE DRINKING GOES TO PRESIDENT
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Chris Dodd (D-CT) today announced the House passed a version of their bill that works to prevent underage drinking. The Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act now goes to the President for his signature. The STOP Underage Drinking Act would coordinate relevant federal agencies to work collectively combating underage drinking and increasing prevention activities in states and local communities, including college campuses. The bi-partisan bill would authorize a public service media campaign increasing adult awareness of the threat alcohol poses to their children, as well as increase research and data collection done at the federal level on adolescent alcohol use and brain development.  
   "As a nation we haven't done enough to address the prevalent problem of underage drinking. Kids are drinking, and drinking so much that the amount of alcohol can have long-term effects. The STOP Underage Drinking Act will go a long way to expand and coordinate our nation's fight against underage drinking," said Senator DeWine. "This bill helps develop a coordinated effort to prevent this problem so we can all work together to make sure our children are making the right decisions when it comes to alcohol." 
   "Children have very difficult challenges on the road to adulthood. They shouldn't have to also navigate the tremendous dangers presented by alcohol," said Dodd. "This measure can - for the first time - help provide critically important new efforts to combat underage drinking nationally." 
   The House Bill was introduced by Representatives Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), Frank Wolf (R-VA), Tom Osbourne (R-NE), Zach Wamp (R-TN), and Rosa DeLauro (D-CT).
