SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO PROVIDE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO FLOOD-DAMAGED COUNTIES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the President for making public disaster assistance available to Ashtabula, Geauga, and Lake Counties to repair damaged infrastructure caused by severe storms and flooding last month. 
   "This critical assistance will help repair damage done to roads, sewers, bridges, and other public facilities during July's storms," said Senator DeWine. "The sooner cleanup and repairs can begin in these communities, the sooner life can return to normal for Northeast Ohio families."
   This public assistance will allow local and state governments and private non-profit organizations to apply for reimbursement of debris removal and repairs to public facilities like roads, bridges, and public buildings. Local and federal officials estimate that the storms caused $13.3 million dollars worth of damage to public infrastructure.
   On August 1, 2006, Senator DeWine, along with Senator George Voinovich, sent a letter to the President supporting Governor Bob Taft's request for a Federal Disaster Declaration for the three counties to allow for Individual Assistance to be provided to individuals and businesses negatively affected by the storms and flooding. Senator DeWine also requested that public assistance be made available to the counties.
