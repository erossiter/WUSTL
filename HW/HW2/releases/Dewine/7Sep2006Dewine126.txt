SENS. DEWINE, HUTCHISON MAKE FRIENDLY WAGER ON OUTCOME OF OHIO STATE - TEXAS GAME
  In anticipation of Saturday night's big game, Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced they are placing a friendly bet on the outcome of the contest that pits the number one ranked Ohio State Buckeyes against the second ranked Texas Longhorns. Sen. DeWine is offering Ohio's candy buckeyes, made by his wife, Fran, while Sen. Hutchison has placed Brenham, Texas' own Blue Bell Ice Cream on the line. The wager will be settled next week on Capitol Hill with the loser presenting the winner with their home state's treat. 
   For the second time in as many years, the two teams will go head-to-head in a game with NCAA title implications. Last year, the Longhorns, en route to the national title, prevailed in a 25-22 victory over Ohio State in Columbus in the first-ever game between the two powerhouse programs. While the Longhorns may be confident coming home to Austin, they currently trail the Buckeyes in the Associated Press poll. It's been nearly 10 years since the top two teams in the nation have played each other during the regular season and both sides are brimming with excitement.
   "I believe in Ohio State and I know that, with Coach Tressel at the helm and backed by the greatest fans in the nation, the Bucks will come out on top," said Senator DeWine. "My kids and grandkids have been anticipating the game for weeks and Buckeye fever is sweeping my office. I look forward to enjoying Texas' finest ice cream and an Ohio State victory. Go Bucks!"
   "Our victory over the Buckeyes on their home turf last year made Ohio State a mere statistic in our record-setting, national championship season," said Sen. Hutchison, a UT graduate. "I commend Senator DeWine for his brave wager against a strong Texas football force, but can't wait to celebrate another victory on Saturday in a sea of burnt orange. Hook 'em!"
