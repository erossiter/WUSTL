SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SECURE OVER $500,000 FOR STRONG FAMILIES PROGRAM
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners will receive $533,730 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the "Strong Start for Cuyahoga's Families" program. This program will bring together 23 community-based organizations with expertise in fatherhood and healthy marriages. Cuyahoga County intends to offer its program at area community centers to low-income participants at no cost. Sens. DeWine and Voinovich wrote letters of support for this grant. 
   "Our children deserve safe and stable families," Sen. DeWine said. "This money will help ensure that Cleveland parents in need have the personal and professional skills to provide that for their children. I applaud the administrators at Cuyahoga County Executive Office of Health and Human Services for their efforts and I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   "When I was a state representative and just beginning my career in government, I was asked how I would confront the problems of Ohio if I had a magic wand," Sen. Voinovich said. "My answer then was the same as it is now: I would use it to reconstitute and protect the family, which is the foundation of this country. This program will promote healthy marriages and responsible parenting, improving the quality of life for families in Cuyahoga County."
   In addition to the offerings relating to marriage and fatherhood, the program will offer courses on job training, money management and domestic violence prevention. Funding will enable Cuyahoga County's partners to provide educational sessions to improve the lives of Cleveland's children by giving their parents the tools they need to successfully parent and provide financial stability.
