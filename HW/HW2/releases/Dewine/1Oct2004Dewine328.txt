SEN. DEWINE: GREAT LAKES MONITORING STILL LACKS COORDINATION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today released a federal government report that found the Great Lakes monitoring efforts still do no provide comprehensive information. The Government Accountability Office report, requested by Sen. DeWine and other members of the Great Lakes Task Force, states that monitoring the progress toward Great Lakes restoration goals is generally limited because of a number of recognized factors. 
   The report found that it will be difficult to coordinate basin-wide goals and a monitoring system because of:
   * The lack of defined organizational leadership;
   * The multiple parties involved;
   * Centralized information from monitoring activities not yet being available; and
   * The unique environmental dynamics of each Lake.
   "Without useful monitoring data about the health of our Great Lakes system, we have no measure for the progress made in the region," Senator DeWine said. "A consistent, comprehensive assessment of the water quality and other indicators will help us lead clean-up efforts. We risk jeopardizing progress we have already made, as well as the ultimate achievement of our restoration goals, if we don't have consistent monitoring of the Lakes. Our Great Lakes are a precious resource and we need to employ an accurate measurement of the health of the system."
   Senators DeWine and Carl Levin (D-MI), co-chairs of the Great Lakes Task Force, last year introduced the Great Lakes Water Quality Indicators and Monitoring Act, which would provide $28 million over four years. The bill would amend the Federal Pollution Control Act to direct the EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office to develop, in coordination with other federal agencies and Canada, indicators of water quality and related environmental conditions in the Great Lakes and a network to monitor those indicators regularly throughout the Great Lakes basin.
   The report, Great Lakes-Organizational Leadership and Restoration Goals Need to be Better Defined for Monitoring Restoration Progress, is available at www.gao.gov.
