SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHEAST, NATIONAL PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill that includes $3.385 million to help Northeast Ohio.
   "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have helped these worthy projects receive funding. They will help area workers, preserve the area's natural resources and keep the region's aerospace technology research on the cutting edge," said Senator DeWine. "I am glad other members of the committee agreed that these projects deserved funding and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the programs are included in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional projects:
   NASA Glenn Research Center
   * NASA Aeronautics Program - $759 million for NASA's Aeronautics Program, which represents a $35 million increase from the Administration's budget request. This increase in aeronautics funding will help reinvigorate research in key areas of strength at NASA Glenn, including hypersonics, propulsion, environmental aircraft development, and fuel cells. The aeronautics funding also ensures that research undertaken at NASA centers continues to aid U.S. global competitiveness in both military and civilian aerospace.
   "Despite the tight budget for NASA programs, I am glad to see that the Committee provides an increase for important aeronautics research and development funding," said Senator DeWine. "I will continue to fight to strengthen NASA aeronautics funding as the bill moves toward the full Senate."
   U.S. Marshals Service
   * Fugitive Safe Surrender - $1.405 million to expand nationally the Fugitive Safe Surrender Program, a faith-based, re-entry initiative created by Northern District of Ohio U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott. The program encourages individuals wanted for felony crimes to voluntarily surrender in a faith-based setting and was created. In August of 2005, a four-day pilot program in Cleveland netted the peaceful surrender of more than 800 fugitives, including 324 felony fugitives. Akron is among the cities chosen for Fugitive Safe Surrender in 2006.
   Western Reserve Land Conservancy
   * Firelands Boy Scout Reservation Protection Project - $1.2 million to purchase conservation easements on the 453-acre Firelands Boy Scout property in Wakeman, Ohio. Over 75 percent of the 453-acre property is covered with old growth bottomland forest, upland deciduous forest, and mature hemlock stands.
   Village of Bratenahl
   * Lake Erie Coastal and Riparian Forest Preserve - $700,000 to purchase an 8-acre property to complete the Lake Erie Coastal and Riparian Forest Preserve. This acquisition will allow Bratenahl to create a publicly accessible nature preserve within the Lake Erie Coastal Management Area.
   Delta Plant Technologies, Inc.
   * Program of Excellence in Natural Rubber - $40,000 to establish a domestic source of natural rubber based on Taraxacum kok-saghyz. The Ohio "Program of Excellence in Natural Rubber" will link existing genetics, production and engineering research capabilities with existing rubber technology industry collaborators associated with essential US manufacturing, transportation, and defense applications.
   BioEnterprise Corp.
   * BioEnterprise Entrepreneurial Acceleration Program - $40,000 to Facilitate the growth of the bioscience industry and foster knowledge-based economic development through the identification, attraction, education, and acceleration of entrepreneurs through trainings and an on-sight business incubator that houses 15 companies.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national projects:
   Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act Grants
   * Grant Program - $5 million in funding for law enforcement and mental health agencies to establish joint programs to provide mentally ill offenders with the services they need to enable them to avoid becoming repeat offenders. Funding for this Senator DeWine initiated program has been used in the past for establishing Mental Health Courts and Crisis Intervention Teams.
   "I am very pleased that grants are now available to help end the cycle of mentally ill offenders who are arrested and put in jail repeatedly," said Senator DeWine. "I wrote this bill to offer hope by creating a chance for non-violent offenders to receive the treatment they need to break the cycle of arrest, release, and re-arrest."
   Justice For All Act
   * DNA Testing - $175.568 million to fund the Justice For All Act's program DNA testing program dedicated to reducing the enormous national backlog of offender DNA profiles and untested DNA evidence from investigations of violent crimes. Senator DeWine was a sponsor of the initial Justice For All Act of 2004, specifically authoring provisions to provide funds for rape kits and to reduce the DNA backlog.
   "I am very pleased that this money will be used to reduce the backlog of untested DNA evidence," said Senator DeWine. "There are at least 540,000 unsolved cases with untested DNA evidence in the United States today and many of them are for violent crimes like rape and murder. This money will go a long way towards solving these cases and putting violent criminals behind bars."
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
