SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN NORTHWEST OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Committee-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $225 million in funding for projects in Northwest Ohio. 
   "I am proud to help secure funding for these very worthy projects," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I want to make sure the defense community in Ohio has proper funding to do their job to protect us at home and abroad. Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedoms, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding is retained in the final version of the bill."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following area project:
