SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS BELLEFAIRE JEWISH CHILDREN'S BUREAU FOR ADOPTION GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds Bellefaire Jewish Children's Bureau (JCB) for receiving a grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  
 The grant is from the Developing Adoption Services and Supports for Youth Who Wish to Retain Contact with Family Grant Program from the Administration for Children and Families. In July of this year, Sen. DeWine wrote to Department of Health and Human Services officials supporting the grant request and explaining that the $300,000 grant would help shorten the time that children languish in the public welfare system by utilizing a number of strategies to find permanent homes for them. 
   "Every child deserves a safe, stable, loving home, this grant will help provide those needs to Northeast Ohio children," said Senator DeWine. "I applaud the administrators at Bellefaire JCB for their efforts and thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project." 
   Bellefaire Jewish Children's Bureau (Bellefaire JCB) is a non-profit agency concerned with the quality of life for and committed to serving the needs of children and their families. Bellefaire JCB provides an array of child welfare, behavioral health, and allied health services without regard to race, religion, sex or national origin, and encourages all clients to develop positive identification with their religious and ethnic backgrounds.
