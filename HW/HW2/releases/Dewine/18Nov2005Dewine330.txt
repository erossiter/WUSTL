SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION MONEY FOR CAMP PERRY
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that funding for Ohio military construction projects he helped secure was included in the fiscal year 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Conference Report.  
 Both the Senate and the House passed the report and it will now go to the president for his signature.
   "Reassessing the needs of our military is a continual process," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. "This project will give Ohio's men and women in uniform all the resources they need to effectively do their jobs, including training in appropriate facilities."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional project:
   Camp Perry Air National Guard Station
   * Troop Training Quarters Replacement - $4.7 million for the replacement of the training and billeting facilities that support the 200th RED HORSE Squadron and the Regional Airman Leadership School at Camp Perry in Port Clinton. Currently, members utilize five run-down buildings that have substandard living conditions, efficiency and fire protection.
   Senator DeWine helped secure other military construction projects in Ohio including $77.77 million in improvements at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, $9.22 million in Army National Guard facilities at Mansfield Lahm Airport and in North Canton, $7.5 million for the joint lodging facility at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, and $11.6 million for an integrated services office building at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima.
