SEN. DEWINE WELCOMES CONGRESSIONAL FOSTER YOUTH INTERNSHIP PROGRAM PARTICIPANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) welcomes Chey Korvandi-Geledar, 18, an intern with the Congressional Foster Youth Internship Program, to his Washington, D.C. office.  
   "It's my pleasure to provide Chey with an opportunity to work in our nation's capitol," Senator DeWine said. "Just like all of our interns, Chey's work will be valuable this summer." 
   Korvandi-Geledar is a sophomore majoring in Psychology at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee. 
   The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute began in 1985 to promote awareness of foster children. The organization officially implemented the internship program for former foster children currently enrolled in college or graduate school in 2003. 
   Senator DeWine is a long-time proponent of providing a safe, secure and nurturing environment for foster children. The language of a bill the senator wrote, requiring the health and safety of a child be the paramount concern when determining family reunification, was included in the Adoption and Safe Families Act, signed into law in 1997. Senator DeWine also spearheaded an effort to ensure the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments Act of 2001, that provides additional grant funding for foster care services, was signed into law. He is a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. 
   Senator DeWine offers internships in his Washington, D.C. and Ohio offices, so college students can gain a insight into the legislative process. For more information, interested college students should go to Senator DeWine's website at http://dewine.senate.gov, then click on constituent services on the bottom of the homepage.
