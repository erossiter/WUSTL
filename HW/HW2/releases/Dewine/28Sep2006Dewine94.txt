SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS ATM EDUCATION FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO PROMOTE ABSTINENCE UNTIL MARRIAGE IN OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds officials at ATM Education Inc. in Sunbury for receiving a $600,000 grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families. In March, Sen. DeWine wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services supporting the grant request and explaining that it would help pay for a program to help teens remain abstinent until marriage. 
   "We must help communities break the devastating cycles of teen pregnancy, poverty and broken families," said Senator DeWine. "This program will support our teens in making the choice to remain abstinent until they are in committed, healthy marriages. I applaud the administrators at ATM Education for their efforts and I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   Directed at students age 12-18, ATM Education's program includes strong character development, guidance to make informed decisions regarding sexual behavior and other risk behaviors, and awareness of the consequences of such behavior. The program is comprised of classroom presentations, teacher training seminars and school assemblies.
