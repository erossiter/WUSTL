SEN. DEWINE BILL TO CONTINUE FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION IN GREAT LAKES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) along with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, today introduced the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 to continue providing needed resources to restore native fish and wildlife in the Great Lakes. 
   "This bill encourages coordination between federal, state, tribal, and non-governmental groups, so that all agencies are working together to preserve and protect the Great Lakes for future generations to enjoy," said Senator DeWine. "The Great Lakes are threatened by pollution, habitat loss, and the continued introduction of invasive species which negatively impact the natural food chain and habitat. By reauthorizing the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act, we are providing even more resources and new tools to move restoration in the right direction."
   This measure was first enacted in 1990 and reauthorized in 1998 to coordinate the management, protection, and restoration of fish and wildlife resources with the Great Lakes Basin. Senator DeWine's bill would reauthorize the program, ensure that both fish and wildlife are included throughout the bill and that the Act is consistent with the goals of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The grants would be authorized up to $12 million. In addition, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service would provide an annual report to states and tribes on which grants they awarded, priorities proposed for funding in the Service budget, and actions taken in support of Great Lakes Regional Collaboration.
   A new authority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be added under the reauthorization. The bill authorizes up to $6 million each year for the Service to take on projects based on recommendation by states and tribes for the regional benefit of fish and wildlife.
   This bill would instruct the Service to conduct a comprehensive study of the status and needs of the fish and wildlife resources of the Great Lakes Basin.
   The Great Lakes harbor a wide variety of fish and wildlife. More than 140 fish species and 500 species of migratory birds are found in the Basin. The Great Lakes hold one-fifth of the world's surface freshwater, cover more than 94,000 square miles, and drain more than twice as much land. Over 30 of the Basin's biological communities - and more than 100 species - are globally rare or found only in the Great Lakes Basin.
   Senator DeWine has a long history of working to protect and restore the Great Lakes, including cosponsoring the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act, to increase efforts to prevent the introduction of invasive species and to ensure a rapid response when potentially damaging species invasions occur, and sponsoring the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act a long-term initiative which provides grants to make improvements in the Great Lakes Watershed. In 2002, he sponsored the Great Lakes Legacy Act, a program that recently provided $25 million for cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Ashtabula.
