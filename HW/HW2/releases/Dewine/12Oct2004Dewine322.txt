SEN. DEWINE'S POPULAR FIREFIGHTER GRANT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION AWAITING PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) announced final House and Senate passage, Saturday, of the Dodd-DeWine FIRE Act reauthorization as a part of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal year 2005. The reauthorization extends the popular grant program for another five years. Currently, the FIRE Act initiative, now in its fourth year, has provided nearly $2 billion to local fire departments throughout the nation for a variety of training, equipment and fire prevention needs. Over this period, the FIRE Act has provided more than $50 million to local fire departments in Ohio. 
   "I am proud that we will continue providing essential grants to our nation's firefighters and other first-responders," said Senator DeWine. "Reauthorizing this successful program shows firefighters we are doing all we can so they have the training and equipment they need to protect their communities. Every year more Americans die in fires than all other natural disasters combined, and this bill helps give fire departments the tools they need to reverse this trend."
   Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Senator DeWine are the authors of the original FIRE Act, which for the first time, established a federal grant initiative explicitly designed to help firefighters throughout America obtain better equipment and improved training. The Office of Domestic Preparedness within the Department of Homeland Security is now administering the FIRE Act in conjunction with the U.S. Fire Administrator.
   This reauthorization includes important updates from the original FIRE Act that will better equip first responders to help families and provide important educational initiatives that could prevent fires. The updates in the reauthorization include:
   * Minimum National Funding for Emergency Medical Services. For the fist time a minimum national funding level for life-saving Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Fire-based EMS units and independent EMS units where fire departments do not provide the service will be eligible for coverage. Annually, a minimum of 3.5 percent of the FIRE Act funding will be set aside for EMS units.
   * Funding for Firefighter Health and Safety Research. The FIRE Act reauthorization includes funding for life saving programs, including training for an acquisition of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). Heart attacks are the number one cause of death for firefighters and having AED units on the scene of fires, as well as personnel trained to use them, may reduce the fatality rate.
   * Ease of Funding Requirements for Non-Profit Community and Advocacy Groups. Non-profit community and advocacy groups involved in fire prevention activities (including installation of smoke detectors in low-income housing and fire safety awareness training in schools) have always been eligible for funds under the FIRE Act. Previously, huge sums of matching money were required before these groups could receive grants. With the reauthorization, those strict requirements would be eliminated so more groups can apply for the competitive grants and receive these funds.
   * Increased Maximum Grant Awards. The reauthorization increases maximum grant awards to local fire departments and adjusts matching requirements to help improve access to the program for all fire departments.
   "By building on the strengths of this program and learning from the past four years, we can increase participation and enhance the ability of fire departments to respond to all types of emergencies in order to better protect and help America's families," said Senator DeWine.
   The FIRE Act is truly a success story. A January 31, 2003, report by the federal government found that 99 percent of participants were satisfied with its ability to meet the needs of their department. In addition, 97 percent of the participants reported it had "a positive impact on their ability to handle fire and fire-related incidents." The report concluded that "overall, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was highly effective in improving the readiness and capabilities of firefighters across the nation."
   The Dodd-DeWine reauthorization bill is endorsed by organizations such as the International Association of Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, National Volunteer Fire Council, National Fire Protection Association, and the Emergency Responder Safety Institute. The original bipartisan bill had 31 cosponsors.
