SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH CONTINUE FIGHT TO ERADICATE EMERALD ASH BORER
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH), along with Senators from Indiana and Michigan, today sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Michael Johanns requesting emergency funding to control the spread of the emerald ash borer beetle. Officials of the three states have asked for $45 million in emergency federal funding to fight the spread of the beetle.  
   "The invasive emerald ash borer could easily devastate the ash tree population in the region," said Senators DeWine and Voinovich. "If we don't work to solve this problem, Ohio's three billion ash trees could be destroyed, damaging the landscape of our state. Right now this issue only affects Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, but if we don't do something to solve the beetle problem, the emerald ash borer could easily spread to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and other neighboring states." 
   Currently the states have received $10 million in eradication funding through fiscal year 2006, and officials expect a total of $55 million is needed to effectively carry out identification and eradication programs.
