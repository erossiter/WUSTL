NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD FREEDOM CENTER AWARDED GRANT THROUGH SEN. DEWINE'S PROGRAM
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) applauds the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center for its selection as a recipient of a grant through the Department of Education Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Grant Program that he created as a part of the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural Act.  
   The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center will receive $1.23 million for a period of three years for educational programs at the Center. 
   "This funding will help teach a new generation of Americans about heroes from a dark chapter in our history," said Senator DeWine. "Brave groups of both Blacks and Whites worked together for freedom and liberty, taking immense personal risk. As the author of the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural Act I am pleased students of all ages can come to the Freedom Center in Cincinnati and learn this great story." 
   The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center uses exhibits, story theatres, and public programs to preserve and spread lessons about the Underground Railroad. 
   The funds are awarded as competitive grants to nonprofit educational organizations that research, display, interpret, and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad.
