SEN. DEWINE COSPONSORED MEASURE TO AID DARFUR CRISIS GOES TO PRESIDENT FOR SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced the final Emergency Supplemental, that included the Biden-DeWine Amendment to aid the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region, passed the Senate 98-1. The Biden-DeWine measure would create a Presidential Envoy for Sudan to address the genocide in the Darfur region. Sen. DeWine is the lead Republican cosponsor of the provision. 
   "A Presidential Envoy will help bring the necessary attention to improve the quality of life for the thousands of people affected by the violence created by the janjaweed militia. The Envoy is in a unique position to better help ease the conflicts in Sudan by focusing on enforcing current peace agreements and working to ease the other conflicts that plague the region," said Senator DeWine.
   The Special Envoy position would support efforts to end the conflict in Darfur, assist in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and address the other potential conflicts in Sudan, and on its boarders.
   Senator DeWine has consistently called for an end to the conflict in Darfur, and has worked to improve the humanitarian conditions there, most recently cosponsoring an amendment to the May 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act that imposes sanctions against perpetrators of crimes against humanity in the Darfur region. This provision became law May 11, 2005.
   The government of Sudan and its allied militia, known collectively as the janjaweed, has engaged in an orchestrated campaign of killing and violence against the black Africans in the western region of Darfur. The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
