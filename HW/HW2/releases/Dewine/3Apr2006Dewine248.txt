SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH RECOMMEND SARA LIOI FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIP
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that they recommended Judge Sara Lioi, of Canton, Ohio, to President George W. Bush for the position of U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio. 
   Sara Lioi joined the law firm of Day, Ketterer, Raley, Wright & Rybolt, Ltd. in the fall of 1987 and was promoted to partner in that firm in December 1993. In November 1997, during his second term as Governor, Voinovich appointed Lioi as a judge in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Central Division. She was elected to a four-year term in November of 1998 and then re-elected for a six-year term in November 2002. Lioi graduated in 1983 from Bowling Green State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree and continued her education at The Ohio State University, receiving her Juris Doctor degree in 1987.
   "We are pleased to recommend Sara Lioi to the President," said Senators DeWine and Voinovich. "We are confident that she is prepared to serve on the bench in the Northern District of Ohio."
   Sara Lioi, if nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, will fill a position that was vacated on February 14, 2006 by Judge Lesley Wells, who informed the President that he was taking senior status.
