SEN. DEWINE'S BILL WOULD ADVANCE UROLOGICAL RESEARCH
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today introduced a measure furthering training and research efforts in urology.  
 The proposed legislation seeks to establish a urological division at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is a cosponsor of the bill. The urological division would be responsible for the creation of a National Urological Diseases Data System and a National Urology Diseases Information Clearinghouse to enhance dissemination of research findings among experts. In addition, the proposal would create a ten to eighteen-member Advisory Board in charge of developing a plan for advancing Urological research in the 21st century. 
   "With this legislation we can expand research opportunities and improve infrastructure and communication between researchers," said Senator DeWine. "These improvements can better prepare us to battle diseases in the future." 
   "Each day, millions of men, women and children suffer with urologic conditions," said Senator Dodd. "With introduction of the Training and Research in Urology Act, we offer these patients a helping hand. This important legislation will greatly strengthen our nation's commitment to urological research and training." 
   The Training and Research in Urology (TRU) Act looks to bolster a promising area of science in Ohio and Connecticut, where leading research institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, Children's Hospital of Cincinnati, and Yale University are located.
