SEN. DEWINE CO-SPONSORS NATIONAL AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES ACT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) joined sponsors Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) as a co-sponsor of the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act (NAISA) of 2005.  
 This act would prevent these harmful invasive species from damaging Ohio's aquatic ecosystems and natural resources. 
   This multi-pronged approach to the problems caused by invasive species includes ballast water management programs, a screening process for planned importations of live aquatic organisms, State Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plans, ecological surveys for early detection, federal funding and resources for rapid response, increased funding and resources for dispersal barrier projects, along with education and outreach programs to inform the public. 
   Senator DeWine, co-chairman of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, stated, "Our nation suffers $137 billion of annual economic damage due to invasive species in our lakes, rivers, and waterways. We must ensure that Ohio's natural resources are not at risk from these aquatic invasive species, and this bill does just that through research, education, and updated policies." 
   As co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Senators DeWine and Levin have worked on legislation and other initiatives to protect this great natural resource. In recent years, they have secured funding for water level gauges, the electric dispersal barrier in the Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal, and sea lamprey control through the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. In addition, they have worked to prevent water from the Lakes being diverted abroad and to address harmful algal blooms.
