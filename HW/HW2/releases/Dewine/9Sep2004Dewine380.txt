SEN. DEWINE CO-SPONSORED BILL GOES TO PRESIDENT FOR HIS SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) urges the president to sign the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (S.2634) into law. Today the senate passed the final version of the bill and it now awaits the president's signature.  
 The bi-partisan bill, co-sponsored by Sen. DeWine, supports the planning and implementation of youth suicide intervention and prevention activities. 
   "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act is another step in meeting the mental health needs of our youth," Senator DeWine said. "With the early intervention outlined in this bill, we can take the necessary first steps to save the lives of our country's children and young adults." 
   The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, named in honor of Senator Gordon Smith's son, supports the provision of mental health care for youth by providing grants to states, tribes, and state-designated non-profit organizations to create a statewide plan for early intervention and prevention in schools. It also authorizes a suicide prevention resource center, which will provide information, training, and technical assistance to organizations involved in suicide prevention intervention. This act will also provide grants to colleges and universities to create or expand certain mental and behavioral health services to students. 
   Senator DeWine is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee on Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services. 
   From 1952 to 1995 the rate of suicide in children and young adults has tripled. The National Institutes of Mental Health found that suicide is the third leading cause for youth ages 15-24 years old. Data from 2003 indicates there is one counselor per 2426 students in colleges and universities with more than 15,000 students.
