SEN. DEWINE JOINS COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORT OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Judiciary Committee, today announced the Coretta Scott King-Cesar Chavez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization passed 18-0 out of the Judiciary Committee without substantive amendments. The bill will now be sent to the Senate floor for debate.  
 Sen. DeWine is an original cosponsor of the bill. "The reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act has been successful in addressing the most obvious and egregious violations of voting rights, and has helped desegregate legislative bodies at every level of government," said Sen. DeWine. "Unfortunately, there is still work to be done; more time and effort is needed to completely fulfill the promise of the Voting Rights Act and to assure every citizen that his or her 15th Amendment rights are fully available. I truly hope that after this 25 year renewal is completed, we will find that no more congressional action is necessary, and that as a society we have fulfilled the promise enshrined in our Constitution - that every American will have the equal right to vote." The Voting Rights Act was originally passed in 1965 to protect the 15th amendment right to vote, which was illegally being denied to many citizens based on their race or ethnicity. The bill was last renewed in 1982 and some of the provisions are expiring. It has been an extraordinary success and we can see its results in towns, counties, and states across the country. The Voting Rights Act has helped minority voters get their voices heard, and votes counted. This bill will help assure that all citizens have the opportunity to exercise this critical right freely and easily. The Voting Rights Act would reauthorize expiring provisions for another 25 years.
