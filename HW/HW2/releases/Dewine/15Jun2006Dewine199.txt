STABILIZATION, DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION PROVISION IN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL GOES TO PRESIDENT
  Sen. Mike DeWine today announced that the final Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, that included his Urgent Stabilization and Democratic Consolidation Package for Haiti and Liberia, passed the Senate 98 to 1. This measure includes $70 million for children's health programs, police and judicial reform, and infrastructure improvements as well as funds to increase economic opportunities. 
   "These funds would provide much needed economic and humanitarian support in Liberia and Haiti that would help the newly elected leaders stabilize their countries. These emerging nations are in a period of transition and the United States must do what we can to encourage peace and security," said Senator DeWine. "These programs would offer Liberians and Haitians hope for a brighter future."
   Liberia would receive $50 million through the Economic Support Fund for emergency employment activities, infrastructure development projects, and rule of law programs.
   Haiti would receive $17.5 million in Economic Support Funds for economic opportunities, and police, judicial, and legal reforms. In addition, Haiti would receive $2.5 million in Child Survival and Health funds for children and maternal healthcare.
   The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
