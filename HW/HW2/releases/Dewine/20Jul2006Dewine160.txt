  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, and Judiciary Appropriations bill that includes $1.2 million in funding for Northwest Ohio projects. 
   "These worthy Northwest Ohio projects will help make our roads safer and ensure that manufacturing students are working with the some of the best equipment available," said Senator DeWine. "One of my priorities on the Appropriations Committee is to work with my colleagues to ensure worthy projects receive funding they need."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following Northwest Ohio projects:
   Rhodes State College
   * Preparing an Advanced Manufacturing Workforce - $200,000 for the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment for an Integrated Manufacturing Center.
   Ohio Department of Transportation
   * Allen County S.R.309 - $1 million for safety improvements along S.R.309 in Allen County including road widening, signalization, and turn lane additions.
   Senator DeWine also helped secure funding for the following statewide project:
   Ohio Public Transit Association
   * Statewide Bus Replacement - $6 million to purchase replacement buses that will be lift equipped and thus will help meet the requirements mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Many of the buses will be equipped with newer, cleaner burning engines that will help meet the mandates of the Clean Air Act Amendments.
   "I am pleased that money will be going to purchase new buses for the Ohio Public Transit Association," said Senator DeWine. "The new fleet of buses will be handicap accessible and will help reduce pollution to keep Ohio's air clean."
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
