SEN. DEWINE REACTS TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  "I am very pleased that the President spoke in detail about our Nation's need for energy independence.  
 This country must make a dramatic shift toward the use of alternative sources of energy. We can no longer rely on OPEC. The world is moving forward, and eventually, we will have to switch to new fuels and other sources of energy, like fuel cells, clean coal technologies, wind, and solar power. We can either be the developers and sellers of these new technologies, or we can be the buyers. If we don't act, someone else - somewhere else - will. Do we want these technologies to have a stamp on them that says 'made in China or Europe' or 'made in America?' The bottom line is this: Energy can be a great economic engine and jobs creator of our future. If we act now, those can be Ohio jobs. They can be American jobs. And that is where this country must go."
