SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS MIAMI CONSERVANCY DISTRICT FOR CONSERVATION INNOVATION GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds The Miami Conservancy District as a Conservation Innovation grant recipient from the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Services.  
 Senator DeWine wrote to officials at the Department of Agriculture supporting the grant request and explaining that the $935,000 grant would help build a collaborative conservation effort between public wastewater treatment plants and agricultural producers within the Great Miami watershed. 
   "This grant will help The Miami Conservancy District produce direct environmental and economic benefits for the region," said Senator DeWine. "I believe the efforts of District workers will serve as a model for improved rural-urban partnerships." 
   The Great Miami River watershed covers more than 4,000 square miles. The quality of the water in the Great Miami River and its tributaries are critical to the one million people who rely on it for drinking water, agriculture, and industrial processes.
