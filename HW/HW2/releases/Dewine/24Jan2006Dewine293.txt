SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS SOUTHWEST OHIO ORGANIZATIONS FOR YOUTHBUILD GRANTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds a Southwest Ohio community organization for receiving a $700,000 grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) YouthBuild Program.  
 The YouthBuild program enables young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 to complete their high school education and achieve on-the-job training in construction skills. Students build or renovate single family homes and multi-family apartments which are sold at affordable prices, to low- and very low-income persons as well as homeless individuals and families. A longtime supporter of the program, Senator DeWine sent letters to appropriators supporting its funding. 
   "YouthBuild is an inspiring program that dramatically improves the lives of young people by channeling their energies into serving others," said Senator DeWine. "The program's emphasis on education, job skills, and community service works to better the lives of thousands of teens each year. I have met many of the hopeful young people this program supports, and I have seen first-hand that the program works." 
   An area organization won competitive grants from HUD for fiscal year 2006 including: 
   * ISUS, Inc. (Dayton) - $700,000 
   Founded in 1990, YouthBuild USA is a national nonprofit organization that works to unleash the positive energy of low-income young people to rebuild their communities and their lives. It supports an expanding nationwide network of more than 200 local YouthBuild programs. Strong emphasis is placed on leadership development, community service, and the creation of a positive mini-community of adults and youth committed to success. In total, 11 Ohio organizations received $5.8 million in YouthBuild program funding.
