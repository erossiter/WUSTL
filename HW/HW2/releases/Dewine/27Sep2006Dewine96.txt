SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT IN REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION SITE SELECTION
  Today, the RNC Convention Site Selection Committee announced that Minneapolis was chosen over Cleveland to be the site for the 2008 Republican National Convention. Sens. Mike DeWine and George V. Voinovich, who worked to bring the convention to Cleveland, today expressed their disappointment:
   "We are disappointed that the 2008 Republican National Convention is not coming to Cleveland," said Senators DeWine and Voinovich. "Cleveland really put its best foot forward, led by the outstanding effort by Mayor Frank Jackson with the help of the business community and many others."
