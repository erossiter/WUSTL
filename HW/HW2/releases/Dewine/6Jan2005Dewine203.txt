SEN'S DEWINE CALLS POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS TO OHIO ELECTORS ?ABSURD'
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) called it "absurd" that Ohio's electors will be challenged in Congress today. Sen.  
 DeWine said the charges that have been made about Ohio's election are "wild, incoherent and completely unsubstantiated." 
   Press reports indicate that during the counting of the Electoral College today that some members of the United States House and a member of the United States Senate will object to the seating of Ohio's electors. 
   "If Ohio's electors are challenged, I think it will be a sad day for the United States Congress. I can hardly believe that this could happen on the floor of the United States Senate. All objective observers in Ohio know that President Bush carried the state of Ohio. Even John Kerry's Ohio lawyer stated such this week: 
   "Daniel J. Hoffheimer, Ohio legal counsel for the Kerry-Edwards campaign said he's not aware of any senator who will join the challenge. 'None of these problems (in Ohio) so far adds up to conspiracy or fraud or enough votes to change the outcome,' Hoffheimer said." (Mark Niquette, "Kerry's Supporters Continue Challenge," The Columbus Dispatch, 1/4/05
