SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS MILLERSBURG FOR RECEIVING FIRE SAFETY GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Holmes Fire District #1, which serves Millersburg, for receiving $101,353 as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention and Safety Grant (FP&S) Program. The purpose of these grants is to enhance the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and fire-related hazards.  
   "I am pleased to know that Millersburg families will benefit from this grant," said Senator DeWine, Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Caucus. "Investing in fire prevention saves lives and resources. By working to pass and fund the FIRE Act, we have ensured that fire departments in Ohio and elsewhere will have the resources to meet future service demands. By funding grant programs like Fire Prevention and Safety, we can limit that demand, helping stop fires before they start." 
   Senator DeWine wrote and passed the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act (S. 1941) in 2000, establishing grant programs, such as the FP&S, dedicated to providing federal assistance to local fire departments and fire prevention programs. Senator DeWine's legislation increased the federal commitment to firefighting, emergency response services and fire prevention. During the fiscal year 2006 appropriations process, Senator DeWine, a member of the Appropriations Committee, helped secure $545 million for the FIRE Act. 
   According to the United States Fire Administration, more than 2,500 children age 14 or younger were injured or killed in residential fires in 2004. Of these casualties, approximately 50 percent were under the age of five. Overall, fire is responsible for killing more Americans than all natural disasters combined.
