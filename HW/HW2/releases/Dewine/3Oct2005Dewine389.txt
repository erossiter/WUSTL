SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF MIERS FOR ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) on President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the United States Supreme Court:  
   "As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I take very seriously the Senate's role in providing advice and consent with regard to a President's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States and I look forward to our hearings on her nomination. I hope and anticipate that Ms. Miers will be treated with the same decency and respect that the Committee extended to Chief Justice Roberts. 
   "Ms. Miers has been a trailblazer for women in the legal profession. She was the first woman hired at a large Dallas law firm, the first woman elected president of that firm, and the first woman elected president of the Texas Bar Association. She has the kind of real-world, practical experience that I believe is important for our justices to have. I have been impressed with my interactions with her while she has served as President Bush's White House Counsel."
