SEN. DEWINE WORKS TO EASE TRANSITIONS FOR YOUTH CHANGING SCHOOLS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) applauds the final senate passage Friday of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) that includes language he sponsored that helps homeless and foster children with disabilities overcome barriers they face to receiving special education services.  
   "All students deserve a quality education in an environment where they feel safe and secure," said Senator DeWine. "This legislation would allow teachers, administrators and advocates to better serve students with special needs. Speeding up a student's transition between schools is necessary for them to continue towards educational success." 
   Measures included in the IDEA reauthorization that would help homeless and foster children include: 
   * An improvement in special education services and coordination of cervices for children with disabilities who change school schools. This legislation would allow an Individual Education Plan (IEP) to follow a student through their transition to a new school. An IEP is required for each child with a disability. The language included in this bill would allow the child's IEP from the previous school to follow the student to the new school and allow them to begin receiving services immediately based on that IEP until a new one is created or the original is adopted. 
   * A clarification about who can be the advocate for children when their parents cannot be found or are not capable of consenting to special education services. 
   * An improved coordination between McKinney-Vento and IDEA The McKinney-Vento law created a range of programs that aid the homeless youth. This bill would ensure that the requirements of the McKinney-Vento law are better coordinated with IDEA so homeless children receive better, more complementary services. 
   * Representatives of the foster care community and McKinney-Vento liaisons would participate on state advisory panels to provide policy guidance on special education issues specific to foster care and homeless youth. 
   The bill must now go to the president for his signature.
