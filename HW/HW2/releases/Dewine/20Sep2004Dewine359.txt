SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE OHIO MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Senate unanimously approved more than $32 million in Ohio military construction projects, including $2.225 million for the Army National Guard to build a new Organizational Maintenance Shop in Columbus.  
   The funds were approved as part of the 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate today by a vote of 91-0. The bill now goes to a joint House-Senate Conference Committee which will resolve the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill. 
   "Reassessing the military's needs is a continual process, and as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to secure funding for a new National Guard Maintenance Shop in Columbus," said Senator DeWine. "Providing the military with the resources they need to protect our nation is essential in fighting the War on Terrorism." 
   "Our military is playing a critical role at home and abroad in defending our nation against terrorism. In this difficult time the whole is only as strong as each individual part and it's essential that we don't lose sight of that. The role of the National Guard is a vital part of these efforts, which is why I'm pleased we were able to secure these funds to help ensure that their equipment is kept in top condition," said Voinovich. 
   The Senate bill also provides $30.321 million for construction projects at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.
