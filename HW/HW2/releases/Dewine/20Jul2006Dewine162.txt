SEN. DEWINE SECURES PROVISIONS TO HELP VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which includes a number of provisions to help veterans get the healthcare they deserve. The bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration. 
   "Given the many sacrifices our troops are making everyday, it is only appropriate that we provide veterans with outstanding, ongoing medical care," said Senator DeWine. "These provisions will help us better understand the effects of combat on mental health and lower the cost and improve the quality of care at our Veterans hospitals. I am glad other members of the committee agreed that these provisions should be included and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure they remain in the final version of the bill."
   Senator DeWine secured the following provisions for Veterans Affairs:
   * Vietnam Veterans Mental Health Study - This provision requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to conduct a study on the long term effects of combat exposure on mental health and social assistance requirements for Vietnam veterans. The results of the study would not only help the VA to better understand the long-term mental health and social needs of Vietnam veterans, but could prepare the VA for the long-term needs of returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are returning in record numbers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
   * Expanded Purchasing Options for the VA - This provision allows the VA to purchase medical equipment from companies that are not on the General Services Administration schedule if the equipment meets all specifications and warranty requirements while providing a more economical solution. This would help VA hospitals limit operating expenses while maintaining quality healthcare.
   * Blinded Veterans Outpatient Services - This provision strengthens language related to blinded veterans outpatient services. Ohio has over 4700 blinded veterans. Currently, if these veterans require inpatient care, they must travel to Illinois. With the language and associated funding in this bill, Ohio would gain outpatient specialists to service veterans in the Cleveland, Chillicothe, Dayton, and Cincinnati areas.
