SEN. DEWINE, HAITIAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PREVAL DISCUSS ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today welcomed Haitian President-Elect René Préval to his Washington, D.C. office. 
   Senator DeWine congratulated President-Elect Préval on his successful election and his upcoming inauguration. They discussed issues of mutual concern including securing and stabilizing Haiti, ensuring the basic needs of Haitians are met, and strengthening the rule of law in the developing country.
   "I look forward to a new chapter for Haitians when President-Elect Préval begins his term, it is essential that our two nations, and the international community work together to improve the quality of life for people living in Haiti," said Senator DeWine. "I've seen first-hand the living conditions in Haiti where more than 80 percent of the population lives in poverty. While the United States can't 'fix' Haiti, we can help improve the situation and help Haiti help itself."
   Senator DeWine has traveled to Haiti numerous times during his tenure in the Senate, most recently in September of 2005 when he was invited by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to join a delegation to show support for Haiti's presidential election.
   Haiti is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere and Senator DeWine is focused on helping Haiti's humanitarian needs, as well as development projects that promote a stable Haitian government and encourage Haiti's participation in the world market. In addition to securing $196 million in recent appropriations bills for humanitarian needs, Child Survival Health Programs, narcotics control and enforcement, economic development and job creation, Senator DeWine is currently working with his colleagues to pass the Haiti Economic Recovery and Opportunity (HERO) Act which encourages Haiti to make further economic, political, and social reforms.
