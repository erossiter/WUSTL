   "These worthy Southwest Ohio projects will help improve our roads and make daily commutes more manageable," said Senator DeWine. "One of my priorities on the Appropriations Committee is to work with my colleagues to ensure worthy projects receive funding they need."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following Southwest Ohio projects:
   Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden

   * Greene County SR-72 Safety Improvement Projects - $500,000 for widening, grading, paving and other general safety improvements to State Route 72.
   Clark State Community College

   Senator DeWine also helped secure funding for the following statewide project:
   Ohio Public Transit Association
   * Statewide Bus Replacement - $6 million to purchase replacement buses that will be lift equipped and thus will help meet the requirements mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
