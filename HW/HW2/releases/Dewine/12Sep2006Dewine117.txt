SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SECURE $1.2 MILLION FOR SOUTHWEST OHIO REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority has received $1.2 million from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of buses. The senators secured these funds through the appropriations process. 
   "In our fight for energy independence, we must continue to expand and improve our public transportation systems so that they are an attractive alternative for all Ohioans," Sen. DeWine said. "Additional buses for the Banks is a good step forward."
   "Due to our current energy crisis, it is critical that we continue to improve our public transportation systems," Sen. Voinovich said. "We must promote usage and make our public transportation systems more efficient, affordable and accessible."
   This grant will provide funds to purchase up to five buses for service to the Banks intermodal facility in Cincinnati.
