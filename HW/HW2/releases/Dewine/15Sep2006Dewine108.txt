  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) introduced a resolution last night that would designate September as "National American History and Heritage Month." The resolution highlights the importance of understanding our history and pays tribute to the Founding Fathers and the many patriots who built our nation. It would encourage more organizations, including schools, businesses and faith communities, to spread interest and foster respect for understanding America's history and heritage. 
   "The importance of learning and appreciating American history cannot be understated," said Senator DeWine. "By understanding our history, we learn about the past as a way to shape the future, helping all of us to be informed and active citizens. We also honor the great men and women who built this country by remembering their great work and sacrifices."
   "Understanding the history of our great democracy is vital to appreciating the tenants of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness on which our country was founded," Sen. Voinovich said. "I am reminded of our nation's heritage every day in the hallowed halls of Congress. It is critical that future generations remember the historic struggle of our forefathers and learn from their sacrifices."
