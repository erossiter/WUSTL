SEN. DEWINE SEEKS RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL STALKING AWARENESS MONTH
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today introduced a resolution calling for the establishment of a National Stalking Awareness Month.  
 A National Stalking Awareness Month would create an opportunity to educate Americans about stalking as well as applaud the efforts of the many victim service providers, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and national and community organizations dedicated to raising awareness of this crime. 
   "Stalking is an issue that cuts across all lines of race, age or gender," said Senator DeWine. "With rapidly advancing technology, I fear that stalking will become even more common and the perpetrators will become harder to catch. We can and we should do more to ensure that stalkers are brought to justice and that their victims are not forced to live in fear." 
   An estimated 1 in 12 women and 1 in 45 men will be affected by stalking during their lifetime. Current statistics from the National Center for Victims of Crime indicate that 81 percent of women stalked by an intimate partner are also physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 percent of women who are killed by an intimate partner were also stalked by their killer.
