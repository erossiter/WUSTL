SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS OPERATION KEEPSAKE FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO PROMOTE ABSTINENCE UNTIL MARRIAGE IN OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds officials at Operation Keepsake in Mayfield for receiving a $459,419 grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families. In June, Sen. DeWine wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services supporting the grant request and explaining that it would help pay for a program to help teens remain abstinent until marriage. 
   "Operation Keepsake has 18 successful years of experience helping thousands of teens learn the complementary messages of abstinence until marriage and the value of marriage," said Senator DeWine. "This program will support our teens in making the choice to remain abstinent until they are in committed, healthy marriages. I applaud the administrators at Operation Keepsake for their efforts and I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   Operation Keepsake is a nonprofit, school-based program with the mission of encouraging sexual abstinence until marriage to a target population of ages 12-18. Their FOR KEEPS program will empower teens to cultivate strong character and effective communication skills, while remaining sexually abstinent until marriage so that they can ultimately establish committed marriages and strong families in the future.
