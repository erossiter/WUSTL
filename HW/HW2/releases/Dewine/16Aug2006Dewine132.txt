SEN. DEWINE SECURES $248,000 FOR YOUNGSTOWN TECHNOLOGY CENTER CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Mike DeWine today announced that Youngstown Central Area Community Improvement Corporation leaders will begin receiving funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for construction of the Youngstown Technology Center. Sen. DeWine secured $248,000 in the Senate version of the FY05 Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. Sen. DeWine also fought for this funding to be included in the conference report as well. It was signed into law in December of 2004. 
   "This funding will help Youngstown retain and attract high-tech businesses that have the potential to offer more jobs to area residents and spur continued economic development in the Mahoning Valley," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "These are the kind of jobs and industries that will help Youngstown and Ohio better compete in the expanding global marketplace."
   When complete the Center will house information technology firms that will benefit from being located close to the Youngstown Business Incubator and Youngstown State University. The Youngstown Central Area Community Improvement Corporation estimates that when complete, the Center's businesses could employ more than 200 workers and could generate more than $332,000 dollars in City income tax revenue.
   Senator DeWine has secured an additional $1.3 million for this project in the fiscal year 2007 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill that has been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The bill is currently being considered by the full Senate.
