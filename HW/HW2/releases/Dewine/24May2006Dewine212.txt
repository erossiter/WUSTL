SEN. DEWINE RESOLUTION DESIGNATING JUNE AS 'NATIONAL SAFETY MONTH' PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) applauds his Senate colleagues for passing his resolution that continues to promote public safety nationwide by designating June 2006 as "National Safety Month". The Senate passed the resolution late last night by unanimous consent. Cosponsors included Sens. Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), George Allen (R-VA), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Sen. John Isakson (R-GA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA). This year, the National Safety Council has selected "Making Our World A Safer Place" as the theme for National Safety Month. "The goal of National Safety Month is to raise public awareness about safety and injury prevention in hopes of reducing these needless deaths and injuries," said Sen. DeWine. "Public safety in the workplace, in our homes, in communities, and on our roads and highways is a vital challenge that we all face." 
   According to the National Safety Council, more than 20 million Americans suffer disabling injuries and 100,000 people die from their injuries each year. In the United States, nearly 43,000 people die every year from motor vehicle crashes, making auto fatalities the number one killer of those between the ages of 4 and 34. Many of these deaths and injuries can be prevented with proper education and precautionary measures.
   June was selected to focus the nation's efforts on public safety since the summer season is traditionally a time of increased unintentional injuries and fatalities. Throughout the month, the National Safety Council and other safety organizations will urge businesses to increase their standards of safety in the workplace and provide information to individuals regarding injury prevention in homes, communities, and on roads and highways.
