SEN. DEWINE SUPPORTS OHIO MANUFACTURERS WITH AMENDMENT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Centers could receive crucial added funding because of an amendment included in the fiscal Year 2005 Department of Appropriations bill that is headed to the President for his signature.  
   "I am proud to co-sponsor an amendment that will help save necessary jobs and maintain services provided by at Manufacturing Extension Partnership centers in Ohio and across the country," Senator DeWine said. "These partnerships produce tremendous results. In fiscal year 2002, the program helped the nation's manufacturers generate $635 million in news sales, retain more than $1.5 billion in sales and create or retain 25,000 jobs. It is my hope that this amendment will allow the Department of Commerce to help Ohio's manufacturing companies continue to prosper and create more jobs." 
   The amendment, co-sponsored by Senator DeWine, gives the Secretary of Commerce the legal authority to appropriate funds to support the MEP program. MEP centers are under-funded and without additional funding, could face elimination, jobs cuts, or discontinued services. 
   MEP centers across the country are recognized as cost-effective, public-private partnerships that help small and mid-size manufacturers modernize and compete in the expanding global market. Ohio has two MEP centers: CAMP, based in Cleveland, serves northern Ohio and TechSolve, based in Cincinnati, serves southern Ohio. In 2003, these two centers created a net economic impact of more than $400 million in Ohio and created or retained 814 jobs. These two MEP centers have work to assisted more than 1,600 Ohio manufacturing companies each year.
