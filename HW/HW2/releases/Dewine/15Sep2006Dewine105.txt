SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES GRANTS TO PROTECT CLEVELAND CHILDREN, FAMILIES FROM DANGEROUS LEAD, OTHER HOME HAZARDS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that Cleveland will be awarded two grants totaling $5 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. The grants will be used to protect Cleveland's children from the dangers of lead poisoning and other home hazards. 
   "Ohio's families deserve safe and healthy homes to raise their kids," said Senator DeWine. "These grants will protect some of the most vulnerable families in Cleveland from the deadly effects of lead poisoning and other home hazards. I applaud the Department of Housing and Urban Development for their continued efforts to end childhood lead poisoning."
   The City of Cleveland Department of Health will be awarded $4 million in federal funds to conduct lead hazard control interventions in 333 private housing units for low-or very low income families with children under the age of six. The grant comes from HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant program.
   Additionally, the Cuyahoga County Board of Health (CCBH) will be awarded $1 million in federal funds to partner with existing Weatherization Programs, managed by the Cleveland Housing Network and the Cuyahoga County Department of Development, in order to provide an integrated approach to asthma trigger reduction. The targeted families will be very-low income and will qualify for Weatherization assistance as well as lead hazard control. This grant comes from HUD's Healthy Homes Demonstration grant program.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control addresses childhood lead-based paint poisoning and other childhood diseases associated with poor housing conditions. It promotes preventive measures to correct multiple safety and health hazards in the home environment.
