SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE CENTRAL OHIO DEFENSE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SENATE FUNDING BILL
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Senate approved $719.45 million in Ohio defense projects for fiscal year 2005.  
   The funds were approved as part of the 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate late last night by a vote of 96-0. It now goes to the President for his signature. 
   "Defense preparedness must be a priority in our war on terrorism," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have secured funding on behalf of Ohio's military installations and projects. We must continue to provide our men and women in the armed forces with the strength and capability necessary in this tumultuous time." "With new challenges to our national security it's more important than ever that our armed forces are ready, equipped, and well-trained. Fundamental to that is making sure our troops have at their disposal the most cutting-edge resources available and these funds help guarantee that by investing heavily in the advanced research and manufacturing that we do so well in Ohio," said Voinovich. 
   The following area projects were included in the bill: 
   * LSP Technologies, Dublin, Laser Peening for U.S. Army Helicopters/F119 - $2 million to help fund the research and development of laser peening which will increase service life and reliability of helicopter parts. Laser peening helps prevents components from fretting fatigue-wear that results when two pieces of metal rub against each other-which can cause fracture, failure, and can require the replacement of parts. 
   * Edison Welding Institute, Columbus, Materials Joining for Army Weapons Systems - $2.6 million to fund research and development efforts in advanced materials joining for next generation combat systems. 
   * Battelle, Columbus, Long Range Biometric Target Identification System - $2 million to help fund research and development efforts that would allow individual human beings to be identified from a long distance. This program will prove especially helpful to military Special Operations units who often rely on stealth, and distance to safely execute their missions. 
   * Specialized Technical Training Services, Columbus, Low Profile Night Vision Goggles - $2.1 million to procure night vision goggles with advanced characteristics: rugged construction, binocular vision, see-through capability, waterproof, heads-up display, and which can be used in weapons operations without requiring laser-aiming devices. 
   * Statewide, Metals Affordability Initiative - $7.5 million to research and improve advanced aerospace metals manufacturing processes to reduce costs and maintain the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. Participating organizations include Brush Wellman, Edison Welding Institute, GE Engines, The Ohio State University, and RTI Titanium. 
   * Nationwide, Lockheed Martin, C-5 In-Service Modifications - $103.1 million for the procurement of 12 AMP kits that replace several difficult to maintain components and upgrade C-5 cockpits with modern avionics and flight instrumentation. Nationwide, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Operational Funding - $1.7 million to provide operational funding for the Cadet program, aimed at the development of young men and women ages 11 to 17 years old, by promoting interest and skill in seamanship and aviation and instilling qualities in Cadets that mold strong moral character and self-discipline.
