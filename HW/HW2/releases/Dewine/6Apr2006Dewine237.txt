SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS MIDWEST ELECTRIC FOR RECEIVING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds officials at Midwest Electric in St. Mary's for receiving a grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The grant will help to establish a Revolving Loan Fund for the creation of new jobs and any other economic development needs that may arise. In May of 2005, Sen. DeWine wrote to USDA officials supporting the grant request, explaining that the $300,000 grant would help Midwest Electric continue the efforts to create new jobs in west central Ohio. 
   "This project will help to create jobs and strengthen the economy in central Ohio," said Senator DeWine. "This money will give families new opportunities. I applaud the administrators at Midwest Electric for their efforts and thank the Department of Agriculture for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   Revolving Loan Funds are used in the development and finance of businesses and communities that are located in rural areas. They are used by intermediaries and money is dispersed from debt payments made by previous loan recipients. Midwest Electric is a customer-owned, customer driven electric cooperative providing electric services to more than 9,700 homes, farms and businesses in Allen, Auglaize, Mercer, Van Wert, Darke, Shelby and Putnam counties.
