SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHWEST OHIO PROJECT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced federal funding for Ohio economic development projects included in the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill.  
 The Senate Appropriations Committee passed the bill and it now goes to the full Senate for consideration. 
   "This worthy project would improve Defiance County's Senior Center, thereby improving the quality of life for the growing senior population in the area. This Center would provide social, educational, and welfare opportunities for older adults living in the area," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding for this project is included in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional project: 
   Defiance County Commissioners for Defiance County Senior Services 
   Defiance County Senior Service Center - $300,000 for the construction of a new one-story senior center for older adults. The center has outgrown its current location and a new building would provide additional space for a library/computer lab, meal prep area, dining/community room, craft/exercise area, storage area, reception area, and office space.
