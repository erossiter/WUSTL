SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR FAA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated funding for Northeast Ohio transit projects when it passed the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill.  
 The bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration. 
   "Ensuring that Ohio's airport facilities are safe and up-to-date, so that employees can do their jobs efficiently is essential to keeping Ohio families and visitors safe in the skies," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Modernizing and expanding the Air Traffic Control Tower at Cleveland Hopkins allows for future growth and could make the region more attractive to businesses that may provide the next generation of jobs for Cleveland." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following Northeast Ohio projects: 
   CLEVELAND HOPKINS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
   * Construction of Replacement Air Traffic Control Tower - $18.225 million for the construction of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control Tower and TRACON that will modernize and expand existing facilities to accommodate layout changes to the airport and future air growth. The existing tower is too small according to FAA standards. 
   * Current Air Traffic Control Tower Improvements - $154,500 for improvements to the current Air Traffic Control tower including installing a new roof and replacing the siding. These necessary improvement projects will improve the working conditions and the physical facilities until the replacement tower is built.
