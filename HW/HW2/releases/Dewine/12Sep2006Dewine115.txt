SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SECURE OVER $100,000 FOR LORAIN COUNTY TRANSIT BOARD
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Lorain County Transit Board has received $101,333 from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of replacement vans. The senators secured these funds through the appropriations process. 
   "In our fight for energy independence, we must continue to expand and improve our public transportation systems so that they are an attractive alternative for all Ohioans," Sen. DeWine said. "These additional ADA compliant vans for Lorain County will expand access to public transportation for those who need it most."
   "Due to our current energy crisis, it is critical that we continue to improve our public transportation systems," Sen. Voinovich said. "We must promote usage and make our public transportation systems more efficient, affordable and accessible."
   This grant will provide funds to purchase three replacement vans for the Lorain County Transit Board. The vans will be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act and will increase accessibility to transit patrons.
