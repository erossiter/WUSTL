SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES EDUCATION GRANT AFFECTING STUDENTS IN 29 OHIO COUNTIES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Ohio Historical Society for receiving a Congressional Academies for Students of American History and Civics Program grant from the Department of Education. The $336,918 grant will help the Ohio Historical Society and regional Education Service Centers as they facilitate a Local History Field School for teams of American history and civics students from Ohio's Appalachian region. 
   "Eighty students a year will be able to attend the Local History Field School for a week in the summer to better understand American history and civics. Then during the next school year, they will be part of a core group of students who will participate in history/civics-oriented local service-learning programs," said Senator DeWine. "By understanding our past, students gain a better understanding of where the country's headed, and may be more likely to take an active role in their local government and community as they grow older. I am pleased the Department of Education, recognized the impact the Field School will have on area students."
   The Field School will cover the development of the democratic model of government at the federal, state, and local levels. The follow-up service-learning program is aimed at instilling critical leadership and management skills in the participants, as well as sufficiently reinforcing the Field School curriculum.
   In April 2006, Senator DeWine sent a letter to Department of Education officials bringing the Ohio Historical Society's grant application to their attention and asking they review it for consideration.
   The Ohio Historical Society will partner with Ohio University, Marietta College, Rio Grande University, the State Archives of Ohio, the Ross County Historical Society, the Athens County Historical Society and the Perry-Hocking Educational Service Center to form the Field School.
