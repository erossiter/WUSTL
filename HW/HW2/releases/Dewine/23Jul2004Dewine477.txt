SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE MIAMI VALLEY DEFENSE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SENATE FUNDING BILL
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Senate approved $719.45 million in Ohio defense projects for fiscal year 2005. 
   The funds were approved as part of the 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate late last night by a vote of 96-0. It now goes to the President for his signature.  
   "Defense preparedness must be a priority in our war on terrorism," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have secured funding on behalf of Ohio's military installations and projects. We must continue to provide our men and women in the armed forces with the strength and capability necessary in this tumultuous time." "With new challenges to our national security it's more important than ever that our armed forces are ready, equipped, and well-trained. Fundamental to that is making sure our troops have at their disposal the most cutting-edge resources available and these funds help guarantee that by investing heavily in the advanced research and manufacturing that we do so well in Ohio," said Voinovich. 
   The following area projects were included in the bill: 
   * Alion, Dayton, Fleet Capability Assessment - $1.3 million to help fund the final development of the Fleet Capability Assessment program, which will be housed at Wright-Pat and which seeks to better improve fleet coordination and activity. 
   * Wright-Pat, Dayton, Advanced Composite Manufacturing Techniques for Unmanned Air Vehicles - $2 million to automate composite fabrication processes to produce low-cost components for unmanned air vehicles. Selected components will be designed, manufactured and tested to be used in active vehicle programs. 
   * Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Pat, Aeronautical Acquisition Data Repository - $1 million for the purchase of information technology services, including hardware and software to establish an aeronautical enterprise acquisition database. Energy Storage Technologies Inc., Montgomery County, Portable Low-Power Blood Cooling and Storage Devices (HEMOCOOL) - $1.1 million to acquire units that have the special capability of both storing pre-chilled blood at 50 degrees Fahrenheit and cooling blood that is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This device complies with the new Marine action doctrine requiring small units deployed for fast penetration beyond shore lines to treat bleeding wounds. 
   * Wright Brothers Institute at Wright-Pat, Dayton, Nanostructured Materials for Advanced Air Systems - $3.6 million to help fund the research and development of nanostractured materials, which hold the promise of improved performance in areas such as embedded sensors, self-diagnostic structural panels, electromagnetic shielding, embedded antennas and superior barrier properties for liners, tanks, ducting and ablatives. 
   * TPI Composites, Clark County, All-Composite Military Vehicle - $4.5 million for research on a composite vehicle that is faster, more mobile, more transportable, easier to maintain, and less detectable. 
   * Renaissance Services Inc., Clark County, Electronic Industry-wide Network for Characteristics and Specifications - $1 million to improve the electronic flow of data used in the production of military components which will improve the Air Force's support of aging and deployed aircraft. 
   * Wright State University, Dayton, Receiver and Processing Concepts Evaluation Program - $1 million to provide the U.S. Air Force with university-based research for Electronic Warfare (EW). Research will target algorithms and methodologies that maximize EW capability while minimizing power and size requirements. 
   * TSP, Dayton, Information Assurance Initiative - $1 million for key IT upgrades that will significantly enhance security and emergency response to physical threats and natural disasters. 
   * Intermec Technologies Corporation, Dayton, Point of Maintenance/Combat Ammunition System Initiative - $6 million to ensure that information related to all maintenance activities and munitions configurations are efficiently and accurately collected, tracked, and reported in an electronic form by utilizing commercial computer technology. 
   * Wright Brothers Institute at Wright-Pat, Dayton, Air Force Knowledge Service - $2.8 million for the procurement of hardware, software, and technical services to permit the Air Force to continue leveraging the powerful decision-support capability currently in use by commercial market leaders in travel, transportation, telecommunications, banking, and retail sales. 
   * Wright Brothers Institute at Wright-Pat, Dayton, Capabilities Planning Support - $3.3 million to develop a family of systems that provides the optimum balance of fielded capability across task forces for the investment required through Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&A) environment and architecture. 
   * University of Dayton, Dayton, Durable Hybrid Coatings for Aircraft Systems - $1 million to help develop a multi-functional, durable coating system that will require the integration of materials research with innovative formulation of complete coating systems, and entail the concurrent development of life prediction capabilities. 
   * Northrop Grumman, Greene and Montgomery counties, Enterprise Availability and Cost Optimization System - $1 million to help fund the U.S. Air Force's office to correct aging aircraft problems. These dollars would help fund a standardized approach to modernizing the aircraft as well as finding out what makes aircraft unavailable. 
   * ICAD Inc., Greene County, Computer Aided Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer - $1.1 million to help improve breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. 
   * Wright Materials Research Company, Greene County, Ultra-Lightweight Composites for Ballistic and Bomb Protection - $1 million to help develop an ultra-lightweight structural armor material utilizing Kevlar and carbon fabrics for fiber reinforcement and a microcellular foam matrix based on poly(ether-imide) or liquid crystalline polymers. 
   * Triune Software, Inc., Greene County, Computational Tools for Materials Development Program - $1 million to fund a program designed to leverage rapid developments in computational technologies-both hardware and software-to help the Air Force extend the life of existing materials and to help with the development of new materials. 
   * Defense Research Associates, Greene County, Affordable Visible Missile Warning System - $3.3 million to help develop a missile warning system based on the same detector technology used in commercial MiniDV cameras. 
   * Statewide, Metals Affordability Initiative - $7.5 million to research and improve advanced aerospace metals manufacturing processes to reduce costs and maintain the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. Participating organizations include Brush Wellman, Edison Welding Institute, GE Engines, The Ohio State University, and RTI Titanium. 
   * Nationwide, Lockheed Martin, C-5 In-Service Modifications - $103.1 million for the procurement of 12 AMP kits that replace several difficult to maintain components and upgrade C-5 cockpits with modern avionics and flight instrumentation. Nationwide, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Operational Funding - $1.7 million to provide operational funding for the Cadet program, aimed at the development of young men and women ages 11 to 17 years old, by promoting interest and skill in seamanship and aviation and instilling qualities in Cadets that mold strong moral character and self-discipline.
