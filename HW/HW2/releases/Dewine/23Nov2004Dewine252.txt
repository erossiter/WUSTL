SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH CALL FOR DEMOCRACY TO PREVAIL IN UKRAINE
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) are extremely concerned and disappointed with the conduct of Sunday's run-off elections in Ukraine.  
 Based on evidence collected by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, non-governmental organizations and other observers, including Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it is clear that there was significant fraud and abuse. 
   "The people of Ukraine deserve free and fair elections," said Senators DeWine and Voinovich. "It is wonderful to see the robust stand for democracy the citizens are making as they take to the streets to demand that their votes be counted and their voices be heard."
   Senators DeWine and Voinovich continued, "We would like to see the Government of Ukraine recognize the right of the people to peacefully demonstrate. We also urge all citizens of Ukraine to not resort to violence. We strongly urge the Government of Ukraine to conduct an investigation and be forthcoming about their findings. We have the utmost faith that the Ukrainian people will continue to work toward a more democratic and transparent electoral process and we can assure them that they have the support of Congress and the American people."
