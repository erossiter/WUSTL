OHIO TO RECEIVE $51.5 MILLION TO REPAIR ROADS DAMAGED BY WINTER STORMS
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) today applaud officials at the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for receiving $51.5 million in reimbursement through emergency funds from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration. The money will be used to pay for repairs to roads damaged by winter storms beginning on December 22, 2004 and continuing through January 2005. Senators DeWine and Voinovich wrote a letter to the President in February 2005 in support of Governor Bob Taft's request for federal assistance for the residents of the 60 hardest hit counties during that winter season. 
   "Two winters ago, Ohio faced a difficult series of storms that severely damaged our infrastructure and roads. I am pleased that the Ohio Department of Transportation is being reimbursed for the work that it has done to restore those roads and keep Ohioans traveling safely," said Senator DeWine. "This is precisely how federal emergency funds are intended to be used."
   "I am pleased the President agreed with our support of Governor Taft's emergency assistance request. The financial burden caused by the winter storms two years ago is too great for Ohio to shoulder alone. I know these funds will help Ohio and its citizens recover financially," said Senator Voinovich.
   More than $685 million is being directed to 31 states and U.S. territories to pay for roads and bridges damaged by recent hurricanes, flooding and storms. The Federal Highway Administration is reimbursing states for expenses associated with 56 emergency situations. The projects paid for by the funds include reconstructing or replacing damaged highways and bridges, establishing detours, removing debris, and replacing signs, lighting and guardrails.
