SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT ON NASA AUTHORIZATION ACT CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced the expected Senate passage of the conference report attached to S.1281, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005, which supports numerous programs in areas of expertise at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The bill should pass the Senate and House later today or early next week.  
   "This bill provides NASA's roadmap for the future, directing their agenda in the critical two years ahead," said Senator DeWine. "I have spent the past few months working with Northeast Ohio's aerospace and academic communities, along with the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, to improve the NASA authorization bill. Together, we have been able to craft and pass through Congress provisions that make this legislation reflect the R&D priorities necessary to spur innovation and support NASA Glenn's employees. I am pleased to see our community's hard work pay off." 
   "Knowing the difficult budget constraints the conferees were working under, I want to thank them for coming forward with the best bill possible," DeWine added. 
   In July of this year, Senator DeWine exercised his ability to hold passage of this legislation setting NASA's long-term agenda until he was able to negotiate a series of amendments to protect NASA Glenn and the Northeast Ohio aerospace and academic communities. The DeWine-sponsored provisions maintained in the final bill include language directing NASA to: 
   * Carry out elements of a new, DeWine-authored aeronautics title that calls for reinvigorated research in key areas of strength at NASA Glenn, including hypersonics, propulsion, environmental aircraft development, and fuel cells. This title protects aeronautics test facilities and lays out specific considerations for the President and NASA Administrator as they formulate a comprehensive National Aeronautics Policy. The aeronautics title also ensures that research undertaken at NASA centers continues to aid U.S. global competitiveness in both military and civilian aerospace. 
   * Maintain a prohibition on major civil service reductions-in-force until March 16, 2007, giving agency planners and staff members time to begin carrying out new space exploration and aeronautics policies before rushing headlong into large-scale staffing decisions. This prohibition will also buy time for leaders at NASA Glenn to secure new work contracts in order to maintain the highest possible employment level at the Center. 
   * Develop advanced surface power systems for use on the Moon and Mars. A central requirement for NASA's planned space exploration program is a reliable source of power. NASA Glenn is the recognized leader in this area, having led development of power systems for the International Space Station. Glenn is expected to be the lead within the agency for this program. 
   * Prohibit closure of key testing assets identified in a recent RAND report on wind tunnels and propulsion laboratories. Several of these protected facilities are at NASA Glenn, and many are used by private sector innovators in Ohio. Additionally, the conference report contains language directing NASA to alter its accounting methodology for major test facilities - a change that should lower NASA Glenn's overhead costs and improve the viability of testing assets at Plum Brook Station near Sandusky. 
   * Implement commercialization programs that focus on transferring technology into and out of NASA. NASA Glenn is home to numerous commercialization programs, including the Great Lakes Innovation and Technology Center. Continuation of these commercialization programs will aid in NASA Glenn's role as a driver of jobs and innovation for Northeast Ohio. Upon passage, the bill then goes to the President for his signature. 
   Since 2001, Senator DeWine has served as the Senate lead in providing over $126 million in directed spending to NASA Glenn and its research partners through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Additionally, he has: 
   * Helped secure $90 million for the commercial technology program nationwide since 2002, with a substantial amount of this funding going to Glenn and its commercialization partners. 
   * Sponsored amendments to the Senate's 2006 NASA budget and appropriations bills that ultimately led to an increase of $60 million over the President's 2006 budget for aeronautics research programs. The additional funding provided by the DeWine amendments added momentum for further increases during final negotiations on the appropriations bill, and Senator DeWine worked with aeronautics advocates in the Ohio delegation, as well as in other states, in a successful push for full aeronautics funding in FY06. 
   Senator DeWine will also participate in a concerted effort by NASA leaders in the Senate to call the agency to task for its erratic and, at times, unauthorized programming approach. As an example, NASA has proposed three entirely different aeronautics R&D plans in the last 18 months, leading to wasted taxpayer dollars, abrupt termination of numerous programs, and the of lack of a clear, long-term direction for aeronautics programs.
