SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS FLYING HIGH FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO HELP AT-RISK YOUTH IN YOUNGSTOWN
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds officials at Flying HIGH, Inc. in Youngstown for receiving a $300,000 grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Community Empowering Youth Program. In July, Sen. DeWine wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services supporting the grant request and explaining that it would support development programming for Youngstown's most at-risk youth. 
   "We need to provide our children with positive alternatives to gang activity and violence," said Senator DeWine. "This program will do just that, helping to systematically eliminate gang activity and violence in Youngstown. I applaud the administrators at Flying HIGH for their efforts and I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
