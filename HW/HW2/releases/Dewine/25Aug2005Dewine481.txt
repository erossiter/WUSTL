SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON CLEVELAND DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE
  After today's vote by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission, Sen.  
 Mike DeWine (R-OH) released the following statement: 
   "The Commission's decision today to not only keep Cleveland DFAS open, but increase jobs at the facility, is tremendous news for Northeast Ohio," said Senator DeWine. "The Commission clearly recognized the high quality and efficient work of employees in Cleveland. I was extremely impressed with how the Cleveland community came together to fight for the 1100 valuable employees currently at the facility. The highly experienced men and women who work in this facility are an integral part of the system that supports our armed forces stationed across the globe and their families here at home."
