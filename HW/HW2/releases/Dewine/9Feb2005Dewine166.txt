SEN. DEWINE CONTINUES HIS FIGHT FOR TRICARE BENEFITS FOR OUR NATION'S GUARDSMEN, RESERVISTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today joined with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), George Allen (R-VA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), and Reps.  
 Tom Latham (R-IA) and Joe Wilson (R-SC) to announce the introduction of the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005. 
   Senator DeWine first became involved with National Guard and Reserves healthcare with his introduction of the National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003, which proposed providing financial support for continuation of health insurance for mobilized members of our nation's Reserves. 
   "We owe nothing less to the families of our men and women in uniform. They are there to protect us - and we need to be there to protect them," stated Senator DeWine. 
   "Our legislation would offer a comprehensive approach to health coverage for members of our military reserve component and their families," continued DeWine, "providing a critical health care safety net by offering uninterrupted, affordable health insurance." 
   Currently, nearly 40 percent of junior enlisted Guard and Reserve servicemen and women lack any civilian health insurance. The Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005 would eliminate that need, while ensuring greater military medical readiness and improving retention rates within the National Guard and Reserves. 
   In addition to improved TRICARE health insurance access, the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005 reduces retirement age for Reservists and Guardsmen. For every two years of service over twenty, a Guardsman or Reservist would receive benefits one year earlier. Currently, retirement benefits eligibility begins only after reaching age 60.
