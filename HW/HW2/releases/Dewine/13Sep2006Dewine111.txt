SEN. DEWINE TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT PASSES COMMITTEE, GOES TO FLOOR FOR CONSIDERATION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that his bill, the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a party line vote of 10-8. The bill is a measure that would provide a statutory framework, with congressional and judicial oversight, for our government to conduct electronic surveillance on the international communications of suspected terrorists, while protecting the rights and liberties of American citizens. 
   "I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee has moved one step closer to providing specific legal authorization for this critical anti-terrorism program, while at the same time taking steps to protect the rights and liberties of Americans by requiring Congressional oversight and, whenever possible, judicial oversight by the FISA court," said Senator DeWine, a member of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee. "In order to win the war on terror, we need to monitor the communications of terrorists. This bill allows us to continue to do just that, within a strong legal framework that meets the requirements of the intelligence community and the Constitution."
   Under the Terrorist Surveillance Act, the President is given the limited authority to conduct surveillance of the international communications of terrorists for 45 days. To engage in such surveillance, the President must have probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a member of or affiliated with a terrorist organization. And, he must believe that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States from a terrorist attack. Under the bill, the President is permitted to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program every 45 days.
   In addition, the Terrorist Surveillance Act adds important safeguards to current law to protect the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans.
   * First, the bill requires that, every 45 days, the Attorney General of the United States must review the surveillance of individual targets under the Terrorist Surveillance Program. If, at any time, the Attorney General determines that he has sufficient evidence regarding a specific target to obtain an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, he must go to the FISA Court and seek such an order.
   * Second, for those unusual cases where the Attorney General does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA court order, but still wishes to conduct surveillance on a suspected terrorist, the bill requires that the Attorney General certify, under oath, that continued surveillance is necessary to protect the United States.
   * Finally, the bill establishes a Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittee within the Senate Intelligence Committee with the exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and monitor the details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. That Subcommittee is empowered to obtain any and all information about the surveillance of any individual in order to ensure that rights of law-abiding Americans are protected.
   The bill is cosponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
