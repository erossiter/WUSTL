SEN. DEWINE: STABILIZATION, DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION PACKAGE INCLUDED IN SENATE-PASSED EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
  Sen. Mike DeWine today announced that the Senate-passed Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill included his Urgent Stabilization and Democratic Consolidation Package for Haiti and Liberia. This measure includes $90 million for children's health programs, police and judicial reform, and infrastructure improvements as well as funds to increase economic opportunities. 
   "Both Liberia and Haiti are in a period of transition. Newly elected leaders can help turn the corner toward more stable democracies and we must do what we can to encourage peace and security," said Senator DeWine. "With needed reform within police departments and courts, as well as infrastructure improvements, and healthcare programs, we're offering hope to the thousands of families living in poverty in Liberia and Haiti."
   If this package is included in the final Supplemental bill, Liberia could receive $50 million through the Economic Support Fund for community-based job programs, electrical upgrades, and rule of law programs.
   Haiti could receive $35 million in Economic Support Funds for community-based job programs, and police and judicial reforms. In addition, Haiti could receive $5 million in Child Survival and Health funds for children and maternal healthcare.
   Senator DeWine recently met with Haitian President-Elect Rene Preval in his Washington, D.C. office. The two spoke about mutual interests including securing and stabilizing Haiti, making sure the basic needs of Haitians are met, and strengthening the rule of law in that developing country. President-Elect Preval indicated his firm commitment to an independent police force that is capable of ensuring security for the people of Haiti.
   The bill passed the full Senate by a vote of 78-20. The House and Senate must now reconcile the differences in each chambers version if the Emergency Supplemental bill.
