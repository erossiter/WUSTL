SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE ALLEN COUNTY DEFENSE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SENATE FUNDING BILL
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the Senate approved $719.45 million in Ohio defense projects for fiscal year 2005.  
   The funds were approved as part of the 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate late last night by a vote of 96-0. It now goes to the President for his signature. 
   "Defense preparedness must be a priority in our war on terrorism," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have secured funding on behalf of Ohio's military installations and projects. We must continue to provide our men and women in the armed forces with the strength and capability necessary in this tumultuous time." "With new challenges to our national security it's more important than ever that our armed forces are ready, equipped, and well-trained. Fundamental to that is making sure our troops have at their disposal the most cutting-edge resources available and these funds help guarantee that by investing heavily in the advanced research and manufacturing that we do so well in Lima," said Voinovich. 
   The following projects were included in the bill: 
   * General Dynamics Tank Plant, Lima, STRYKER Project - An additional $625 million for a total of $1.53 billion to help develop the STRYKER, which is the U.S. Army's highest-priority production combat vehicle program. The eight-wheeled combat vehicle is significantly lighter, faster, and more transportable than existing tanks and armored vehicles. 
   * General Dynamics Tank Plant, Lima, N-STEP Enabled Manufacturing Cell - 3.25 million to help develop a flexible, reconfigurable manufacturing device that replaces the need to manually weld the structural mounts required on each large military vehicle with an automated state-of-the-art welding and machining process. This will help improve military and weapons construction projects. 
   * Statewide, Metals Affordability Initiative - $7.5 million to research and improve advanced aerospace metals manufacturing processes to reduce costs and maintain the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. Participating organizations include Brush Wellman, Edison Welding Institute, GE Engines, The Ohio State University, and RTI Titanium. 
   * Nationwide, Lockheed Martin, C-5 In-Service Modifications - $103.1 million for the procurement of 12 AMP kits that replace several difficult to maintain components and upgrade C-5 cockpits with modern avionics and flight instrumentation. Nationwide, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Operational Funding - $1.7 million to provide operational funding for the Cadet program, aimed at the development of young men and women ages 11 to 17 years old, by promoting interest and skill in seamanship and aviation and instilling qualities in Cadets that mold strong moral character and self-discipline.
