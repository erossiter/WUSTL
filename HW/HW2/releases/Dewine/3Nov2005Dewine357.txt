SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL MONEY FOR CENTRAL OHIO AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee Passage of the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which includes funding for regional projects.  
   "These worthy projects will help move Ohio's rich agricultural heritage into the 21st century through research and seminars addressing current issues in the agricultural community," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure funding for these projects is included in the final bill so that everyone can benefit from Ohio's strong agricultural base." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following projects: 
   The Ohio State University 
   * Ohio Aquaculture Research and Development Initiative 
   * $800,000 for The College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences to improve broodstock, production techniques and recalculating aquaculture systems for fish using long and short-term strategies aimed to increase the productivity, innovation, and profitability of Ohio and Midwest aquaculture operations. Sites in Franklin, Pike, Wayne, and Wood counties. 
   * Emergency Detection and Response Research Program 
   * $750,000 for The College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences to provide pragmatic support for the operation and maintenance of the proposed BSL-3 Ag facility to be built on the campus of the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. This will support faculty and staff on both the Columbus and Wooster campuses. 
   Small Farm Institute 
   * Seasonal Grazing Dairy Research Project 
   * $400,000 for the establishment of a seasonal grazing dairy in Coshocton. The North Central Ohio Dairy Grazing Council, the Department of Agriculture and The Ohio State University will work together research the needs for a grazing dairy in the Appalachian region. One of the fastest growing segments of agriculture in Ohio, dairy grazing for small and mid-size producers is profitable, and maintains the quality of life and protects area soils and natural resources. 
   The bill now goes before the full Senate for consideration.
