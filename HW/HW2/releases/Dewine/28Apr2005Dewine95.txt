SEN. DEWINE WORKS TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF HANDS OF CRIMINALS
  Following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that current laws contained a loophole allowing criminals who commit felonies in foreign nations to purchase firearms, Sen.  
 Mike DeWine (R-OH) today re-introduced legislation to ensure that these felons would be barred from purchasing firearms in the United States. 
   "A person convicted of a felony outside the United States should not be in a better position to acquire a lethal weapon than a person committing the same crime in the United States," said Senator DeWine. "As lawmakers, we must act to keep guns from the hands of criminals and this bill closes the loophole in our laws, assisting in that goal." 
   Those convicted of a felony in the United States are currently prevented from purchasing a firearm, however, these standards are not universally applied to those convicted of felonies in foreign nations. The Firearms Fairness and Security Act would clarify current statutory language to eliminate this inconsistency. The bill would prohibit the sale of a firearm to a person convicted of a felony in a foreign court if the crime is considered a felony in the United States. 
   Senator DeWine previously introduced the Firearms Fairness and Security Act in 2003.
