SEN. DEWINE ACCEPTS AWARD FOR WORK ON DEMINING, VICTIM ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) yesterday accepted an award for his long-time support for demining and victim assistance in Southeastern Europe presented by the International Trust Fund for Demining and Victim Assistance (ITF).  
 ITF Director Dorijan Marsic and Slovenian Ambassador to the United States Samuel Zbogar presented the award. 
   "Mines are ugly tools of war and far too often, the victims of mines are not even the military combatants who they were designed for, but instead are innocent men, women, and worst of all - children," said Senator DeWine. "We can do more, not just in the Balkans, but around the world, to educate people about the dangers mines pose and to help those who have been harmed. I plan to continue working with ITF to spread their model of demining and victim assistance to other regions in need." 
   ITF is based in Slovenia and does demining and victim assistance throughout the Balkans. Their vision is to free the countries of Southeast Europe free from mines and unexploded ordnance by 2010.
