SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES LORAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOB TRAINING GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that the Department of Labor has awarded more than $2.599 million to Lorain County Community College (LCCC) to train Northeast Ohio workers and to encourage the growth of area businesses.  
   "This grant is an example of how community colleges can train workers for well-paying 21st Century jobs," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am pleased to help Ohio's businesses grow. I appreciate the leadership of President Bush and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao in advocating for the role of community colleges in providing America's workers with sought-after skills." 
   The training program responds to the local business community by assessing the emerging employment trends and deficiencies and then training workers to meet those needs. The Department of Labor calls this "simultaneously building talent and growing businesses and jobs." 
   In 2004, Senator DeWine included language in the Omnibus Appropriations bill that directed the Secretary of Labor to "give favorable consideration to the application to continue and expand support for job training, workforce and economic development initiatives" delivered by LCCC. The funding was not immediately received by LCCC, prompting Senator DeWine to work to release the funds by writing letters to officials at the Department of Labor.
