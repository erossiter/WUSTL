SEN. DEWINE COLLECTS ON OHIO STATE - TEXAS GAME WAGER
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today collected on a friendly bet that he had made with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) on the outcome last Saturday's football game between number one ranked Ohio State Buckeyes and the second ranked Texas Longhorns, which Ohio State won 24-7. The wager staked Texas' own Blue Bell Ice Cream against Fran DeWine's famous candy buckeyes. Sen. Hutchison graciously presented the ice cream to Sen. DeWine at his offices this morning. 
   "The Buckeyes' convincing victory over Texas confirms that Ohio State is the number one college team in the country," said Senator DeWine. "What a great effort by coach Jim Tressel and all of the Ohio State players! I thank Senator Hutchison for agreeing to offer up this delicious ice cream that my staff and I will be enjoying as we revel in Saturday night's victory. Go Bucks!"
   In the first regular-season matchup of No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a decade, Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith passed for 269 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Buckeyes to a 24-7 win Saturday night. The victory keeps the Buckeyes (2-0) in perfect position for a run to a national title and snaps Texas' 21 game winning streak.
