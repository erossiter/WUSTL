SEN. DEWINE INTRODUCES BILL TO PRESERVE PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIC SITES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), with Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), today introduced the Presidential Sites Improvement Act of 2005, which would create a new and innovative partnership with public and private entities to preserve and maintain presidential birthplaces, homes and tombs.  
 Ohio presidential sites include the homes, memorials and tombs of former Presidents William Henry Harrison, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding. 
   "We need to make a lasting commitment to preserve the memory and contributions of America's presidents for generations to come," said Senator DeWine. "Ohio, which is proud to be the home of eight former presidents, has a rich presidential history. We should do all we can so that our children and grandchildren have the opportunity to visit and explore these historical treasures." 
   Many presidential sites across the country are maintained and administered by state and local agencies, family foundations, colleges and universities, historic preservation organizations and other non-profit organizations. The costs associated with operating and maintaining these historic treasures are significant. Consequently, maintenance projects, even though they may be needed, are often postponed. Many of these sites are in need of funding for capital, technological and interpretive display improvements. 
   The Presidential Sites Improvement Act would establish a five-member committee, including the Director of the National Park Service, a member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and a state historic preservation officer, which would make grant recommendations to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Each grant would require a minimum of a 50 percent non-Federal match. Up to $5 million would be made available annually.
