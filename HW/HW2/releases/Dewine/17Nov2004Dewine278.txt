SEN. DEWINE, KOHL ISSUE STATEMENT ON PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN SEARS, KMART
  Statement by Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Herb Kohl (D-WI), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights: 
   "We expect that the antitrust agencies will examine closely the merger announced today between Sears and Kmart, a combination that will create the nation's third largest retail chain. Sears and Kmart are household names in American commerce and two companies with proud histories. This merger will impact millions of consumers across the nation who shop daily at these two chains for their household needs. We will monitor this situation carefully to ensure that consumers do not suffer a significant loss of competitive choices as a result of this deal."
