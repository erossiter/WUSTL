SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS GRANT TO AID OHIO FAITH-BASED, COMMUNITY INITIATIVES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) is pleased that the United States Department of Health and Human Services awarded the Governor's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives a $750,000 Compassion Capital Demonstration Fund grant to aid faith-based and community initiatives across the state. 
   "I am pleased the Governor's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives received this grant," said Senator DeWine. "This office's work will help the most vulnerable people of our state, and this grant will improve their ability to reach out to the community."
   Regional Intermediary Partners in this collaboration include the Ohio Community Action Training Organization (Northwest/Southeast); Cleveland Christian Home (Northeast); DBA Care Alliance, Economic Community Development Institute; formerly a division of Jewish Family Services, (Central); and FreestoreFoodbank (Southwest). The project will provide technical assistance to faith-based and community-based organizations in Ohio. The technical assistance includes statewide training events, on-going technical assistance, a moderated listserve, and a web portal. The grant also provides $500,000 in sub-awards for capacity-building activities for faith-based and community organizations.
   These tools will allow faith-based and community organizations the ability to provide social services and create collaborations to better serve those in need.
