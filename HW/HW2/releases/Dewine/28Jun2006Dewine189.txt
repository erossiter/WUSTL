OLDER AMERICANS ACT REAUTHORIZATION PASSES COMMITTEE, GOES TO FLOOR
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Retirement Securities and Aging, announced that the Older American Act Reauthorization he cosponsored passed out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee today, and is now headed to the Senate floor for consideration. Sen. Michael Enzi's (R-WY) reauthorization bill would reform the Older Americans Act to make it more effective in improving the lives of older Americans. Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are also cosponsors. 
   "More than 36 million Americans are over the age of 65, and the Census Bureau predicts within the next 45 years, the older American community will be 90 million strong and make up about 21 percent of the population. This reauthorization comes at a time when our older American population is growing and that's why so many of these improvements are vital to ensuring our loved ones have the resources they need as they age. Older Americans are a rapidly growing segment of our population, making the reauthorization of this act important," said Senator DeWine. "With this reauthorization, older Americans would have better access to long-term care as they age. In addition, since families take on all shapes and sizes, this bill would bolster the National Family Caregiver Support Program, by allowing more grandparent caregivers to access the benefits the program provides."
   Last reauthorized in 2000, the Older Americans Act was first passed in 1965 to better serve the low-income elderly population, and serves as the cornerstone for such social services as nutrition programs, home care, affordable housing, transportation, and job training. In addition to reauthorizing the Act, the legislation would improve the Older Americans Act in the following ways:
   * Provides grants to states to enable consumer choice with respect to long-term care and encourage planning and improve access.
   * Increases the funding authorization for National Family Caregiver Support Program by 25 percent.
   * Expands the National Family Caregiver Program to give more Older Americans access to the program's resources to provide for children in their care.
   * Creates an interagency council to ensure appropriate planning for baby boomer-related needs.
   * Establishes a grant program for mental health screening of older Americans and increase awareness of mental illness effects.
   * Creates a grant program for the improvement of assistive technology for older Americans to enable them to have the necessary technology needed to monitor their own health.
   * Creates a grant program to encourage the creation of innovative models that allow individuals to remain in community-based settings.
   * Creates an office of Elder Abuse Prevention to oversee grant distribution to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It also would collect data about elder abuse to help improve the well-being of our loved ones.
   Reauthorizing and modernizing the Older Americans Act was the top priority of the Senate Aging Subcommittee, under the direction of Senator DeWine. Most recently, Senator DeWine held a hearing examining naturally occurring retirement communities. Senator DeWine chaired a hearing on the Older Americans Act in March 2006, to examine Title V - Community Service Employment. In February of this year Senator DeWine held a roundtable for community leaders to share their thoughts and ideas about reauthorization. Senator DeWine also chaired a hearing in May 2005 where Assistant Aging Secretary, Josefina Carbonell, and Assistant Labor Secretary Emily DeRocco testified offered their views on improving the Older Americans Act.
