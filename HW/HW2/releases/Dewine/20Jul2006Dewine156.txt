SEN. DEWINE SECURES FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION MONEY FOR WRIGHT-PATT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which includes federal funding for projects in Ohio. Next, the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration. 
   "I am proud to have secured funding for these important military construction projects. We need to ensure that Ohio's men and women in uniform have all the resources they need to effectively do their jobs, including the modernization and expansion of facilities," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veteran's Affairs. "Our military protects us from terrorism and other threats both at home and abroad and they deserve nothing less. I look forward to working to make sure funding for these projects is retained in the final version of the bill."
   Senator DeWine secured Senate funding for the following regional project:
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
   * Information Technology Complex, Phase II - $900,000 for the design and planning of a state-of-the-art Information Technology Complex that will provide the computing, collaborative modeling and simulation environment required to rapidly enhance weapon system life-cycle acquisition and support capabilities. Currently, the IT facilities are housed in several substandard buildings scattered around the base without appropriate computing and security capabilities.
   The appropriations bill funded other Ohio military construction projects including $7.2 million for the construction of a Security Forces Complex at the Rickenbacker International Airport in Columbus, and $1.5 million for construction of bachelor quarters for the Ohio National Guard's Training and Logistics site in Ravenna.
