SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS WARREN COUNTY COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO HELP ELDERLY
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds Warren County Community Services for receiving a $3,074,100 grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The HUD grant is from the Section 202 Supportive Housing for Seniors Grant Program, a program designed to increase the supply of affordable rental housing equipped with supportive services for elderly persons. In May of 2006, Sen. DeWine wrote to HUD officials supporting the grant request and explaining that the grant would help construct 30 one-bedroom units for very low-income elderly persons at a site in close proximity to public transportation for easy access to shopping, medical facilities, entertainment, and other social/recreational activities. 
   "The need for safe and affordable housing for the elderly in Warren County continues to grow," said Senator DeWine. "This money will help fund the construction of 30 housing units to meet that need. I applaud the administrators at Warren County Community Services for their efforts and I thank the Department of Housing and Urban Development for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   HUD's Section 202 Program awards allow elderly persons, including the most frail, to live as independently as possible in the community by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services. Under this program, capital advances are made to private nonprofit organizations to build, acquire and rehabilitate rental housing appropriately equipped for elderly persons. The capital advance is interest free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years.
