SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON COLUMBUS DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE
  After today's vote by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission, Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) released the following statement: 
   "The Commission's decision today to consolidate DFAS offices to five locations including Columbus is great news for Central Ohio and the entire state," said Senator DeWine. "The facilities available at the Defense Supply Center Columbus rival any facilities available in the business sector, and the quality of the workforce is second to none. The community has come together to show Commissioners that DFAS Columbus employees are doing a tremendous job in supporting our Americans serving their country. Their hard work should be commended."
