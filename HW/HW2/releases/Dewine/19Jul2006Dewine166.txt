BILL TO HELP STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES GOES TO PRESIDENT FOR HIS SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that the Senate approved a House bill to protect students with disabilities from losing their Section 8 Housing assistance. Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-15) introduced the legislation in the House, and it passed in June. Sen. DeWine introduced companion legislation in the Senate. 
   Amid reports that wealthy students were taking advantage of a loophole in Section 8 regulations by living in housing designated for the poor, last year Congress passed legislation requiring that family income and government assistance be used as part of the eligibility equation for Section 8 applicants.
   The new law unintentionally affected Creative Living, a housing complex for the disabled near The Ohio State University, and seven Creative Living residents could lose their Section 8 housing eligibility. This legislation exempts disabled students currently receiving Section 8 housing assistance from the new eligibility requirements.
   "At long last, the students living at Creative Living will have the peace of mind in knowing their housing needs will be met, and can instead focus on their studies," said Pryce. "I was happy to work with Senator DeWine on this important issue, and I am thrilled with the closure this brings for the students currently residing at Creative Living."
   "This bill helps to correct an unintended consequence of Section 8 housing reform by ensuring that current students with disabilities such as those at Creative Living have access to the quality, affordable housing they need," said Senator DeWine. "Representative Pryce and I have worked to correct this error because we know that students with disabilities deserve every opportunity to succeed."
   The bill now goes to the president for his signature.
