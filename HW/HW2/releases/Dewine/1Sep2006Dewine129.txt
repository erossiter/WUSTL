NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD FREEDOM CENTER AWARDED GRANT THROUGH SEN. DEWINE PROGRAM
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) applauds the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati for receiving a grant through the Department of Education Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Grant Program that he created as a part of the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural Act included in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center will receive a total of $1,428,950 for educational programs at the Center. 
   "This funding will help teach our children about heroes from a disturbing chapter in our nation's history," said Senator DeWine. "Brave men and women took immense personal risk to work together for freedom and liberty. As the author of the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural Act, I am pleased students of all ages can come to the Freedom Center in Cincinnati and learn about this inspiring story."
   Senator DeWine authored and helped pass the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural Act in 1998 that established the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Grant program. In 2000, Senator DeWine helped pass a law that called for $16 million in federal funding to assist with the construction of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. The Freedom Center contains exhibits that trace the lives of slaves and illustrates the escape routes of the thousands fleeing the South. Center visitors have the opportunity to travel along a recreated Underground Railroad route via virtual reality simulation.
   The funds for the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Grant Program are awarded as competitive grants to nonprofit educational organizations that research, display, interpret, and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad. Cincinnati's Freedom Center was one of only three grant recipients nationwide.
