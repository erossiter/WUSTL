SEN. DEWINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NASA SHARED SERVICES DECISION
  Statement from Senator Mike DeWine on the NASA Shared Services decision 
   "NASA kept this bidding process rather tight, but it seems that the Mississippi center was able to put together a better bid from a cost standpoint. We continue to support the work Ohioans do at NASA Glenn in aviation research and to further our nation's mission back to the moon."
