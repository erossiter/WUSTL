SENS. KOHL/DEWINE PROPOSE BILL TO ENSURE ACCESS TO NEEDED MEDICAL DEVICES
  Sens. Herb Kohl (D-WI) and Mike DeWine (R-OH), the Ranking Member and Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, today introduced a bill, known as the Medical Device Competition Act of 2004, which will help ensure that physicians and patients have access to the best, safest, and most cost-effective life saving medical devices. The bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to oversee the hospital purchasing industry to prevent hospital buying groups from engaging in anticompetitive or unethical practices. 
   Almost every product that most hospitals buy to treat patients is bought by contracts negotiated by what are known as hospital group purchasing organizations (GPOs). GPOs are buying groups formed by hospitals in order to gain bargaining power to lower the price hospitals pay for these products. These GPOs are funded by fees paid by hospital suppliers, fees that are allowed under a special exception to the Medicare program's anti-kickback law (the Medicare "safe harbor"). For nearly 3 years, the Antitrust Subcommittee has been engaged in a comprehensive investigation of GPO practices. The investigation focused on allegations that certain GPO practices harmed competition and innovation among manufacturers of medical devices, by excluding these manufacturers from gaining access to the hospital marketplace. In response to this investigation, the industry adopted a baseline code of conduct and separately six of the nation's leading GPOs enacted voluntary codes of conduct to address anticompetitive business practices and ban unethical practices.
   The bill has three essential provisions to ensure that GPO practices are in the interests of hospitals, physicians, and patients. It:
   * Directs the HHS to write rules forbidding GPO practices which are unethical, anticompetitive, or prevent needed medical devices from access to the hospital marketplace;
   * Prevents GPOs from accepting fees from hospital suppliers unless HHS certifies that the GPO does not violate these rules; and
   * Bans vendor fees that exceed 3% of the price of the good or service sold.
   "Our goal is to ensure that physicians and patients have access to the highest quality medical products at the lowest prices, and to prevent improper barriers to competition among hospital suppliers. We also want to ensure that GPOs fulfill their important purpose - to cut prices for thousands of hospitals across the country and thereby restrain health care costs. We believe our bill strikes the right balance and accomplishes these goals. It will ensure that the considerable reforms we have already achieved in the hospital purchasing industry will not be lost should our scrutiny of this industry be lessened," said Senators Kohl and DeWine.
   "Our bill will ensure that GPOs act in the best interests of patients and hospitals. Giving the Department of Health and Human Services oversight of this industry will help prevent improper practices that can endanger patients' access to the best and safest products," added Senator Kohl. "We have come a long way with the GPO industry. Through many discussions and hard work on the voluntary codes, manufacturers, hospitals, doctors and other healthcare workers, and most importantly patients, are all better off. This bill is another step in the process and I look forward to working with all the interested parties to assure that we continue to progress towards better, safer and less expensive healthcare," said Senator DeWine.
