SEN. DEWINE CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE U.N. INTERVENTION IN SUDAN
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today called on the United Nations to immediately send personnel to Sudan to stabilize the country, stop the genocide and distribute humanitarian relief.  
   "There are in fact two crises in Sudan - a grave breach of human rights and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe," Senator DeWine said today on the Senate floor. "We must condemn the Government of Sudan for their complicity in the human rights abuses and their gross failure in putting an end to the current genocide." 
   In a speech delivered on the floor of the United States Senate, Senator DeWine outlined four things that must be done immediately in Sudan: 
   * The United States must push the United Nations Security Council to authorize a stability and support operation under Chapter VII to help stop the atrocities and help distribute humanitarian aid. 
   * Congress must amend the Sudan Peace Act to require improvements in Darfur. 
   * The United States should target sanctions against any members of the Sudanese government found to be involved in these atrocities. And finally, 
   * The international community must act now. We need a special session of the UN Human Rights Commission to appoint a special rapporteur for Sudan. We should also consider a special tribunal to investigate the atrocities. 
   This morning, the Senate considered and passed by unanimous consent, S. Con. Res. 99, a resolution condemning the Government of Sudan for its participation in attacks against civilians. Senator DeWine is a co-sponsor of this resolution.
