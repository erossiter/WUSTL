SEN. DEWINE SECURES EXTENSION FOR FEDERAL FUNDING FOR YOUNGSTOWN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of a bill that includes language that would extend by three years the time the City of Youngstown has to use federal funds that were earmarked for the construction of a downtown convocation and community center.  
 (The extension is contingent on House approval of the conference report.) 
   In 2000, $25 million was secured for the downtown development project, however the funding needed to be spent by the end of 2004 or the City of Youngstown risked losing it. Senator DeWine, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, successfully included language in the Senate Appropriations bill that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and other agencies to extend the deadline through 2007. 
   "I am pleased that Youngstown will have up to three more years to complete this project," said Senator DeWine. "I appreciate Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri and the Bush Administration for supporting my efforts to ensure that Youngstown has the opportunity to use the funds that were earmarked for downtown development." 
   The Senate VA-HUD Appropriations bill states: The statement of managers accompanying Public Law 106-74, as amended by chapter 8 of title II of the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2000 (Public Law 106-246), is further amended by inserting ", to remain available to be expended until September 30, 2007," after "$25,000,000". 
   The bill next must be approved by the full Senate. After the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill are resolved, it will go to the President for his signature.
