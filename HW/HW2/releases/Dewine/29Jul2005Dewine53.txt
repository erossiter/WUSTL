SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH SUPPORT HIGHWAY JOBS BILL FOR CENTRAL OHIO
  Today, Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) supported the Highway Conference Report on the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (SAFETEA). The bill, will determine highway funding for the next five years (2005-2009). It will now need to be passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the President before becoming law.  
   "The Highway conference report that the Senate signed today will create thousands of jobs for Ohio, make our roads safer, and improve our state's infrastructure, allowing Ohio's people and businesses to move more efficiently and securely," stated Senator DeWine. 
   "Each year, over 1,200 Ohioans die on our roadways, and projects that we've supported in this bill will help the state to remedy roads and intersections that have the highest crash, injury, and fatality totals each year according to ODOT," continued Senator DeWine. "Construction and other upgrades at these locations will be performed with the goal of keeping families together by reducing the number of Ohioans who die on our roads each year." 
   "The highway conference report filed today will create more than 20,000 much-needed jobs in Ohio when the President signs it into law. It includes a 36 percent increase in funding for Ohio roads and bridges - including $400 million more due to changes that I pushed for last Congress to have states like Ohio not penalized for their use of ethanol. I've also pushed hard for Ohio to get its fair share of these federal funds and for increased funding for our state's roads and bridges," said Senator Voinovich. 
   "Although I am disappointed that the Administration did not understand the importance to Ohio of increasing our share from 90.5 to 95 percent, we did manage to raise it to 92 percent. This bill will also make our roads safer and improve our infrastructure, which is so critical to our just-in-time-delivery manufacturers. I look forward to working with my colleagues to expeditiously pass this important jobs bill and get it to the President for his signature." 
   For Ohio, the bill: 
   * Creates more than 20,000 highway related jobs over the life of the bill; 
   * Provides $6.646 billion over five years for highways - which is a 36 percent increase in funding over the last transportation bill;
