SEN. DEWINE COMMENTS ON HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SUDAN
  Mr. President, I want to commend my fellow co-sponsors of S. Con. Res. 99 for taking this essential first step in addressing the dual crises in Sudan.  
   There are in fact two crises in Sudan - a grave breach of human rights and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe. We must condemn the Government of Sudan for their complicity in the human rights abuses and their gross failure in putting an end to the current genocide. 
   The genocide is just the beginning. In addition to the gross human rights violations, we now face a humanitarian disaster. Over a million people are displaced and well over 100,000 have fled across the border into Chad. The Government of Sudan is only making matters more difficult by resisting, delaying, and frustrating the work of humanitarian assistance groups. 
   The situation gets worse. Roads in the region are only accessible to the sturdiest of jeeps and trucks, and once the rainy season starts in just a couple weeks, those roads will be wiped out, cutting off all aid. The clock is ticking. We cannot control mother nature - and so we must act now. 
   I believe there are five essential things we should do immediately: 
   * The United States must push the United Nations Security Council to authorize a stability and support operation under Chapter VII to help stop the atrocities and help distribute humanitarian aid. I would also like to see an expansion of the Civilian Protection Monitoring Teams into the Darfur region. The government of Sudan has had long enough to stop the killing and facilitate the flow of aid, and, with the rainy season coming, we cannot tell the people of Darfur to give their government more time to comply. 
   * Congress must amend the Sudan Peace Act to require improvements in Darfur. 
   * I would like to sit down with the Sudanese Ambassador to discuss these concerns. I hope that other Senators will join me in that discussion to show that we are not just saber rattling. We are serious about ending the genocide. 
   * The United States should target sanctions against any members of the Sudanese government found to be involved in these atrocities. And finally, 
   * The international community must act now. We need a special session of the UN Human Rights Commission to appoint a special rapporteur for Sudan. We should also consider a special tribunal to investigate the atrocities. 
   These five steps form a broad outline of what must be done. I plan to work with my colleagues and the administration in the coming days to iron out the details so we can move forward. The crisis is here - it is now - and this is what we must do. This is genocide and the international community must face its moral responsibility to act.
