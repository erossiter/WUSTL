SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN NORTHEAST OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $34 million in funding for projects in Northeast Ohio.
   "Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedom, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools to perform their mission. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I am proud to help provide them with the resources they need to succeed," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased that Ohio's defense community is able to greatly contribute to necessary projects that support our men and women in uniform." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following area projects:
   BWX Technologies
   * Nuclear Reactor Components - $10 million for nuclear reactor components for the next aircraft carrier for the Navy. This funding will allow BWX Technologies to retain employees they would have otherwise been forced to lay-off.
   Timken Company
   * MEMS Sensors for Rolling Element Bearings - $3 million to fund the development of a one-chip solution for the determination of temperature, vibration, strain and angular rotation in rolling element bearings. This technology allows our servicemen to fight more effectively and be better protected from injury or death.
   * Hybrid Bearings - $3 million to review various corrosion resistant steel for use in the bearing, as well as the introduction of new ball and retainer materials in the final bearing design. The hybrid bearing technology, which includes a variety of material and coating technologies, is being incorporated into the Joint Strike Fighter engine, as well as other platforms.
   Energy Conversion Devices and the University of Akron
   * Solid Hydrogen Storage and Fuel Cell Systems - $4 million to design, build, integrate, and demonstrate a metal hydride solid hydrogen storage system for fuel cell powered ground support equipment vehicles at military airfields and for other applications.
   The Sherwin-Williams Company
   * Life Shield Blast Resistant Panels - $2 million for research to determine how Life Shield Panels, a cost effective, superior blast resistance shield, can be applied to nonstandard structures and vehicles.
   Lockheed Martin
   * Millennium Gun Systems - $3 million to complete the Millennium Gun, a multi-role, inner layer defense naval weapon system designed to defeat threats in the air, on the surface, and during littoral and riverine operations. Viewed as a unique Naval Gun Weapon system, the Millennium Gun provides the Navy with an improved capability over older gun technologies.
   Energizer
   * High Power Lightweight Zinc-Air Battery - $3 million to fund further development of a new battery that will provide much improved power over current lithium batteries at half the weight and in a 60% smaller packaging.
   Orbital Research
   * Steering Guided Munitions - $2 million to research improved weapon and "smart" munitions technologies for several weapons systems which will improve guidance, navigation and control of munitions.
   Alcoa
   * Advanced Aluminum Aerostructures - $2 million to fund a design methodology that will reduce the weight and cost of producing components for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Joint Unmanned Combat Air System platform.
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company
   * Advanced Reinforced Materials and New Materials Research for Aircraft Tires - $1 million to complete research for new materials for aircraft tires that improve landing performance while lowering weight.
   IGR Enterprises
   * Oxygen Generator: $1 million for the final engineering development of a field-portable, rugged ceramic oxygen generator.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national program:
   Navy Family Lines
   * COMPASS - $300,000 for a team mentoring program designed to educate new Navy spouses, enabling them to understand the military lifestyle and realistically meet the challenges that lie ahead.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national programs:
   Defense Health Program
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $15 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Prostate Cancer Research Program - $80 million for the prostate cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   The bill now goes to a Conference Committee to reconcile differences with the House version.
