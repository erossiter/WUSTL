SEN. DEWINE SPONSORED BILL WOULD ASSIST PHARMACISTS AS THEY IMPLEMENT NEW MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS
  Sen. Mike DeWine recently announced his cosponsorship of Sen. Thad Cochran's (R-MS) Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare (PhARM) Act (S. 2563), a bill that would further empower pharmacists to provide Medicare beneficiaries access to the affordable medicines that they need. 
   "Pharmacists are an important component in the healthcare process, and in rural areas are often the primary sources of medical information for their patients," said Senator DeWine, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. "This bill would help give pharmacists the support they need as they assist patients transitioning to the new Medicare Part D benefit, by ensuring that pharmacists are reimbursed promptly and guaranteeing beneficiaries access to local pharmacies."
   The PhARM Act would allow pharmacists to receive payment within fourteen days of submitting their claims to participating Medicare plans. It also would clarify what pharmacies a beneficiary can visit by eliminating branding on Medicare cards issued after the bill becomes law. Finally, the PhARM Act calls for a two-year community-based Medication Therapy Management Services (MTMS) demonstration program where pharmacists would help beneficiaries who take multiple medications or have chronic conditions appropriately take those prescriptions to improve their health and quality of life.
