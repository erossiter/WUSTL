SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CENTRAL OHIO, STATEWIDE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, and Judiciary Appropriations bill that includes $1 million in funding for a Central Ohio project. 
   "This worthy Central Ohio project will help facilitate commercial shipping, boosting the area economy," said Senator DeWine. "One of my priorities on the Appropriations Committee is to work with my colleagues to ensure worthy projects receive funding they need."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following Central Ohio project:
   Columbus Regional Airport Authority
   * Rickenbacker Rail Spur - $1 million to plan, design and construct a rail spur connecting Rickenbacker Intermodal facility to Rickenbacker International Airport (LCK). The rail spur would serve commercial/industrial businesses in the area by providing direct rail access for shipping and receiving of their goods.
   Senator DeWine also helped secure funding for the following statewide project:
   Ohio Public Transit Association
   * Statewide Bus Replacement - $6 million to purchase replacement buses that will be lift equipped and thus will help meet the requirements mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Many of the buses will be equipped with newer, cleaner burning engines that will help meet the mandates of the Clean Air Act Amendments.
   "I am pleased that money will be going to purchase new buses for the transit systems throughout Ohio," said Senator DeWine. "The new fleet of buses will be handicap accessible and will help reduce pollution to keep Ohio's air clean."
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
