SEN. DEWINE RECEIVES ADVOCACY AWARD FROM SAVE THE CHILDREN
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today received the "Congressional Champion for Real and Lasting Change" Award from Save the Children, a leading children's advocacy group. The award recognizes Sen. DeWine for his work on humanitarian issues affecting child and maternal health. 
   "As Americans, we have a moral obligation to assist people in desperate need, particularly the millions of innocent children suffering around the world," said Senator DeWine. "We have an obligation to act because we have the knowledge and the resources to prevent these unnecessary deaths. I am honored to receive this award from such an admirable organization and I will continue to give children a voice in Washington."
   Senator DeWine is a longtime supporter of humanitarian issues, particularly those focused on children's health. He has sponsored budget and appropriations measures in the last several years increasing funding for child, newborn and maternal health. Most recently, he secured a $77 million increase for child and maternal health funding in the 2007 budget - from $323 million to $400 million. For several years he has worked through his position on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that proper focus and funding is given to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and to children living with HIV/AIDS.
   Save the Children is one of the leading independent organizations creating real and lasting change for children in need in the United States and around the world. It is a member of the International Save the Children Alliance working in more than 110 countries.
