SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH ANNOUNCE COLUMBUS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN FUNDING BILL
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced a Columbus project is included in the committee-approved fiscal year 2005 Senate Military Construction Appropriations bill.  
 The bill included $2.225 million in funding for the Army National Guard to build a new Organizational Maintenance Shop in Columbus. 
   "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of my priorities is bringing funding to Ohio's military installations. I want to make sure our troops have the resources they need," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased these projects included in the bill provide necessary improvements and facilities for Ohio's service men and women." 
   "Our military is playing a critical role at home and abroad in defending our nation against terrorism. In this difficult time the whole is only as strong as each individual part and it's essential that we don't lose sight of that. The role of the National Guard is inseparably intertwined with that of the Army and the Defense Department which is why I'm pleased we were able to secure these funds. These funds will help aid in the construction of an Organizational Maintenance Shop which will help ensure that their equipment is kept in top condition," said Senator Voinovich. 
   The full Senate is expected to take up the Military Construction Bill early next week. Following Senate passage, a House-Senate Conference Committee will resolve the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill.
