SENATE PASSES SEN. DEWINE'S RESOLUTION DESIGNATING JUNE AS 'NATIONAL SAFETY MONTH'
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) applauds the Senate passage of his resolution that promotes public safety nationwide by designating June 2005 as "National Safety Month."  
 The resolution passed yesterday with unanimous consent in the Senate. This year, the National Safety Council has selected "Safety: Where We Live, Work, and Play" as the theme for National Safety Month. "I am pleased my Senate colleagues recognize the importance of National Safety Month to raise public awareness of safety and prevention in hopes of reducing accidental deaths and injuries," said Sen. DeWine. "With a raised awareness we can work to reduce accidents and make our homes, communities and roadways safer and possibly save lives." 
   According to the National Safety Council, more than 20 million Americans suffer disabling injuries and 100,000 people die from their injuries each year. In the United States, nearly 43,000 people die each year from motor vehicle crashes, making auto fatalities the number one killer of those between the ages of 4 and 34. Many of these deaths and injuries can be prevented with proper education and precautionary measures. 
   June was selected to focus the nation's efforts on public safety since the summer season is traditionally a time of increased unintentional injuries and fatalities. Throughout the month, the National Safety Council and other safety organizations will urge businesses to increase their standards of safety in the workplace and provide information to individuals regarding injury prevention in homes, communities, and on roads and highways 
   The resolution was cosponsored by Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN). The resolution now goes to the House for consideration.
