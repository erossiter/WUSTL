FLOOR STATEMENT: TRICARE AMENDMENT
  FLOOR STATEMENT: TRICARE AMENDMENT
   Mr. President, I would like to thank the Committee for their hard work on this bill.  
 I am always impressed by how Senator Warner and Senator Levin manage this bill and for the excellent work of their staff. Their continued commitment to our troops, and to our Nation is evident in this bill. And, it is especially important right now. 
   I would also like to thank the Committee for their very important inclusion of expanded TRICARE coverage to several members of the Guard and Reserve. While limited, the Committee's inclusion of any extended health care benefits to the Reserve Component is unprecedented. The Committee's mark is an important step in the right direction, but the benefits included in the Committee's mark simply aren't enough. They don't go far enough to reach the folks we need to; the current provisions don't provide the kind of coverage that we owe these individuals and their families. They also don't recognize the continued sacrifice of the employers of our Reservists and Guardsmen. 
   That is why I join my colleagues - Senator Lindsay Graham, Senator Daschle, and Senator Leahy - in support of this important amendment. Unfortunately, benefits for our Guard and Reserve simply haven't kept pace with the increasing role these folks are expected to play. With the increasing demands we're placing on these individuals, it is the right thing to do. I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout the coming months to make these important initiatives a permanent reality. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.
