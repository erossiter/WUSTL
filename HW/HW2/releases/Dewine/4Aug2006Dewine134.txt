SEN. DEWINE CONTINUES EFFORT TO REDUCE EDUCATION COSTS FOR MILITARY SURVIVORS, DEPENDENTS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced his bill to accelerate benefit payment under the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program was included in the overall Veteran's Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act that passed the Senate last night by Unanimous Consent. 
   "I am pleased my Senate colleagues saw the importance of including this measure in the Veterans' Benefits bill," said Senator DeWine. "This is a step in improving military dependents' and survivors' benefits. By expediting educational assistance payments to those pursuing high-tech careers, dependents and survivors don't have to worry about monthly reimbursements and can instead focus on their studies. This will also encourage more workers to go into high tech fields where their skills are in great demand."
   Survivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance Program currently provides $827 per month for full-time students to be used for educational expenses. Under Senator DeWine's measure, those pursuing a high-tech career would have most of their benefit paid up front each semester, rather than having to pay out-of-pocket and be reimbursed by the program.
   The bill now goes to the House for consideration.
