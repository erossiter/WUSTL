SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE FOR HOUSING GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Economic and Community Development Institute (ECDI) for receiving a grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for the Assets for Independence Demonstration Program.  
 In June of this year, Sen. DeWine wrote to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services supporting the grant request and explaining that the $1 million grant would help address the asset building needs of low and moderate income individuals and families in Central Ohio. 
   "The Economic and Community Development Institute's efforts help families to stabilize and improve their financial well-being and become self-sufficient," said Senator DeWine. "This grant will help ECDI create invaluable opportunities for Central Ohioans to lift themselves out of poverty. I applaud ECDI's efforts and thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project." 
   The Economic and Community Development Institute is a nonprofit, community-based organization whose mission is to build the economic and social capacities of individuals, families, enterprises, and communities.
