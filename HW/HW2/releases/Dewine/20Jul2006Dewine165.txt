GREAT LAKES PROVISIONS PASS SENATE IN WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, and Sen. George Voinovich, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, announced that the Water Resources Development Act (S. 728), which includes several of their Great Lakes provisions, passed the Senate last night by a voice vote. These provisions specifically authorize the strengthening of the barrier at the Chicago Canal to keep Asian carp and other invasive species out of the Great Lakes and authorize money for programs to help with contaminated sediment cleanup.
   "The Great Lakes are threatened by the continued introduction of invasive species, like Asian carp, which negatively impact the natural food chain and habitat," said Senator DeWine. "We need to shut the door to all of the pathways that these fish can use to enter the Great Lakes and this bill authorizes the strengthening of a critical barrier. It also extends funding for important programs to help with managing sediment. I have worked for years to preserve and protect the Great Lakes and with measures like these, we can help ensure future generations can enjoy these unique treasures." 
   "Today, the Senate passed critical legislation which continues the momentum to restore our Great Lakes," Senator Voinovich said. "This legislation builds on federal, state, local and tribal efforts since the release of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration strategy report last year to ensure this national treasure is protected. I was pleased to help guide WRDA through the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure its final passage through Congress."
   Senators DeWine and Voinovich helped secure the following Great Lakes provisions in the Act:
   * Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier Project - This provision authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to operate and maintain Barriers I and II, to upgrade the temporary barrier-Barrier I-into a permanent barrier, to finish construction of Barrier II, to conduct a study of options that may reduce the efficacy of the barriers, and to provide credit to those states that contributed to the construction of Barrier II.
   * Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans & Sediment Remediation - This provision reauthorizes funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to provide technical assistance to local communities in the remediation of contaminated sediments and other pollution problems. 
  * Great Lakes Tributary Models - This provision reauthorizes funds to construct models to help local officials to prevent sediment from entering our waters and then to manage sediment in Great Lakes tributaries.
   * Great Lakes Fishery & Ecosystem Restoration - This provision amends the Great Lakes Fishery & Ecosystem Restoration program to clarify that reconnaissance studies carried out under this authority shall be carried out at full federal expense, like all other reconnaissance studies.
   Senator DeWine has a long history of working to protect and restore the Great Lakes, including cosponsoring the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act, to increase efforts to prevent the introduction of invasive species and to ensure a rapid response when potentially damaging species invasions occur. He also sponsored the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act, a long-term initiative which provides grants to make improvements in the Great Lakes Watershed. In 2002, he sponsored the Great Lakes Legacy Act, a program that recently provided $25 million for cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Ashtabula River.
   Senator Voinovich has been actively involved in efforts to restore the Great Lakes since his time as a state representative. As mayor of Cleveland, he helped waged the "Second Battle for Lake Erie" to clean up the lake and held the first national meeting to discuss the problems posed by the introduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes. As governor of Ohio, he served as chairman of the Great Lakes Governors and worked to ensure the Great Lakes received necessary restoration funding. As senator, he is proud to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee and helped author many provisions beneficial to the Great Lakes. Since his time in the Senate, he has held four hearings to examine efforts to restore and protect the Great Lakes.
