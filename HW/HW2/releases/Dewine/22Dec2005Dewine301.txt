SEN. DEWINE SECURES DEFENSE FUNDING FOR CENTRAL OHIO
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Senate passage late yesterday of the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations Conference Report, which includes $8.2 million in funding for Central Ohio projects.  
   "These projects are important to help give our service men and women the tools they need to effectively do their jobs," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I work to ensure Ohio's defense community receives funding for worthy projects and I am pleased my colleagues saw the importance of these programs." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure $8.2 million in funding for the following Central Ohio projects: 
   LSP TECHNOLOGIES 
   * Laser Peening - $1.8 million for laser peening of the U.S. Army's helicopters and ground vehicles with turbine engines. Laser peening prevents wear caused by friction which produces cracks that cause fracture, failure, and ultimately requires replacement parts. 
   Edison Welding Institute 
   * Materials Joining for Army Weapons Systems - $1.8 million for the development of advanced materials joining technologies for Future Combat Systems (FCS) and other Weapons Platforms. 
   Battelle 
   * Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Docking and Recharging Station - $2.1 million for the development and demonstration of a forward deployed base for one or more Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) that would allow AUVs to conduct nearly continuous ocean surveillance in remote locations for extended periods of time without human presence. 
   * Long Range Biometric Target Identification System - $1.5 million for Batelle's Navy Division to use existing technologies to develop, fabricate, and test a suite of biometric sensors that can be used at long range to identify specific individuals. This funding will allow the transition of the limited developmental system to a system ready for field and operational testing. 
   Ohio State University 
   * Indiana-Ohio Center for Traumatic Amputee Rehabilitation and Research - $1 million to assist in the planning and construction of a Center to study the needs of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs related to the rehabilitation and human care of veterans with traumatic amputee-related injuries. 
   Senator DeWine also helped secure $217.5 million in funding for national projects in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. "Funding these worthy projects is important to keep our military and the medical research community on the cutting edge as we move farther into the 21st century." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national programs: 
   Defense Health Program 
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $127.5 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $10 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   Lockheed Martin 
   * C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) - $11 million for the procurements of 8 AMP kits to modernize C-5s. AMPs replace difficult-to-maintain components and upgrade the C-5 cockpits. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program because the C-5 is replacing the C-141 which the 445th is flying. 
   * C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP) - $11 million for the replacement and modernization of engines and systems on C-5s. This replacement will save the Air Force more than $1 million per day in operations and support costs. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program because the C-5 is replacing the C-141 which the 445th is flying. 
   Metals Affordability Initiative (MAI) 
   * MAI Consortium - $5 million for continued initiative implementation. The MAI consortium has improved the military's war fighting capability while reducing life-cycle cost through technology innovation. Several Ohio companies participate in this initiative. 
   U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps 
   * Operational Funding - $300,000 for funding the Sea Cadet Corps program that promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation, as well as moral character and self-discipline, for youth ages 11 - 17. 
   Procurement Technical Assistance Program 
   * Assistance Program - $27.009 million for Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs). These PTACs form a network of dedicated procurement professionals who provide assistance to small businesses seeking to participate in the Department of Defense and other federal agencies procurement contracts. PTAC clients are small businesses, including disadvantaged, minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses that can not afford a fulltime marketing and procurement staff. There are 18 PTACs in Ohio. 
   Copper Development Association 
   * Copper Air Quality Program - $1 million for the design, production, and evaluation of copper components for the reduction of harmful microbes in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems. 
   * Copper-Based Casting Technology - $1.2 million for the development and testing of copper in electric motors, generators, and distribution components. Copper in motor rotors has resulted in weight reductions of five to ten percent, as well as three to seven percent reductions in size. 
   Metallurg Vanadium 
   * Vanadium Technology Partnership - $1.5 million for additional case studies and research and to initiate full-scale demonstrations of Vandium Technology's Partnership with the U.S. Army to apply high-performance steel to Army applications. 
   American Metalcasting Consortium 
   * Castings for Improved Defense Readiness Program - $1 million for the increased deployed weapons systems' readiness by developing new technology and procurement processes to maintain or improve reliability, availability and maintainability. 
   United Technologies Corporation 
   * Air National Guard Engine Upgrades - $21 million for the continued upgrade of the Block 42 F-16s, that do not provide sufficient power to adequately defend against opposition air defense systems or to be compatible in speed and maneuvering with newer F-16s in the active Air Force.
