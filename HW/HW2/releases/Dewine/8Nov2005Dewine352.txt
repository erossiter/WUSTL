SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR REGIONAL PROJECT IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that he secured federal funds for a Northwest Ohio project in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill Conference Report. The Senate and the House are expected to approve the Report this week, and the bill will then go to the president for his signature.  
   "This project will help protect and preserve one of Ohio's great natural resource," stated Senator DeWine. "I hope by monitoring the lake's water quality, generations to come can enjoy the natural beauty of Lake Erie." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional project in the final version of the bill: 
   Bowling Green State University 
   * Lake Erie Water Quality Monitoring - $500,000 for Bowling Green State University in partnership with the University of Toledo's Lake Erie Center, and the Heidelberg College Water Quality Laboratory for real-time, continuous monitoring and assessment of harmful algal blooms and coliform in Lake Erie. 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following statewide justice projects: 
   Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification/Investigation 
   * $125,000 for equipment and analysis assistance for the Forensic Crime Lab Improvement Project. 
   * $140,000 for upgrades to the Palmprint Identification equipment or the purchase of new equipment for agencies that do not currently have it. 
   Ohio State Highway Patrol 
   * Communication Capabilities - $500,000 for the ability to access information from their patrol vehicles, to allow police, fire, and emergency services to better communicate with each other, and to enable emerging electronic equipment to be easily integrated into police vehicle operations. 
   "Funding these important law enforcement projects will help make our communities safer," stated Senator DeWine. "By providing law enforcement personnel with cutting edge crime-fighting technology we can better protect our families from criminals." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national projects: 
   Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act Grants 
   * Grant Program - $5 million in funding for the grant program to help states and counties design and implement collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health programs. 
   "As a former County Prosecutor, I have seen first hand how non-violent, mentally ill offenders do not receive the treatment they need and get themselves caught in a cycle of arrest, release, and re-arrest. If we can break the cycle by giving them necessary mental health treatment, we can offer hope and a better chance of rehabilitation." 
   Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
   * $106 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) which assists small and medium manufacturers compete in the global marketplace. Participating manufacturers experience productivity increases that are four times greater than non-MEP clients. This is a $59.2 million increase over the President's budget request. 
   Advanced Technology Program 
   * $80 million for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) which supports development of high-risk, cutting-edge technologies with broad commercial potential and social benefits. This program allows companies in Ohio and across the nation to develop the next generation of breakthrough technologies that are unlikely to find funding elsewhere. Funding for the Advanced Technology Program was not included in the President's budget request. 
   "I am pleased my colleagues in the House and Senate saw the importance of funding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Advanced Technology Program in the final version of this appropriations bill," said Senator DeWine. "These programs will help spur the innovative, high-technology, value-added economic growth we need in Ohio and nationwide. Throughout the appropriations process, I fought for these two projects. Their inclusion in the final bill will improve Ohio's strong manufacturing and technology base, providing good, high-paying jobs for Ohioans."
