SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS AKRON PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR TEACHING GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the Akron Public Schools for receiving a grant from the United States Department of Education for the American History Grant Program.  
 In May of this year, Sen. DeWine wrote to officials at the Department of Education supporting the grant request and explaining that over the next three years the $990,505 grant would provide 90 Akron teachers the opportunity to master academic content knowledge of American history, enabling them to pass it on to Akron schoolchildren. 
   "The importance of learning and appreciating American history cannot be understated," said Senator DeWine. "By understanding our history, our children learn about the past as a way to shape the future, preparing them to be informed and active citizens. This grant will help teachers in Akron Public Schools to connect local and national historical events to national themes and engage their students in the critical thinking skills required to understand America's rich history. I applaud the Akron Public School administrators for their efforts and thank the Department of Education for recognizing and funding such a deserving project." 
   Teaching American History Grants support projects to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge, understanding and appreciation of traditional American history. This year Ohio Public Schools have received five such grants totaling nearly $4.5 million.
