SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN COLUMBUS REGION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $8.2 million in funding for Columbus-area projects. 
   "Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedom, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools to perform their mission. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I am proud to help provide them with the resources they need to succeed," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased that Ohio's defense community is able to greatly contribute to necessary projects that support our men and women in uniform."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following area projects:
   LSP Technologies
   * Laser Peening for U.S. Army Helicopters - $4 million to apply laser peening to components of the Army's helicopters and ground vehicles with turbine engines, including Comanche, Black Hawk and Apache helicopters and M1 Abrams tanks. Laser peening prevents components from fretting fatigue, wear that results when two metal components rub against each other.
   Edison Welding Institute
   * Materials Joining for Army Weapons Systems - $3 million to develop joining technologies and materials for advanced lightweight structures for defense systems, including the Army's Future Combat System.
   Columbus Children's Hospital
   * Minimally Invasive Removal of Ballistic Foreign Bodies - $1.2 million to implement a technique developed at Columbus Children's Hospital that removes fragments in a minimally invasive way to the triservice military care system. This will help to address the growing challenge of caring for service personnel injured by bombs and other ballistic trauma in the line of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national program:
   Navy Family Lines
   * COMPASS - $300,000 for a team mentoring program designed to educate new Navy spouses, enabling them to understand the military lifestyle and realistically meet the challenges that lie ahead.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national programs:
   Defense Health Program
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $15 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Prostate Cancer Research Program - $80 million for the prostate cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   The bill now goes to a Conference Committee to reconcile differences with the House version.
