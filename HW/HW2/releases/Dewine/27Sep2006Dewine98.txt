SEN. DEWINE BACKS RESOLUTION TO STRENGTHEN FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Today Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID) and Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) for introducing a bipartisan concurrent resolution in the Senate that calls for public policy that supports and strengthens the ability of farmers and ranchers to band together in cooperative self-help efforts. Sen. DeWine, a member of the Farmer Cooperative Caucus, is an original cosponsor of the resolution. 
   "American farmers play a critical role in our lives, providing us with the world's safest and highest quality food supply. We must continue to support Ohio agriculture's ability to benefit from cooperatives and maintain those rights granted by the Capper-Volstead Act," said Senator DeWine.
   The goal of the resolution is to help farmers join together to form cooperative organizations to market their products and ensure access to competitive markets. There are nearly 3,000 farmer-owned cooperatives throughout the United States with a combined membership representing nearly 2 million farmers. These cooperatives help farmers improve their income, manage their risk, meet their credit needs and compete more effectively in the marketplace. They also help farmers provide consumers with a dependable supply of safe, affordable, high-quality food, fiber and related products.
