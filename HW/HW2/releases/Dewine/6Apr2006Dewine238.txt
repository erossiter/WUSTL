SEN. DEWINE SPONSORED BILL WOULD GIVE MORE HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS
  Sen. Mike DeWine today announced his cosponsorship of Sen. John Ensign's (R-NV) bill that creates more affordable health insurance options. The Affordability in the Individual Market (AIM) Act expands on the foundation of a previously-passed law that established Health Savings Accounts, allowing individuals and families to use their Health Savings Accounts to pay for health insurance plans. "This bill would create more affordable health care options for people and small businesses," said Sen. DeWine, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. "Creating Health Savings Accounts was a good start, but now we need to strengthen them, and this bill does just that. The AIM Act would allow people to use the money they have set aside in their Health Savings Accounts to purchase the health insurance they need." 
   The AIM Act would expand the definition of what is considered a "qualified medical expense" under the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals and families who purchase high deductible health insurance plans on their own to use funds they have set aside in their Health Savings Accounts to pay plan premiums.
   Health Savings Accounts allow individuals with high deductible health insurance to set aside tax-free savings for lifetime healthcare needs.
   Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) is also a cosponsor of the AIM Act.
