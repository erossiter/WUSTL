SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS ELIZABETH'S NEW LIFE CENTER FOR RECEIVING GRANT TO PROMOTE HEALTHY FAMILIES IN DAYTON
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds officials at Elizabeth's New Life Center in Dayton for receiving a $1,754,872 grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy Marriage Promotion program. The grant will be used to help a collaborative effort to establish and maintain healthy marriages and families in the Dayton area. In June, Sen. DeWine wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services supporting the grant request and explaining that it would help fund important skills-based marriage education, support services and targeted media campaigns reinforcing the value of marriage. 
   "Healthy marriages are critical to providing our children with safe and stable homes," said Senator DeWine. "This program will promote healthy marriages and responsible parenting, improving the quality of life for Dayton families and children. I applaud the administrators at Elizabeth's New Life Center for their efforts and I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing and funding such a deserving project."
   Elizabeth's New Life Center has a long history of providing services, education, medical care and material assistance to the poor and needy in the community. Their proposal, "Marriage Works!" will be done in collaboration with nine other faith-based, community-based, and governmental organizations. It will use skills-based marriage education, support services, targeted media campaigns and high school relationship skills education reinforcing the value of marriage.
