SEN. DEWINE SECURES DEFENSE FUNDING FOR CINCINNATI AREA
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Senate passage late yesterday of the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations Conference Report, which includes $183.2 million in funding for Cincinnati-area projects.  
   "These projects are important to help give our service men and women the tools they need to effectively do their jobs," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I work to ensure Ohio's defense community receives funding for worthy projects and I am pleased my colleagues saw the importance of these programs." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure $183.2 million in funding for the following Cincinnati projects: 
   O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company 
   * M1114 Up-Armored HMMWV - $170 million for improved soldier protection on Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard vehicles. This funding will permit the Army to sustain a high rate of production for the Up-Armored HMMWV through Fiscal Year 2006 and provide the Army with much needed armored humvees. 
   Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) and University of Cincinnati 
   * Advanced Center for Telemedicine and Surgical Innovation - $1.2 million for TATRC to be directed to the University of Cincinnati for the development of state-of-the-art laboratories and teaching facilities for robotic telesurgery. This technology holds great promise to improve access and quality of medical care delivers to the war fighter. Robotic telesurgery, remote control of a surgical robot over a telecommunication link, permit hospital surgeons far from the battlefield to deliver care that will save the lives and limbs of soldiers deployed throughout the world. 
   TechSolve 
   * Smart Machine Platform Initiative - $2 million for the development of manufacturing systems that possess complex internal sensing and control systems to create instructions and integrate them in real time into the manufacturing process. 
   Intermec Technologies Corporation 
   * Arsenal/Depot AIT Initiative - $7 million for the expansion of the Army arsenal and maintenance depot inventory upgrading by utilizing commercial, off-the-shelf programs and equipment, like accurate automatic data collection and work-in-process tracking devices, to enhance productivity and permit efficient operations. 
   * Point of Maintenance/Combat Ammunition System Initiative - $3 million for the use of commercial off-the-shelf automatic identification and data collection equipment to streamline mission critical data collection and reduce the burden on flight-line personnel. 
   Senator DeWine also helped secure $217.5 million in funding for national projects in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. "Funding these worthy projects is important to keep our military and the medical research community on the cutting edge as we move farther into the 21st century." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national programs: 
   Defense Health Program 
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $127.5 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $10 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   Lockheed Martin 
   * C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) - $11 million for the procurements of 8 AMP kits to modernize C-5s. AMPs replace difficult-to-maintain components and upgrade the C-5 cockpits. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program because the C-5 is replacing the C-141 which the 445th is flying. 
   * C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP) - $11 million for the replacement and modernization of engines and systems on C-5s. This replacement will save the Air Force more than $1 million per day in operations and support costs. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program because the C-5 is replacing the C-141 which the 445th is flying. 
   Metals Affordability Initiative (MAI) 
   * MAI Consortium - $5 million for continued initiative implementation. The MAI consortium has improved the military's war fighting capability while reducing life-cycle cost through technology innovation. Several Ohio companies participate in this initiative. 
   U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps 
   * Operational Funding - $300,000 for funding the Sea Cadet Corps program that promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation, as well as moral character and self-discipline, for youth ages 11 - 17. 
   Procurement Technical Assistance Program 
   * Assistance Program - $27.009 million for Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs). These PTACs form a network of dedicated procurement professionals who provide assistance to small businesses seeking to participate in the Department of Defense and other federal agencies procurement contracts. PTAC clients are small businesses, including disadvantaged, minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses that can not afford a fulltime marketing and procurement staff. There are 18 PTACs in Ohio. 
   Copper Development Association 
   * Copper Air Quality Program - $1 million for the design, production, and evaluation of copper components for the reduction of harmful microbes in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems. 
   * Copper-Based Casting Technology - $1.2 million for the development and testing of copper in electric motors, generators, and distribution components. Copper in motor rotors has resulted in weight reductions of five to ten percent, as well as three to seven percent reductions in size. 
   Metallurg Vanadium 
   * Vanadium Technology Partnership - $1.5 million for additional case studies and research and to initiate full-scale demonstrations of Vandium Technology's Partnership with the U.S. Army to apply high-performance steel to Army applications. 
   American Metalcasting Consortium 
   * Castings for Improved Defense Readiness Program - $1 million for the increased deployed weapons systems' readiness by developing new technology and procurement processes to maintain or improve reliability, availability and maintainability. 
   United Technologies Corporation 
   * Air National Guard Engine Upgrades - $21 million for the continued upgrade of the Block 42 F-16s, that do not provide sufficient power to adequately defend against opposition air defense systems or to be compatible in speed and maneuvering with newer F-16s in the active Air Force.
