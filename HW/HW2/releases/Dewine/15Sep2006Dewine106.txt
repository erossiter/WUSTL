SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES GRANT TO PROTECT MAHONING VALLEY FAMILIES FROM LEAD POISONING
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that the Mahoning Valley Real Estate Investors Association, Inc. will be awarded $2 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. The funds come from the Operation Lead Elimination Act Program (LEAP) grant program, which offers money to nonprofit and for-profit entities working to eliminate lead poisoning as a major public health threat to children. The grant will be coupled with an additional $4 million in private resources to produce 160 lead safe housing units throughout Youngstown and Mahoning County. 
   "Ohio's families deserve safe and healthy homes to raise their kids," said Senator DeWine. "This funding will protect some of the most vulnerable families in the Mahoning Valley from the deadly effects of lead poisoning. I applaud the Department of Housing and Urban Development for their continued efforts to end childhood lead poisoning for good."
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control addresses childhood lead-based paint poisoning and other childhood diseases associated with poor housing conditions. It promotes preventive measures to correct multiple safety and health hazards in the home environment.
