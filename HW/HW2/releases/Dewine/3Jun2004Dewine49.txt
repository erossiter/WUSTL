COLUMBUS PUBLIC HOUSING FACILITY RECEIVES FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that Jenkins Terrace of Columbus received a demolition grant of $1,164,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development as part of the HOPE VI Program. 
   "Sections of our public housing are in a horrible state of disrepair," said Senator DeWine. "This funding released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development will go a long way to renew these areas and continue to make public housing available to those in need." 
   The goal of the HOPE VI Program is to eradicate severely distressed public housing and was developed through a recommendation by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing.
