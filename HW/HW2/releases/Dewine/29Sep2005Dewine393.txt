SEN. DEWINE SECURES REGIONAL DEFENSE FUNDING
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the committee passage of the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense Appropriations bill, which includes $30.8 million in funding for Miami Valley projects. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.  
   "I am proud to help secure funding for these very worthy projects," said Senator DeWine. "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I want to make sure the defense community in Ohio has proper funding to effectively do their jobs. As our service men and women are combating terror at home and abroad, we need to give them the proper tools as they protect our freedoms. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure funding is retained in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure $30.8 million in funding for the following Miami Valley projects: 
   Wright State University 
   * Advanced Sensor-based Vigilance Technologies for Countering Irregular and Disruptive Threats - $1.3 million for the establishment of a nucleus of expertise to counter irregular and disruptive threats through breakthroughs in innovative technologies. Troops in Iraq face irregular threats and disruptive threats that erode U.S. power in the region. For example, this center will provide for accelerated development and deployments of new sensor and data processing and managements systems. 
   Defense Research Associates, Inc. 
   * Affordable Visible Missile Warning System - $3.5 million for the acceleration for the development and live-fire demonstrations of an affordable visible missile warning system (AVMWS). The Air Force has sponsored two live-fire demonstrations of this technology which show AVWMS has the potential to meet operational warning system requirements. 
   Radiance Technology 
   * Enhanced Space and Missiles Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) - $2 million for the production and development of a PBA. The development of a PBA would support and improve the peacetime support of policy actions, the contingency planning process and a solid intelligence base, should a crisis occur. 
   National Composite Center and Wright Materials 
   * Innovative Process for Fabrication of Nanotubes - $2.5 million for production acceleration and commercial development of cost-effective nanotubes and nanofibers, which are lightweight, super-strong and are used in aerospace structural and multifunctional composites, lightening strike protection and directional thermal and electrical conducting applications in materials and devices. 
   Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation 
   * MASINT Distributed Exploitation Element (MDEE) - $4.5 million for the improved reporting of Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) information into the Air Force's Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). The Ohio Air National Guard and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) plan to have a sustained MASINT/DCGS system in Fiscal Year 2008. 
   University of Dayton Research Institute 
   * Multifunctional Nanostructural Research Institute - $4 million for the optimization of nanocomposite formulations, scaled-up production of those formulations and the development of process and component design for high-quality integrated structures for armored vehicles. Nano-structures materials may offer weight reduction, improved performance and durability, and cost reduction for Future Combat Systems. 
   Wright Brothers Institute 
   * Capabilities Analysis Phase II - $3.5 million for the development of the Wright Brothers Institute capabilities planning efforts for a world-class, multi-customer National Capabilities Analysis Center. 
   Wright Brothers Institute, University of Dayton Research Institute, SAIC 
   * Airborne Environment for Tactical Lasers - $1 million for program acceleration to develop air vehicle technologies to operate high-energy lasers on tactical air vehicle platforms. 
   Alien Technology Corporation 
   * Wright Brothers Institute, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Rapid Adoption Collaboration Initiative - $8.5 million for the establishment of an RFID center in Dayton that will provide an effective way to collaborate with government users, prime contractors, and suppliers to educate and implement RFID into their systems. 
   Senator DeWine also worked on securing $224.309 million in funding for national projects in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. "These programs will keep our military and the medical research field on the cutting edge. I hope my fellow Senators will realize the importance of this funding and retain these programs in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national programs: 
   Defense Health Program 
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $10 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded. 
   Lockheed Martin 
   * C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) - $15 million for the procurements of 8 AMP kits to modernize C-5s. AMPs replace difficult-to-maintain components and upgrade the C-5 cockpits. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program. Beginning this month the C-5 will replace the C-141 which is currently being flown by the 445th. 
   * C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP) - $15 million for the replacement of engines and systems on C-5s with modern ones. This replacement will save the Air Force more than $1 million per day in operations and support costs. The 445th Reserve Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base will benefit from this modification program. Beginning this month the C-5 will replace the C-141 which is currently being flown by the 445th. 
   Metals Affordability Initiative (MAI) 
   * MAI Consortium - $7 million for continued initiative implementation. The MAI consortium has improved the military's war fighting capability while reducing life-cycle cost through technology innovation. Several Ohio companies participate in this initiative. 
   U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps 
   * Operational Funding - $300,000 for funding the Sea Cadet Corps program that promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation, as well as moral character and self-discipline, for youth ages 11 - 17. 
   Procurement Technical Assistance Program 
   * Assistance Program - $27.009 million for Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs). These PTACs form a network of dedicated procurement professionals who provide assistance to small businesses seeking to participate in the Department of Defense and other federal agencies procurement contracts. PTAC clients are small businesses, including disadvantaged, minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses that can not afford a fulltime marketing and procurement staff. There are 18 PTACs in Ohio.
