CLEVELAND PUBLIC HOUSING FACILITY RECEIVES FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today announced that Valley View Estates of Cleveland received two grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development as part of the HOPE VI Program.  
 The first is a demolition grant of $2,201,997 to remove the 243 public housing units. The second is a revitalization grant of $17,447,772 to build 191 units, 95 of which will be set aside for public housing, and 20 new homes, eight of which will be available through HOPE VI funds. 
   "Sections of our public housing are in a horrible state of disrepair," said Senator DeWine. "This funding released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development will go a long way to renew these areas and continue to make public housing available to those in need." 
   The goal of the HOPE VI Program is to eradicate severely distressed public housing and was developed through a recommendation by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing.
