SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOUTHEAST OHIO PROJECT
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Committee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill that includes $500,000 to help Southeast Ohio. 
   "As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have helped secure funding for this worthy project. I look forward to working with my colleagues to maintain funding in the final version of the bill," said Senator DeWine. "This project will help Southeast Ohio residents and their families receive necessary treatment close to home, instead of traveling to larger cities hours away to receive medical care."
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following project:
   Genesis HealthCare System
   * Enhanced Outpatient Cancer Services -- $500,000 to provide more comprehensive outpatient cancer care for the Appalachian region in Ohio.
   This bill now goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
