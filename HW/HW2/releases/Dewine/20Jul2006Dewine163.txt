SENATE PASSED VOTING RIGHTS REAUTHORIZATION, BILL ON WAY TO PRESIDENT'S DESK FOR SIGNATURE
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), today announced the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization passed the full Senate, 98-0. The Reauthorization passed the House last week, and the bill is now on the way to the President to be signed into law. Sen. DeWine is an original cosponsor of the bill. 
   "I am pleased my House and Senate colleagues overwhelmingly voted to pass the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization, because while there is still work to be done, this Act goes a long way in assuring that all citizens are guaranteed the rights promised in the 15th Amendment," said Senator DeWine. "I truly hope that after this 25 year renewal is completed, we will find that no more congressional action is necessary, and that as a society we have fulfilled the promise enshrined in our Constitution - that every American will have the equal right to vote." The Voting Rights Act was originally passed in 1965 to protect the 15th amendment right to vote, which was illegally being denied to many citizens based on their race or ethnicity. The bill was last renewed in 1982 and some of the provisions are expiring. It has been an extraordinary success and we can see its results in towns, counties, and states across the country. The Voting Rights Act has helped minority voters get their voices heard, and votes counted. This bill will help assure that all citizens have the opportunity to exercise this critical right freely and easily. The Voting Rights Act would reauthorize expiring provisions for another 25 years.
