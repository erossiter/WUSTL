SEN. DEWINE AMENDMENT INCLUDED IN TAX BILL WOULD HELP CREATE JOBS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), with Sen. Ben Nelson (D-NE), introduced and worked to pass an amendment to S.2020, the Tax Relief Bill of 2005, which would establish a preference under the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection contracting program to hire disabled veterans and other people with disabilities.  
 The amendment was included in the bill, which passed the Senate last night.
   "There are currently 15 million Americans with disabilities who are unemployed and actively searching for employment," stated Senator DeWine. "This amendment would help create the opportunities they need to provide for themselves; well-paying jobs that often include health and retirement benefits."
   In order for a company to qualify for the preference, they need to employ a minimum of 50 persons and veterans with severe disabilities. Once an IRS contract is awarded, the company would be required to hire additional persons or veterans with severe disabilities to work on the IRS contract. That is, 35 percent of the IRS contract workforce would be required to be disabled veterans or persons with disabilities. If held in Conference, this would be purely prospective in nature, applying only to the next round of anticipated contracts and not affecting the bidding process currently underway.
   "When the Congress passed the "American Jobs Creation Act of 2004", it certainly did not intend to curtail the government's long-standing commitment to creating meaningful job opportunities for people with disabilities and disabled veterans, and this amendment remedies the situation," continued Senator DeWine.
