BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL GROUP FIGHTS TO IMPROVE BENEFITS FOR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE
  A bipartisan group of Senators and House members will hold a press conference on Wednesday February 9th to announce the introduction of the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005.  
 The legislation is designed to improve retirement and healthcare benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserves. The group includes U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Hillary Clinton (D-New York), Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), George Allen (R-Virginia), Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Saxby Chambliss (R-Georgia), and Reps. Tom Latham (R-Iowa) and Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina).
  The bill would allow Guardsmen and Reservists to receive TRICARE coverage on a full-time basis for a monthly premium. TRICARE is the military healthcare system. In addition, the legislation provides for a decrease in retirement age based on years of service.
