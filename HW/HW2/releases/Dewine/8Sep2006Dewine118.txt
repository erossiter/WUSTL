SEN. DEWINE SECURES FUNDING FOR DEFENSE PROJECTS IN CINCINNATI REGION
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill contains $956.7 million in funding for Cincinnati-area projects. 
   "Given all the sacrifices that our service men and women make in defense of our freedom, the least we can do is provide them with the proper tools to perform their mission. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I am proud to help provide them with the resources they need to succeed," said Senator DeWine. "I am pleased that Ohio's defense community is able to greatly contribute to necessary projects that support our men and women in uniform."
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following area projects:
   O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company
   * Up-Armored HMMVW Program - $614.7 million for production of Up-Armored HMMVWs. The Up-Armored HMMWV was developed to provide improved soldier protection with primary use by military/security police, special operations, and scout units. It is a proven system with documented evidence of saving lives. It is the primary vehicle of choice for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and provides the highest level of protection in its class
   General Electric Aviation
   * F-136 Alternative Engine for the Joint Strike Fighter - $340 million to fund the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter. This will drive increases in overall engine quality and competitive pricing for the F-136, one of the key aircrafts used by the Air Force now and well into the future.
   The Sherwin-Williams Company
   * Life Shield Blast Resistant Panels - $2 million for research to determine how Life Shield Panels, a cost effective, superior blast resistance shield, can be applied to nonstandard structures and vehicles.
   Senator DeWine secured funding for the following national program:
   Navy Family Lines
   * COMPASS - $300,000 for a team mentoring program designed to educate new Navy spouses, enabling them to understand the military lifestyle and realistically meet the challenges that lie ahead.
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national programs:
   Defense Health Program
   * Breast Cancer Research Program - $150 million for the breast cancer research program administered by the Army. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Ovarian Cancer Research Program - $15 million for the ovarian cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   * Prostate Cancer Research Program - $80 million for the prostate cancer research program. This program responds quickly to cutting-edge scientific advances and is able to focus on research that is traditionally under funded.
   The bill now goes to a Conference Committee to reconcile differences with the House version.
