SEN. DEWINE APPLAUDS U.S. MARSHALS FOR SUCCESSFUL CAPTURE OF SEX OFFENDERS
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) today applauds the U.S. Marshals Service and its state, local and federal partners for capturing 1,659 sex offenders during Operation FALCON III (Federal And Local Cops Organized Nationally), a seven day nationally coordinated fugitive sweep which netted a total of 10,773 felony fugitives. This successful effort to protect our nation's communities from sexual predators is due in part to the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a law that Sen. DeWine helped write, which makes it a federal felony, subject to 10 years in jail, to fail to register as a sex offender. Under this bill, once sex offenders fail to register they become priority targets for the federal marshal service, and the full resources of the federal government can be used to catch them and lock them up. Over 80 Ohio sex offenders were apprehended in the operation and many of them will be charged under the Adam Walsh Act. 
   "The success of Operation FALCON III shows how much can be accomplished by our law enforcement agencies when they work together with the right resources and information," said Senator DeWine. "As a former Greene County prosecutor, I know how important it is to give our law enforcement officers the tools they need to protect our families, which is why I helped author the Adam Walsh Act. In the few months since its passage, this bill has already made a difference, taking sex offenders off the streets and away from our children."
   Senator DeWine was an author and original cosponsor of the Adam Walsh Child Protection Act, which was signed into law on July 27th. The bill establishes a National Sex Offender Registry, creates mandatory minimums for federal crimes of violence against victims under 12, increases penalties for sex offenders, provides more resources to enforce sexual exploitation laws, and provides more tools to prosecute accused sex offenders.
