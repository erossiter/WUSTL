SEN. DEWINE SECURES NORTHEAST OHIO PROJECTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that appropriations projects affecting Northeast Ohio were included in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill Conference Report. The Senate and the House are expected to approve the Report this week, and the bill will then go to the president for his signature.  
   "I am proud to have secured money for these worthy projects in Northeast Ohio, they will help area workers, preserve the area's natural resources, keep families safe, and keep the region's aerospace technology research on the cutting edge," stated Senator DeWine. "These projects directly benefit Ohioans and I am pleased my colleagues in the House and Senate saw the impact they would have on the community and voted to include these projects in the final version of the bill." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following regional projects in the final version of the bill: 
   Lake County Metro Parks and Trust for Public Land 
   * Grand River Big Bend - $310,000 for acquiring a 56 acre parcel of riverfront property in the City of Painesville to preserve water quality and wildlife habitat and create greater river access for the public. The land contains important floodplain wetlands and 3400 feet of frontage on the Grand River. 
   Lorain Community College 
   * Great Lakes Business Growth and Development Center - $100,000 for the construction of the Great Lakes Business Growth and Development Center within the Great Lakes Technology Park. 
   Summit County 
   * Pond Brook Wetland - $1.35 million for the acquisition of the 236-acre Pond Brook wetland parcel. Pond Brook is the keystone in a larger wetland and open space protection effort, which will link three existing regional parks and preserves. 
   Geauga County Prosecutor's Office 
   * Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force - $175,000 for the public/private partnership that identifies, locates, and apprehends criminals. 
   NASA Glenn Research Center 
   * Power and Propulsion Programs - $2.75 million for research and technology programs in electric power and propulsion programs, fuel cells, and other forms of energy storage. 
   * Aeronautics - $1.1 million in additional earmark funding for research and technology programs in advanced aeronautics programs, including turbine engine research and other key technologies for continued U.S. global leadership in civil and military aerospace. 
   * Applied Research - $750,000 for research in nuclear power and propulsion systems, including surface power, nuclear electric power, and nuclear thermal power. This funding will help maintain NASA Glenn's pre-eminent role in advanced power and propulsion systems for use in space exploration. 
   * Human Health and Performance Programs - $400,000 for collaborative programs including medical monitoring, cardiac health, and other strengths of the Northeast Ohio biomedical community. This funding will aid NASA Glenn's effort develop innovative support systems for human astronauts during extended space exploration missions. 
   * Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program - $4 million for NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program (UEET), a leading aeronautics research and development initiative focused on improving turbine engines in areas such as fuel efficiency, noise reduction, and reliability. 
   * Garrett Morgan Commercialization Initiative - $1 million for technology transfer programs designed to increase the competitiveness of small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses by providing enhanced access to NASA technology, resources and expertise. 
   In addition, Senator DeWine helped secure $912 million for NASA's aeronautics program by sponsoring an amendment in the Senate and by co-sponsoring an aeronautics amendment to the FY06 budget. This is a $6 million increase over FY05 appropriations. Additionally, Senator DeWine led eight other senators in sending a letter to appropriators requesting full funding for aeronautics in the final conference report. 
   "The aeronautics funding provided in this bill is a major victory for NASA Glenn and its research partners in the private sector and academia. I will continue to do everything I can to protect NASA Glenn and the vital jobs and innovation it provides for the State of Ohio," explained Senator DeWine. 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following statewide projects: 
   Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification/Investigation 
   * Forensic Crime Lab Improvement Project - $125,000 for equipment and analysis assistance. 
   * Palmprint Identification - $140,000 for upgrades to current Palmprint Identification equipment or the purchase of new equipment for agencies that do not currently have it. 
   Ohio State Highway Patrol 
   * Communication Capabilities - $500,000 for the ability to access information from their patrol vehicles, to allow police, fire, and emergency services to better communicate with each other, and to enable emerging electronic equipment to be easily integrated into police vehicle operations. 
   "Funding these important law enforcement projects will help make our communities safer," stated Senator DeWine. "By providing law enforcement personnel with cutting edge crime-fighting technology we can better protect our families from criminals." 
   Senator DeWine helped secure funding for the following national projects: 
   Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act Grants 
   * Grant Program - $5 million in funding for the grant program to help states and counties design and implement collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health programs. 
   "As a former County Prosecutor, I have seen first hand how non-violent, mentally ill offenders do not receive the treatment they need and get themselves caught in a cycle of arrest, release, and re-arrest. If we can break the cycle by giving them necessary mental health treatment, we can offer hope and a better chance of rehabilitation." 
   Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
   * $106 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) which assists small and medium manufacturers compete in the global marketplace. Participating manufacturers experience productivity increases that are four times greater than non-MEP clients. This is a $59.2 million increase over the President's budget request. 
   Advanced Technology Program 
   * $80 million for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) which supports development of high-risk, cutting-edge technologies with broad commercial potential and social benefits. This program allows companies in Ohio and across the nation to develop the next generation of breakthrough technologies that are unlikely to find funding elsewhere. Funding for the Advanced Technology Program was not included in the President's budget request. 
   "I am pleased my colleagues in the House and Senate saw the importance of funding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Advanced Technology Program in the final version of this appropriations bill," said Senator DeWine. "These programs will help spur the innovative, high-technology, value-added economic growth we need in Ohio and nationwide. Throughout the appropriations process, I fought for these two projects. Their inclusion in the final bill will improve Ohio's strong manufacturing and technology base, providing good, high-paying jobs for Ohioans."
