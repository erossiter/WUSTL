SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH, REP. STRICKLAND URGE EXPEDITED PROCESS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN LAWRENCE COUNTY
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH), and Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Lucasville) sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce to request that the approval process of the Lawrence County Port Authority Foreign Trade Zone Application be expedited. With a Foreign Trade Zone designation, Lawrence County and Southern Ohio could better attract new industry, encourage existing industry to remain and reinvest in the community and create new employment opportunities. 
   "As a Foreign Trade Zone, Lawrence County would be better able to attract new industry to the region, which in turn would increase economic development and create jobs for hardworking families," said Senator DeWine.
   "As competition increases both domestically and internationally, local authorities will have to pull out all the stops to encourage economic development. A Foreign Trade Zone designation is one such tool they can use to bolster industry and create jobs," said Senator Voinovich.
   "The pressures of globalization are giving companies an incentive to look overseas," said Rep. Strickland. "But a Foreign Trade Zone designation will raise Lawrence County's profile in its efforts to attract and help keep jobs right here in southern Ohio."
   There has not been any opposition to Lawrence County's application, and it has the support of the community and members of the local school board. Senators DeWine and Voinovich and Congressman Strickland urge the Foreign Trade Zone Board to expedite the standard 120 day approval process and asked to be notified when the review process is complete.
