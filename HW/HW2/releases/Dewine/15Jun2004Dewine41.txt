SEN. DEWINE ADDRESSES GATHERING AT 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF WIC PROGRAM IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY
  REMARKS: AS PREPARED CUYAHOGA COUNTY WIC PROGRAM 30TH ANNIVERSAY EVENT
   * I'm happy to be here with you today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the WIC program in Cuyahoga County. Thank you all for what you do each day to assist women and children across the County. What you do matters. What you do makes a difference every day to so many families in need.  
   * I'd like to take just a moment to give a special thank you to Director Barbara Riley and Manager Susan Conover. Your many, many years of service and dedication to improving the health of children and mothers has changed lives - no doubt it has saved lives. Thank you for that. 
   * I know I don't have to explain to you the importance of the WIC program to the many pregnant and nursing women and infants and children who benefit from the food program and from the related services your agency provides. 
   * WIC has proven to be one of the most successful public health nutrition programs ever created by Congress. Nearly one-half of the infants born in this country receive WIC benefits. 
   * Participation in the WIC program has been shown to: - Reduce fetal deaths and infant mortality; - Reduce low birth-weight rates and increases the duration of pregnancy; - Improve the growth of nutritionally at-risk infants and children; - Decrease the incidence of iron deficiency anemia in children; - Improve the dietary intake of pregnant and postpartum women and improve weight gain in pregnant women; and - Significantly improve children's diets. 
   * Furthermore, children enrolled in WIC are more likely to have a regular source of medical care and have more up to date immunizations. WIC helps get children ready to start school, and children who receive WIC benefits demonstrate improved intellectual development. 
   * It's clear - the nutrition services you provide are invaluable to the women and children whom you reach. I congratulate you on the important work that you have done these past 30 years, and I pledge to do all that I can to help you continue and expand this work in the future.
