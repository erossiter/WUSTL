SEN. DEWINE ANNOUNCES GRANTS AVAILABE TO HELP MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS
  Sen. Mike DeWine is pleased to announce that the Bureau of Justice Assistance within the United States Department of Justice has begun accepting applications for a grant program authorized by DeWine's Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004 (S.1194). The grants, which are available to state, tribal and local governments, may be used to develop and implement a variety of programs designed to improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness involved in the criminal justice system. For example, they could be used to establish mental health courts, provide in-jail treatment and transitional services, as well as provide additional training for mental health personnel, police, judges, prosecutors, and corrections officials. 
   "I am very pleased that grants are now available to help end the cycle of non-violent, mentally ill offenders who are arrested and put in jail repeatedly," said Senator DeWine. "I wrote this bill to offer hope by creating a chance for them to receive the treatment they need to break the cycle of arrest, release, and re-arrest."
   The programs must be developed as a collaboration between a law enforcement agency and a mental health agency. Three types of grants are available:
   * Planning ($50,000 maximum award)
   * Planning and Implementation ($250,000 maximum award)
   * Implementation and Expansion ($200,000 maximum award)
   In October of 2004, President Bush signed the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004 into law. The bill addresses the problem of disproportionate numbers of mentally ill individuals in the criminal justice system. It provides incentives such as grants to the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health and substance abuse treatment systems to provide treatment to non-violent mentally ill offenders.
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that over 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders.
   The deadline for applications is 8:00 p.m. on June 2. For more information about this program, go to: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/grant/06MIOsol.pdf.
