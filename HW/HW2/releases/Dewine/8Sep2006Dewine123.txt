SEN. DEWINE RESOLUTION TO STOP ESCALATING CRISIS IN SUDAN INTRODUCED
  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) announced his support as the lead Republican sponsor for the Biden-DeWine Senate Resolution (S. Res. 559), which calls on the President to take immediate steps to stop the violence in Darfur. Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE) introduced the resolution yesterday. 
   "It is critical that a robust U.N. peacekeeping force be deployed to Darfur as soon as possible," said Senator DeWine. "We are at a period similar to the one we faced just before the genocide in Rwanda. We must act now to avert an even greater tragedy than what exists on the ground today."
   Despite last week's passage of a UN Security Council Resolution authorizing a UN peacekeeping force of up to 22,500, the Sudanese government continues to reject the deployment of UN peacekeepers and has dramatically intensified the war against innocent civilians in Darfur. Four months after a peace deal was signed in Nigeria, bombing raids and ground attacks have increased and thousands of citizens continue to flood refugee camps. Violence and disease in the region is reported to have left as many as 450,000 people dead and 2 million homeless.
   Senator DeWine has consistently called for an end to the genocide in Darfur, and has worked to improve the humanitarian conditions there. Most recently he cosponsored the Biden-DeWine Amendment to the Emergency Supplemental bill signed into law in June. It creates a special envoy for Sudan to address the genocide in the Darfur region. He also cosponsored an amendment to the May 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act that imposes sanctions against perpetrators of crimes against humanity in the Darfur region. This provision became law May 11, 2005.
