VERMONT DELEGATION HITS PRESIDENT BUSH'S PROPOSED DAIRY TAX
  Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Jim Jeffords, and Rep.  
 Bernie Sanders released the following reaction to the milk tax proposed in President Bush's 2007 budget proposal, released Monday by the White House. The President's budget calls for imposing a dairy tax of 3 cents per hundredweight. His plan would also cut all commodity programs, including the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program, by 5 percent.
   "While pressing for even more tax cuts to the wealthy, the President in his budget proposes a brand new tax increase on America's dairy farmers. This is a morally bankrupt plan to tax hardworking dairy farmers who are already suffering from escalating fuel costs and declining prices for their milk. The Administration's proposal to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of family dairy farmers is dead on arrival with us, and we will do all we can to make sure that Congress does not approve it."
