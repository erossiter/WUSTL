SEN. JEFFORDS CHALLENGES INTERNATIONAL PAPER ON TIRE BURN TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today challenged International Paper Company's claim that it has updated its equipment at its Ticonderoga plant in response to concerns that the plant now wants to test burn up to 72 tons of shredded tires a day.  
   "I believe this response from International Paper demonstrates exactly why we have serious concerns about their plan to burn tires. They say 'trust us,' but they don't want to do what is needed to win our trust," said Jeffords, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "This plant is a dinosaur, and until they upgrade the plant with state-of-the-art equipment, they shouldn't even consider burning tires." 
   In a letter sent to New York Gov. George Pataki on Monday, Jeffords called on the governor to reject IP's plan to test burn shredded tires, saying the plant lacked the equipment to remove the fine particulate matter and heavy metals, including toxic air pollutants such as mercury, that would result from the tire burn.
   An IP spokesperson responded to Jeffords' letter late Monday by saying that IP had upgraded its technologies in 1996. But Jeffords said those upgrades still would not capture the fine particulate materials that are especially worrisome. In addition to mercury, these include zinc, cadmium, arsenic, lead and chromium.
   Jeffords is calling for IP to install the same type of technology used by other tire burning plants -- specifically electrostatic precipitators and a Kevlar baghouse -- which are designed to capture the fine particulate matter that would be emitted from tire burning.
   Jeffords said the IP plant, located on the shores of Lake Champlain and upwind of many Vermont farms, has shown a poor track record of environmental compliance, and he noted that when the company embarked on a two-day test burn of tires at the plant in 1997, it never even notified officials in Vermont.
