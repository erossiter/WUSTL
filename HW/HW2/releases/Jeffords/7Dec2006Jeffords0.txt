VERMONT DELEGATION REQUESTS GROUNDWATER STUDIES INFORMATION FROM EPA
Sen. Jim Jeffords today sent the attached letter requesting information about Environmental Protection Agency programs that support groundwater studies to Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson.  
 This Congress, Jeffords introduced S. 2054, which would authorize $6,000,000 for the United States Geological Survey to partner with the state of Vermont on a groundwater mapping project. Today's letter adds to that effort to enhance clean water in Vermont. 
 "Groundwater mapping is step one toward making informed decisions that will serve the people of Vermont and the environment well," Jeffords, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in the letter. 
 Jeffords, I-Vt., was joined in the letter by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
