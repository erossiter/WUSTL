SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  "I am pleased the 9/11 Commission released its report and I hope it brings some comfort to the families of the victims. Unfortunately, I am not surprised by many of the findings in this report. However, now that we've reviewed the past we must look to the future to ensure that these types of intelligence failures are not repeated. We in Congress must give active consideration to these and other recommendations, and this should be the first item of business when we return in September."
