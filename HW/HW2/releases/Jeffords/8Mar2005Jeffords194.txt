SEN. JEFFORDS RE-INTRODUCES PATIENT SAFETY BILL
  Joined by a bipartisan group of colleagues, Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today re-introduced a patient safety bill that will create a new confidential and voluntary system for reporting medical errors in an effort to stem the number of needless patient injuries and deaths. Jeffords' patient safety bill unanimously passed the Senate last Congress, but stalled when the House failed to appoint conferees. The bill introduced today is scheduled for a mark-up in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee tomorrow. 
   "This legislation will literally save lives by reducing the number of unnecessary medical errors, which account for nearly 100,000 deaths a year," Jeffords said. "There is no reason that we cannot do better, and this bill will help ensure that avoidable medical errors are not repeated."
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 encourages health care providers to report errors and "near misses" to Patient Safety Organizations, which would use the data to develop recommendations and promote standards to avoid future mistakes. 
   The bill also includes protections for patient confidentiality. Jeffords first sponsored a patient safety bill in 2000 following a report from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) that noted that medical errors are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as many as 98,000 people dying per year. More people die from medical mistakes than from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS or breast cancer, the report noted. 
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act 
   This legislation: 
   * Encourages a culture of safety and quality by providing for the legal protection of information reported voluntarily for the purposes of patient safety and quality improvement. 
   * Creates incentives for voluntary reporting systems that are non-punitive and promote learning to help ensure medical errors will not be repeated. 
   * Recognizes that to be effective, these systems must engender the trust and cooperation of the health care providers 
   * Provides for a mechanism to share and disseminate information learned about improving patient safety 
   * Complements many ongoing patient safety initiatives in the public and private sector in which operational expertise is currently being developed 
   This legislation does not: 
   * Alter existing rights or remedies available to injured patients 
   * Compromise a patient's privacy rights concerning their medical information 
   * Mandate a punitive reporting systems 
   SUMMARY OF THE PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT 
   * Creates a system for voluntary reporting of medical errors to promote the development of interventions and solutions to ensure that such errors will not be repeated. 
   * Confidential Reporting to Patient Safety Organizations - Health care providers would be given the opportunity to report medical errors, incidents of "near misses" and enhanced heath care quality practices to "patient safety organizations" (PSOs). 
   * PSO's Develop Recommendations, Interventions and Best Practices - PSO's are private or public organizations or a component of such an organization and are tasked with analyzing reported patient safety data and developing strategic guidance to give back to providers on how to improve patient safety and the quality of care. 
   * PSO's May Provide Information to the National Patient Safety Database - PSO's may provide information - in which the patient, provider, and reporter are not identifiable - to a National Patient Safety Database. 
   * Allows PSO's and Providers to Disseminate Methods and Strategies - PSOs and providers may disseminate information on recommended interventions and best practices to other PSO's, providers and consumers, to improve quality of care and enhance patient safety. 
   * Establishes a federal evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to promote the reporting of medical errors. 
   * Privilege granted for reports to PSO's - The legislation grants a privilege for data and reports being collected and developed by providers and data and reports sent to PSO's. 
   * Health Care Providers Can Share Patient Safety Information - Health care providers can report and analyze medical errors, without fear of being sued and without compromising patient's legal rights. This non-punitive environment fosters the sharing of medical error information. 
   * Current opportunities for discovery are preserved - The bill ensures that information, such as medical records, that exist separately from the patient safety process would remain discoverable under State or Federal law. 
   * Promotes the development of national standards to integrate health care technology information systems. 
   The legislation requires the Secretary to develop or adopt voluntary national standards that promote the integration of health care information technology systems.
