SEN. JEFFORDS' ISSUES STATEMENT ON GATES VOTE
Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. 
 On Senate Vote to Confirm Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense
 "I am pleased the Senate has confirmed a new Secretary of Defense. It's about time. We need a leader at the Department of Defense who will take into account the professional opinions of senior military leaders. We need a Secretary of Defense who will work well with other Cabinet members and take valuable advice when appropriate. We need a Secretary of Defense who will give the President a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and will recommend bold policy changes. I am hopeful that Robert Gates is up to the task, and for that reason, I voted today in support of his nomination."
