SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANWR/DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., issued the following statement today after the Senate voted 94-1 to proceed to the Department of Defense Appropriations conference report.  
 Jeffords, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, cast the lone vote against doing so: 
   "I voted against proceeding with this defense spending bill because I will not be a part of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. This bill would not just allow for drilling in ANWR, it will allow for it in the most environmentally unsound way. Adding this provision to a defense spending bill is irresponsible. I have a long record of supporting the military but I cannot defend this legislative process, nor drilling in the Arctic Refuge."
