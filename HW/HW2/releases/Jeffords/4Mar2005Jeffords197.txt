REP JEFFORDS' APPLAUDS REP. JOHNSON'S NOMINATION
  Rep. Jeffords' Statement on Rep. Steve Johnson Nomination
   "I applaud the decision to nominate Stephen Johnson to head the EPA, and will work to move his nomination through the Senate.  
 His experience and temperament make him a solid choice to lead the agency at this time. The Bush Administration has the worst environmental record in history, and I am hopeful that given Steve's background and experience, he can bring a fresh and new approach to the Administration. The Bush Administration can not continue to ignore the serious environmental problems facing our nation and the world. I can only hope that this appointment will help repair and restore the credibility of the Bush Administration's environmental record with the American public, Congress and the world."
