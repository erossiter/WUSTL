VERMONT DELEGATION ANNOUNCES EPA BROWNFIELDS GRANTS
  The Vermont congressional delegation today announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $610,000 in brownfields grants to three Vermont regional planning agencies. The Brownfields Program helps communities clean up, develop and reuse old industrial sites. 
   Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee and a co-author of the Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 said, "I'm pleased to see that the new brownfields law, of which I was an original co-sponsor, is working as intended to restore blighted sites and create jobs. I remain disappointed, however, that the Bush Administration again is not seeking to fully fund the program. I will continue to fight for additional funds so that more communities can realize the benefits of brownfields revitalization."
   Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a senior member of the Appropriations panel that funds the Brownfields program, said, "These funds help our towns turn liabilities into assets. This is a program that helps our communities reclaim land to spur economic development and jobs." Leahy has championed expansion of the program and has worked to redevelop sites throughout the state.
   Congressman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said, "I am pleased that the EPA has awarded three Vermont regional planning commissions over half a million dollars to explore possible reclamation of polluted land that would otherwise languish and force development elsewhere. If the conditions are right for appropriate redevelopment of land in these three areas, it will be a boost to the local economy and a net win for the environment."
