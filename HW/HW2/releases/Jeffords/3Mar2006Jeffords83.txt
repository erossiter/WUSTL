ED FLEX EXTENSION UNANIMOUSLY PASSES THE SENATE
  Late Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed an extension of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act (Ed Flex). The bill was sponsored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., and cosponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. The legislation will allow states that have strong accountability standards under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law to continue to waive certain federal education requirements.  
   Ed Flex was first enacted in 1999 under the leadership of Jeffords when he was chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Under the supervision of the federal Department of Education, the law allows states to grant waivers to local school districts for some provisions under NCLB. 
   Vermont is one of ten states that have taken advantage of Ed Flex. For example, the law has allowed some school districts in Vermont to garner federal dollars to strengthen the curriculum to address the educational needs of disadvantaged students. The 1999 law's waiver authority for Vermont is set to expire this coming September unless the Ed Flex extension is enacted. 
   "This legislation will enable Vermont to continue to have flexibility under No Child Left Behind," said Jeffords. "This flexibility is extremely important, especially in the wake of tight education budgets at the federal, state, and local levels. Passage of Ed Flex will give Vermont the opportunity to better target its federal education dollars for elementary and secondary education."
   "One of my chief concerns with No Child Left Behind has been that the 'one-size-fits-all' approach does not meet the needs of Vermont," said Leahy. "By moving to extend the Ed Flex program, we are ensuring that Vermont schools will continue to have flexibility in meeting their individual needs. I commend Sen. Jeffords for his persistence in working to pass this needed extension."
   This legislation will now move to the House of Representatives for consideration.
