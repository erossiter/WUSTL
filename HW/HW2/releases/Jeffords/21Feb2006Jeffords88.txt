VERMONT DELEGATION ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING BURLINGTON BALLOT QUESTION ABOUT NATIONAL GUARD
  "Though we opposed the war in Iraq, we are steadfast in our support and appreciation for the sacrifices and the skill of the men and women of the Vermont National Guard. To this end, we have worked to improve and strengthen the Vermont National Guard and Burlington International Airport. The Air Guard makes an important contribution to our national defense, and we believe its presence at the Burlington Airport is beneficial to Vermont. We oppose Burlington City's Ballot Question #6, as its passage would be harmful to both the airport and the Vermont Guard. We hope that opposition to the war in Iraq will not be misdirected towards the Vermont Air Guard."
