COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. JEFFORDS' NUKE POWER PLANT SECURITY BILL
  The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee today approved legislation, co-authored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., to strengthen the security at nuclear power plants. Jeffords is the ranking member of the EPW Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  
   "This legislation requires the 103 nuclear power plants in the United States to strengthen security measures throughout their facilities. Since September 11th we have made progress in securing our nuclear plants, but we must do more. We have a serious responsibility to ensure that nuclear power plants are as safe as they can possibly be," said Jeffords.
   Jeffords authored the legislation with EPW Committee Chairman James Inhofe, R - Okla., and U.S. Sens. George Voinovich, R - Ohio, and Tom Carper, D - Del. 
   The Nuclear Security Infrastructure Act of 2005:
   * allows security guards to possess more powerful weapons (machine guns, semiautomatic, assault weapons, etc.) when they are engaged in the protection of NRC-licensed or NRC certified facilities;
   * requires the NRC to issue new regulations to address any identified security threats and establishes requirements for fingerprinting and criminal history record checks to ensure that no individual who presents a threat to national security is employed at nuclear power plants;
   * requires that NRC conduct security evaluations at each licensed facility at least once every three years. The security evaluations must include force-on-force exercises that simulate security threats, to the maximum extent possible, in accordance with the applicable design basis threat;
   * requires NRC to develop guidelines for implementing a uniform materials control and accountability program for spent fuel rods. The NRC is currently conducting a pilot program to address this issue;
   * requires the NRC to issue regulations to control the international import and export of radiation sources to prevent the development of a dirty bomb.
