SENATE COMMITTEE AGREES TO SEN. JEFFORDS' REQUEST FOR BURLINGTON COURTHOUSE STUDY
  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today agreed to study whether to build a new federal courthouse in Burlington, Vt.  
   Built in 1958, the current courthouse lacks important security precautions, including barriers to keep vehicles a safe distance from the building, and staff workspace that is segregated from public areas. The courthouse also has an outdated elevator system.
   "Anyone who has been in the Burlington courthouse knows it is long past time we looked into getting a safer and more modern facility," said Jeffords, who introduced the resolution authorizing the study. 
   The study will be performed by the General Services Administration, the largest civilian landlord of the United States. The GSA is under the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which Jeffords serves as the ranking member.
