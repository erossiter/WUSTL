SEN. JEFFORDS' REACTION TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  "Once again, Vermonters and the American people heard President Bush say all the right things, but his five-year record demonstrates something very different.  
 As the United States faces mounting casualties in Iraq, soaring energy prices, a crisis in healthcare, huge deficits, and many other pressing problems, President Bush chose empty promises over realistic solutions."
   "President Bush spoke again about reducing our nation's dependence on foreign oil, but our nation is now more dependent than ever before. He spoke about a responsibility to insure the poor and elderly, but his budget forces low-income people off Medicaid and into the ranks of the uninsured. He spoke about the importance of education to compete in the global economy, but his Administration has worked to cut students' financial aid. Simply put, his record does not support his rhetoric."
