SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR VERMONT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded three more Vermont fire departments a total of $140,721 in grants to support the departments' roles as first responders in their communities.  
 The following departments will be receiving grants:
   * Orwell Volunteer Fire Department: $38,808
  * Orleans Fire Department: $65,700
  * Ryegate Volunteer Fire Department: $36,213 
   Jeffords said, "These additional firefighter grants will make our communities safer and better equipped to handle whatever emergencies they may face." Jeffords served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; defend against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the Department's United States Fire Administration and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants.
