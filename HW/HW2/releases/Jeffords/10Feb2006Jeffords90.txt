SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEMA'S INCLUSION IN DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
  In response to Michael Brown's testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs today, Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., Ranking Member of the Senate the Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following statement:  
   "After September 11th, the Department of Homeland Security was formed. In what I believe is an example of extremely poor judgment that failed to take into account the unique mission of FEMA in responding to natural disasters, FEMA was moved into the Department. In 2002, I opposed the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, in large part because of FEMA's inclusion. Sadly, Hurricane Katrina confirmed my concerns about FEMA's ability to respond to natural disasters.''
