SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH IMMIGRATION PLAN
  "For both security and economic reasons, it is important that Congress pass comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens border enforcement, establishes a temporary worker program that satisfies America's labor needs, and addresses the reality that there are millions of immigrants currently residing in the United States illegally. As we continue to debate this issue in the Senate, I will work to ensure that Vermont's businesses, including dairy farms, have access to an adequate workforce and that travel between Canada and Vermont is not unnecessarily stifled."  
   "With members of the National Guard already serving overseas in unprecedented numbers, and the hurricane season fast-approaching, I am very concerned that President Bush's proposal may be spreading the Guard too thin."
