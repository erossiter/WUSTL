SENS. JEFFORDS, LEAHY CALL ON ADMINISTRATION TO STOP PUMPING GASOLINE PRICES HIGHER
  Vermont's Sens. Jim Jeffords (I) and Patrick Leahy (D) Monday called on the Bush Administration to slow the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in light of skyrocketing gasoline prices in Vermont and across the country.  
   Leahy, Jeffords and 28 other senators wrote to U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham asking why, despite the high price of gasoline, the Bush Administration has increased the rate they are filling the SPR to 300,000 barrels per day, taking substantial amounts of oil off the market while gasoline prices have increased more than 22 percent nationally. The letter cites recent reports in Oil Daily that claim filling the SPR at a very high rate contributes to higher crude oil and gasoline prices. Currently, the SPR is filled to 94 percent capacity.
   Jeffords said, "At a time when consumers are facing record-high prices at the pumps, it makes no sense for the Bush Administration to stockpile more oil and drive prices up even further. I call on the President to reconsider this approach."
   "It's poor judgment to 'top off' the nation's reserves while Americans are digging deep into their pockets to keep a few gallons of gasoline in the gas tanks of the family cruiser," said Leahy. "The Administration's decisions are contributing to the high cost of gasoline, and they need to explain themselves."
   According to a recent study conducted by the minority staff of the U.S. Senate Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, filling the SPR has resulted in higher crude oil prices, lower private sector inventories, increased cost to taxpayers and higher prices for gasoline and other refined products, such as diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil. The report cites estimates by Goldman Sachs and others that filling the SPR is increasing the oil prices by $4.25 to $10 per barrel.
