SEN. JEFFORDS' REACTION TO GOVERNOR'S HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.
  On Gov. Douglas' State of the State Address
   "I applaud Governor Douglas for his support of higher education as outlined today in his State of the State address. We must recognize the critical importance of UVM and Vermont's state colleges to economic development and job creation in our state. I will continue to work with our colleges and universities to expand economic opportunities in Vermont, and I am pleased that the final State of the State address I attended as an elected official highlighted this challenge facing Vermont."
