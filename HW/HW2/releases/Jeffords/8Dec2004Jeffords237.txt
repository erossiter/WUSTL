SENATE PASSES SEN. JEFFORDS' CV HERITAGE BILL
  The U.S. Senate last night gave its final approval to a bill introduced by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., to establish a National Heritage Partnership within the Champlain Valley. The bill, which authorizes as much as $10 million for the effort, will now go to the President for his signature.  
   The program would be funded by the National Park Service and administered through the Lake Champlain Basin Program for projects to explore, protect and promote the area. The Partnership will bring together more than 100 local groups to work towards that goal.
   Military history and maritime commerce have been identified as themes for the region. Visitors would explore sites such as Fort Henry, Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point, the Ethan Allen Homestead, and the St. Albans Historical Museum as they make their way along a designated route.
   In 1997, the National Park Service undertook a study at Jeffords' request to explore the possibility of establishing the Champlain Valley as a Heritage region. The study examined the cultural and historic resources of the area, both on land and submerged. According to that report, more than $50 million a year of additional tourism revenue could be generated with the establishment of the Heritage designation. Jeffords first introduced legislation to create the designation in 1992. 
   "We are so fortunate to have such a rich history in the Champlain Valley, and I look forward to sharing that history as we promote this great region," said Jeffords, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "This will be a huge boost for our tourism industry."
   The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Charles Schumer, D-NY and Hillary Clinton, D-NY.
