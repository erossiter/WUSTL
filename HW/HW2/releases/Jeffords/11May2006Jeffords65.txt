SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NSA PHONE DATABASE
  "News that the NSA has collected the phone records of tens of millions of Americans is deeply disturbing, and demands that Congress delve into the legality of such actions. These reports confirm that Congress has not done a thorough job in investigating the original allegations of illegal wiretapping. I trust that we will learn much more about this latest development as the Senate considers the nomination of General Hayden to head up the CIA."
