SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS VETERANS TO ANNOUNCE MEMORIAL FUNDING
 Sen. Jim Jeffords, (I-Vt.) joined veterans and volunteers yesterday to present a check in the amount of $100,000 for the planning and construction of the Lake Champlain Naval Memorial at its proposed site at Hoehl Park on Burlington's Waterfront.
   Jeffords said, "This is a fitting tribute to those in the Navy who have sacrificed so much for our state and country. It is especially sentimental to me, being a Navy veteran myself."
   The bronze Lone Sailor Statue will replicate a memorial in Washington, D.C. standing 7 1/2 feet tall and weighing 1000 pounds.
