COMPLETE LIST OF SEN. JEFFORDS' TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., as the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has been working for more than three years to pass the $286.5 billion highway bill, which authorizes federal transportation funding through 2009. Under the legislation, Vermont's share of total highway dollars will increase from an average of $125 million a year now, to $175 million a year through 2009, for a total increase of $250 million over the five years. This represents a 40 percent increase in funding for Vermont. In all, Vermont will receive more than $1 billion over the five-year period, with specific projects included. 
   "This highway bill makes the biggest federal investment in Vermont's road and bridges in history. It will make Vermont's roads safer and less congested and bring new jobs and resources to our state for years to come. Every region of Vermont will benefit from this legislation," said Jeffords.  
   The bill is expected to pass the House and Senate later today.
