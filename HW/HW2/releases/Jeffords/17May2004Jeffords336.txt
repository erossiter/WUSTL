SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES WINNERS OF CONGRESSIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ART COMPETITION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced the winners of the 23rd Annual Congressional High School Art Competition. Michelle Trick of Essex High School took the First Place award for her work, "Self Portrait". Carolyn Zuaro of Northfield High School won the People's Choice award for her work, "Self", for the second year in a row. There were 146 students from 31 schools, as well as one home-schooled student, who took part in the competition.  
   The Congressional Art Competition is judged by a panel of art teachers and artists and took place this morning at the T. W. Wood Art Gallery on the Vermont College campus of Union Institute and University in Montpelier. Attendees included Dr Victor Ehly, Union Institute & University Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Alex Aldrich, Vermont Arts Council Executive Director. 
   The competition was founded by Senator Jeffords while in the U.S. House of Representatives. Michelle's piece, "Self Portrait", will hang in the hallway between the U.S. Capitol and Congressional offices and then in Senator Jeffords' office over the next year.
