SEN. JEFFORDS DELIVERS $200,000 GRANT FOR RUTLAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that he has secured nearly $200,000 to help fund a variety of affordable housing initiatives in Rutland.  
 He made the announcement as he met with local housing and land trust officials to tour the housing sites.
   "I am so pleased to be able to help more Vermonters secure affordable housing. This is such a worthy investment of our federal dollars," Jeffords said. "But we know that the demand is so much greater than the supply, and I will continue to work to support more projects like this."
   The $198,400 grant will be administered by the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, working with the Rutland Housing Coalition and the Rutland Community Land Trust. The Vermont State Housing Authority is also working as a partner in the project.
   The funding was contained in the FY 2005 VA-HUD spending bill. The grant will support transitional housing for families and youth, as well as multiple family housing units.
   "We know that having a safe and affordable place to call home is the basis for everything else we do in our lives," said Jeffords, a Rutland native. "That is why these investments are so critical to our communities."
