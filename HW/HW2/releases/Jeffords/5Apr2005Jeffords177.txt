SEN. JEFFORDS SLAMS PLAN TO REDUCE CONSERVATION TAX BREAKS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today blasted a proposal that would drastically reduce the amount of a deduction that farmers and other landowners could take when they donate their land or the conservation easement upon it. 
   At a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee called to consider changes in the non-profit tax structure, Jeffords criticized a proposal put forward by the Joint Committee on Taxation that would reduce the deduction taken on the donation of land or a conservation easement, from 100 percent down to 33 percent or even less of the land's value.
   "Simply put, a farmer donating land or an easement on his land deserves full value every bit as much as the donor of cash or securities. The government has no trouble taxing land based on appraisals, so I don't think we can have it both ways," said Jeffords, a senior member of the Finance Committee who was recently named ranking member of the tax subcommittee. 
   "I am sure we can find a way to attack abuses while continuing to permit deductions based on the full value of appreciated property," said Jeffords, whose skeptical line of questioning was echoed by several other senators on the panel.
   Conservation easements are considered a valuable tool in preserving open land and preventing sprawl. Landowners sell or gift the right to develop land in an effort to preserve the land for farming, forestry or other public purposes. In Vermont, there are approximately 1,500 properties now under conservation easements, protecting roughly 375,000 acres from future development. 
   The 109th Congress is expected to take up legislation aimed at addressing abuses in the tax-exempt arena. The Senate Finance Committee is expected to hold more hearings on charitable giving over the next several months.
