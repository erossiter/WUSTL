SENATE PASSES SEN. JEFFORDS' GENETIC NON-DISCRIMINATION BILL
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that legislation he co-sponsored to prohibit genetic discrimination in the areas of health insurance and employment won unanimous approval in the Senate. The vote was 98-0. 
   "The Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act of 2005" prohibits health insurance companies from collecting or using genetic information in underwriting health insurance plans. It would also prohibit employers from using such information in making workplace decisions, such as hiring, firing, job assignments and promotions, and it would require the information to be kept private and disclosed only under specific circumstances.  
   In addition to Jeffords, the bill had two dozen co-sponsors. Jeffords introduced similar legislation two years ago. That bill passed the Senate by a 95-0 margin in 2003, but it languished in the House.
   "As we make great scientific advances in the area of genetic research, every American should all be able to enjoy the benefits of these advances without having to worry that their own genetic information will be used against them. This bill will protect all of us against the type of discriminatory practices that have no place in a civilized society," said Jeffords, who began hearings on the topic six years ago as then-chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
   "Based on the support we saw today in the Senate, this issue obviously cuts through party lines. I am hopeful that our House counterparts will take quick action to pass this important and long-overdue legislation," Jeffords said.

   Statement of Senator James M. Jeffords S. 306, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 February 16, 2005
   Mr. President, all of us are privileged to be living in an era of unprecedented scientific discovery in the biological sciences. Since 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick first identified the structure of DNA-or the double helix-we have relentlessly increased our ability to decipher an individual's hereditary information. At the time of their discovery, Watson and Crick said that they had "found the secret of life" and to be certain, life, as we know it, has not been the same since. 
   Today, we have the entire genetic map - the human genome - that is revealing a greater understanding of a range of diseases and their treatment. We also have a much greater capacity to know an individual's biological destiny as it is encoded in their DNA, which is essentially a personal genetic blueprint of their current biology as well as a predictor of their biological future. The benefit of knowing this information cannot be overstated. It can save countless lives. Part of the challenge of having this information is to ensure that it not be used unfairly to influence an individual's sociological destiny. 
   This is the reason I am joining with Senator Snowe and our other colleagues in support of S. 306, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005. S. 306 will prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their genetic makeup in both health insurance and employment. This legislation represents a major contribution to civil rights law. It is a victory for consumers, health insurers and health care providers; and it is a victory for employees and employers. It is the result of almost seven years of effort and it is identical to a measure that passed the Senate during the 108th Congress by a vote of 95 yeas and zero nays.
   Together with the much-deserved excitement over the potential of genetic research, there have also been long-standing concerns that genetic information, in the wrong hands, could be misused. Many people have argued that an individual's genetic information - which may indicate a predisposition to a particular disease - could be used to deny that individual health insurance or employment opportunities. The promise of better health would instead become a potential for greater discrimination and disadvantage. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 is designed to address those concerns. 
   Existing anti-discrimination law has been enacted over the years as a means of correcting long-standing abuses in voter rights, employment, housing and education. However, under current law a person who has suffered employment or health insurance discrimination because of their genetic make-up has very little, if any, recourse to legal remedies. This legislation addresses this problem by creating new enforceable rights for individuals similar to those available under existing civil rights, education and fair employment law. 
   It is important to note that to date, there has not been a pattern or clear prevalence of genetic discrimination. However, there is anecdotal evidence that people have refused to take genetic tests because of their fear that the predictive information would lead to discrimination. We know the science is rapidly moving forward and we are learning more every day about the "predictive" correlation between genetic markers and certain diseases. It is not difficult to imagine such discrimination occurring in the near future. So in a sense, we can take that rare opportunity to be ahead of the curve and enact legislation to preempt discriminatory practices and prevent them from ever happening. 
   I believe the compromise legislation we consider today will be successful in preventing abuses in the insuring of health services and employment. However, it is extremely important that we remain vigilant against this type of discrimination from ever getting a foothold in our society and if this measure proves insufficient and needs to be strengthened, then we will be back to correct the problems and that effort will have my support. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the genesis of this legislation links to many years of effort on the part of several of our colleagues. My friend, Senator Snowe, has for many years been the leader of one effort in which I was proud to join, together with Senators Frist, Enzi, Collins and Hagel. In another keystone effort, the previous Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, joined with Senators Kennedy, Dodd and Harkin to delineate the need for employment protections. All have contributed extensively to a better understanding of the many critical and complex definitions that are the heart of this legislation. We could not have been successful last Congress in weaving an agreement between these bills without the commitment of Senator Gregg, who as chairman of the HELP Committee during the 108th Congress, devoted his energies to finding a middle ground that made today's bipartisan agreements possible. Finally, I want to commend Senator Enzi, the current chairman of the HELP Committee. Not only because he elevated the importance of this bill by moving it to the front of the legislative calendar, but also for the many years of effort he has dedicated to seeing this measure enacted. It is wholly appropriate that he is there as chairman to see it cross the legislative finish line. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased at the willingness both sides have shown to work through the many difficult aspects of this key issue. Through many meetings and discussions, we have been able to reach agreements on an array of important issues that have improved and strengthened the legislation. I look forward to continuing this cooperative approach as we move to enact this important and landmark initiative and I urge our colleagues in the House to pass it in the near. The President supports this legislation, and it is my hope that we can enact it into law before the end of this Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in its favor.
   * Summary of S. 306:
   With regard to health insurance discrimination, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will:
   * PROHIBIT enrollment restriction and premium adjustment on the basis of predictive genetic information or genetic services;
   * PREVENT health plans and insurers from requesting or requiring that an individual take a genetic test; 
   * PREVENT health plans and insurers from pursuing or being provided information on predictive genetic information or genetic services prior to enrollment B when this information is most likely to be used in making enrollment decisions; and 
   * COVER all health insurance programs, including those regulated by the federal government under ERISA, state regulated plans, Medigap, and the individual market. 
   With regard to employment discrimination, the Act will: 
   * PROHIBIT discrimination in hiring, compensation, and other personnel processes; 
   * PROHIBIT the collection of genetic information, and allow genetic testing only to monitor the adverse effects of hazardous workplace exposures;
