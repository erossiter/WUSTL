SEN. JEFFORDS' ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PORT MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS
  "The security of U.S. ports is incredibly important, and if nothing else I hope the current controversy will cause Congress and the President to devote more attention and resources to this critical area. It is a very tough problem, as millions of containers from around the world enter our ports every year. 
   "It is not clear to me how the sale of a British firm, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), to a Dubai company will undermine the security of our ports. P&O was once the largest terminal operator in the world. But today the top three spots are filled by Dubai Ports and two companies from China.
   "The United Arab Emirates is one of our closest allies in the Middle East. I think we need more facts on what this sale would actually mean for our security. If the case can be made that security will suffer, then this change of terminal operators should not go forward. But to this point, I've seen more guilt by association than real evidence. With our security almost as dependent on what happens at foreign ports as our own, we have no choice but to cooperate with our trading partners."
