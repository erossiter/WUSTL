SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON UN CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.
  Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 
  On UN Conference on Climate Change
   "The meetings in Montreal showed that most nations stand ready and willing to address global climate change. Unfortunately, the United States is not among them. The Bush Administration continues to do everything within its power to slow and stall further progress towards reducing greenhouse gases. Climate change is real, it is happening, and there is no time for further delay. We must make mandatory greenhouse gas reductions a reality as soon as possible. I am heartened that a bipartisan majority in the Senate agrees, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this goal."
