SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR VERMONT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded three Vermont fire departments a total of $204,143 in grants to support the departments' roles as first responders in their communities.  
 The following departments will be receiving grants:
   * Newport City Fire Department - $ 46,800 
   * Ripton Fire and First Response - $ 140,585 
   * Concord Fire and Rescue - $ 16,758 
   Jeffords said, "These Vermont communities will surely benefit from these grants. There are always first-responder needs that additional funding can help meet and as a former volunteer firefighter myself, I understand how important that is."
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants. These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; the defense against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over FEMA and its responsibilities under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act for all hazards planning, response, and recovery. FEMA continues to execute these responsibilities as part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
