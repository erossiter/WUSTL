SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS DOT SECRETARY MINETA IN PUSH FOR HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., today joined U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and other officials in urging the passage of the six-year highway bill currently before Congress. Sen.  
 Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a co-author of the highway bill.
   Jeffords joined Mineta, Washington D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams and others at a ceremony in front of the South Capitol Street bridge today to call for passage of the highway bill to provide the funding needed to repair bridges and roads across the nation.
   Jeffords said, "According to the Federal Highway Administration 28 percent of our nation's bridges are structurally deficient. In my home state of Vermont there are 36 structurally deficient bridges on our interstates and 524 structurally deficient bridges throughout the state. Our transportation system needs help now."
   The legislation passed both the House and the Senate earlier this year. Jeffords will help lead the conference committee that will reconcile the differences between the two versions of the legislation. The conference is scheduled to begin on Wednesday.
   Under the Senate-passed highway bill, Vermont would receive more than $1 billion over the next six years, bringing Vermont a 37 percent increase in federal highway funds.
   Jeffords concluded, "I believe that we can pass a bill this year that will help rebuild our bridges, make our highways safer and create more than a million jobs. If Congress passes one bill this year, it should be the highway bill."
