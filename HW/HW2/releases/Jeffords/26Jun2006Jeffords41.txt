SEN. JEFFORDS REACTS TO SUPREME COURT DECISION ON VERMONT CAMPAIGN FINANCE
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on US Supreme Court's Rejection of Vt. Campaign Finance Law: 
   "I am disappointed that the court has deemed Vermont's law unconstitutional. The decision itself, with six different opinions from the court, demonstrates how difficult it is to solve the problems inherent to campaign financing. It appears that no one has the magic formula, but I applaud the Vermont Legislature and Attorney General Sorrell for moving our state to the forefront with this legal case. I hope this decision will not discourage Vermont and other states from continuing with these efforts."
