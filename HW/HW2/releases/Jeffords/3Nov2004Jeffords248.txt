SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH RE-ELECTION
  "I congratulate President Bush on his re-election and salute Senator Kerry for running an honest and spirited campaign. I hope President Bush uses this opportunity to unite our divided nation rather than claim a mandate for a conservative agenda. This has been a hard-fought election with high emotions on both sides. But it is time for the country to come together and remember that in the end we are all Americans, and we must leave our nation better for future generations."
