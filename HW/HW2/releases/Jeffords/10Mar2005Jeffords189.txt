SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR THREE MORE VERMONT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded three more Vermont fire departments a total of $151,937 in grants to support the departments' roles as first responders in their communities.  
 The following departments will be receiving grants:
   * Champion Fire Company #5 (South Londonderry) $ 45,282
   * Wallingford Volunteer Fire Department $ 19,800
   * St. Johnsbury Fire Department $ 86,855
   Jeffords said, "I am pleased our local fire departments have been awarded these grants. As our first responders work to keep Vermont safe, we must continue to work to support these brave men and women in any way that we can." Jeffords served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; defend against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants. To date, Vermont fire departments have received 56 grants for a total of $4.6 million. For more information, please visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
