SEN. JEFFORDS NAMED RANKING MEMBER ON TAX SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., has been named ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee's tax subcommittee.  
 Jeffords attained the post based on his seniority in the Senate, where he has served since 1989. Jeffords is marking his 30th anniversary in Congress, where he started as a House member in 1975. 
   The subcommittee is now made up of eight Republicans, five Democrats and Jeffords, the Senate's only independent. He will be working with Senator John Kyl, R-Ariz., the chairman of the subcommittee, to address critical issues related to tax reform policy and to ensure simplicity and fairness.
   "I am pleased to be taking over this position at a time when tax policy is so critical to our future, our children's future and our grandchildren's future," Jeffords said. "I hope to work in a bipartisan way to steer policy and craft legislation in a way that will benefit all Americans."
   As the 109th Congress gets underway, Jeffords will retain his position as ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee; and as a member of the Finance Committee; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; and Veterans' Affairs Committee.
