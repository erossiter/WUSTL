SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RUSSIA'S ACCEPTANCE OF KYOTO PROTOCOL
  "This action by Russia provides a stark contrast for the American public. The Bush Administration continues to fumble around in the darkness of ignorance and the quagmire of special interests, while the Russians are demonstrating world leadership on the single, most crucial global environmental issue of this century. The Bush Administration's major contribution to global warming has been mostly hot air and press releases, while the Russians are stepping up to their responsibilities. I applaud their efforts."
