SEN. JEFFORD ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING WEHRUM NOMINATION
  "I will oppose the nomination of Bill Wehrum when it comes before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for a vote tomorrow. I do so with regret, but unfortunately, this nominee leaves me no choice. During his five-year tenure with the EPA, Mr. Wehrum has worked to undermine the very same environmental protections that I have worked throughout my career to put in place. His disdain for the Clean Air Act is alarming. Mr. Wehrum has repeatedly chosen to ignore career EPA professionals and fight for polluters, rather than public health. The person who assumes this position will act as steward of the nation's air quality. I am afraid that Mr. Wehrum is not up to the task. I cannot in good conscience support moving this nominee forward."
