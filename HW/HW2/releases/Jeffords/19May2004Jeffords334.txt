SEN. JEFFORDS TO GRILL NRC OFFICIALS ON VT YANKEE AT THURSDAY HEARING
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., will question officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on recent events at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant when they testify before a Senate Subcommittee tomorrow. 
   "Recent events have only raised new questions about accountability and safety at the Vermont Yankee plant. Public confidence has been shaken. The NRC needs to tell us what it is doing to locate the parts of missing fuel rods, what it is doing to assure Vermonters that the proposed uprate will not jeopardize safety at the plant, and how it plans to restore its credibility with the public," said Jeffords.
   The Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change and Nuclear Safety will hold an oversight hearing on the NRC on Thursday morning in Washington D.C.. Jeffords is the ranking member of the full Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Commission. 
   The hearing will be broadcast live over the internet at: epw.senate.gov/epwmultimedia/epwmultimedia.htm
