SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON CDC CHEMICAL REPORT
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords on the Center for Disease Control's  
  National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals 
   "The report released today by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) illustrates the need for the Kids Safe Chemicals bill, S.1391, which I introduced with Senator Lautenberg and others last week. CDC found widespread human exposure to over a hundred man-made chemicals, many of which have never been evaluated for potential human health effects. The Kids Safe Chemicals Act would decrease our toxic ignorance and better protect our children by requiring the chemical industry to perform basic health evaluations before using chemicals in consumer products."
