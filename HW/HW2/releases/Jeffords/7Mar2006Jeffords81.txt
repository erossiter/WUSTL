SENATORS CALL ON HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY CHERTOFF TO EXPLAIN IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT 'S REFUSAL TO DISAVOW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE
  Five U.S. Senators have written to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff seeking an explanation of why U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have not ruled out the practice of posing as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) officials, despite written assurances to Senators that this practice had been prohibited. Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Jim Jeffords (I-VT) wrote Chertoff following news reports that ICE officials told immigration and labor groups that it has not disavowed the practice, even though Chertoff had previously stated that he was "very concerned" with the practice and that he "specifically ordered ICE to cease these types of administrative ruses under OSHA's name."
