SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION GRANT TO BOOST MILTON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) will award $2 million to the Town of Milton to help expand its wastewater infrastructure to serve affordable housing and a planned growth center on Route 7, south of the village center. It is estimated that the development of this growth center will help create 250 new jobs and generate private investment of over $20 million.  
   Jeffords serves as the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EDA and federal wastewater treatment efforts. 
   This grant will help extend the Milton municipal sewer line to the Catamount Industrial Park, several miles south of the village center, and some residential homes along Route 7. The extension of this sewer line is the final phase of a project that began in the late 1990's to expand and improve Milton's wastewater facilities. Jeffords and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., secured a federal grant of $3 million for the initial phase of this project in Fiscal Year 1998.
   "I am delighted Milton has been awarded this grant to assist with the town's critical revitalization project," said Jeffords. "These federal dollars will help create much-needed jobs and encourage economic development in the entire region."
   Sanford Miller, Milton Town Manager said, "This is a wonderful turning point after many years of team effort and will bring many new high-paying jobs to the region".
   Frank Cioffi, President of the Greater Burlington Industrial Corporation, said, "We are very appreciative of Senator Jeffords' assistance. This is a critically important project for the people of Milton."
