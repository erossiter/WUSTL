SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE 'NUCLEAR OPTION'
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today joined Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and a group of fellow Senators in front of the Supreme Court to oppose the use of the "nuclear option" to change long-standing rules and trample on minority rights in the Senate.  
   Recently, Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has suggested he may move to change long-standing Senate rules and allow a bare minimum majority to approve the nominations of all judges, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices, for life-time appointments. Such action, termed the "nuclear option," would likely end the consensus-building efforts during the judicial nominating process that have traditionally been required. 
   "Our government was founded on a system of checks and balances which serves to protect the rights of all individuals," said Jeffords. "On critical issues like life-time judicial appointments we should work to reach a bipartisan consensus. I sincerely hope that cooler heads will prevail and the Republican leadership will reject this divisive and unprecedented action." 
   At today's event, the Senators heard from citizens objecting to efforts to allow judicial nominees to be confirmed to life-time appointments with a simple majority in the Senate. Senate Democrat Leader Reid also collected over 1 million petitions urging their Senators to oppose the "nuclear option."
