SEN. JEFFORDS: VERMONT TO RECEIVE $1 BILLION IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that negotiations are complete on a $286.5 billion highway bill that brings significant new funds to Vermont and the nation for a variety of transportation projects through 2009. Sen.  
 Jeffords, a co-author of the highway bill, was a leading negotiator of the final legislation that is expected to be voted on in the House and Senate in the coming days. 
   Jeffords said that under the legislation Vermont will receive more than $1 billion over five years in annual highway funds and funds for specific transportation projects. 
   The measure includes $100 million for projects to improve highway, road and rail transportation in Western Vermont, running from the Massachusetts to Quebec borders. These funds will be directed to road and rail improvements from Bennington to Manchester to Rutland to Middlebury to Burlington to St. Albans. 
   The bill includes $30 million for the Vermont small town bridge fund and $25 million for Vermont's Interstate system improvements.
   The legislation also includes $18 million to complete the Missisquoi Bay Bridge project that the Vermont Congressional Delegation had requested.
   "This highway bill makes the biggest federal investment in Vermont's road and bridges in history. It will make Vermont's roads safer and less congested and bring new jobs and resources to our state for years to come. Every region of Vermont will benefit from this legislation," said Jeffords, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   A final vote on the highway bill conference report is expected later today in the U.S. House of Representatives, and soon after by the U.S. Senate. A breakdown on individual projects will be forthcoming.
