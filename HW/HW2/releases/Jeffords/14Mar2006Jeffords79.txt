SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING INCREASING VETERANS BUDGET
  The proposed budget, while far more realistic than in previous years, falls short of our commitment to America's veterans. This amendment would provide an additional $1.5 billion for VA health care in FY 2007, improving funding for mental health, Vet Centers, and rehabilitative care, among others. The increase would be offset by closing corporate tax loopholes, rather than by increasing overall taxes. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   We have a moral responsibility to provide this care to all veterans, regardless of income. This amendment removes both the $250 enrolment fee for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, and the co-pay increase from $8 to $15. While these amounts may seem inconsequential to some, many of these veterans make as little as $26,902 a year. At this income level, such added expense forces difficult choices between essential needs. All veterans have served our country without reservation. Our commitment to them should not be contingent on income level.
   The VA faces a growing challenge as soldiers return to their homes and families from Iraq and Afghanistan. Their return will impose new demands for care directly related to injuries and experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan and for routine healthcare. Growing demand, coupled with the rising costs of health care nationally, increases pressure on the VA budget. We must ensure that the VA has adequate funding to meet these growing costs.
   This amendment provides support for an essential program, and has a fiscally responsible source of funding. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. Our moral responsibility to America's veterans must not be limited.
