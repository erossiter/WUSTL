SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $1.4M GRANT FOR VERMONT BUSES
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Transportation will be providing $1.48M for the replacement of 22 buses and support equipment throughout the state of Vermont.  
   These buses enable individuals who are elderly, disabled or who otherwise require assistance and who live in urban and rural areas to have access to transportation services that would otherwise be unavailable.
   Jeffords said, "I am excited to say that those in Vermont with special transportation needs will have more help in getting to where they need to go, whether it is to a job, to the store or just getting around in general. We live in a rural state where public transportation needs are not so easily met, but these funds help meet that challenge."
   The recipients will be Addison County Transit Resources, Advance Transit, Barre Project Independence, Connecticut River Transit, Inc., Deerfield Valley Transit Association, Green Mountain Transit Agency, Marble Valley Regional Transit District, Northwest Vermont Public Transit Network, Rural Community Transportation and Stagecoach Transportation Services, Inc.
   Jeffords is ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which has oversight of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   For additional information on the grant, please contact Trini Brassard with the Vermont Agency of Transportation at (802) 828-2828.
