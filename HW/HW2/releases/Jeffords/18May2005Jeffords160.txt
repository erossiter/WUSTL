SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL STEPS TO OPPOSE 'NUCLEAR OPTION'
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today joined Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other members of Congress on the steps of the Capitol to oppose the use of the "nuclear option" to suppress minority rights in the Senate.  
   Senate Republican leaders have threatened to invoke the "nuclear option," which would change Senate rules to deny Senators the right to unlimited debate on judicial nominees. Despite over 95% of President Bush's judicial nominees receiving Senate confirmation, Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has repeatedly demanded that the Democrats cease efforts to filibuster a small group of the President's most controversial nominees. 
   "I am proud to defend the Senate's constitutional responsibility to debate every person nominated for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench," said Jeffords. "I am also saddened that the Senate, an institution traditionally run on civility and compromise, seems so close to descending into bitter partisan warfare. I am hopeful the Republican leadership will come to understand that the 'nuclear option' is actually no option at all."
