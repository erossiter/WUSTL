SEN. JEFFORDS CELEBRATES CONSTRUCTION OF FARRELL STREET SENIOR CENTER
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., joined representatives from nonprofit organizations and local government to celebrate the construction of the Farrell Street Senior Housing and Resource Center, which will be run by the Cathedral Square Corporation and include 63 units of affordable housing for low-income seniors. Sen. Jeffords secured a $250,000 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Special Purpose grant to support construction of the center. 
   In addition to the affordable housing units, the Farrell Street Senior Center will house the offices of organizations that work with seniors, including the Cathedral Square Corporation, HomeShare Vermont, the United Way of Chittenden County, and an adult day program site operated by the Visiting Nurse Association of Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties. Residents of the center will also have easy access to a grocery store and other shopping on nearby Shelburne Road.
   "The Farrell Street Senior Center is a dream come true for the people who will live here and for the organizations that will operate here. I am delighted that the important services provided by these organizations will now all be accessible to our seniors under one roof," said Jeffords. "I want to congratulate all the individuals and organizations who helped make this possible, especially Nancy Eldridge of Cathedral Square."
   Senator Jeffords is a long-time supporter of efforts to both improve services available to Vermont's seniors and to provide the state with increased affordable housing. In 2001, Senator Jeffords secured a $600,000 HUD grant to help Cathedral Square create and rehabilitate affordable housing units for the elderly at the Ruggles House and 3 Cathedral Square in Burlington.
