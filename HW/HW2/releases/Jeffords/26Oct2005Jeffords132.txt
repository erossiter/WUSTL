SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON GAS PRICE ACT DEFEAT
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.
  On the Defeat of S. 1772, GAS Price Act of 2005 
  Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Mark-up
   "The defeat of this legislation today is a victory for public health and the environment. This bill would have weakened environmental regulations and dramatically changed the federal-state structure of judicial review established in our environmental laws, while doing virtually nothing to lower gas prices. If we are serious about addressing soaring gas prices we must promote conservation, boost the supply of clean fuels and protect the environment, measures included in an amendment I offered at the mark-up today. This legislation would not have helped our constituents suffering from higher prices at the pump, but it would have exposed them to increased pollution and threats to their health."
