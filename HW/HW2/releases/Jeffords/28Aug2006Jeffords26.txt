SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NETWORK NEUTRALITY
  Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on network neutrality: 
   I support the concept of network neutrality, as I believe the Internet works best when users can control their access to content. I recognize the benefits of reasonably priced, high-speed Internet access, especially in rural areas.
   During the Senate Commerce Committee mark-up, a proposal introduced by Senators Snowe and Dorgan was defeated on a tie vote. The Snowe-Dorgan amendment would have strengthened the bill's network neutrality provision. I am disappointed the Commerce Committee was not able to agree on a stronger network neutrality provision. 
   While I am in support of net neutrality, it is important to remember that we do not yet know what a final telecommunications bill will look like, if and when it reaches the Senate floor.
