SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY MINETA
  Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on Resignation of Transportation Secretary Mineta: 
   Norm Mineta deserves our gratitude for his work as Secretary of Transportation, and for his many years of dedicated public service. I am pleased to have had the honor of working with him, most recently on the nation's six-year transportation bill and going back to our years together in the House of Representatives. Norm Mineta is the type of person we need more of here in Washington. He is committed, warm-hearted and gracious. I will miss working with him, and wish him all the best.
