SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES WINNERS IN CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced the winners of the 25th Annual Congressional Art Competition. Danielle Laberge of Burr and Burton Academy took the First Place Award for her work, "Self-Portrait". Majken Thomas of Vergennes Union High School won the People's Choice Award for her work, "Justice?". One-hundred and fifty-nine students from 32 schools throughout Vermont submitted entries in this year's competition.
   The Congressional Art Competition is judged by a panel of artists and was held this morning at the T.W. Wood Gallery on the Vermont College campus of Union Institute and University. Senator Jeffords, who viewed the students' work in Montpelier today, founded the competition when he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  
   "Every year I am more impressed with the creativity of these young Vermonters, and this year was no exception," said Jeffords. "After 25 years of working on this competition, today was bittersweet for me: it was a real pleasure to see such an impressive collection of artwork, but difficult knowing that this is the last year I will be judging the competition. I am confident, however, that this great tradition will live on for years to come."
