SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN ON SENATE FLOOR
  Senator Jeffords' Floor Statement on the Death of President Reagan
   Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in remembering our nation's 40th President, Ronald Reagan, who passed away last weekend at his home in Bel-Air, California. 
   Of course much has already been said, both in this chamber and in the media, about the legend of his large life. His career in movies, his entry into politics and of course, his two terms as President during a most tumultuous time have been well documented in the past several days.
   By all of these accounts Ronald Reagan was a most admired politician, and while he and I had our policy differences, I have always shared in that admiration.
   Ronald Reagan held true to a strong conservative philosophy, which often made it hard for the two of us to find common ground. I was a member of the House of Representatives during his eight years as President, and you might say I was often a thorn in his side. We were on opposing sides when it came to many issues, most notably tax cuts and funding for the arts.
   But through all of our sometimes heated discussions and debates, it was so evident to me that President Reagan held a deep and abiding passion for his country, and an equally deep conviction for what he believed was right. 
   As Americans take time this week to honor the life of President Reagan, it is that passion and conviction that they will remember and reflect upon. And I believe, Mr. President, that those memories of our nation's 40th President will inspire our future leaders.
   I would like to extend my condolences to his wife Nancy, and to the entire Reagan family on the passing of President Ronald Reagan. May the memories of his life's accomplishments sustain them in their time of grief, and may the nation's prayers bring them comfort.
