SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NRC'S ORDER
  In an order published today, the NRC has denied a request made by the Vermont Congressional delegation and Gov.  
 James Douglas to extend the public hearing deadline for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station's uprate application. Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight of the NRC.
   "I am disappointed that the NRC did not grant an extension of the hearing deadline. However, the NRC has said that if the inspection turns up new information, constituents may file a late request for a hearing or amend an existing hearing request. I expect them to stick to that commitment and give any new or revised hearing requests serious consideration."
