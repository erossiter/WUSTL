SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2007 BUDGET
  "President Bush today offered us a budget that is wrong for Vermont and wrong for America. Under his proposal, President Bush would cut spending for education and environmental protection, and trim Medicare by $36 billion. As our national debt continues to soar, he asks for sacrifices from those who can least afford them, yet he promises more tax breaks for those who don't need them. Our children, our environment and our elderly citizens simply cannot afford this approach. In fact, none of us can."
