SEN. JEFFORDS UNDERGOES KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., is recovering from knee replacement surgery he underwent last Tuesday at the Bethesda Naval Hospital.  
 Jeffords is scheduled to be released from the hospital later this week and will undergo outpatient rehabilitation for several weeks.
   "As people may have noticed, my knee has been giving me some problems in recent months so I am relieved to have this surgery done. I am looking forward to a speedy recovery and hope to be completely up and around again in the very near future," Jeffords said. 
   Jeffords injured his left knee several years ago while snowshoeing with his dog near his Shrewsbury home. The dog's leash became wrapped around his knee, resulting in an injury that caused the tissue in the knee to degenerate.
   Jeffords' doctor has also advised him that he will not be able to travel for the next four to six weeks, which will curtail his plans to attend events that had been scheduled in Vermont during that time. 
   "It looks as if I will be 'grounded' for a little while, but with this new knee, I'm looking forward to resuming a busy schedule very soon," Jeffords said, adding, "Who would have guessed that snowshoeing could be such a dangerous sport?"
