SEN. JEFFORDS' STATEMENT ON INSPECTOR GENERAL TINSLEY RESIGNATION
  "I applaud Nikki Tinsley for the dedication she has shown as the EPA's Inspector General for the past six years, and I am saddened to learn that she will be stepping down. Nikki has proven herself to be an independent voice at a time when it has been most needed. We know that this Administration does not welcome scrutiny, but that has never kept Nikki from fulfilling her oversight role in a most professional manner. Nikki's tenure has not always been easy, but I hope it has been rewarding. She deserves thanks for her hard work, and I wish her well in her future endeavors."
