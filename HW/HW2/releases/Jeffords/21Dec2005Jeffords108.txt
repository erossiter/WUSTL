SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON EPA'S PROPOSED POLLUTION STANDARDS
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.
  Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 
  On EPA's Proposed Standards for Fine Particulate Matter (PM 2.5)
   "Thousands of studies now confirm what we have known for more than a decade: Fine particle pollution kills. This latest review of scientific evidence clearly shows that we need to substantially lower the existing particulate matter standard. Although EPA has recognized this fact, it has apparently chosen to put forward the least protective approach available. This is unconscionable. Science, not politics, must drive this decision. When EPA makes its final decision in September I expect it to do its duty by setting a level that won't leave millions of Americans breathing dangerously unhealthy air. The Environmental Protection Agency exists to protect the public, not the polluters."
