SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  "The real challenges facing our country were not squarely addressed tonight.  
 Our President should be talking about how we climb out of the fiscal hole we're in rather than digging it deeper. Unfortunately, the President's Social Security plan would only saddle our children with trillions of dollars of additional debt." 
   "Our President should be outlining specific plans for getting us out of a war that had little to do with terrorism. Instead, he offers us only vague visions of democracy intended to make us feel good."
   "President Bush has had four years to work out the details. It is time to stop the diversions. It is time to honestly face the problems of our nation rather than peddling platitudes."
