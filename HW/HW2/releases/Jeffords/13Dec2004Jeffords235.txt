SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON HHS NOMINATION
  "I have enjoyed working with Mike Leavitt, just as I did with Christine Whitman before him. It is my hope that his replacement will be able to move forward to protect human health and the environment, rather than repeat the poor record of the Bush Administration over the past four years. I look forward to working with Secretary Leavitt in his new role at HHS, and I wish him all the best."
