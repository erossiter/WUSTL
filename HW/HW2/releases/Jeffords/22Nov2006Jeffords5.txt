SENS. KENNEDY, KERRY, REP. TIERNEY SUPPORT FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOR DANVERS PLANT EXPLOSION
  Dear Gov. Romney: 
  We're writing to express our strong support for the state's efforts to respond to the emergency in Massachusetts caused by the explosion at a Danvers industrial park, and to offer our assistance in obtaining a federal disaster declaration.  
  The blast radius affected dozens of buildings within several hundreds of yards of the explosion. We are extremely thankful that no lives have been lost and for the brave work of the first responders and care providers and we pledge our full support in pursuing federal assistance for the recovery efforts. 
  Right now, the Commonwealth's efforts are appropriately focused on emergency response and recovery, and we believe the next step should be to seek a Presidential Disaster Declaration. As you know, such a declaration can provide support for a range of critical needs, such as temporary housing, emergency repairs, crisis counseling, medical care and unemployment assistance. 
  The high concentration of this catastrophe will, undoubtedly, put a strain on the area's emergency, housing, and medical services. Federal assistance from a disaster declaration can ease the financial burden that might, otherwise, fall squarely on the shoulders of Danvers, surrounding communities and the Commonwealth. 
  Again, you will have our full support in seeking a federal disaster declaration, and we look forward to working with you to help our communities recover. 
  With respect and appreciation, 
   Edward M. Kennedy 
  John F. Kerry 
  John F. Tierney.
