SEN. JEFFORDS ADDRESSES HEARING ON VETERANS ADMINISTRATION BUDGET
  Sen. Jeffords' Statement at Hearing on Veterans Administration Budget 
   I join my colleagues today in congratulating Secretary Nicholson on his confirmation. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Secretary, in getting the job done for America's veterans.
   Mr. Secretary, this budget is tough. It has been constructed against the backdrop of an overall federal budget that claims to reduce the huge federal deficit by cutting domestic spending programs in the name of deficit reduction, yet does not reduce the expensive tax cuts given to the richest segment of American society. In this context, it is very difficult to construct a veterans' budget that does justice to the men and women who have served their country. 
   I know it is your desire to honor our commitment to our veterans, giving them the best health care and quickest processing of benefit claims the system can provide with the least possible cost to them. But I don't see how this budget does that. This budget relies on increased collection of funds from the veteran in order to maintain current services. This does not seem right. 
   I am anxious to hear your testimony and pursue these matters in my questions.
