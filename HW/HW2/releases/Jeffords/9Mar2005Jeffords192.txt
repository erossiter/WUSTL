SEN. JEFFORDS HAILS PASSAGE OF WELFARE REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., today hailed the passage of welfare reform legislation as it passed out of the Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan vote.  
 The legislation updates the welfare reform law of 1996, increases child care funding $6 billion and improves access to education.
   "This legislation is a hard-fought compromise that allows greater flexibility for Vermont to use federal funding to help families achieve greater independence and economic success," said Jeffords, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.
   Highlights of the legislation, entitled the "Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone (PRIDE) Act" include:
   * Allowing up to 10% of welfare recipients to go to college and earn a 2 or 4-year degree.
   * Jeffords' "Pathways to Independence Act" which allows states to receive credit for providing rehabilitative services to individuals with disabilities and substance abuse addictions. 
   * A provision authored by Jeffords to provide $25 million to support programs like Vermont's Good News Garage. 
   * $6 billion in new child care funding, $43.5 million for Vermont over 5 years.
   * Credit for employment begins at 20 hours per week, with bonus credit for hours worked above 34 hours a week. 
   * An "Employment Credit" that rewards the state for helping clients to find jobs, and more credit for helping clients to find high paying jobs.
