SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  "I am very disappointed the Senate will again spend its time with a federal marriage amendment, rather than working to address the critical challenges that face our country, such as the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global warming, and the rising cost of health insurance. This partisan political maneuvering does not serve anyone well. Furthermore, defining marriage is a matter that can and should be left to each state to decide, as my home state of Vermont has done." 
   "I will vote against a federal marriage amendment, and hope this issue will be laid to rest so the Senate can address the real needs of the American people."
