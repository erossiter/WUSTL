VERMONT DELEGATION URGES NRC TO GRANT UPRATE HEARING
  The Honorable Nils J. Diaz
  Chairman
  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
  Washington, DC 20555-0001
  Dear Chairman Diaz:
   On July 1, 2004, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the Federal Register a notice of opportunity to request a hearing on the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant's pending extended power uprate application. The notice set a deadline of August 30, 2004 for any hearing requests on this matter. We understand that you have received several contentions from Vermont in compliance with the deadline. We write to urge that you promptly grant a formal hearing and full discovery to review these contentions.
   You have also assured us that requesters may amend or add to their contentions based upon information obtained through the independent engineering assessment now being undertaken at Vermont Yankee. We are monitoring the independent engineering assessment, and urge that any amended contentions based upon its results are given full and fair consideration.
   We believe that the NRC has the discretion to accommodate these requests. The issues raised by Vermont are important concerns that should be addressed in a public hearing. Vermonters need to know that the NRC has fully addressed these concerns and that these questions have been answered. 
   Sincerely,
   James M. Jeffords
  United States Senator
   Patrick Leahy 
  United States Senator
   Bernard Sanders
  United States Congressman.
