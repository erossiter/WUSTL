SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO CLOTURE VOTE
  I believe Judge Alito's appointment to the United States Supreme Court will shift the balance of the court for years, perhaps decades to come. I also believe that his judicial philosophy leans too far in favor of presidential powers. There is too much at stake for our country to allow this to happen. I will vote to oppose cloture on this nomination.
