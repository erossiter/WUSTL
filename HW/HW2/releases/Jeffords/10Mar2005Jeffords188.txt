SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON CLEAN AIR INTERSTATE RULE
  "This rule represents a small step forward in reducing pollution from old, dirty power plants, but the Administration has chosen to exercise only part of its authority to control damaging emissions. Full and responsible enforcement of the Clean Air Act would have required significantly greater reductions from the oldest and dirtiest plants sooner. Regrettably, now the States will have to pick up the slack."
