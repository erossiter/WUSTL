ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OPENS CAPITOL ART EXHIBIT
  Michelle Trick, an eleventh grade student from Essex High School in Essex Junction, Vt., joined U.S. Sen.  
 James M. Jeffords, I - Vt., at the opening of the 23rd annual Congressional High School Art Competition exhibit in the U.S. Capitol today. Michelle was the winner of the Vermont High School Competition sponsored by Jeffords in May. Her artwork is entitled "Self-Portrait".
   "Michelle Trick's winning piece of art will represent the wonderful talents of the students of Vermont," said Jeffords. "As the son of a music teacher, I learned early in life the importance of supporting the arts, both through federal legislation and supporting young artists in their work."
   147 students from 31 Vermont high schools participated in this year's Vermont competition sponsored by Jeffords which was held on May 17th. 
   The national exhibit features art work from students across the nation. The exhibition will be displayed in the Capitol complex through May 2005. The annual competition was first launched in 1982 by the Congressional Arts Caucus, of which Jeffords is a co-founder. Since then, some 5,500 local contests have been held involving nearly one million high school students from across the nation.
