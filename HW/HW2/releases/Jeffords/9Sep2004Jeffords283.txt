SEN. JEFFORDS' CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF NUCLEAR SECURITY BILL
  "It is time for the passage of the Nuclear Infrastructure Security Act. The Senate's bill, S. 1043, which passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously last fall, has been sitting on the Senate's calendar waiting for action. This bill is a good first step toward enhancing security at nuclear plants and it is well past time to take action."
