SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PATRIOT ACT
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.
  On Senate Consideration of the PATRIOT Act
   "This legislation fails to strike the needed balance between security and civil liberties that is such a vital part of our democracy. We all want to be safe and secure on the homefront, but not at the expense of violating the protections that we cherish. I supported the Senate's bipartisan compromise bill, and remain hopeful that we can work to restore the safeguards in that bill that have been stripped out in this conference report."
