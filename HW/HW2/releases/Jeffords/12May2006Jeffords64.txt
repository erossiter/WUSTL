SENS. JEFFORDS, CARPER PRESS EPA, ARMY CORPS FOR ANSWERS, ACTION ON KATRINA DEBRIS REMOVAL
  Sens. Jim Jeffords (I-VT) and Tom Carper (D-DE) have written to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works asking that they provide information regarding the efforts to remove 22.5 million tons of debris left in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   In addition, the Senators asked the Corps to provide a status report on the levee repairs and enhancements that the Corps plans to conduct before this year's hurricane season and through 2009.
   Last month, Jeffords, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, toured the devastated Gulf Region. 
   Attached are the letters to the Corps (see http://jeffords.senate.gov/corps_debris_removal.pdf) and the EPA (see http://jeffords.senate.gov/epa_debris_removal.pdf).
