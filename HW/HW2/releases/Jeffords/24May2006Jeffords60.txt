SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. JEFFORDS' GROUNDWATER BILL
  A bill sponsored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that would pave the way for the first comprehensive study of Vermont's groundwater supply moved one step closer to passage today as it was voice-voted out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   Jeffords said the comprehensive study, which would include a complete inventory of Vermont's water supply, is critical to ensuring clean and safe water for future generations. He noted that two-thirds of all Vermont households depend on groundwater for their drinking water. Groundwater is also critical for manufacturing, agriculture, commercial enterprises, and to support aquatic habitat.
   "I am pleased that my colleagues in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee recognized the need to move forward with this effort," Jeffords said. "I am hopeful that this bill will soon win the approval of the full Senate."
   The legislation authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct this groundwater study in coordination with the state of Vermont. Within two years, subject to appropriations, the study would be completed and available for use by the state of Vermont and individual municipalities for water resources planning. Jeffords introduced the legislation last November. Vermont's state geologist, Larry Becker, testified on the bill before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 30.
   Although the state has been working on mapping its groundwater resources since the 1960s following a severe drought, no comprehensive, statewide study has ever been completed.
   In a 2003 report to the Vermont Legislature, the state Department of Environmental Conservation stated that, "the most obvious obstacle to completed aquifer mapping statewide is the lack of a dedicated funding source." Jeffords' bill, which would authorize the project, is the first step toward getting the financial assistance the state would need for the work.
