SEN. JEFFORDS LAUDS NEW YORK FINDING ON INTERNATIONAL PAPER
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today applauded the decision by New York regulators that found International Paper's plans to test burn tires at its Ticonderoga plant are lacking. Sen.  
 Jeffords said the findings bolstered arguments that IP's trial tire burn should not go forward until all environmental concerns are resolved.
   "This review process has found serious deficiencies in IP's application. It shows that IP has failed to fully address the potential for harmful air emissions from tire burning. At this point, the trial burn is on hold and the burden is on IP to prove that they can burn tires without jeopardizing public health."
   Jeffords was responding to a letter sent from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to IP, detailing a long list of reasons why the permit application has been deemed incomplete. A copy of the letter is attached.
   Jeffords has challenged IP's plan for a two-week test burn since it was first announced in 2003. Jeffords has called on IP to install the same equipment found on most other tire burning stacks that would capture the toxic fine particulates that are produced in tire-burning.
