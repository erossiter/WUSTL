SEN. JEFFORDS' DISABILITIES ASSISTANCE BILL PASSES SENATE
  The U.S. Senate last night passed legislation co-authored by Sen.  
 Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that will boost federal funding to help Vermonters with disabilities live more independently with help from assistive technologies. 
   The bill increases funding for Vermont's Assistive Technology Project, which has received approximately $340,000 each year for the past five years as the result of earlier legislation sponsored by Jeffords. Under the new formula, Vermont will receive $410,000 each year for the next five years, an increase of $350,000 over the life the bill.
   The money will be used to help people with disabilities purchase or lease assistive technology, which might include computer equipment; sensory aids; communication devices or structural adaptations used to reduce physical barriers. It will also provide for training and technical assistance to use such equipment. 
   "I am pleased that the Senate and House have been able to work together to craft this important, bipartisan legislation. Assistive technology allows people with disabilities to live their lives to the fullest. This additional funding for Vermont will help make a difference for many disabled Vermonters and their families," Jeffords said.
   The bill, HR 4278, the Assistive Technology Act of 2004, is expected to be passed by the House next week and go the President to be signed into law.
