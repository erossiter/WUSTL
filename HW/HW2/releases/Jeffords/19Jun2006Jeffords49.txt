SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT RULING ON CLEAN WATER ACT
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. 
  On the U.S. Supreme Court Ruling,
  Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. U.S. Army Corp of Engineers
   "This split decision by the Court is an invitation for mischief by those who seek to limit the protections of the Clean Water Act. It is clear from this decision that the Court is headed in a direction that would put protections at risk for some wetlands and intermittent streams. This ruling is particularly troubling in light of the torrential rains Vermont endured this spring, which reminded us of the critical role wetlands can play in mitigating floods." 
   "This decision provides a clear signal to Congress: we must legislate to retain the intent of the Clean Water Act and to provide broad protection for our nation's waters. I will be taking steps in the remaining days of this Congress to move S. 912, the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act, through the Senate. This is the third Congress in which I have joined Senator Feingold in introducing S. 912, and today's Supreme Court decision reaffirms this bill's importance."
