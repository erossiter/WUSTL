SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON EUROPEAN CHEMICAL PROTECTION LEGISLATION
 the following statement:
   Statement of Sen. James Jeffords, I-VT
  Ranking Member, US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 
  On European Union's Enactment of Chemical Protection Legislation 
   "I applaud the European Parliament for taking action to address the human health risks posed by the widespread use of untested chemicals in consumer products. Hundreds of these chemicals have been detected in our bodies, and Americans deserve to know if their health is being compromised by toxic chemicals they use every day. In many cases no one has tested these chemicals, and it is high time we required chemical manufacturers to do just that. The EU's enactment of the REACH legislation should spur passage of the Kids Safe Chemicals bill, S. 1391, which I have co-sponsored."
