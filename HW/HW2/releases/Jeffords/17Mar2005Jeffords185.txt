SEN. JEFFORDS HAILS MEDICAID AMENDMENT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., today applauded the passage of an amendment he had cosponsored to restore $14 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next five years.  
 The 52 to 48 vote came on an amendment to the $2.6 trillion Budget Resolution currently being debated on the Senate floor.
   "This vote is a rare bright spot in what for the most part is a pretty dismal budget. States like Vermont are already facing serious shortfalls in Medicaid funding and further cuts to the program would only exacerbate the problem. It is unfortunate we had to offer this amendment in the first place as Medicaid is such a vital part of our nation's safety net," said Jeffords.
   The amendment also provides for a bipartisan commission to review and strengthen the Medicaid program.
   Jeffords is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Medicaid program. Medicaid is the federal program that supports State efforts to fund health care for the poor and disabled.
   Jeffords, who plans to vote against the overall budget resolution continued, "The budget does not adequately fund important domestic programs, promotes tax cuts to the detriment of other priorities and does little to put our nation's fiscal house in order."
