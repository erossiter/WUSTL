SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON OMNIBUS VOTE
  I am deeply disappointed that Congress has approved this omnibus legislation, which not only represents misguided spending priorities, but also includes many major policy decisions that are bad for our country.  
   In this bill we will be curtailing a woman's legal right and access to abortion. Fortunately we saw the wisdom of killing a provision that would have allowed Congressional staffers to review anyone's IRS tax records. On the spending side, I believe that our priorities are wrong, and education and the environment will suffer as a result. Our educational programs, including special education, will be level-funded. The environmental protection budget will be cut $277 million below last year's level. Particularly hard hit were the funds that states such as Vermont use to fund clean water projects. The list goes on. 
   These critical spending decisions require good debate and deliberation, but unfortunately, that didn't happen this year. Instead, we wasted precious Senate time on such divisive issues as gay marriage, posturing for an election while we failed to do the most basic work of good governance. In the end, across-the-board budget cuts were required to meet the White House budget targets. Congress was then left with just a few hours to consider a massive piece of legislation that lumped nine different spending bills into one. The result was a "take-it-or-leave-it" approach.
   This bill is indefensible, and for that reason, I have chosen to "leave it," and vote against it.
