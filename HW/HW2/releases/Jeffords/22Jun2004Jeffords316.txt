SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA ANNOUNCEMENT ON TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY
  Statement of Senator Jeffords on EPA Announcement on Toxic Release Inventory
   "With the Bush Administration ignoring environmental protection, it's no wonder that polluters feel free to increase their toxic releases of mercury, lead and other hazardous substances. In light of current homeland security concerns, communities have a right to know about dangerous materials being stored or emitted in their backyard. By casting a spotlight on toxic releases, TRI creates a powerful tool to hold companies accountable for their waste management practices. This just proves that the policies of the Bush Administration have moved us backward, not forward, on the environment."
