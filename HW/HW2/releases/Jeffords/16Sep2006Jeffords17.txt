SEN. JEFFORDS' ADDRESSES AT CIVIL WAR MONUMENT DEDICATION
  Remarks of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. 
   Vermont Monument Dedication at the Wilderness
   I am so pleased to be here today for the dedication and unveiling of the Vermont Brigade Monument. I want to thank, and congratulate, everyone who has made this possible, including the State of Vermont, the National Park Service, and Rock of Ages. 
   Over 140 years ago, many courageous Green Mountain Boys fought on these hallowed grounds where we now stand. These woods saw some of the most terrible and bloody fighting of the Civil War. Vermont lost more of its sons during the first day of the Wilderness battle than on any other single day of the Civil War. 
   Standing here, with the woods largely unchanged, it is easy to imagine the thick underbrush and dense trees, the closeness of the two armies, the heat and heavy smoke conditions that faced the Vermont Brigade. These men defended the intersection of Brock and Plank Roads with valor and distinction; preventing the Union army from being cut in half. 
   Today, we honor and remember all of those brave Vermonters who fought at the Battle of the Wilderness. This magnificent monument will be a lasting tribute to the Vermont Brigade and its personal sacrifices for many generations to come.
