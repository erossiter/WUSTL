SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORT OF LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., joined his Democratic Senate colleagues at a press conference outside the Capitol today to urge the Bush Administration to support the full $5.1 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 Currently, LIHEAP is funded at about $2 billion annually, less than half of its authorized level.
   Last year, LIHEAP helped 19,327 Vermonters pay their heating bills, with an average benefit of $902 per household. LIHEAP recently distributed over $11 million in assistance to Vermont to cover the winter heating season. If the program had been fully funded, however, Vermont would have received over $27 million to cover that same period of time. This increase in federal support would help more Vermonters who are eligible for assistance pay their heating bills. Nationally, 6 million applications for energy assistance were filed in 2005, the highest level in 12 years.
   "As energy prices skyrocket, the federal government must step up to the plate and fulfill its commitment to help Americans who are struggling to heat their homes," said Jeffords. "While families across Vermont feel the financial squeeze from out-of-control heating costs, Washington has failed to fund LIHEAP with even half the dollars we promised. The Administration and Congress must address this unacceptable situation immediately."
   In addition to helping low-income and middle-income Americans pay their heating bills, LIHEAP supports energy crisis intervention programs and low-cost residential weatherization and other energy-related home repairs. LIHEAP is a federal block grant program.
