SEN. JEFFORDS CONCERNED BY ADMINISTRATION'S LACK OF INITIATIVE TO CURB GLOBAL MERCURY, TOXIC EMISSIONS
  In response to the letter, Sen. James M. Jeffords, I - Vt., the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee said, "It would be better if the U.S. were proposing now some constructive way of reducing all global mercury and air toxic emissions since our Clear Air Act requires these harmful pollutants to be reduced quickly at the domestic level. That would be a proactive way of protecting U.S. interests and our environment."
