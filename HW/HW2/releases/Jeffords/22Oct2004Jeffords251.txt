SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RUSSIAN STATE DUMA APPROVAL OF KYOTO PROTOCOL
  "The Russian action to ratify the Kyoto Protocol should be seen as a challenge and perhaps as a rebuke to the United States. We are the most technologically advanced nation in history and yet, we have failed to acknowledge our share of the responsibility for global warming. The Bush Administration has failed miserably to lead on Kyoto or any real alternative for action."
