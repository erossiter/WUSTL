SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON MIERS' NOMINATION
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.,
  On Supreme Court Nominee Harriet Miers 
   "President Bush today nominated Harriet Miers to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and I look forward to reviewing her record and her qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice O'Connor is a steadfast supporter of constitutional rights, and Ms. Miers must prove that she will continue in this fine tradition. Given her lack of a judicial record, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings will be critical to learn more about how Ms. Miers will approach the law as a Supreme Court justice."
