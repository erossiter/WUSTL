SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PATRIOT ACT AMENDMENT CLOTURE VOTE
  Sen. Jeffords' Statement on Patriot Act Amendment Cloture Vote: 
   "Today, I voted against moving forward on Senator Sununu's Patriot Act amendments because they fail to move us closer to the provisions that the Senate forwarded to the House last year. It is vital to strike the needed balance between national security and civil liberties, and to provide sunset provisions that require Congress to assess this balance in the future. If our government is to have the authority to monitor its citizens, we must have every assurance, through a meaningful judicial and oversight process, that it has good reason to do so. Neither the Sununu Bill nor the Conference report accomplish these protections."
