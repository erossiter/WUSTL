SEN. JEFFORDS' ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING EPA ANNOUNCEMENT OF PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS
  Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords, I-Vt.  
  Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
  Regarding Today's Announcement by the EPA on
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Particulate Matter
   "Today the EPA has announced standards regarding fine and coarse particle pollution, also known as particulate matter. I am deeply disappointed by EPA's decision to disregard the advice of its own science advisors. Instead of following their advice by adopting standards that would save thousands of lives, the EPA chose the politically expedient path. We need air quality standards that tell us when the air is safe to breathe, not standards that tell us when the air is only partially safe to breathe."
