SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON U.S. COMMISSION ON OCEAN POLICY REPORT
  "The final report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy provides the first comprehensive look at the state of our oceans in decades. The report shows that the detrimental effects of coastal water pollution on the world's oceans are significant and that it is past time to take action. It is clear that we must review these recommendations in the context of the Clean Water Act, which has not been reauthorized since 1987. This report once again reminds us that our oceans are a precious resource that we can not take for granted."
