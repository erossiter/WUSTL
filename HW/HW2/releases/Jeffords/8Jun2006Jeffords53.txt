SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING AL-ZARQAWI DEATH
  "The death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is welcome news and credit goes to our troops for a job well done under the most trying circumstances. It is far too early to know what his death will mean to the future stability of Iraq. Unfortunately, we continue to see bombings and other senseless acts of violence that illustrate the daunting challenges that remain in the region. I am pleased that al-Zarqawi will no longer be inciting violence, but I fear the hatred he has unleashed will be with us for some time to come."
