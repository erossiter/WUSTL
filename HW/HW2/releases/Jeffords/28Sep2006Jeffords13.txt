SEN. JEFFORDS' HEARING STATEMENT ON ELECTRONIC MANIFEST
  Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. 
  Environment and Public Works Committee
  Superfund Subcommittee Hearing on Electronic Manifest
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we are holding this hearing on S. 3871, the "Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act," introduced by Senator Thune. 
   I co-sponsored this legislation because it appears to be one of the rare examples in politics where everybody wins and nobody loses. 
   The environment wins because an electronic manifest system will strengthen the tracking of hazardous waste from the point of generation to ultimate disposal. 
   Industry wins because an electronic manifest will significantly reduce compliance costs. The EPA estimates that the current paper-based system costs waste handlers and states between $193 million and $404 million annually.
   Finally, the public wins because an electronic manifest system will enable the citizens, states, the Federal government and industry to access manifests for shipments of hazardous waste all over the country.
