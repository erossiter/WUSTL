SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS BURLINGTON MAYOR CLAVELLE FOR GROUNDBREAKING ON NORTH STREET REVITALIZATION PROJECT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., joined Burlington Mayor Peter Clavelle today to break ground for the North Street Revitalization Project, for which Sen.  
 Jeffords secured $1.4 million. The groundbreaking took place at the Lawrence Barnes Elementary School in the heart of the city's Old North End. 
   "We are well on the way to recreating the thriving, pedestrian-friendly area that this neighborhood was some time ago," Jeffords said. "Business activity is up and housing investment is increasing. The optimism here is infectious."
   The revitalization effort is the product of nearly a decade of planning that brought residents together with city, state and federal agencies to develop a plan that would reflect the mixed-use and ethnic traditions of the neighborhood. The project includes rehabilitating existing housing, improving facades, planting trees, improving traffic flow and burying utility lines. "It took time and it took effort, but the rewards will be very satisfying," Jeffords said. "This community worked so hard to make it happen, and I'm honored to be a part of the effort."
