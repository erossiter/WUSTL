SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $39,845 FOR BEECHER FALLS FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded the Beecher Falls Volunteer Fire Department $39,845 through the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP), which directs grants to the nation's fire departments.  
 Vermont has received 25 grants for a total of over $1.9 million through the AFGP this year. 
   "Beecher Falls' firefighters volunteer their time and services to keep their community safe, and we must provide them with the resources they need to do their job effectively. I am delighted Vermont's first responders are being provided with the support they deserve," said Jeffords, who served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   AFGP funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; defend against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   The AFGP assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants directly to the departments. For more information, please visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
