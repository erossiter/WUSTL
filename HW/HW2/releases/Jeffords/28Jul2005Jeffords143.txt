SEN. JEFFORDS TO ATTEND WHITE HOUSE SIGNING CEREMONY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., will attend a signing ceremony at the White House Friday morning, when a patient safety bill that Jeffords authored will become law.  
 The ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. 
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 will create a new confidential and voluntary system for reporting medical errors. Jeffords first sponsored a patient safety bill in 2000 following a report from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) that noted that medical errors are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as many as 98,000 people dying per year, about the same number as those that die from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS or breast cancer combined, the report noted.
   "This bill will go a long way in reducing patient deaths and injuries that result from preventable errors," Jeffords said. "I am grateful that the President has acted so quickly after passage to see that this bill will now become law."
