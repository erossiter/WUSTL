SEN. JEFFORDS HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., praised today's Senate passage of S.622, the Family Opportunity Act of 2004. The bill would allow middle-class families of children with disabilities to purchase treatment and services through the Medicaid program.  
   "This is an important step for families in Vermont and across the country," Jeffords said. "If the House will act as the Senate has, the families of children with disabilities will no longer have to refuse a job or a raise in order to retain Medicaid services." 
   Jeffords continued, "Parents will never have to choose between keeping custody of their children and obtaining the services they need. This is the result of many years of hard work, and I hope that we will see the bill become law this year."
   The Family Opportunity Act was originally introduced in early 2000 by Jeffords, with U.S. Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and others. At the time of its passage today, the bill had 66 cosponsors in the Senate.
   SUMMARY OF THE FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2004
  (Also referred to as the "Dylan Lee James Act")
   Access to Health Care Coverage 
   * Expands Medicaid Options for States: States will be able to offer Medicaid coverage to children with severe disabilities living in middle income families through a buy-in program. Cost-sharing up to the full premium cost may be required, but cannot exceed 7.5% of the family income. Currently, families must stay impoverished, become impoverished, place their child in an out of home placement or simply give up custody in order to secure the health care services their child needs under Medicaid. 
   * Option for States to Include Children Receiving Hospital Psychiatric Services in Home and Community-Based Waivers: States would be permitted to include children with disabilities, who are receiving hospital psychiatric services, with the option to the receive services through the State's home and community-based Medicaid waiver program. 
   * Restores immediate Medicaid coverage for children found eligible for SSI under the definition of "presumptive eligibility". 
   Access to Health Information and Resources
   * Establishes Family to Family Health Information Centers: The bill provides funds for establishing health information centers to assist and support families of children with disabilities and special health care needs. These centers, staffed by both parents of children with special needs and professionals, would provide technical assistance and information to other families on various health care programs and services available and appropriate for children with special needs.
