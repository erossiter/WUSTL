SEN. JEFFORDS INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN ?PATHWAYS TO INDEPENDENCE ACT'
  Sen. Jim Jeffords (I-Vt) and a bipartisan group of Senators late Thursday introduced legislation designed to provide states with the flexibility they need to successfully move welfare recipients with disabilities into the workforce.  
   The "Pathways to Independence Act of 2005" would amend the welfare reauthorization bill that the Senate Finance Committee is expected to consider in March. The bipartisan legislation introduced Thursday would allow states to count rehabilitative services for individuals with disabilities and substance abuse problems toward their "work activity" requirements in the welfare reauthorization bill.
   "We must ensure that all individuals in our welfare system are provided with the opportunity for future success and productivity," said Jeffords. "This bill gives states the flexibility they need to help people with disabilities and substance abuse problems become independent and self-sufficient."
   The "Pathways to Independence Act of 2005" is modeled after an existing partnership between Vermont's Economic Services Division and Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. The bill will encourage other states to develop similar partnerships and help Vermont to meet more stringent work requirements that are expected to be imposed in the near future. 
   The bill is supported by nearly 70 national organizations representing individuals with disabilities, service providers and state administrators.
