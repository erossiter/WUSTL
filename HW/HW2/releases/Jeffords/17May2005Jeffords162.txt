SENATE PASSES SEN. JEFFORDS' HIGHWAY BILL; BOOSTS VERMONT'S FUNDING BY 42 PERCENT
  The U.S. Senate today passed a highway bill co-authored by U.S. Sen.  
 Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. that will increase Vermont's federal funding by 42 percent, bumping its annual share from $125 million to $178 million per year. 
   Under the legislation, which runs through 2009, Vermonters will receive $2.12 back from the federal government in transportation funding for every dollar the state contributes to the Federal Highway Trust Fund through gas taxes. 
   Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which drafted the legislation and helped shepherd it through the Senate. The $295 billion bill passed the Senate on a vote of 89 to 11. 
   "This bill is a homerun for Vermont," Jeffords said. "It provides Vermont with an additional $53 million a year to fix our roads and bridges. This federal funding will be used in every county of our state for transportation projects, including the completion of the Missisquoi Bay Bridge, safety improvements along Route 7, and maintenance and repair of interstates 89 and 91." 
   Vermont has a total of 14,056 miles of highways, including 320 miles of interstate and 2,668 bridges.
   Jeffords continued, "This bill will have an impact on every single citizen of Vermont in some way."
   According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics:
   * 35% of Vermont's highway bridges are structurally deficient or functional obsolete;
   * 17% of Vermont's roads are in mediocre or poor condition. 
   States are currently receiving federal highway funds at current levels through a temporary extension measure. That extension expires on May 31, 2005.
   The bill now goes to conference with the House, which passed a $284 billion bill.
