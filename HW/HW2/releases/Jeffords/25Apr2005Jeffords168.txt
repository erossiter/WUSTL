SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON HIGHWAY BILL
  The U.S. Senate today began debate on a highway bill co-authored by Sen.  
 Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that will increase Vermont's federal funding by 37 percent, bumping its annual share to $172 million per year. Vermont currently receives $125 million per year in federal highway funds.
   Jeffords, the ranking member of the EPW Committee, vowed to seek an increase in funding for the $284 billion bill as debate continues on the legislation on the Senate Floor. Last year the Senate passed a highway bill with $318 billion in funding.
   On the Senate floor Jeffords said, "It is unfortunate that the President fails to see the value of a robust transportation program. It's unfortunate the President fails to see the jobs that will be lost, and the roads and bridges that will go unrepaired and unbuilt. It's unfortunate the President doesn't see the lives that could be saved with better roads and the time that will be wasted sitting in traffic. All of this is the result of inadequate funding."
   The federal funding will be used for transportation projects throughout Vermont including the completion of the Missisquoi Bay Bridge, safety improvements along Route 7, and maintenance and repair of interstates 89 and 91, and highways and bridges throughout the state. Vermont has a total of 14,056 miles of highways, including 320 miles of interstate and 2,668 bridges.
   According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics:
   * 35% of Vermont's highway bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete; 
   * 17% of Vermont's roads are in mediocre or poor condition. 
   States are currently receiving federal highway funds through a temporary extension measure at current funding levels. That extension expires on May 31, 2005.
