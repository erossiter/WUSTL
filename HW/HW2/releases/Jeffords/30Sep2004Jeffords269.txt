SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF HIGHWAY BILL EXTENSION
  "It is unfortunate we have come to these crossroads, but it is better to pass an extension than be forced to accept an underfunded, six-year highway bill that will backslide on our commitment to our nation's highways. Earlier this year the Senate passed a highway bill that helped all states and all regions. It passed on an overwhelming, bipartisan vote. But unreasonable demands by the White House put the brakes on the bill. A long-term extension is the responsible action at this time that provides state and local officials with more certainty, but we must continue to push for an adequately funded, six-year bill."
