SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION GRANT TO PROMOTE VERMONT WOOD PRODUCTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced a major marketing strategy for Vermont wood products that will be funded with a $1 million grant he helped secure from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.  
   Jeffords made the announcement at the Knight Kitchen Cabinets facility in Clarendon. The $1 million grant, made to the Vermont Council on Rural Development, will help fund a two-year national marketing program. 
   "This is a great example of how the talent and skills of our Vermont craftspeople can help promote not only wood products, but our great state of Vermont," Jeffords said. "We are known worldwide for our high-quality syrup and now our other forest products are following suit." 
   The marketing campaign will seek to promote Vermont's value-added wood products industry - toys, furniture, household items, cabinetry and more - through various marketing strategies. The plan calls for showcasing these products through factory tours, trade shows, design competitions and other high-profile events. 
   Jeffords credited the work of the Vermont Council on Rural Development and its executive director, Paul Costello, in developing the grant proposal. 
   "This project has tremendous economic potential for our wood manufacturing industry and for the many Vermonters who make their living in this wonderful trade," Jeffords said, adding, "This is a solid investment."
