SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING BILL
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on passage of the Supplemental Spending Bill: 
   "I voted today in support of this $94.5 billion supplemental spending bill because we must continue providing our troops with the equipment and support they need. This bill also contains some much-needed help for New Orleans, including a critical environmental provision that I am pleased to have inserted in the bill that will close the disastrous Mississippi River Gulf Outlet." 
   "However, I am deeply disturbed that the Republican leadership in the House and Senate, unwilling or unable to debate a budget in the light of day, has chosen to slip a spending ceiling into this bill that will cut domestic spending in FY 2007 by $14 billion. There is no way Congress will be able to meet these budget targets without inflicting even greater damage to programs that so many Americans rely on. These misguided budget priorities will harm our country for generations to come." 
   "I am also very disappointed that this bill does not address another emergency situation: the devastatingly wet weather that has soaked Vermont dairy farmers' hay and corn fields. Just minutes after casting my vote on this bill, I met with Vermont Secretary of Agriculture Steve Kerr to discuss in detail the dire situation facing Vermont dairy farmers. Due the excessive rain - more than 20 inches in 30 days on one farmer's fields - the critical first hay and corn crops are ruined. Farmers will have to look to other sources for their feed, a proposition made worse by escalating transportation and fuel costs. I appreciate Secretary Kerr personally giving me this briefing, and I will do all I can for Vermont's farmers during this difficult season, including supporting an Emergency Disaster Designation."
