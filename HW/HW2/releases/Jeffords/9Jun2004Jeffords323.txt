SEN. JEFFORDS HELPS LEAD HIGHWAY BILL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., today joined in the kicked-off the inaugural meeting of the 73-member Conference Committee to reauthorize the nation's six-year highway bill. 
   As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Jeffords will help lead the conference for the Senate.
   In February Jeffords helped shepherd a $318 billion highway bill through the Senate. The House passed a $284 billion package and the White House has threatened to veto any bill over $256 billion.
   The federal funding will be used for transportation projects throughout Vermont including the completion of the Missisquoi Bay Bridge, safety improvements along Route 7, and maintenance and repair of highways and bridges throughout the state.
   Jeffords told the conference, "We cannot improve our highways, bridges and transit systems on the cheap. The completion of this conference depends on our ability to come to an agreement on funding. We owe it to the American people - the traveling public - to finish this job. This is our responsibility and ours alone."
