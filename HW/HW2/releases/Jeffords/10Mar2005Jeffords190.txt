SEN. JEFFORDS' VOC-TECH BILL PASSES SENATE
  The Senate today passed the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005, legislation co-sponsored by Sen.  
 Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that will maintain the program that was slated to be zeroed out under the Bush budget proposal. The vote was 99-0.
   "I am very pleased to support this bill and am delighted by the overwhelming support for technical education shown by my colleagues," said Jeffords, a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "Today's vote on the Perkins Bill sends a clear message that the Senate does not agree with the President that this program should be eliminated."
   Passage of the career and technical education bill is especially significant because President Bush eliminated this $1.3 billion program in his Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal. For this current fiscal year, Vermont receives an estimated $4.5 million in federal funding for vocational technical education.
   The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act provides federal funding for high school and post-secondary programs that integrate academics with technical skills. The bill the Senate passed will support partnerships established among high schools, post-secondary institutions, the business community and workforce boards that promote quality career and technical education.
   Next week, the Senate is scheduled to consider the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution.
