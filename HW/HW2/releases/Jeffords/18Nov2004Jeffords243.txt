   Jeffords said, "With these grants, more fire departments will be better able to protect the people they serve. First responders are an invaluable part of our communities." Jeffords served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; defend against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the Department's United States Fire Administration and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants.
