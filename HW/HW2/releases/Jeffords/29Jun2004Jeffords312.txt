SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR VERMONT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $86,795 in grants to four Vermont fire departments to support the departments' roles as first responders in the communities they serve.  
 The fire departments are as follows:
   * Thetford Volunteer Fire Department: $ 14,769
   * West Haven Volunteer Fire Department: $ 26,424 and $ 9,953
   * East Dover Volunteer Fire Company: $ 8,424
   * Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department: $ 27,225
   Jeffords said, "Each grant that is awarded to a Vermont fire department makes us that much safer and more prepared for an emergency. As a former volunteer fire-fighter, I know first-hand how important it is to have the best equipment and training possible to protect our communities. I hope to see many more well-deserved grants awarded in the future."
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; the defense against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over FEMA and its responsibilities under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act for all hazards planning, response, and recovery. FEMA continues to execute these responsibilities as part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
