SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA/DUPONT SETTLEMENT
  Sen. Jeffords today issued the following statement in response to EPA's settlement with DuPont, in which DuPont will pay $10.25 million to settle violations alleged by EPA over the company's failure to comply with federal law.  
 This marks the largest civil administrative penalty EPA has ever obtained under any federal environmental statute. DuPont is also committing to pay $6.25 million for supplemental environmental projects to help industry, scientists, the public and EPA examine the potential sources of the synthetic chemical Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) in the environment, and potential routes of human exposure to PFOA. PFOA, which is known to cause developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals, has been found at low levels in the environment and in the blood of the general U.S. population, according to the EPA. (See EPA's press release below).
   Statement of Senator James Jeffords, I-Vt.
  Ranking Member, US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
  On EPA's Settlement with DuPont 
   "This case illustrates the need for a fundamental overhaul of our antiquated and ineffective chemical laws. EPA simply lacks the tools needed to ensure that the potential human health risks from chemicals are disclosed and evaluated before there is widespread human exposure. The Kids Safe Chemicals bill that I co-authored with Senator Lautenberg, S. 1391, would protect children and workers by holding chemical manufacturers responsible for providing health and safety data for each chemical they produce so EPA can perform a safety review before such chemicals are found in our bodies."
