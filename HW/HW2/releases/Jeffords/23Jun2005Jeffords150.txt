SEN. JEFFORDS ASSAILS VETS' HEALTH CARE SHORTFALL
  Below is a statement issued today by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., a senior member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, responding to the report that the Veterans Administration will need more than $1 billion for medical care in the current fiscal year:  
   "This news confirms what many of us had suspected for some time. I don't know why the Veterans Administration operated on such low assumptions of patient growth in the face of clear evidence that veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were streaming into the VA." 
   "I was very disappointed when the Administration opposed our efforts earlier this year to add money to the supplemental appropriations bill for care of our veterans. That was the time to have fixed this problem. It is unconscionable that the VA now finds itself in this position. I will do all I can to address this problem, even at this late date. We owe our veterans no less."
