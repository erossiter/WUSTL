SEN. JEFFORDS TO HONOR VERMONTERS NOMINATED TO MILITARY ACADEMIES
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that he has nominated 14 Vermont high school students for admission to the United States Service Academies.  
   Jeffords will honor the nominees at a reception in the Cedar Creek Room at the Vermont Statehouse from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 28. Families of the nominees, as well as Vermonters currently attending the military academies, have also been invited. Members of the press are welcome.
   "In a time when we are asking so much of our men and women in uniform, I am proud of these young Vermonters who stand ready to continue our state's great tradition of military service. These nominees represent the very best Vermont has to offer," said Jeffords, a U.S. Navy veteran. Jeffords nominated six Vermonters to the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, CO; six to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD; and two to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY.
   The military academies will select Vermonters from Jeffords' list of nominees. As in past years, Jeffords made no attempt to rank the nominees, submitting each name on an equal basis.
