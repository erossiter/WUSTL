SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON BUSH'S IRAQ SPEECH
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on President Bush's Iraq Speech at the Naval Academy:
   "I am pleased we are finally engaged in a dialogue about the tremendous challenges we face in Iraq, and that President Bush has recognized the legitimacy and importance of that dialogue. I am disappointed, however, that President Bush once again failed to provide a strategy for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. As our troops and their families sacrifice so much, they deserve to be supported with sound and thoughtful planning in Washington."
