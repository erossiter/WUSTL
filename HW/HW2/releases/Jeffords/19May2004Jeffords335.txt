SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NAMING OF CONFEREES TO HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Jeffords' Statement on the Naming of Conferees to the Highway Bill 
   "Thanks to an agreement among leaders from both sides of the aisle, we are poised to appoint conferees on the highway bill. I am very pleased that the spirit of bipartisanship has prevailed. It was that cooperative approach that enabled the Senate to pass the highway bill by a wide margin. The Senate bill is funded at a level that will benefit all states, ensure improvement to our roads and bridges, reduce congestion, enhance safety and create hundreds of thousands of jobs." 
   "I will work in conference to secure the sound policy and ample funding that our transportation system requires and our nation deserves as provided in the Senate bill. There's a long road ahead, but we're ready to get this bill back in the fast lane."
