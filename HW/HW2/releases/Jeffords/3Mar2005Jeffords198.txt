  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded two more Vermont fire departments a total of $237,596 in grants to support the departments' roles as first responders in their communities.  
 The following departments will be receiving grants:
   * Alburg Volunteer Fire Department $ 130,361 
  * Sherburne Volunteer Fire Department (Killington) $ 107,235
   Jeffords said, "Vermont's first responders must be provided with the resources they need to do their job safely and effectively. Supporting our local fire departments must remain one of our top priorities." Jeffords served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; defend against weapons of mass destruction; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
