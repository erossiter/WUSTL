SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENS. KERRY, LEVIN AMENDMENTS ON IRAQ
  Statement of Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., on Voting in Support of Kerry, Levin Amendments on Iraq:  
   "I voted in support of the Sens. Kerry and Levin amendments today because our nation needs a plan to begin drawing down our troops in Iraq and bringing them home. We should not be asking our troops to stay in harm's way one day longer than is necessary. This Administration has lacked an exit strategy from the first day we went to war, and as a result, we have paid a tragic price. We have 'stayed the course' for far too long. It takes political courage to change course, and it is time Congress showed such courage. Our troops deserve nothing less."
