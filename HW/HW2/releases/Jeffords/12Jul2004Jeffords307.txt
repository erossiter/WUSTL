SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF LAURANCE ROCKEFELLER
  "Laurance Rockefeller was a tremendous friend and generous benefactor to the state of Vermont, and I feel so honored to have had the opportunity to work with him to create the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park. Laurance Rockefeller leaves a legacy of conservation stewardship, and our state so much better off for it. Liz and I offer our sincerest condolences to the Rockefeller family as they mourn the loss of such a wonderful man."
