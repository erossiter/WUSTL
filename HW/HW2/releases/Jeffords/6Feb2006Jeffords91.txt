SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S PROPOSED EPA BUDGET
  "President Bush's 2007 budget proposal reveals what we have known for a long time: protecting the environment is not a priority of this Administration.  
 In the last four years of budget proposals, President Bush has offered a steady decline in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In Fiscal Year 2004, the EPA's budget was $8.365 billion; today we see that funding level has dropped to $7.315 billion. If the President has his way, we will have dirtier air, dirtier water, and fewer resources devoted to the problem of climate change. We cannot allow this dangerous trend to continue, and I will do all that I can to fight these cuts."
