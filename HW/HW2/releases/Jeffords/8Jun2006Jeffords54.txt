SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PROPOSED REPEAL OF ESTATE TAX
  "As we continue to run up record budget deficits and shortchange important priorities such as health care and education, it would be tremendously irresponsible to repeal the estate tax outright, or adopt changes that are tantamount to repeal." 
   "Although I understand the difficulties the estate tax can pose for some family businesses and am willing to consider some compromises to ease that burden, eliminating an additional source of revenue would make our fiscal mess even worse, particularly on the heels of the recently enacted tax cuts. The estate tax only affects 1 percent of all decedents, but its repeal would cost the federal treasury $1 trillion over a decade. I voted against the repeal of the estate tax because it would lift a burden off the most affluent Americans and place it on our children's shoulders in the form of ever-greater debt payments."
