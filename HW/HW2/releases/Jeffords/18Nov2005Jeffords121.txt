SEN. JEFFORDS' BILL WOULD SPUR VT GROUNDWATER STUDY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today introduced legislation that would authorize the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct a groundwater study for the state of Vermont.  
 This would mark the first time that such a comprehensive study of Vermont's water supply has been undertaken.
   Jeffords, in introducing the bill, noted that two-thirds of all Vermonters depend on groundwater for their drinking water supply. Groundwater is also used for manufacturing, agriculture, commercial enterprises, and to support aquatic habitat. 
   "It is critical for long-term planning efforts, at the local and state levels, to secure clean and safe water supplies for our future generations. To do that, we must have a better understanding and a complete inventory of the groundwater resources of our state," Jeffords said. 
   Jeffords noted that since the 1960s, when a drought adversely affected water supplies in Vermont, the state has been working on mapping its groundwater resources, although a comprehensive, statewide study has never been completed.
   Jeffords' legislation authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct this groundwater study in coordination with the state of Vermont. Within two years, subject to appropriations, the study would be completed and available for use by the state of Vermont and individual towns for water resources planning. 
   In a 2003 report to the Vermont Legislature, the state Department of Environmental Conservation stated that, "...the most obvious obstacle to completed aquifer mapping statewide is the lack of a dedicated funding source..." That report outlined specific approaches to a groundwater study for the state. 
   Jeffords' bill, which would authorize the project, is the first step toward getting the financial assistance the state would need for the work.
