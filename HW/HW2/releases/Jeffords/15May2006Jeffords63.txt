SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING 'WARREN V. MAINE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION' DECISION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., issued the following statement today in response to the US Supreme Court's 9-0 decision that said hydroelectric dams raise "a potential for a discharge," and are therefore subject to state review under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. Jeffords, as ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, filed an amicus brief with the court last year asking that the judgment of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court be affirmed (To view the brief go to: http://jeffords.senate.gov/sdw_brief.pdf):  
   "I am pleased that the US Supreme Court has unanimously reaffirmed the role of states in administering the Clean Water Act. States need to be able to solve their water pollution problems, and the Clean Water Act is a critical tool in that effort. Congress clearly intended for the act to be used for just these purposes. This decision marks a true victory for our rivers, streams and tributaries, and provides states with the oversight they need in reviewing these types of projects."
