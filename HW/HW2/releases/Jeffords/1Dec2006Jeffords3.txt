PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS NEW ENGLAND WILDERNESS ACT
President Bush Friday signed into law the New England Wilderness Act, which adds about 42,000 additional wilderness acres to Vermont's Green Mountain National Forest, along with new wilderness designations in New Hampshire. The bill was steered through Congress by a bipartisan partnership of the two states' congressional delegations. 
 Sen. Patrick Leahy said, "This is a balanced plan, produced through bipartisan cooperation, which now becomes the heritage of all Vermonters. Settling this uncertainty also frees Vermont's dedicated Forest Service management team to proceed to implement the many other aspects of the new plan for the Green Mountain National Forest."
 Sen. Jim Jeffords said, "This is great news for conservation in Vermont and for future generations of Vermonters. I am proud to have worked with Senator Leahy and Senator-Elect Sanders on this bill, alongside members of the delegation from New Hampshire."
 Rep. (and Senator-Elect) Bernie Sanders said, "I am very pleased that the New England Wilderness Act was signed into law today, protecting and expanding wilderness in the Green Mountain National Forest. Following years of careful consideration, this bipartisan plan balances the diverse needs of Vermonters and ensures that wilderness areas will be preserved for generations to come."
