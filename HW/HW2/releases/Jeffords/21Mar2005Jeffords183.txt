SEN. JEFFORDS MARKS OPENING OF HEALTH CLINIC
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today joined in the official opening of the Pearl Street Health Clinic in Burlington, a health clinic designed to serve homeless teens that Sen.  
 Jeffords secured a $150,000 federal grant to help create. It is the only such clinic operating in Vermont.
   "In true Vermont style, Spectrum Youth Services and the Community Health center have brought quality health care to 'the street.' Now our homeless and at-risk teens won't have to worry about getting medical attention when they are faced with so much else to think about," Jeffords said during a press conference held at the clinic.
   Spectrum worked jointly with the Community Health Center of Burlington, which operates the drop-in clinic at 177 Pearl Street. The $150,000 grant was part of a $1 million substance abuse package Jeffords secured for Vermont projects in the Fiscal Year 2004 Labor/HHS budget bill.
   "This is such a great example of the type of project that our federal dollars should be supporting," said Jeffords, who was joined at the press conference by teenagers who are using the services the clinic is now providing. "This space is great, and it provides these teens with some privacy and respect when they need it most."
   Jeffords toured the clinic joined by Spectrum's Executive Director Mark Redmond and Joe Ariolo, the executive director of the Community Health Center.
