SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOUTH CAPITOL STREET BRIDGE
  Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords
  Press Conference on the South Capitol Street Bridge 
   As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee I want to lend my voice in support of federal funding for this important project. The Anacostia Waterfront Initiative and the replacement of the South Capitol Street bridge are important parts of this region's revitalization.
   Unfortunately, this bridge is not alone in its need for replacement. According to the Federal Highway Administration 28 percent of our nation's bridges are structurally deficient. In my home state of Vermont there are 36 structurally deficient bridges on our interstates and 524 structurally deficient bridges throughout the state. Our transportation system needs help now.
   In Congress we are making progress on a six-year highway bill that will help this project and thousands of others like it. The highway bill is not only about roads and bridges, it is about helping people. The Senate bill will create more than a million jobs across the United States. But we have got to pass a highway bill with enough funding. Without adequate resources, our states and the District of Columbia will be fighting against each other for precious dollars.
   Tomorrow the full conference committee on the highway bill will meet for the first time and begin to hammer out the final details of this important legislation. I believe that we can pass a bill this year that will help rebuild our bridges, make our highways safer and create more than a million jobs. If Congress passes one bill this year, it should be the highway bill.
   Thank you.
