JOINT STATEMENT OF VERMONT CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ON CO-LOCATION OF VERMONT AIR NATIONAL GUARD FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
  "The one-thousand Vermonters who make up the Vermont Air National Guard are some of the most experienced pilots, maintainers and support personnel in the entire United States Air Force.  
 Because of our Guard's hard-won reputation for quality, the nation turned to the Vermont Air National Guard for air defense after 9/11 and for deployments that have included missions in the Persian Gulf. This depth of experience also has prompted the Air Force's community-basing initiative, which will bring active-duty personnel to train alongside the skilled men and women of the Vermont Air National Guard.
   "Sharing the airport has been good for Burlington International Airport, for its customers, and for the taxpayers, and it also continues to make sense for the Guard and its facilities and people.
   "Though we opposed the war in Iraq and believe that this Administration has misled the country's foreign policy, we are steadfast in our support and appreciation for the sacrifices and the skill of the men and women of the Vermont National Guard."
