SEN. JEFFORDS SECURES $250,000 FOR PREVENT CHILD ABUSE VERMONT
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced that he has secured $250,000 for Prevent Child Abuse Vermont to expand the organization's SAFE-T program, which aims to decrease child abuse, harassment, violence and bullying in Vermont schools.  
 Jeffords made the announcement as he kicked off the fourth annual Walk For Children at the State House.
   "Students should be able to concentrate on their schoolwork without having to worry about being abused, harassed or bullied," Jeffords said. "This money will help teachers and staff identify and respond to such problems so that more of their time can be spent helping kids learn, in an environment free from fear."
   The SAFE-T program, the only curriculum of its kind, helps meet the State of Vermont's requirement that schools provide safe and harassment-free learning environments for all students.
   The funds secured by Jeffords for the SAFE-T program were included in the 2004 Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bill. The grant will be adminsitered by the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquncy Prevention Programs.
