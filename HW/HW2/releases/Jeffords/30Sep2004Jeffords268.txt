SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA IG REPORT ON NSR ENFORCEMENT
  "This report is further evidence that the Bush Administration has been trying to gut the enforcement of the Clean Air Act since coming into office. The Bush White House has regularly sought to exempt the biggest, dirtiest power plants and other industrial polluters from legal requirements that would protect local air quality and reduce millions of tons of harmful pollutants. This Administration's record is a disaster for public health and the environment. This report shows there is a blatant and willful disregard for the law."
