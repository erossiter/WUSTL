SEN. JEFFORDS JOINS IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT FOR WEST RUTLAND
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., at a ceremony in West Rutland, Vermont, announced today a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development funding award of $4.8 million that West Rutland is receiving to upgrade their water system infrastructure.  
   "This investment in the future of West Rutland will ensure that its citizens have clean, safe drinking water and adequate fire protection. Unfortunately, the situation here in West Rutland is not unique. All around the nation, small towns and large cities are faced with a massive financial burden as the bill for aging water infrastructure comes due," said Jeffords, ranking member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee. "These funds for West Rutland represent one step in a long process of updating our nation's water systems and ensuring that we do not lose the gains we have made in the last 30 years in water quality improvements." 
   The upgrades and rehabilitations will allow West Rutland to meet the water needs of its people that would not be possible without these funds. This includes new generators that will be placed at the wells for use during power outages, new water meters that will ensure that customers are being billed for only the water used and the complete rehabilitation of the main well. 
   Water and waste loans and grants are made to public bodies, non-profits and corporations to develop or improve water and wastewater systems in rural areas.
