SENATE PASSES SEASONAL WORKERS AMENDMENT COSPONSORED BY SENS. JEFFORDS, LEAHY
  The U.S. Senate Tuesday night passed an amendment, cosponsored by Vermont's Sens. Jim Jeffords and Patrick Leahy, which would ease the shortage of seasonal workers who are desperately needed in Vermont. The amendment was successfully attached to the Senate version of the supplemental appropriations bill by a vote of 94 to 6.  
   Vermont counts tourism as one of its largest industries and, as a result, the current H-2B visa restrictions hit Vermont's small businesses particularly hard. Many employers in Vermont are forced to hire foreign workers when they cannot find Americans to fill seasonal jobs. 
   Employers who rely on international hiring faced a severe shortage of workers last year when the government's limit of 66,000 H-2B visas was reached just halfway through Fiscal Year 2004. This situation further deteriorated for many of Vermont's employers as the cap was reached within the first three months of Fiscal Year 2005. The amendment agreed to in the Senate today would temporarily exempt workers from the 66,000 cap if they had participated in the H-2B visa program in previous years. 
   "Seasonal workers are critical to the health of Vermont's economy and I am pleased that the Senate has taken steps to address the problems caused by the H-2B visa cap," Jeffords, I-Vt., said. "While I am proud that Vermont businesses have risen to this challenge with hard work and creativity, the need for seasonal workers has not diminished."
   "Vermont businesses have struggled mightily to manage without these temporary seasonal workers," said Leahy, D-Vt. "The need for relief is clear, and so is this common-sense solution."
   In February, Sens. Jeffords and Leahy cosponsored the Save Our Small and Seasonal Business Act, on which this amendment is based.
