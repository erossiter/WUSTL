SEN. JEFFORDS SECURES NEARLY $400,000 MORE TO UPGRADE BURLINGTON POLICE TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced that he has secured a $394,657 federal grant that will allow the Burlington Police Department to purchase digital video equipment and laptop computers for its police cruisers.  
   "These upgrades will go a long way in helping the police operate more efficiently and effectively, thereby making Burlington a better and safer community for everyone," Jeffords said in announcing the grant. The announcement was made at the Burlington Police Department, where Jeffords was joined by Burlington Police Chief Tom Tremblay and Lt. Mike Schirling for the announcement. The latest grant money was secured in the 2005 Commerce, Justice and State spending bill. 
   Jeffords also secured $500,000 for the department to upgrade its computer equipment in 2000. The department has used that money to buy laptop computers; upgrade its computer systems; purchase mobile data terminals and upgrade its radio system.
   "The duties of a law enforcement officer are both vitally important and extremely dangerous," Jeffords said. "We owe these officers our deepest gratitude, and we owe them the best possible equipment and technology to get the job done."
