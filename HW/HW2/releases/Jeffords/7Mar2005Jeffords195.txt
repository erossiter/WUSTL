SEN. JEFFORDS TO SUPPORT MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE LATER TODAY
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., will vote later today in support of an amendment to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour, over two years. Vermont currently has a minimum wage of $7 per hour. "An increase in the federal minimum wage is long overdue. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. Rather than pursuing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we should be improving the lives of workers on the lower end of the salary scale," said Sen. Jeffords. 
   Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn $10,700 a year or $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. Since the last increase in the minimum wage in 1997, the value has eroded by more than 15 percent.
   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4.3 million since 2000. Nearly 36 million people live in poverty, including 13 million children. Among full-time, year-round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970s, from 1.3 million then to more than 2.6 million. 
   The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D -- Mass., would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in three steps: $5.85, 60 days after enactment; $6.55, one year later; $7.25, one year after that.
   Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour will mean an additional $4,370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families. That's enough for a minimum wage family to buy: full tuition for a community college degree; a year and a half of heat and electricity; more than a year of groceries; more than nine months of rent.
   The Senate is expected to vote on the minimum wage increase at approximately 5:30 this evening.
