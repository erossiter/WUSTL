SENS. JEFFORDS, FEINGOLD INTRODUCE MILITARY FAMILY SUPPORT ACT
  Sens. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., introduced legislation today to support military families struggling with the long-term absence of a family member deployed overseas by providing them with increased flexibility in accessing leave time at work.  
   The Military Family Support Act of 2005 would establish a pilot program, administered through the Office for Personnel Management, authorizing federal employees who have been designated "caregivers" by the Armed Forces to use their previously earned leave time in a more flexible manner. The legislation would also instruct the Department of Labor to solicit private businesses to voluntarily offer more accommodating leave time to employees affected by a family member's deployment overseas. 
   "This bill will bring a small but important measure of relief to the families of our men and women in uniform as they seek to maintain a sense of normalcy here at home while their loved ones are deployed in service to our country," Feingold said. 
   "As we support our soldiers serving overseas, we must not forget the enormous sacrifice their families are making here at home," said Jeffords. "This legislation gives military families some well-deserved flexibility as they face the day-to-day demands of family life with one less set of hands around the home." 
   The Military Family Support Act of 2005 does not impact the Family Medical Leave Act, and all private-sector participation in programs outlined in the bill is voluntary.
