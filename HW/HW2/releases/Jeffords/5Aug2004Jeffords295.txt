SENS. LEAHY, JEFFORDS HAIL ARRIVAL OF $2 MILLION FOR CCTA
  Sens. Jim Jeffords and Patrick Leahy Thursday announced that the Chittenden County Transportation Authority (CCTA) will receive nearly $2 million in federal funding this week to replace aging buses and build new bus shelters.  
   Leahy and Jeffords secured the funds in a bill signed by President Bush last year, and the U.S. Department of Transportation announced this week that the money will now be released to CCTA.
   "Jim and I know that good public transportation is important to the economic vitality of our communities," said Leahy, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which wrote the bill that included the new funds. "Workers, students, retirees and tourists depend on CCTA buses to travel throughout the county. We are working together to help make sure that users have a reliable system and reliable equipment."
   Jeffords said, "This money for CCTA will enhance and modernize our public transportation system, which is so critical in Chittenden County and around the state. This is a wonderful investment in our communities, and it demonstrates why we should be working to strengthen our nation's transportation system."
   Jeffords, who is ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the funding for CCTA is a prime example of why Congress must move forward to pass a six-year reauthorization of the national Transportation Bill. Jeffords, I-Vt., is a member of the conference committee on the bill, which is caught up in a dispute with the Bush Administration. The President has threatened to veto the Senate's version of the bill, which calls for $318 billion in transportation investment over six years.
