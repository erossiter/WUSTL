  The White House
  Washington, D.C. 20500
   Dear Mr.  
 President,
   We are writing to request that you declare a major disaster for the State of Vermont in response to severe rains and flooding that occurred in the state beginning? August 12 and continuing through until the passage of tropical storm Frances. The seven counties of Addison, Caledonia, Chittenden, Franklin, Lamoille, Orleans and Windham all sustained major damages to personal and public property, including homes, schools, roads and bridges. Total expenditures requiring state and local cost share are expected to exceed $1,833,470 for Public Assistance and $182,000 for Other Needs Assistance.
   Governor Douglas requested a major disaster declaration for the State of Vermont on September 8, 2004. We urge you to sign the major disaster declaration for Vermont, granting Public Assistance to all seven afflicted counties and Individual Assistance for Addison County. With your signature comes the assurance that the federal government supports Vermont and its citizens in their efforts to overcome the effects of this disaster.
   Thank you for your assistance.
   Sincerely,
   James M. Jeffords
  U.S. Senate
   Patrick J. Leahy
  U.S. Senate
   Bernard Sanders
  Member of Congress.
