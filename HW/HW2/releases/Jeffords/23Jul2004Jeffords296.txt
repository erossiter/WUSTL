SENATE PASSES SEN. JEFFORDS' PATIENT SAFETY BILL
  The Senate last night passed a patient safety bill sponsored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that will create a new confidential and voluntary system for reporting medical errors in an effort to reduce needless patient deaths. Sen. Jeffords has been working to get the legislation passed for nearly five years. "I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate agreed that this legislation is critical to the health and well-being of Americans," Jeffords said. "Where health care is concerned, there is no room for mistakes. Under this bill, doctors and other health care providers will be able to report their mistakes without the threat of punishment, and their patients will be much better off for it."  
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act encourages health care providers to report errors and "near misses" to Patient Safety Organizations, which would use the data to develop recommendations and promote standards to avoid future mistakes. The bill also includes protections for patient confidentiality. Jeffords first sponsored a patient safety bill in 2000, following a report from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) that noted that medical errors are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as many as 98,000 people dying per year. More people die from medical mistakes than from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS or breast cancer, the report noted. The bill was approved by a voice vote shortly before the Senate went into recess Thursday night. It must now be reconciled with a similar bill that passed the House earlier this year. Jeffords will be a member of the conference committee.

   Summary of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act
   * Creates a system for voluntary reporting of medical errors to promote the development of interventions and solutions to ensure that such errors will not be repeated.
   * Confidential Reporting to Patient Safety Organizations - Health care providers would be given the opportunity to report medical errors, incidents of "near misses" and enhanced heath care quality practices to "patient safety organizations" (PSOs). 
   * PSO's Develop Recommendations, Interventions and Best Practices - PSO's are private or public organizations or a component of such an organization and are tasked with analyzing reported patient safety data and developing strategic guidance to give back to providers on how to improve patient safety and the quality of care.
   * PSO's May Provide Information to the National Patient Safety Database - PSO's may provide information - in which the patient, provider, and reporter are not identifiable - to a National Patient Safety Database. 
   * Allows PSO's and Providers to Disseminate Methods and Strategies - PSOs and providers may disseminate information on recommended interventions and best practices to other PSO's, providers and consumers, to improve quality of care and enhance patient safety. 
   * Establishes a federal evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to promote the reporting of medical errors.
   * Privilege granted for reports to PSO's - The legislation grants a privilege for data and reports being collected and developed by providers and data and reports sent to PSO's. 
   * Health Care Providers Can Share Patient Safety Information - Health care providers can report and analyze medical errors, without fear of being sued and without compromising patient's legal rights. This non-punitive environment fosters the sharing of medical error information.
   * Current opportunities for discovery are preserved - The bill ensures that information, such as medical records, that exist separately from the patient safety process would remain discoverable under State or Federal law.
   * Promotes the development of national standards to integrate health care technology information systems.
   The legislation requires the Secretary to develop or adopt voluntary national standards that promote the integration of health care information technology systems.
