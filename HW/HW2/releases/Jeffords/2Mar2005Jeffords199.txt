SEN. JEFFORDS' ISSUES STATEMENT ON TOWN MEETING RESOLUTIONS ON IRAQ
  Sen. Jeffords' Statement on Town Meeting Resolutions on Iraq
   I am proud that Vermont has led the way in discussing the validity of the war in Iraq. If only our Town Meeting discussions could be replicated across the country. 
   I have vehemently opposed this war and will continue to do so. I have repeatedly said the troops should be brought home at the earliest possible moment. In response to the concerns raised by Vermonters, I have been examining the federal statutes that govern activation of the National Guard, and I believe this issue warrants careful investigation.
