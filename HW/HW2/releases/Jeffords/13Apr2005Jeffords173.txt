SEN. JEFFORDS' COMMITTEE APPROVES WATER RESOURCES LEGISLATION
  The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee today approved legislation co-authored by Sen.  
 Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., to authorize U.S. Army Corps of Engineers water projects in Vermont and across the nation. 
   "With this legislation we maintain our commitment to the protection of our rivers, streams and lakes, and protect our aquatic ecosystems which are so delicate and yet so vital to critical species. This bill provides the resources our states and local jurisdictions need to manage their water resources and improve flood and storm control damage protection," said Jeffords, the ranking member of the EPW Committee. 
   The legislation includes authorization for Vermont project such as:
   * River and wetlands restoration programs for the upper Connecticut River; 
   * The repair, remediation and removal or small dams; 
   * The construction of a dispersal barrier for the Lake Champlain canal, to protect Lake Champlain from the snakehead, Asian carp and other invasive species.
   The Water Resources Development Act authorizes projects for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of water resource projects. These projects are designed to provide the nation with improved flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, commercial navigation, environmental and natural resource restoration, hydroelectric power, and recreation.
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
