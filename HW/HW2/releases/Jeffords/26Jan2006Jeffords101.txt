SEN. JEFFORDS' STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO
  "After much consideration, I will not support the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to fill Justice O'Connor's seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 While Judge Alito is clearly qualified and capable of serving on the high court, I believe our country would be ill-served by his judicial philosophy at this critical point in time. This philosophy would grant too much authority to one branch of government at the expense of the others. There are limits on the power of the Presidency, and Judge Alito, in my view, has not demonstrated the needed respect for those limits. While others will disagree with my assessment of Judge Alito, this will be a lifetime appointment and a lifetime is too long to be wrong."
