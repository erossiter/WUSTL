JOINT DELEGATION STATEMENT ON FOREST PLAN
  Joint Statement Of The Vermont Congressional Delegation on The Forest Service's Draft Forest Plan for The Green Mountain National Forest  
   "We thank the entire Green Mountain team and specifically Supervisor Paul Brewster for all of the hard work put into the draft plan. The outpouring of interest from Vermonters during the planning process underscores how important the forest and its future are to our state and to future generations of Vermonters. 
   "As a delegation, we accept our responsibilities to Vermonters and to the forest in the same spirit. We hope to introduce legislation in the near future that will not only recognize new wilderness areas but also help improve the recreation, timber harvest and wildlife values of the forest. We will be reviewing all of the information in this document to help frame our legislation and look forward to hearing from Vermonters on all of these issues."
