SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES WINNERS OF CONGRESSIONAL ARTS COMPETITION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., today announced the winners of the 24th Annual Congressional Arts Competition. For the second year in a row, Michelle Trick of Essex High School took the First Place Award for her work, "Untitled." Kerri MacPherson of St. Johnsbury Academy won the People's Choice award for her work, "Max". 167 students from 36 schools across Vermont submitted entries in this year's competition.  
   The Congressional Arts Competition is judged by a panel of art teachers and artists and was held this morning at the T.W. Wood Gallery on the Vermont College campus of Union Institute and University. Senator Jeffords, who viewed the students' work in Montpelier this morning, founded the competition when he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   "Every year I look forward to this great event with high expectations and every year these talented young Vermonters impress me with their skill and creativity," said Jeffords.
