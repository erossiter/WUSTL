SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ATTORNEYS GENERAL LAWSUIT ON GLOBAL WARMING
  "I fully support the lawsuit brought by the Attorneys General to curb global warming.  
 It is a real embarrassment that, under this Bush Administration, our States have to go to court to make the Federal government step up to its responsibilities on global warming and so many other national environmental issues. 
   If President Bush had stood by his campaign pledge of 2000 to work with Congress to control greenhouse gases from power plants, then we could have made some real progress on this important energy and clean air issue. 
   Sadly, instead of tackling the risks of climate change together, he long ago decided to listen only to his friends in industry and not to the American public or the scientific community."
