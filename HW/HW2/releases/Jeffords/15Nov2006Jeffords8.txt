VERMONT DELEGATION CALLS ON EPA TO RELEASE IP TIRE BURN DATA
  Vermont's Congressional Delegation today sent the attached letter to EPA Administrator Steven Johnson, calling on the EPA to release all emissions data related to International Paper's one-week test burn of tire-derived fuel, which was discontinued Tuesday.  
   "Though the trial burn was of short duration, we remain concerned about its public health and environmental consequences. We are particularly troubled that local doctors reported that residents of Addison County, Vermont, experienced respiratory difficulties at rates much higher than expected during the trial burn," says the letter, signed by Sens. Leahy and Jeffords, and Rep. Sanders.
