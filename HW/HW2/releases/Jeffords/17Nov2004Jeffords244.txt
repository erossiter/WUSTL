SEN. JEFFORDS' COMMITTEE APPROVES FUNDING FOR VERMONT BORDER STATIONS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved the General Services Administration's (GSA) request for funding to acquire sites and design plans for expansion of three Vermont border stations.  
 The border stations and amounts are as follows:
   * Richford - $1,545,000
  * Norton - $1,747,000
  * Derby Line - $3,348,000 
   Jeffords said, "Border stations are the nation's front and back doors and it is essential that they function properly. These crossings play a vital role in our economic development." Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee which has oversight of these projects.
   GSA, through the Public Building Service (PBS), manages the real estate that houses the federal workforce. The funding for PBS comes from the Federal Building Fund. After the site acquisition and design phases are complete, the construction phase will begin to expand the current border stations and inspection lanes to provide increased border functions.
