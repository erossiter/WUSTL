SEN. JEFFORDS SAYS GOVERNMENT MUST KEEP ITS PROMISE TO GUARD
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-VT, today called on the Army to keep its promise to the National Guard and Reservists and abandon any plan that would extend their two-year commitments.  
   At today's St. Albans deployment ceremony for 330 Vermont soldiers, Jeffords, a Navy veteran and senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, pledged to fight any effort by the Army that would extend the Guard and Reservists' deployments.
   "In the Vermont tradition, you are stepping forward to answer your nation's call and keep the promise you made when you first joined the National Guard," Jeffords said. "It was not a promise you took lightly and I want you to know that I will demand that the Government keep its promise to you, whether it be the contracted length of your service or the health care you are promised upon your return home."
   Jeffords has also called on President Bush to ensure adequate funding for the veterans health care system in wake of reports that the Administration's budget will level-fund that system despite rising demands brought on by the Iraq War.
   In a January 14th letter, Jeffords joined 30 other Senators in urging the President "to give appropriate attention and priority to the needs of our nation's veterans" in the proposed 2006 budget, which the President will submit to Congress next month.
   "Merely covering payroll increases for VA health care personnel and medical inflation is not sufficient," the senators wrote. "It is imperative that VA is able to provide high-quality primary and specialty care in a timely manner, in addition to long-term and mental health care for those who require it."
