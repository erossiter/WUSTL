SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VERMONT GUARD CASUALTIES IN IRAQ
  Senator Jeffords' Statement on Vermont Guard Caualties in Iraq 
   "Liz and I are so saddened by the loss of Vermont Guard members yesterday. We are never quite prepared to accept the realization that this could happen to our citizen soldiers when we send them off to war. These casualties, along with the other Vermonters killed and injured in this war, strike so close to our homes and to our hearts."
   "The Bean and Sheehan families have suffered the harshest toll of war, and all Vermonters share in their grief. We anxiously await news of the injured soldiers and pray they will recover completely and be reunited with their families soon."
