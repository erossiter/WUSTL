SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON EPA-OIG FINAL REPORT ON MERCURY
  "Unfortunately, this report confirms that the Administration's proposal to regulate mercury compromises children's health for the benefit of corporate profits.  
 One in six women of child-bearing age has unsafe levels of mercury in her body that puts her children at risk of birth defects. This report is further evidence that the Bush Administration's environmental policies are written for K Street, not Main Street. The Administration should go back to the drawing board with this rule. In the meantime, Congress needs to conduct extensive oversight hearings into this important health issue and into the process by which this rule was crafted. 
   It's no coincidence that the Administration's Clear Skies proposal suffers from the same problems. When is this Administration going to stop shielding the dirtiest coal plants and require the installation of already proven technology?"
