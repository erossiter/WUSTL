SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON OHIO ELECTORS CHALLENGE
  I am deeply concerned about reported irregularities and flaws in the 2004 election, and I fully support efforts to find out what went wrong and make it right.  
 A challenge to the Ohio Electors will not fix the problems at hand. We know that such a challenge will not affect the outcome of the election, and I fear it will only further polarize our political landscape. John Kerry has conceded this election, and we must now move forward in a constructive way. I believe the investigation by the non-partisan Goverment Accountability Office will provide needed answers. 
   In Congress, I will work to reform and clarify existing law, and push for the creation of a paper trail for electronic voting and a national standard for provisional ballots. These reforms are needed to assure that these problems are not repeated in future elections. People must have the utmost confidence that their votes will be counted.
