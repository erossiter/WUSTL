SENATE APPROVES SEN. JEFFORDS' PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS FOR EMERGENCY WORKERS
  An amendment offered by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., to improve the ability of public safety officers to talk with each other via voice and data during an emergency, was included last night into intelligence reform legislation currently being debated by the Senate.  
 Jeffords' amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security to adopt emergency communication standards, and implement those standards for federal, state and local officials. 
   Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which held numerous hearings on the role of first responders in the wake of the September 11th attacks. Those hearings highlighted the shortcomings of the communications equipment of emergency personnel.
   "Ensuring that our nation's first responders have the tools they need to communicate quickly and effectively during a crisis must be a top priority," said Jeffords. "The best technology in the world is useless if our emergency personnel can not talk to one another from person to person, agency to agency, state to state and even nation to nation."
   Jeffords' amendment was adopted by voice vote as part of the National Intelligence Reform bill, which will implement recommendations from the 9-11 Commission report. Jeffords also supported an amendment to return additional frequencies for use by first responders and other public safety officials.
   Jeffords continued, "This will ensure that as the Federal government, states, and localities spend money on communications, we will all be working in the same direction, toward one set of goals, with measurable results. My amendment also establishes a means of coordinating international communications. For states like Vermont, which share an international border, it is imperative that first responders in both nations can communicate with each other."
