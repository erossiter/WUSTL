SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $34,066 GRANT FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded the Franklin Country International Firefighters Association a grant of $34,066 to help train and support 16 northwestern Vermont fire departments.  
   Jeffords said, "I am pleased Franklin County's firefighters are being provided with this much-needed federal support. February's tragic fire in Enosburg Falls reminded us just how important it is for Vermont's first responders to have the best training and equipment available." Jeffords served as a volunteer firefighter with the Shrewsbury Volunteer Fire Department. 
   These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations; bolster firefighter health and safety programs; improve wellness and fitness; and provide new fire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs.
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States by awarding one-year grants. Vermont fire departments have received 58 grants for a total of over $4.7 million since June 1, 2004. For more information, please visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
