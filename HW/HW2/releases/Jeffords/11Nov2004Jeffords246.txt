SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF YASSER ARAFAT
  The passing of Yasser Arafat is a very significant event for the Middle East. I hope that the Palestinian people and the Israeli people will seize upon this time of change as an opportunity to move forward and revive the quest for peace in the Middle East. I am more convinced than ever that the only lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East is a negotiated solution that recognizes the rights, hopes and desires of all peoples of the region.
