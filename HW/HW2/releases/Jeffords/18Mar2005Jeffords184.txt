SEN. JEFFORDS COMMENTS ON TERRI SCHIAVO CASE
  My heart goes out to Terri Schiavo and her family. No family should have to make this choice. But the decision on removing a feeding tube, as difficult as it is, should be made by a family and its doctors, and when that isn't possible, it is up to the courts to decide. Congress should not interfere in individual end-of-life decisions, and I oppose any efforts in the Senate to do so.
