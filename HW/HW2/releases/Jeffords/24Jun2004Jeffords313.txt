SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT ON PETER HALL'S CONFIRMATION
  I am pleased to be here today to recommend to my colleagues Peter W. Hall for a seat on the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  
 Peter will come to the Second Circuit with an extensive and wide knowledge of the law. In addition, this nomination comes with the strong support of a large bipartisan group of Vermonters. Jim Douglas, the governor of Vermont, offered Peter's name to the president as the nominee for this seat, and both Senator Leahy and I support his nomination. My constituents also believe Peter will be an outstanding judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Vermont has been proud to provide to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals a line of excellent judges to serve on the bench. I have the utmost faith that Peter will continue this line of excellence during his service there. I am a bit melancholy, though, as Peter will be filling the seat opened by the passing of my close friend, the late Fred Parker. Judge Parker left some big shoes to fill, both literally and figuratively, but Peter is the ideal candidate to accomplish this task.
   Peter will bring a proper judicial temperament, strong values, and an exceptional judgment to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe these all come naturally to Peter through his upbringing in Vermont, and I know that Peter will serve in the Vermont tradition of prudence and fairness. 
   I recommend that my colleagues support his nomination, and I yield the floor.
