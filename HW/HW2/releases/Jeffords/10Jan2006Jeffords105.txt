SEN. JEFFORDS SECURES $1.7 MILLION FOR VERMONT'S HISTORIC COVERED BRIDGES
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation released the final $387,333 of $1.7 million in federal support for the preservation and restoration of Vermont's covered bridges contained in the Fiscal Year 2005 transportation appropriations legislation.  
 The Department of Transportation released the initial $1,322,667 of the funds last March.
   This federal support for Vermont's covered bridges was secured by Jeffords through the Department of Transportation's National Covered Bridge Preservation Program, which Jeffords authored in 1998. This program provides financial resources to improve and maintain covered bridges across the nation. 
   "Vermont's covered bridges are beautiful reminders of our past and will remain an important part for our state's transportation network in the future," said Jeffords. "This money will help preserve these historic structures and ensure that covered bridges will continue to dot Vermont's landscape for generations to come."
   As the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal transportation issues, Jeffords has helped direct federal support to improve Vermont's roads, bridges, and railways. In addition to the almost $12 million Jeffords has secured for Vermont through the National Covered Bridge Preservation Program, Jeffords' efforts yielded $1 billion for Vermont in the recently passed six-year federal transportation bill.
