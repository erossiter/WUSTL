SEN. JEFFORDS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING PATRIOT ACT VOTE
  "I voted today against reauthorizing the Patriot Act because I believe this bill lacks the provisions needed to strike the proper balance between national security and civil liberties. In the four years since we first passed Patriot Act legislation, we have seen repeated cases in which our government has used security concerns as a blank check to violate privacy rights. It is up to Congress to revisit these provisions on a regular basis to ensure this does not happen. No one would debate the need to protect our nation's security, but in doing so, we cannot and must not violate civil liberties."
