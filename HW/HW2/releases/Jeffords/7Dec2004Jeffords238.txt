SEN. JEFFORDS' PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN INTEL BILL
  An amendment offered by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I - Vt., to improve the ability of public safety officers to talk with each other via voice and data during an emergency was included in the final National Intelligence Reform bill, which will implement recommendations from the 9-11 Commission.  
   Jeffords' amendment, which was incorporated in the Senate bill, requires the Department of Homeland Security to adopt emergency communication standards, and implement those standards for federal, state and local officials. 
  "Ensuring that our nation's first responders have the tools they need to communicate quickly and effectively during a crisis must be a top priority," said Jeffords. "The best technology in the world is useless if our emergency personnel can not talk to one another from person to person, agency to agency, state to state and even nation to nation." 
   Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which held numerous hearings on the role of first responders in the wake of the September 11th attacks. Those hearings highlighted the shortcomings of the communications equipment of emergency personnel.
