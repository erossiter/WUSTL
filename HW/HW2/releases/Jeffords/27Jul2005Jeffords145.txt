SEN. JEFFORDS' PATIENT SAFETY BILL PASSES HOUSE, HEADS TO PRESIDENT
  The U.S. House of Representatives today passed legislation authored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that aims to reduce the number of patient injuries and deaths caused by medical error. The Senate passed the measure last week, and it will now go to the White House for the President's signature. 
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 will create a new confidential and voluntary system for reporting medical errors. Jeffords first sponsored a patient safety bill in 2000 following a report from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) that noted that medical errors are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as many as 98,000 people dying per year. More people die from medical mistakes than from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS or breast cancer, the report noted.
   "Reducing the number of needless injuries and deaths is in everyone's best interest, and this bill will go a long way in doing just that," Jeffords said. "I am delighted this legislation is now on its way to the President's desk."
   The legislation encourages health care providers to report errors and "near misses" to Patient Safety Organizations, which would use the data to develop recommendations and promote standards to avoid future mistakes. The bill also includes protections for patient confidentiality. 
   Jeffords' patient safety bill unanimously passed the Senate last Congress, but stalled when the House failed to appoint conferees. 
   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 
   * Creates a system for voluntary reporting of medical errors to promote the development of interventions and solutions to ensure that such errors will not be repeated; 
   * Confidential Reporting to Patient Safety Organizations - Health care providers would be given the opportunity to report medical errors, incidents of "near misses" and enhanced heath care quality practices to "patient safety organizations" (PSO's); 
   * PSO's Develop Recommendations, Interventions and Best Practices - PSO's are private or public organizations or a component of such an organization and are tasked with analyzing reported patient safety data and developing strategic guidance to give back to providers on how to improve patient safety and the quality of care;
   * Allows PSO's and Providers to disseminate methods and strategies - PSO's and providers may disseminate information on recommended interventions and best practices to other PSO's, providers and consumers, to improve quality of care and enhance patient safety; 
   * Establishes a federal evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to promote the reporting of medical errors; 
   * Privilege granted for reports to PSO's - The legislation grants a privilege for data and reports being collected and developed by providers and data and reports sent to PSO's;
   * Health Care Providers Can Share Patient Safety Information - Health care providers can report and analyze medical errors, without fear of being sued and without compromising patient's legal rights. This non-punitive environment fosters the sharing of medical error information;
   * Current opportunities for discovery are preserved - The bill ensures that information, such as medical records, that exist separately from the patient safety process would remain discoverable under State or Federal law; 
   * Promotes the development of national standards to integrate health care technology information systems. 
   The legislation requires the HHS Secretary to develop or adopt voluntary national standards that promote the integration of health care information technology systems.
