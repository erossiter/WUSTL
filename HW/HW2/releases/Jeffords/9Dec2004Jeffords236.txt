SEN. JEFFORDS SECURES $150,000 FOR HISTORIC MIDDLEBURY THEATER
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that he has secured $150,000 in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2005 for ongoing restoration work at the historic Town Hall Theater in Middlebury. President Bush signed the spending bill into law earlier this week.  
   The landmark brick theater, which dates back to 1884, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a key feature of the Middlebury Village Historic District. It was designed by famed Vermont architect Clinton Smith.
   "The Town Hall Theater is a perfect example of how our communities can come together to preserve and protect their most cherished historical features," Jeffords said. "I look forward to the day that the theater re-opens and once again serves as the heart of community life in Middlebury."
   Douglas Anderson, executive director of the Town Hall Theater Inc., the non-profit organization that purchased the theater in 2000, said the money secured by Jeffords will go a long way toward finishing the project that began six years ago.
   "A grant like this is really an investment in the entire town," Anderson said. "By drawing hundreds of people downtown on a daily basis, Town Hall Theater will have a significant impact on the downtown economy."
   The theater's goal is to raise $2.5 million for restoring the building, and the project has received strong community support in recent years. In addition to the funding secured by Jeffords, the theater has received over $1.5 million from more than a thousand private donors.
   Jeffords has had a long interest in helping to preserve Vermont's historic theaters. In past years, he has secured funding for the Vergennes Opera House; Burlington's Flynn Theater; the Paramount Theater in Rutland, as well as opera houses in Enosburg Falls and Derby Line.
