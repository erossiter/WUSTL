U.S. RELEASES $1 B. FOR HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE; DELEGATION'S EFFORTS HELP BRING $18.5 M. TO VT.
  The Department of Health and Human Services has released $1 billion in emergency funds to help needy Americans across the country heat their homes as cold temperatures continue into the spring season. Vermont will receive more than $6 million from the funding, which was approved in legislation advocated by Sens. Patrick Leahy and Jim Jeffords, and Rep. Bernie Sanders in Congress earlier this month. Any unused funds from the new release also can be carried over to the next season to help Vermonters and those in need in other states. 
   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federally funding program designed to help low-income homeowners meeting home heating needs. Last week Congress passed legislation reallocating mandatory funds for the program, making $1 billion available in 2006 instead of 2007. In light of record heating bills this winter, Leahy, Jeffords and Sanders have supported congressional efforts to increase funding for LIHEAP, including failed attempts to approve four separate delegation-backed initiatives for additional funding in recent months, all of which were denied votes in the Senate.
   The new funding brings the total allocations for the program to $3 billion for FY 2006. Vermont has received more than $18.5 million in LIHEAP funding in 2006.
