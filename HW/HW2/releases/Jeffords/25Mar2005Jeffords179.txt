SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES NEARLY $400,000 FOR WILDER BUILDING REHABILITATION
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I- Vt., announced today that a $397,640 federal grant he was able to secure will be put towards rehabilitating the Wilder Building, a historic, four-story building in downtown Brattleboro that was ravaged by fire on December 4th.  
 Jeffords was joined by housing, conservation and land trust partners in making the announcement.
   "It was a very sad day for Brattleboro when this fire occurred, but I am relieved that we were able to act so quickly on a plan to rehabilitate this important structure," Jeffords said. "Brattleboro, like so many other Vermont communities, is in such dire need of affordable housing, and this project will help ease that demand."
   Jeffords lauded the efforts of many partners who worked together on the rehabilitation plan, including Brattleboro officials, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, the Brattleboro Area Community Land Trust, and the Preservation Trust of Vermont.
   "This was a true partnership effort, and a great example of how Vermont ingenuity can make things happen," he said.
   The fire totally burned the top two stories of the building, which is adjacent to the Latchis Hotel. Only the brick shell and fa?ade were left. The lower two stories sustained heavy water damage. The rehabilitation plans for the building call for up to 11 affordable housing units, plus two commercial storefronts, with office space on the second floor.
   Jeffords secured the $397,640 grant for Brattleboro's downtown revitalization in the FY 2004 VA-HUD bill. The money was earmarked for economic development in Brattleboro, but when housing and preservation officials looked for ways to rehabilitate the Wilder Building after the fire, it was determined that the grant could be applied for that purpose.
