SENS. LEAHY, JEFFORDS BACK BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP EFFORT TO REPLENISH FEMA'S COFFERS FOR KATRINA RELIEF
  Vermont's Sens. Patrick Leahy and Jim Jeffords Thursday lent their support to an emergency effort to infuse federal agencies with funds for urgent relief efforts underway in Louisiana, Mississippi and other states hard hit by Hurricane Katrina.  
   The Senate as early as Friday is expected to approve about $10 billion in emergency funds, which are especially needed to replenish the coffers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
   The senators also expressed pride and gratitude about the upcoming dispatch of Vermont National Guard troops to the Gulf Coast. 
   Leahy said, "Those who are suffering are distant from us in miles, but they are close to our hearts. We are proud of the way Vermonters are responding to help our fellow citizens during this crisis and of the willingness of our Vermont National Guard troops to take on yet another difficult mission." 
   Jeffords said, "I applaud the bipartisan decision to act immediately to provide new federal resources and funds for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. This crisis will put our federal resources to the test and once again, Vermonters will do their full duty and be at the forefront of relief efforts. This is a human tragedy of mammoth proportions. I know I join all Vermonters in sending my thoughts and prayers to the people of the Gulf Coast as they struggle to recover from this horrible disaster."
