SEN. JEFFORDS ANNOUNCES $560,000 IN SCENIC BYWAY GRANTS
  Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., announced today that the Vermont Department of Transportation will be receiving more than $560,000 in federal funds for three projects to enhance the Vermont Byways Program. 
   Jeffords learned of the grant awards in a telephone call late Tuesday from U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Jeffords is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which authorizes the federal highway program.
   "This is great news. Vermont's scenic byways encourage our visitors to see the best Vermont has to offer, getting them off the beaten path and into the heart and soul of our communities. This money will go a long way to support this effort."
   The money will be included in funding for the National Scenic Byways Program, which has been funded since 1992. The three Vermont grants are:
   * $342,200 for the final design and installation of directional signs with the State byway logo for travelers to follow the Connecticut River Scenic Byway. The byway extends over 500 miles of roads and parallels both the New Hampshire and Vermont sides of the Connecticut River;
   * $138,573 to design and install Molly Stark Trail byway logo signs in southern Vermont; develop and print a byway brochure; create a byway website; and design and install byway interpretive signs;
   * $79,240 to develop and install directional and interpretive signs for "A Walking History of Middlebury" and create three self-guided virtual tours based on the Champlain Trail byway themes.
