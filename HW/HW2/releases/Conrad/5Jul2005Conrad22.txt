Senator Honors Veterans at Liberty Memorial Bridge Conrad Amendment Saves State More Than  4 million on Bridge Work                    July 5  2005  Bismarck    Bismarck and Mandan community leaders joined Senator Kent Conrad today at a ceremony to rededicate the Liberty Memorial Bridge  which is undergoing reconstruction  to North Dakota veterans  State and local taxpayers will save more than  4 million on the cost of the project  thanks to legislation authored by Senator Conrad as part of the Highway Bill  This bridge was named to honor those courageous men and women who served in the Armed Forces  Senator Conrad said  But today  our beloved Memorial Bridge is in a state of disrepair  I am pleased to announce that I was able to secure an amendment in the Senate Highway Bill that will help pay for the rebuilding of this landmark so that it can serve as a lasting tribute to North Dakota s veterans  Senator Conrad was joined at today s announcement by area veterans  Mandan Mayor Ken LaMont  and Dave Sprynczynatyk  the Director of the North Dakota Department of Transportation  The Liberty Memorial Bridge was built in 1922 as the final coast to coast link of U S  Highway 10  It was dedicated to honor North Dakotans who fought in World War I  and was the first Missouri River bridge designed for automobile traffic  After 83 years  the historic bridge needs to be replaced  Senator Conrad authored and successfully attached an amendment to the Highway Bill that would cut in half the combined costs to the State and the cities of Bismarck and Mandan for replacing Liberty Memorial Bridge  a savings of as much as  5 million for state and local government  Construction on the bridge connecting Bismarck and Mandan will begin in the spring of 2006  It is estimated to cost about  43 million  90 percent of which will be federal money under the Conrad amendment The Conrad amendment is part of a broad  295 billion highway spending package that was approved by the Senate  The bill would mean an additional  235 million in highway funds for North Dakota road and bridge projects  a 31 percent funding increase over the last highway bill  That means North Dakota will get  2 08 in highway dollars for every  1 in gasoline tax sent to the federal Treasury  Only four other states would do better  House and Senate negotiators are expected to agree on compromise bill later this month  Senate leaders have appointed Senator Conrad to the team that will negotiate the final version of the transportation bill  This bill is very important to North Dakota  It means new roads  new bridges and thousands of good paying jobs  Senator Conrad said  It also means restoring Liberty Memorial Bridge  a landmark that will ensure we never forget all that has been done to defend our nation s freedom and liberty
