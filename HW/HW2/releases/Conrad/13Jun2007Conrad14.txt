Conrad Calls on FDA to Block Tainted Honey Senator Wants Safety of Imported Chinese Honey Addressed                   June 13  2007     Washington   Almost 70 percent of the honey consumed in our country is imported  most of it from China  Unfortunately  China has a long track record of importing adulterated honey and engaging in other fraudulent conduct in the honey trade  Senator Conrad said  These actions not only hurt honey producers in North Dakota and across the country  they also present needless health risks to our consumers  In a bipartisan letter signed by 15 Senators  Senator Conrad also urged the FDA to act on a petition for a Standard of Identity for honey  A Standard of Identity would provide a uniform  legal definition of honey purity levels that would aid regulators  Imported honey is an ingredient found in a wide array of products including cereals  snacks  meats and beverages and is also a common ingredient in many health and beauty products  In 2002 and 2003 the FDA and U S  Customs seized multiple shipments of Chinese honey at U S  ports which were contaminated with chloramphenicol  an antibiotic that is banned in food products in the United States because of its potentially life threatening effects  More recently  there are reports that imported honey is being blended with sugars or being labeled as a blend to avoid U S  duties  This honey is subsequently sold to U S  processors as pure honey  A long time supporter of North Dakotas honey producers  Senator Conrad recently called on the Secretary of Agriculture to address the growing problem of Colony Collapse Disorder  a mysterious condition destroying colonies of honeybees across the country  North Dakota ranks number one among honey producing states in the nation   Below is the letter Senator Conrad sent to the FDA  Dear Commissioner  We are writing to request that you advise us on the steps that the FDA is taking to ensure that imports of adulterated or mislabeled honey do not enter the U S  food supply  Recent alarming reports of adulterated food ingredients imported from China raise very serious concerns about the threats posed to U S  consumers by impure and unfit food imports  and about the steps being taken by the U S  Government to detect and stop such imports  In this regard  we have particular concerns about imports of honey into the United States  Imported honey currently accounts for almost 70 percent of U S  honey consumption  Much of this honey is produced in China  Imported honey is an ingredient in a wide array of food products  including breads  cereals  snacks  meats and beverages  and is also a common ingredient in health and beauty products  U S  consumers generally have no means of knowing the country of origin of honey used as an ingredient in these various products and  thus  cannot protect themselves from adulterated honey from China  There have been serious problems in the recent past with imports of adulterated honey from China  In 2002 and 2003  for example  the FDA and U S  Customs seized multiple shipments of bulk honey from China that were contaminated with the antibiotic chloramphenicol  a food contaminant that is illegal in the United States because of its association with a potentially life threatening side effect  idiosyncratic aplastic anemia  We are also informed that there are recent indications that imported honey is now being blended with sugars or being labeled as a blend but may be subsequently sold to U S  processors as pure honey  As shown on the FDA s on line listing of import refusals  the growing number of import refusals for impure  adulterated or otherwise unfit products from China far exceeds refusals for other countries  We fear that these reported incidents may only be a portion of a much larger problem  We are particularly concerned about common practices that may enable those who adulterate or mislabel imported honey to readily escape detection  For example  the continually changing list of enterprises selling honey from China  and the extensive history of fraud and illegal transshipment in honey imports from China may make it especially difficult to determine the actual producers of impure imported honey We are also very concerned that your agency has not yet issued a proposed standard of identity for pure honey  which has been before your agency for over a year  Such a standard could be a critical tool in enforcement actions against those responsible for imports of adulterated or mislabeled honey  In light of these serious issues  we request that you report to us on  i  the steps being taken by your agency to detect and stop imported honey that is adulterated or mislabeled   ii  whether your agency requires additional legal authority or resources to address these serious issues and  iii  the status of your review of the pending standard of identity for honey  U S  consumers buy honey because it is a pure and healthful product  Surveys also show that consumers are willing to pay a premium price for products that contain honey  We look forward to working with you to make certain that consumers can be sure the honey they consume is pure and unadulterated
