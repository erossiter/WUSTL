Conrad  Extend Medicare Fix for Rural Hospitals Senator Urges Extension to Medicare Law that Means Millions for Hospitals                    November 30  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today urged the Chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee to follow through on a promise to extend a Medicare provision  that provides millions of dollars to North Dakota s hospitals  In a letter to Senator Charles Grassley  an Iowa Republican  Senator Conrad  asked for a six month extension to Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization  Act  as Grassley had promised to do  That particular provision enables rural  hospitals in North Dakota  and across the nation  to qualify for higher  Medicare payments  The provision expires in March  This is extremely important for the thousands of North Dakotans on Medicare   If this provision is not extended  many of our rural hospitals    and the care  they give our rural communities    would be at great risk  Senator Conrad said  The provision was originally authored by Senator Conrad as part of his own  H CARE bill  When Congress debated the Medicare Modernization Act  Senator  Grassley incorporated Senator Conrad s H CARE legislation as part of the broader  Medicare bill  which passed in 2003  Section 508 of the Medicare legislation helped level the playing field  between urban and rural hospitals by rewriting the formula used by Medicare to  reimburse hospital expenses  Prior to that  hospitals on the Coasts were  reimbursed much more than hospitals in more rural parts of the country for labor  costs  There are more than 105 000 North Dakotans who qualify for Medicare  The high  number of Medicare patients makes the Medicare reimbursement formula crucial to  maintaining North Dakota s health care infrastructure  Over the last three  years  North Dakota hospitals that qualified received  34 million to help offset  labor costs  It costs just as much  maybe even more  to attract good doctors to rural  America  Senator Conrad said  We need to be able to continue to draw qualified  health care professionals to our state  Senator Byron Dorgan joined a group of 13 other senators in signing Senator  Conrad s letter to Grassley  Senator Conrad serves on the Finance Committee   which oversees Medicare  The following is the text of the letter sent to Grassley  Dear Chairman Grassley  As Members from states with Section 508 hospitals  we were pleased to learn  that you will be seeking a six month extension of this vital provision in  Medicare legislation before the end of the 109th Congress  We also share your  support for a broader look at the inequities that exist in the current area wage  index  AWI  formula  We stand ready to join in this effort and urge you to work  quickly on such a proposal  There is no question that the current AWI formula shortchanges some hospitals  because it doesn t accurately account for wages and other costs that they face  in those areas  We commend your recent comments recognizing the inequities in  the AWI and the need for comprehensive reform  Until that reform is achieved   Section 508 should be extended to ensure that hospitals are able to obtain  high quality staff and protect the health care safety net in many parts of the  country  Without short term relief and comprehensive reform of the AWI  many  hospitals will be at serious financial risk  threatening care across the  country  In addition  we also wanted to take this opportunity to bring to your  attention one issue for your consideration as you draft language related to a  six month extension of Section 508  While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services  CMS  worked tirelessly to craft the regulation implementing Section  508  some hospitals were overlooked  CMS worked with several Members of Congress  to address these hospitals  and  ultimately  CMS created a special exceptions  process that allowed these hospitals to reclassify to a more reflective labor  market  While these hospitals were erroneously left off of the original list of  Section 508 hospitals  they do in fact draw down Section 508 funds  As you work  on legislation to extend Section 508  we urge you to provide the same six month  extension to these special exceptions hospitals and take other needed steps to  incorporate them into the underlying Section 508 provision  This will ensure  that future efforts to address Section 508 hospitals or AWI issues more broadly  will recognize these hospitals as deserving of the same treatment  Thank you for your commitment to health care and your leadership on the  Senate Finance Committee  We are encouraged by your remarks last month and look  forward to working with you on this issue in the coming weeks
