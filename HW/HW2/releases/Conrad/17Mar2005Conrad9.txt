Senator Fights for Family Farms in Budget Debate Conrad Says Drastic Farm Cuts Are Wrong Priority                    March 17  2005  Listen to Senator Conrad s speech   mp3 2 8 mb  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today sponsored an amendment to reverse  2 8 billion in farm cuts proposed in the Republican budget  saying the spending plan asks farmers to bear an unfair share of overall cuts and that the cuts amount to a unilateral disarmament in the midst of a growing trade dispute with Europe  In a speech from the floor of the Senate  Senator Conrad said that farmers and ranchers who rely on the Farm Bill have already helped to reduce deficit spending  The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the actual costs of the 2002 Farm Bill have come in  16 billion below what was originally budgeted  Farm spending has already gone down  And this is in the midst of a growing trade dispute with the European Union  And the EU is providing far more funding to their producers than we are to ours  Senator Conrad said  They are outgunning our producers 5 to 1 in domestic support  If we drop our support for farmers  we are unilaterally disarming at the height of a major trade dispute  The European Union provides  277 an acre of support annually to its producers  in the United States  producers get  48 per acre  Further  the Agriculture Department reports that in 2005  the United States will lose its longtime agriculture trade surplus and will import more food than it will export  We re disarming just as we re preparing to go to the World Trade Organization for major talks  We d never disarm in the midst of a military confrontation  Why would we do that in a trade confrontation  Senator Conrad said  Unilateral disarmament is a profound mistake  If we keep up with this strategy  America is going to become a second class agriculture power  Spending on federal farm programs accounts for less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget  However  the budget proposal would ask farmers and ranchers to shoulder at least 9 percent of the proposed cuts in mandatory spending programs  such as Medicaid  Senator Conrad is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and also serves on the Finance and Agriculture committees  He co sponsored the amendment with Senators Max Baucus  of Montana  Tom Harkin  of Iowa  and Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor  both of Arkansas
