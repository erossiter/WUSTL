Conrad Secures  70 Million for Devils Lake Roads Funding in National Highway Bill Will Repair Roads Acting as Dams  Senator says                    July 28  2005  Devils Lake   Senator Kent Conrad announced today that he has secured  70 million to strengthen and repair flood damaged roads in the Devils Lake basin  These roads were not designed to act as dams  If they fail  the lake could flood the surrounding communities putting people and property at great risk  Senator Conrad said  Now  after five years of hard work we have real results for North Dakota  The funding I secured will help strengthen these roads in the basin  protecting lives and property and maintaining vital transportation links in the basin  The provision drafted by Senator Conrad makes the Federal Highway Administration responsible for addressing the issue of roads acting as dams in the Devils Lake basin  The provision will result in at least  70 million from the Federal Highway Administration s Emergency Relief program to stabilize and raise the roads acting as dams  Since 2000  Senator Conrad has been fighting to get the federal government to assume responsibility for this serious safety issue  Neither the U S  Army Corps of Engineers nor the Federal Highway Administration would take responsibility for addressing this problem  This issue took on new urgency in April  when ND Highway 20 was closed due to water seepage in the roadbed  threatening its integrity  With the authority and funding provided under the Conrad provision in the highway bill  the North Dakota Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration can move forward in repairing these roads  I told my colleagues that the basin was sitting on a ticking time bomb and that the Federal Highway Administration should be responsible for correcting this dangerous  emergency situation  Senator Conrad said  If these roads were to fail  the Emergency Relief program would be responsible for the repair costs  Therefore  it was only appropriate for the ER program be part of the solution now  before a major disaster  In addition  Devils Lake and other North Dakota communities will benefit from more than  1 5 billion in additional transportation funding negotiated in a federal highway construction bill that is expected to be approved by Congress this week
