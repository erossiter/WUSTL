Pension Reform OK d by Senate Finance Panel   Senator Conrad Votes to Secure Worker Benefits                    July 26  2005  Washington    A major pension reform bill passed the U S  Senate Finance Committee today with the vote of Senator Kent Conrad  who said the legislation was urgently needed to secure retirement benefits for American workers  and help financially struggling airlines meet their pension obligations  Airlines could go bankrupt if we did not act  so I think this is a good beginning  Senator Conrad said  This bill would also protect worker pensions and reduce the likelihood that pension plans could be frozen or terminated  We don t want people to come to the end of their working lives and see their pensions evaporate  The National Employee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee Act of 2005  or NESTEG  takes several steps to protect pension plans and help air carriers  like Northwest Airlines  meet pension funding obligations  Specifically  the bill changes the formula that businesses use to calculate how much they pay into their pension funds  The purpose of the formula change is to avert a growing difference in the amount that companies set aside to pay for those pensions and how much the pensions are expected to cost  In June  the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp   PBGC  reported that defined benefit pensions are under funded by as much as  354 billion  However  the NESTEG bill included a special provision to give airlines 14 years to catch up on what is owed to their pension plans  This provision stretches out their payments in order to avoid the cash shortfalls that have previously driven airlines into bankruptcy  This is a reasonable step to help these airlines keep their pension promises  while also keeping their business intact  Senator Conrad said  If we don t offer some flexibility to these airlines  we risk losing service    and the economic activity that air service brings    to some parts of the country
