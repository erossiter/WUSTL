Senate Passes Conrad Bill to Combat Meth  Senator s Legislation Adds Muscle to Police Effort  Helps Displaced Children                   March 2  2006  Washington    The U S  Senate today overwhelmingly approved legislation co sponsored by Senator Kent Conrad to combat methamphetamine production and distribution  especially in rural areas  by restricting access to meth ingredients  and providing additional resources to law enforcement for training and cleanup  The bill passed as part of legislation to reauthorize the Patriot Act  Time after time  I hear from families who have suffered at the hands of meth  This drug is eating away at our communities and ultimately destroying lives  Senator Conrad said  Our law enforcement officials must have the tools necessary to stop the spread of this devastating drug  Senator Conrad s Combat Meth Act provides reclassifies pseudoephedrine  and other key ingredients in meth that are commonly found in cold medicine  as a drug that must be stored behind the counter  making it difficult to steal or acquire in large amounts  While North Dakota currently regulates the sale of pseudoephedrine  Senator Conrad s bill would impose a national standard so that people can t simply cross state lines to get the ingredients to make meth  Specifically  Senator Conrad s Combat Meth Act would also fight the dangerous and addictive drug by    Providing close to  500 million to the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  Meth Hot Spots program to hire law enforcement and pay for cleanup    Enhancing international enforcement of meth trafficking by requiring new reporting and certification procedures    Providing  20 million in 2006 and 2007 for Drug Endangered Children grants to fund rapid response teams that assist and educate children who have been exposed to meth  Senator Conrad is the co chair of the bipartisan Senate Anti Meth Caucus  Earlier this year  he convened a special field hearing of the U S  Senate Budget Committee in Fargo to discuss ways to fight the spread of methamphetamine use in North Dakota and across the nation  According to state statistics  the vast majority of meth in North Dakota comes from out of state  As much as 95 percent of the meth used in North Dakota is brought into the state  The Combat Meth Act empowers communities and gives law enforcement the muscle to fight meth trafficking  Senator Conrad said  We must also coordinate local  state and federal agencies to help children who become victims of meth abuse when their addicted parents enter either jail or treatment  My bill gives those families hope  The Combat Meth Act has already passed the House of Representatives and will now go to the President  who is expected to sign it into law
