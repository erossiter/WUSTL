Senate House Reach Budget Conference Agreement Fiscal Plan Funds Priorities and Returns Budget to Surplus Without Raising Taxes                   May 16  2007  Washington  DC  Senate and House negotiators have reached an agreement on a budget plan for fiscal year 2008  The five year budget resolution funds critical national priorities while returning the budget to surplus by 2012  And it achieves this goal without raising taxes  This budget provides a fiscally responsible plan for our country  said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad  D ND   It balances the budget by 2012  It provides for an extension of middle class tax cuts  And it funds the nations priorities  including a strong national defense  improving veterans health care  expanding childrens health care  and increasing our investment in education  Weve been placed in a deep hole  This plan will begin to dig us out     On all the basics  our budget is better than the Presidents  said Congressman John Spratt  D SC   House Budget Committee Chairman  It moves us in the right direction and to balance in five years  It posts smaller deficits than the Presidents budget over five years  adheres to the Pay As You Go principle and contains no new mandatory spending not paid for  and it adds program integrity initiatives to root out wasteful spending  Within this framework  our budget does more for veterans health care  more for education  and more for childrens health care   Under the budget resolution  the budget will reach a surplus of  41 billion in 2012  Spending as a share of the economy will fall in every year after 2008 and gross debt as a share of the economy will fall in every year after 2010  The plan also restores crucial budget enforcement provisions  such as spending caps  a strong Pay As You Go rule  and allowing reconciliation for deficit reduction only  The conference agreement provides robust funding for national defense and ensures that resources are available to address the most critical threats facing our nation  The plan rejects the Presidents proposals to again cut domestic priorities  It provides badly needed resources in key areas that have been underfunded by the Bush administration  such as kids health  education  and veterans health care  In total  it provides  954 billion for discretionary programs in 2008  Notably  the budget resolution does not include any tax increase  To the contrary  the agreement supports tax relief that would benefit the middle class  including extension of the child tax credit  10 percent bracket  and marriage penalty relief  and provides for estate tax reform  The plan also provides for immediate Alternative Minimum Tax relief  preventing nearly 20 million middle class taxpayers from being hit by the tax  Over the five years of the budget  revenues total  14 828 trillion  which is virtually identical to the Presidents level of  14 826 trillion  and  180 billion below the levels in the Congressional Budget Office baseline over 2007 2012  The revenue numbers in the budget can be achieved by closing the tax gap  addressing offshore tax havens  shutting down abusive tax shelters  and without raising taxes   Revenue legislation is subject to House and Senate Pay As You Go rules  and a House only trigger mechanism to ensure fiscal responsibility  The House trigger mechanism limits tax cuts to 80 percent of the projected surplus in 2012  based on Office of Management and Budget estimates   The plan also includes a reconciliation instruction for higher education that requires  750 million in deficit reduction  while enhancing student benefits      The American people sent new leadership to Congress for a reason  said Conrad  They want Washington to change course  and that includes changing failed fiscal policies that have exploded our nations debt  This budget shows that Democrats can govern  and they can do it in a fiscally responsible manner  We have an agenda thats ambitious  but framed in a fiscally sound way  said Spratt  We have our priorities  and we are sticking to them  but one of those priorities is a balanced budget  To reach that goal  we cannot let the process fail  as it did last year under the Republican majority  when no concurrent resolution and only two of eleven appropriation bills were passed  This concurrent resolution is not the complete solution  but its a long step in the right direction  The full Senate and House are each expected to pass the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution this week
