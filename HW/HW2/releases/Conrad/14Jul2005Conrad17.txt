trade officials to investigate the financial backing a state owned oil company has received from the Chinese government in its bid to buy Unocal  a California based oil company  In a letter to U S  Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez and Trade Representative Robert Portman  Senator Conrad writes that he is deeply concerned that the  18 5 billion bid by China National Offshore Oil Corporation  CNOOC  violates World Trade Organization rules  Senator Jim Bunning  a Republican from Kentucky  joined Senator Conrad in writing the letter  We have been troubled for some time about the role of the Chinese government in the global economy and how the massive subsidies it provides to certain companies and sectors cause irreparable harm to U S  companies and workers  the Senators write  The Chinese government owns 70 percent of CNOOC  the country s third largest oil firm  In their letter  Senators Conrad and Bunning provide evidence that financing for CNOOC s bid is being provided by Chinese state owned banks  a direct state subsidy  About  13 billion of the  16 billion in outside financing needed by CNOOC will come in the form of no interest or below market rate loans  the Senators write  WTO rules restrict government subsidies and other state involvement in commercial activities  Without this subsidy  it is clear that CNOOC s bid would be uncompetitive and not worthy of consideration by Unocal shareholders  the Senators write in their letter  The text of the letter follows  July 11  2005 Dear Secretary Gutierrez and Ambassador Portman  We have been troubled for some time about the role of the Chinese government in the global economy and how the massive subsidies it provides to certain companies and sectors cause irreparable harm to U S  companies and workers  That is why we are deeply concerned over the economic and national security implications of the recent bid for Unocal Corporation by the state owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation  CNOOC   We respectfully request that you raise with your counterparts at the U S   China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade  JCCT  the continuing problem of Chinese state owned companies receiving an unfair advantage in the commercial marketplace due to huge government subsidies and conduct a thorough review of whether CNOOC s proposal is inconsistent with China s WTO commitments  As you know  the Chinese government holds a 70 percent stake in CNOOC  and this proposed acquisition is clearly intended to advance the Chinese government s stated policy of building strategic energy reserves  CNOOC s own website boasts of its link to the Chinese government and the Communist Party  Indeed  the proposed acquisition is not being conducted on commercial terms and has little commercial justification  CNOOC s bid for Unocal will require CNOOC to secure  16 billion in funding from outside sources  Of this  16 billion   13 billion will be provided by entities owned by the Chinese government  and  7 billion of this funding will be in the form of no interest or low interest loans from its state owned parent company  This below market financing arrangement is a direct subsidy provided by the Chinese government to CNOOC  through a state owned enterprise  In addition  the remaining  6 billion will be provided by state owned banks  which often do not seek repayment of their loans  Without this subsidy  it is clear that CNOOC s bid would be uncompetitive and not worthy of consideration by Unocal s shareholders  In fact  the value of the direct subsidy alone has been estimated at approximately  10 per share of Unocal stock  a substantial portion of the  67 per share that CNOOC has bid for Unocal  The upcoming JCCT provides an important opportunity for the Administration to urge China to cease such anti competitive practices  We understand that the Chinese often use the JCCT to argue that China should be deemed a market economy under the Tariff Act of 1930  The proposed CNOOC transaction  which represents the continued government involvement and control of the commercial activities of state owned enterprises in China  is a powerful example of why China is not ready to be deemed a market economy  We hope that the Administration will stress this point with its Chinese counterparts  The financing arrangement proposed by CNOOC also appears to violate commitments that China made when entering the World Trade Organization  WTO   For example  China assured Members that its state owned banks had been commercialized and would only lend to state owned enterprises on market terms  The CNOOC transaction illustrates that China has failed to abide by this commitment  The Administration should conduct a thorough review of China s compliance with its WTO commitments  in light of the CNOOC proposal  prior to granting approval of the proposed CNOOC acquisition  We look forward to your report on what you accomplished at the JCCT with respect to China s continued  massive subsidization of its state owned enterprises  We also look forward to working with you to assure that the actions of foreign governments do not inhibit the ability of U S  companies to compete in the commercial marketplace  Sincerely  KENT CONRAD and JIM BUNNING
