Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on the Acceptance of Amendment to Save the B 52 Attrition Reserve  Amendment Aims to Keeps Bombers at Minot AFB                   July 20  2006  Washington    A United States Senate committee adopted an amendment today to  delay a Pentagon plan to cut the number of B 52s in America s bomber force  The  Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment offered by Senator Byron  Dorgan saying no B 52s can be retired until a detailed study is conducted  assessing the national security risk of retiring a substantial portion of the  bomber fleet  Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement regarding the strategic  importance of maintaining the nation s fleet of 94 B 52s  As I ve said many times before  this is the wrong time to be thinking about  retiring these planes  With all the instability in the world right now we need  to be prepared for anything  Retiring these B 52 could damage America s  long range strike capabilities  If anything  our nation needs more bombers  not  fewer  The B 52s are the best bomb truck for the buck and I commend Senator Dorgan  for his persistence in fighting for this amendment  The Dorgan amendment delays a decision made earlier this week by the Senate  Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to discontinue funding for the attrition  reserve B 52 bombers stationed at Minot Air Force Base  That ruling would  essentially ground 18 of the 35 bombers based at Minot Air Force Base  If the 18  attrition reserve bombers are put in storage  the Air Force says it will affect  fewer than 100 people at the base
