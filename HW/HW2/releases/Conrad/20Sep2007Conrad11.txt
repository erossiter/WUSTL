Conrad  Ag Rule Threatens U S  Cattle Senator Opposes Opening of Canadian Cattle Trade                   September 20  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad said today that he strongly opposes a U S  Department of Agriculture decision to allow the importation of older Canadian cattle at risk of carrying the so called mad cow disease  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  warned Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns in January that allowing importation of older Canadian cattle into the United States poses a threat to the U S  beef herd  At issue are the low Canadian standards for detecting contaminated feed  a subject that was widely reported upon by Canadian media  Ive asked USDA for any evidence that Canada is taking a more serious approach to its feed ban and efforts to prevent the spread of mad cow  Senator Conrad said  Until we have that documentation  I believe it is simply foolish to allow these older cattle that are at the greatest risk into the United States  It threatens our markets and our own trade with other nations  In December 2003  the USDA discovered a case of mad cow disease  or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE   in a dairy cow in Washington state  While USDA officials confirmed that the diseased cow had its origins in Canada  the U S  cattle industry suffered from a drastic drop in cattle prices and the loss of beef exports  Since then  Senator Conrad has called for strict trade limits until Canada proves it has raised its standards to detect BSE and prevent its spread
