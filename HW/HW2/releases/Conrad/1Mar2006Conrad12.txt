Conrad Questions Health Secretary on Bird Flu Preparedness More Must be Done to Prepare for this Extraordinary Threat  Senator says                    March 1  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today questioned U S  Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt on the growing threat of avian bird flu and the Administration s strategy to prepare the country for a possible pandemic  I am extremely concerned about avian flu and the threat it poses to our country  Senator Conrad told the nation s top health official  I have to question whether this Administration is doing everything that it can do to prepare for this extraordinary threat  According to the World Health Organization  bird flu  officially known as H5N1  has spread to birds in Asia  Africa and Europe  infecting 174 people  killing 94 of them  Secretary Leavitt told Senator Conrad that it was only a matter of time before the U S  sees its own case of bird flu  Health experts estimate that an avian flu outbreak in the U S  could sicken millions of Americans and kill thousands more  When it comes to a pandemic we are overdue and under prepared  Leavitt told Senator Conrad  Senator Conrad  the ranking member of the Budget Committee  said the clock is ticking and pressed Leavitt to accelerate the Administration s timeline to produce a vaccine  Leavitt said the capability to produce the necessary amount of vaccine to inoculate the U S  population would not be available for three to five years  In addition  it would take six months from the first U S  outbreak of avian flu to create a viable vaccine  When I hear you say three to five years that seems like an awful long time to me  Senator Conrad said  This could be the disaster of our time  More must be done to speed up this process  We need to do much more to prepare for this threat  Last fall  Leavitt accepted an invitation from Senator Conrad to come to North Dakota to discuss the growing threat of an avian bird flu pandemic with public health officials
