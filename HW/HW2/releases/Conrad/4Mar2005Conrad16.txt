Bush Seeks Farm Cuts of  18 Billion New Estimate Finds Bush Plan Means Much Deeper Farm Cuts                    March 4  2005  Washington    President Bush s agriculture budget cuts are more than twice as deep as he had originally said  according to a non partisan review of the budget  Senator Kent Conrad  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  said today  When the President released his budget last month  he said he was seeking  7 6 billion in farm program cuts over the next 10 years  However  a just released analysis of the White House budget by the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  CBO  shows a far deeper cut of nearly  18 billion  The cuts are outlined in the President s budget for Fiscal Year 2006  starting on October 1  It is absolutely clear the proposed cuts for farm country are far more severe than we were first led to believe  Senator Conrad said  Farm cuts of this magnitude would hurt not only farm families  but the Main Street businesses throughout North Dakota  All North Dakotans should be asking   What on earth did we do to deserve this   The President s budget calls for sweeping and painful cuts in loan deficiency  counter cyclical and direct payments  It also includes a new tax on sugar producers and a requirement that farmers pay more for crop insurance  The President s plan would cost North Dakota farmers and ranchers at least  20 million a year  I don t know how someone can pull  18 billion out of U S  farms and still claim to be pro farmer  Senator Conrad said  The proposed cuts would go beyond the immediate pain felt by farm families  The cuts would undercut America s negotiating position at the World Trade Organization  Senator Conrad says the cuts would constitute unilateral disarmament in trade talks with our European competitors  They support their farmers at a level five times ours  The President s budget cuts undermine our attempts to level the playing field for our producers  Senator Conrad said
