ITC Wrong to Reverse Wheat Ruling  Conrad Says Senator  Trade Panel Ignores the Evidence                    October 5  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad issued the following statement after a decision by the International Trade Commission to reverse its earlier ruling that North Dakota wheat farmers had been injured by unfair Canadian trade practices  This decision is just wrong  Study after study has determined that unfair trade practices by the Canadian Wheat Board cost North Dakota farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales and lower prices  It is especially disturbing that the International Trade Commission reversed its previous decision in favor of our producers in response to a NAFTA panel that exceeded its authority  In essence the ITC has allowed a panel of Canadian and American trade lawyers to make up a new standard for proving that our farmers have been injured by Canada s unfair practices  That sets a very dangerous precedent  Last week  Senator Conrad urged ITC Chairman Stephen Koplan and United States Trade Ambassador Rob Portman to treat farmers fairly in accordance to the law  That letter to Koplan and Portman  written by Conrad  was signed by Senator Byron Dorgan  Senator Tim Johnson  Senator Max Baucus  Senator Conrad Burns  Senator Michael Crapo  Senator Larry Craig  Senator John Thune  Senator Collin Peterson  Senator Mark Dayton and Congressman Earl Pomeroy
