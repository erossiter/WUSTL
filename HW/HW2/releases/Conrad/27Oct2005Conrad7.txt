Conrad Statement on Miers  Withdrawal                     October 27  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad issued the following statement today after the announced withdrawal of Harriet Miers as a nominee to the Supreme Court  I wish Ms  Miers well  I understand she is going to remain as White House Counsel  and I ve enjoyed my relationship with her in that job  She is a good person  I wish she d had an opportunity to defend herself in a hearing  I m hopeful that the President will seek a nominee who can demonstrate independence as well as a strong grasp of complex Constitutional matters  The President found that in Chief Justice Roberts  and I m confident there are more like him who can draw wide support in the U S  Senate
