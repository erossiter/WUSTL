Senator Conrad s Statement on Ag Disaster Bill                     June 7  2006  Washington    A bipartisan natural disaster aid package authored by Senator  Kent Conrad to help family farmers and ranchers recover was eliminated from an  appropriations bill today by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives  Senator Conrad s legislation  which had been added to the Senate  appropriations bill in committee by Senator Byron Dorgan  would have provided   175 million for North Dakota farmers and ranchers recovering from last year s  natural disasters  including flood  frost and disease  The Conrad bill had been  endorsed by a long list of national farm groups  commodity organizations and  rural bankers  In response  Senator Conrad made the following statement  In 2005  every county in North Dakota was designated as a disaster area by  the Secretary of Agriculture  Nearly 80 percent of all U S  counties were  designated as disaster areas  Almost every time I am home  I talk to a farmer  who tells me they are getting out of farming    that last year s heavy rain  or  flooding or frost had done them in  My bipartisan agriculture disaster  assistance bill could have meant a great deal to family farmers and ranchers  trying to stay in business  Instead  recovery for farmers and ranchers was blocked by President Bush and  the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives  That is wrong  As  Americans  we help each other overcome disaster  We have not given up  I will  pursue a farm disaster assistance package at every available opportunity because  I believe it is the right thing to do for North Dakotans and the right thing for  farmers and ranchers across America
