Conrad Continues to Fight for Northwood Senator Looks to Make Sure Underinsured Families Can Rebuild                   September 6  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today continued to fight for Northwood  North Dakota and reiterated the need for federal disaster aid to help families devastated by the August 26th tornado  The Northwood community has the heart and determination to overcome this disaster  and they will  But they need a little help  Senator Conrad said  These people need disaster assistance and they need it now  Last week  officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  said that since 90 percent of the homes in Northwood were insured  homeowners would not likely qualify for Individual Assistance  However  Senator Conrad has argued that the homeowners should qualify for Individual Assistance  because many were underinsured as far as rebuilding costs  Senator Conrad sent a letter to FEMA Administrator R  David Paulison yesterday urging him to immediately approve Individual Assistance for families in Northwood  including aid for those whose homes were underinsured  Homeowners often just get enough insurance to buy a similar home in the same town  But in the case of Northwood  when half the town is destroyed  that option doesnt work  said Robert Carlson  president of the North Dakota Farmers Union  Many of the families in Northwood are being forced to build from scratch  The most recent data from representatives of Farmers Union Insurance show the company has policies on 169 of the roughly 300 residential structures in Northwood  Four homes have less than  50 000 coverage  68 homes have  50 000    99 999 coverage  82 homes have  100 000    199 999 coverage and only 15 homes have coverage of  200 000 or more  However  estimates to rebuild start at a minimum of  150 000    200 000  This demonstrates clearly that there is significant underinsurance in the community  We want families to rebuild and stay in Northwood  However  the cost to rebuild for many far exceeds their insurance coverage  Senator Conrad said  If we want to keep these families in Northwood they will need federal assistance
