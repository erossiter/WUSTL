Conrad Works to Simplify Medicare Drug Benefit  Senator Urges Secretary Leavitt to Help Seniors Get through the Medicare Maze                    December 16  2005  Washington    Concerned with senior citizens  growing frustration surrounding the Medicare prescription drug benefit  Senator Kent Conrad today urged Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to take immediate steps to improve informational services for the new drug benefit  I have been meeting with seniors all over the state to educate them about this new benefit and encourage them to sign up for a plan that will help reduce their prescription drug costs  Senator Conrad writes in a letter to Leavitt  Unfortunately  it has become clear from these meetings that implementation of this drug benefit is leaving North Dakota s seniors confused  frustrated  and even angry  While the drug benefit offers significant coverage  Medicare has made it difficult to choose the right plan  There are more than 40 government approved private prescription plans that will be offered in North Dakota  each with its own price structure and list of covered drugs  North Dakota seniors are not alone in their confusion surrounding their Medicare prescription drug benefit  A recent Gallup poll surveyed Americans 65 and older about how well they understood the new drug program  Sixty one percent said not too well or not at all  In the letter  Senator Conrad calls on Leavitt to take several steps to help seniors understand their options under the Medicare prescription drug benefit including  Increasing federal support of the State Health Insurance Counseling program  Updating the Medicare Web site with information on drug utilization management tools  Increasing the capacity of the Web site to accommodate additional online visitors  Increasing the number of customer service representatives available to answer inquiries through Medicare s telephone information hotline  the primary source of information for senior citizens  Having visited with hundreds of senior citizens  I can tell they are frustrated by the way this plan has been implemented  I am frustrated too  Senator Conrad said  This program is so confusing that it is deterring many seniors from taking advantage of it  We can t let that happen  I m committed to helping seniors get the information and help they need to choose the plan best suited to their needs  To learn more about this and other issues of importance to North Dakota  please visit Senator Conrad s Web site at www conrad senate gov  Attached is the text of the letter sent to Leavitt  December 16  2005 The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt Secretary Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  200 Independence Avenue SW Washington  DC 20201 0004 Dear Secretary Leavitt  In just a few weeks  North Dakota seniors will have access to the new Medicare prescription drug coverage  As you know from joining me in Fargo  I have been meeting with seniors all over the state to educate them about this new benefit and encourage them to sign up for a plan that will help reduce their prescription drug costs  Unfortunately  it has become clear from these meetings that implementation of this drug benefit is leaving North Dakota s seniors confused  frustrated  and even angry  As a result  I am increasingly concerned that many seniors will not complete the enrollment process and will  therefore  not receive the benefits available to them from the new drug coverage  Consequently  I urge you to immediately take several steps to make it easier for seniors to understand their options and choose a good drug plan  1  Improve the responsiveness of 1 800 MEDICARE  Because most North Dakota seniors do not regularly use the InterNet  the 1 800 MEDICARE phone service is their first and primary source of information about the benefit  However  seniors tell me they often experience long periods on hold  some report that they have had to wait hours to speak to a representative  In addition  seniors in North Dakota repeatedly complain that  when they do talk to a representative  they receive inaccurate or incomplete information  For example  seniors tell me that the staff on the 1 800 line have been unable to answer even simple questions and have instead forwarded their calls to the North Dakota Seniors Health Insurance Counseling  SHIC  office  For many seniors  the 1 800 line is the only way to determine which prescription drug plan  PDP  will work for them  It is unacceptable that this service is inaccessible and unable to provide the basic information North Dakota seniors need  I urge you to immediately increase the number of representatives available to answer inquiries and improve the training provided to them  2  Significantly increase resources for state counseling programs  In North Dakota  as in most other states  the State Health Insurance Counseling program  has proved to be the best source of one on one counseling for seniors struggling to pick a plan  The North Dakota SHIC has done a terrific job  but it is understaffed and operating with limited financial resources  Put simply  the SHIC is being overwhelmed by requests for assistance  In fact  the SHIC program s call volume has increased at least 200 percent since October 1  leaving many seniors to wait several days or weeks for counseling sessions  I urge you to immediately provide a significant increase in federal funding to support these efforts  3  Improve the website  As I noted  most seniors do not regularly access the Internet  However  because HHS has been encouraging seniors to use its website  it is critical to ensure that seniors and those who are helping them through this process be able to access this site and get the information they need  Unfortunately  North Dakota seniors and their families tell me this resource is as difficult to access and navigate as 1 800 MEDICARE  First  they tell me that the system often freezes up because of the volume of users  Second  when seniors and their families are able to access the online comparison tool  they find it difficult to make an informed decision  For example  seniors tell me that the posted drug prices change almost weekly  with a new set of plans offering the best discounts each week  How do we expect a senior to choose the plan that works best for them when their cost sharing and annual drug costs change each time they check the website  In addition  the site does not provide adequate notice of the coverage gap or what a senior will be paying when they are responsible for 100 percent of their drug costs once they ve spent  2 250 in total drug costs  This makes it extremely difficult for seniors to get an accurate view of their likely total drug expenditures under the different plans  Finally  the website provides insufficient information to seniors about drug utilization management tools  leaving seniors to wonder whether they will have to get prior approval for a drug their doctor prescribes or if their supply will be limited because of quantity limits  Therefore  I urge you to improve the capacity of the online comparison tool  work with the PDPs to provide more reliable drug pricing information  and immediately update the website to inform seniors of the cost sharing while in the coverage gap  I look forward to hearing what steps you will take to reduce confusion to improve enrollment in this new benefit
