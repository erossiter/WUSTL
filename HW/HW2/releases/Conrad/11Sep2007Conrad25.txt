Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on the Sixth Anniversary of the 9 11 Terrorist Attacks                    September 11  2007  As we mark the anniversary of September 11  we must remember and honor those who lost their lives six years ago  And we again pay tribute tothe courage displayed by so many heroes on that terrible morning  We must alsoremember who attacked us on that fateful day  It was Osama bin Laden  the head of al Qaeda  who planned  financed  and organized the attacks of September 11  It has now been 2 191 days since those attacks  and this man is still on the loose  I believe it should be one of our Nation s highest priorities that he and the other top leadership of al Qaeda are brought to justice   Osama bin Laden is far from virtually impotent  as the White House suggests  Our intelligence agencies believe al Qaeda is stronger today than at any point since September 2001 Terrorist plots in Germany and Denmark with suspected ties to al Qaeda were broken up just last week  Al Qaeda is regrouping with aims of another strike on the United States  To me  the most important question for all our nations leaders ishow our country cansucceed in this battle against terrorism  My own conviction is  it starts with hunting down Osama bin Laden and his leadership cadre
