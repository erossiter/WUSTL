Conrad Program Brings Top Docs to ND Hospitals Fargo Physician Thanks Senator for Aiding Escape from War Torn Lebanon                    August 15  2006  Fargo    Senator Kent Conrad was recognized today by MeritCare Hospital for  his leadership in the U S  Senate on health care issues  especially his efforts  to bring qualified doctors to underserved  rural areas in North Dakota and  correct outdated Medicare payment formulas that have put hospitals in rural  states at a disadvantage to larger urban hospitals  Hospital administrators across North Dakota have told me of the challenges  in recruiting and keeping capable  quality physicians  said Senator Conrad   The Conrad State 30 program is helping to fill that void  bringing doctors to  rural America  The Conrad State 30 program requires American trained  but foreign born   doctors to work in underserved areas  typically rural hospitals and clinics   when applying for a work visa  Senator Conrad first created the program in 1994  and it has proven to be extremely successful  In 2003  the Conrad State 30  program placed more than 1 000 doctors in medically underserved communities  across the nation  North Dakota typically receives more than a dozen doctors a  year through the Conrad State 30 program   almost all of them in rural counties  One of those Conrad State 30 physicians is Dr  Nicolas Zouain  a radiation  oncologist with the MeritCare Roger Maris Cancer Center  Dr  Zouain was  traveling in his home country of Lebanon last month when the conflict erupted  between Israel and Hezbollah  MeritCare administrators asked Senator Conrad for  help getting Dr  Zouain safely out of Lebanon and back to his patients in Fargo  Senator Conrad and his staff negotiated with the U S  Department of State   the U S  Defense Department  and the embassy staff of Canada and Norway to  secure Dr  Zouain s safe passage to Cyprus  and then eventually to the United  States  Dr  Zouain was on hand at today s event to personally thank Senator Conrad  for helping him return to Fargo  The doctor also testified to the importance of  the Conrad State 30 program There are many families here in Fargo and across North Dakota who depend on  State 30 physicians like Dr  Zouain  Without their services people in rural  areas would have to travel great distances for routine health care  Senator  Conrad said
