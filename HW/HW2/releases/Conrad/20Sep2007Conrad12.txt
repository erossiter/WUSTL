Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on the Resignation of Mike Johanns Statement Following the Resignation of the Secretary of Agriculture                   September 20  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today following the announced resignation of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns  I am a big believer in the adage that you always finish what you start  It is completely irresponsible for the Secretary of Agriculture to leave his post right in the middle of negotiations in Congress over the next Farm Bill  I have never agreed with Secretary Johanns and the Administrations Farm Bill proposal  Their plan undermines U S  farm policy and guts the current bill  However  Secretary Johanns has a responsibility to Americas farmers and ranchers  I would have thought the Secretary would have stayed at his post until the major responsibility of that post was completed  President Bush today named Deputy Agriculture Secretary Chuck Conner to serve as acting Agriculture secretary  Senator Conrad made the following statement on Mr  Connor  I have had a long  positive working relationship with Chuck Connor  He is very knowledgeable  He knows farm policy and is someone who will be respected in the negotiations on the Farm Bill  Thats not to say I have always agreed with him  But I do respect him  He is a good man  Senator Conrad is the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee
