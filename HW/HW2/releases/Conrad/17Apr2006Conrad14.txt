Conrad Inspects GF Flood Control Project Senator Praises Community on Winning the Fight Against the Flood of 2006                    April 17  2006  Grand Forks  Just days after the swollen Red River crested in Grand Forks  Senator Kent Conrad toured the city s multimillion dollar levee and pump system today and praised community members on their flood fighting efforts  It was nine years ago tomorrow that the Red River poured over the dikes and flooded Grand Forks and East Grand Forks  Since then  every effort has been made to ensure Grand Forks never experiences that destruction again  Senator Conrad said  After the spring rise of 2006  it is obvious that all the planning and preparation of the community paid off  Senator Conrad was joined by Grand Forks Mayor Mike Brown and City Engineer Al Grasser today to inspect the new levee and pump system built in the wake of the devastating 1997 flood that destroyed downtown Grand Forks  Since the 1997 flood  Senator Conrad has helped secure the federal funding necessary to construct a flood protection system for the Grand Forks community  To date  the North Dakota Congressional delegation has secured  209 million in federal funding for the  410 million project  The U S  Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the flood control project in 2000  The project consists of 30 miles of levees  two miles of floodwalls  22 pump stations and 10 miles of diversion channels  When completed  the flood control system will protect Grand Forks and East Grand Forks from water levels equivalent to those experienced during the1997 flood  The dike project is 85 percent finished  On April 6  the Red River in Grand Forks crested at 47 8 feet  nearly 20 feet above flood stage  but well below the top of the new levee  According to Jim Campbell  the emergency management director for Grand Forks County  had the current dikes and floodwalls not been in place  it would have required millions of sandbags to hold back the river  We can all breathe a sigh of relief  The city made it through the flood of 2006 in good shape  The levees were tested and they held their own against the Red  Senator Conrad said  I have made this Grand Forks flood control project a top priority and it has paid off
