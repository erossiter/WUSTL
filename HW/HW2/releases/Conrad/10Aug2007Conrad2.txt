Conrad Answers First Responders Call for Aid Senator s Bill Helps Emergency Agencies That Lose Personnel to Military Duty                   August 10  2007  Fargo  Local law enforcement and emergency personnel stood alongside Senator Kent Conrad today as he unveiled his legislation to assist first responder agencies that have lost personnel called up for service in the National Guard or Reserves  Many of our nations first responders double as citizen soldiers  More and more of these police  fire and emergency medical personnel are called up to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan  and my bill will fill the void left on the streets in our hometowns  Senator Conrad said  My bill helps fill the ranks of first responders at home  as our citizen solders are called up to serve overseas  Senator Conrads legislation is called the Reinforce First Responders and Emergency Employees Deployed Overseas in the Military Act  or the Reinforce FREEDOM Act  Senator Conrad wrote the bill in direct response to concerns expressed by Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes  Chief Ternes testified at a Senate Budget Committee field hearing earlier this year that one of the greatest challenges the department faced was filling the shifts of officers called up for military service  At one point  15 of the Fargo police department s 125 sworn officers were serving Guard duty abroad  In response  Senator Conrad drafted the Reinforce FREEDOM Act  His bill makes grants available to first responder agencies that have employees in the National Guard or Reserves on active duty  While the positions are held for the officers when they return  the grants help pay for temporary staffing needs and equipment  as well as overtime  A report by the nonpartisan Institute for Policy Studies found that 44 percent of the nations police forces had at one time been deprived of officers by Guard call ups  The frequent call ups of first responders puts an added strain on the smaller departments that operate on shoestring budgets  Our first responders are being stretched thin  Faced with fewer officers  firefighters and emergency personnel  first responder agencies must still answer the call for help  Senator Conrad said  My bill will help our short handed first responders until their brave colleagues return safely from service overseas  Joining Senator Conrad today at the Fargo Police Station headquarters were Chief Ternes  Fargo Fire Chief Bruce Hoover  Fargo Moorhead Ambulance Executive Director Mike Hall  and Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker
