Conrad Energy Initiatives Bring Big Benefits to ND Senator s Provisions in Energy Bill Could Mean Big Job Growth for State                    August 5  2005  Mandan  Senator Kent Conrad was joined by North Dakota s energy and agricultural leaders today to announce the passage of national energy legislation that could bring hundreds of millions of dollars and many good paying jobs to North Dakota  This is more than an energy bill  it is also a jobs bill  Senator Conrad said  From the farms of the Red River Valley to the coal fields of Washburn  this bill makes a real investment in North Dakota  both in our natural resources and in our people  The legislation  which the President will sign into law next week  includes many of Senator Conrad s initiatives to support exploration of alternative and traditional sources of domestic energy in North Dakota  A senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad helped secure a Renewable Fuels Standard  requiring the use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels  like biodiesel and ethanol  by 2012  This standard will increase demand for many of North Dakota s fuel producing crops  In addition  Senator Conrad drafted a provision that will help develop plans for a proposed  750 million coal to liquid fuel plant in North Dakota  Additional Conrad provisions include  An Extension of the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit  One of Senator Conrad s most important energy policy goals is to develop North Dakota s potential for wind power  To that end  Senator Conrad secured a two year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit  Clean Coal Tax Credits  The energy bill includes Senator Conrad s tax credits for power companies that use clean coal technology  These credits include  800 million for a 20 percent investment tax credit for power plants using the most advanced clean coal technology  and  500 million for a 15 percent investment tax credit for other advanced clean coal power plants  Expanded Existing Ethanol Tax Credit  Senator Conrad expanded an existing 10 cent per gallon tax credit for ethanol plants to include plants that produce up to 60 million gallons of ethanol per year  Renewable Energy Bonds for Cooperatives and Tribes  Senator Conrad drafted this provision in an effort to encourage co ops  public power systems and Indian tribes to invest in wind and other renewable energy projects  The Energy Bill provides  800 million for these organizations to expand their renewable energy development by issuing a new category of tax credit bonds  Investment in North Dakota s Transmission Capacity  Senator Conrad has taken action to make sure that electric consumers in North Dakota continue to receive cheap  reliable power  He developed tax incentives to help utilities invest in electricity transmission and pollution control  The federal energy bill also calls for  30 million to be set aside for the development of 10 enhanced oil recovery demonstration projects in the Williston Basin  These demonstration projects will not only increase oil production  but will also prevent carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere by injecting it underground  In addition  the energy legislation calls for further development of clean coal technology  The bill secures federal loan guarantees for new lignite fired coal plants and authorizes a Department of Energy program to study mercury removal from lignite coal  There is probably no greater opportunity to develop North Dakota s economy    and create hundreds if not thousands of jobs    than with energy policy  Senator Conrad said  This is not a perfect bill but it takes steps toward greater energy independence for the United States and lays the groundwork for a plan that promotes substantial investment in North Dakota s energy sector
