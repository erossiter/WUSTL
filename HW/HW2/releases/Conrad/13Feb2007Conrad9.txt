Conrad Warns of Exploding Healthcare Costs Nation in Need of Real Health Care Reform  Senator says                   February 13  2007  Washington    From his position as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee  Senator Kent Conrad today warned Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt that the White House budget proposal for Medicare and Medicaid is unsustainable  We are facing a real demographic tsunami   The Baby Boom generation is about to retire and more and more seniors will be eligible to receive Medicare  We are on an unsustainable course and the President s budget does little to put us back on track  Senator Conrad said  Instead  it cuts Medicare and Medicaid to extend tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans  President Bush s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2008 cuts millions of dollars from health care providers in North Dakota    as much as  60 million over five years   Overall  the President s budget calls for  76 billion in Medicare cuts over the next five years  including  40 billion in across the board cuts for hospitals  nursing homes  home health agencies  and ambulance services  The cuts in Medicare are one way that President Bush attempts to pay the costs of more than  2 trillion in tax cuts  Senator Conrad pressed Leavitt to develop a plan for real health care reform and suggested the federal government restrain the exploding cost of Medicare by focusing resources on the chronically ill   According to some estimates  the chronically ill represent 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries but account for half of Medicare costs   But one pilot study showed that better coordinating the care of the chronically ill can save money and improve health care  We have a very serious problem in making things add up here  Senator Conrad said   While I agree that we must find savings in our health care entitlement programs  the real savings will only be found through overall health care reform   Not by cutting vital health care programs to extend tax cuts that only benefit the wealthiest among us
