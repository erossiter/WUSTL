Conrad Fights to Keep Teachers in Rural Communities  Senator s Bill Could Bring More Than  500 000 in Bonuses to ND s Teachers                    May 16  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad introduced legislation today to help rural school districts attract and keep highly qualified teachers  Under the legislation  North Dakota schools could receive up to  550 000 to recruit and retain teachers  Every classroom in the nation should be staffed by a talented  dedicated  well prepared teacher  But many rural districts have a difficult time attracting teachers to their schools  Senator Conrad said  The legislation I am introducing today will help rural school districts in North Dakota  and across the nation  provide signing and retention bonuses so they can keep teachers in the classroom  Senator Conrad s Rural Teacher Retention Act  introduced with Senator Ken Salazar  CO  and Senator Tim Johnson  SD   will create a  50 million grant program for rural schools that have experienced at least 5 percent teacher turnover rate  Schools can use the funds to give  2 000 signing bonuses to new teachers and  3 000 retention bonuses to qualified teachers who work in the same school for at least 3 years  If Senator Conrad s program were fully funded  rural schools in North Dakota would receive about  550 000 for teacher bonuses  Today s introduction of the Rural Teacher Retention Act builds on the success of the Rural Education Achievement Program  REAP   Created in 1999 by Senator Conrad and Senator Susan Collins  ME   REAP is designed to help rural school districts compete for federal grants  To date  more than 300 North Dakota schools have benefited from the REAP program  receiving more than  1 8 million in funding  I am committed to ensuring that North Dakota s children receive the best education possible  And that starts with recruiting  hiring  and retaining the best teachers possible  Senator Conrad said
