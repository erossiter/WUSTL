Conrad Fights for ND s Rural Ambulance Squads New Fed Rule Threatens Access to Emergency Services  Senator Warns                   December 4  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad strongly urged the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to reverse a federal ruling that would dramatically cut funding  to rural ambulance squads across the nation  including services in several North  Dakota communities  In a letter to Secretary Michael Leavitt  Senator Conrad called for  immediate action to correct changes to payment policies that shortchange 11  ambulance squads in North Dakota  Ambulance personnel are not only the first responders to an emergency  but  also play a key role in the provision of life saving medical care  However   current reimbursement levels in rural areas are insufficient for the squads to  bear the costs of responding to calls  Senator Conrad writes  Fifty four percent of North Dakotans live in areas served by rural emergency  medical service teams  Rural ambulance squads often need to travel greater  distances to transport patients to health care facilities and face higher costs  for caring for patients  To alleviate the budget crunch on rural EMS service   Senator Conrad helped secure a bonus payment for rural ambulance squads in the  Medicare Modernization Act  However  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has proposed  changing ambulance payment rules  stripping the bonus payment for rural  ambulance squads in 11 North Dakota communities  Under the ruling  ambulance  services in Grand Forks  Larimore  Wing  Wilton  New Salem  Hebron  Glen Ullin   Dickinson  Fargo  Rugby and Bismarck would receive a 23 percent decrease in  their Medicare reimbursement payments  This ruling makes absolutely no sense  People living in rural areas should  not have to worry whether an ambulance will come when called upon  Senator  Conrad said  Without immediate action  access to rural ambulance service across  the country could be threatened  Attached is the text of the letter sent to Leavitt  The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt Secretary Department of Health and Human  Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington  DC 20201 0004 Dear Secretary Leavitt  I am writing to express deep concern about the Revisions to the Payment  Policies of Ambulance Services under the Fee Schedule for Ambulance Services for  Calendar Year  CY  2007  The change to Super Rural Bonus areas will have a  drastic impact on several ambulance services in rural North Dakota  I urge you  to take immediate action to reverse this shortsighted proposal on Super Rural  Bonus areas  Ambulance personnel are not only the first responders to an emergency  but  also play a key role in the provision of life saving medical care  However   current reimbursement levels in rural areas are insufficient for the squads to  bear the costs of responding to calls  As rural ambulance squads are forced to  close  rural residents    and others traveling through rural areas    are left  without access to emergency services  In the proposed ambulance payment rule    issued in May    the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  announced that Super Rural Bonus areas  would not be affected by the payment changes  This was of particular importance  to North Dakota ambulance services because it ensured that the Super Rural Bonus  I helped secure in the Medicare Modernization Act would continue  This bonus  provides a 22 6 percent add on to Medicare payments for services provided in the  most rural areas  where costs per patient transported are highest  Despite these assurances by CMS  a number of Super Rural Bonus areas in North  Dakota will lose their designation in 2007 as a result of the final rule  released today  In the zip code file located on the CMS website  nine Super  Rural zip codes in North Dakota will no longer be designated as such and could  be forced to stop providing services  I am particularly concerned that CMS  assured stakeholders in the proposed rule that no Super Rural Areas would lose  the bonus payment  but then reversed course in the final rule  This is not fair  Given the failure of CMS to seek input from the affected rural ambulance  squads and the failure to honor the commitment made to Super Rural Bonus areas  in the proposed rule  I urge you to reconsider this decision  Without action   access to rural ambulance services across the country could be threatened
