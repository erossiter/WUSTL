Senators Announce Final Passage of  44 Million for High Tech Research  Training in North Dakota                      November 9  2007 Washington  U S  Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad announced Friday that the Senate has given final approval to a bill that will give a wage hike to U S  military personnel and direct  44 million in federal funding to high tech research and training projects in North Dakota   Dorgan and Conrad worked with Congressman Earl Pomeroy to secure the funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill  which will now be sent to the President for his signature  The bill will support high tech research and training programs in North Dakota that are crucial to the U S  military  They include initiatives to help inoculate troops against disease and bioterror agents  research to develop new cutting edge technology that gives American soldiers a step up on the battlefield  and a training program that brings West Point cadets to UND to learn to fly helicopters   The bill will give a 3 5 percent pay raise to U S  military personnel  a bigger hike than the President had requested  It also includes funding for the Air Force to buy 24 Predator and 5 Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs   some of which will be based at Grand Forks Air Force Base   Our troops give a lot to this country  and this bill is a significant investment that will help them carry out their missions more safely and effectively  said Senator Dorgan  who helped negotiate the final version of the bill as a member of the House Senate conference committee  At the same time  it will give a boost to our states high tech research industry and bring more good paying jobs to North Dakota   This bill makes a major investment in the future of North Dakotas bases and underlines the important role they play in our national security  Senator Conrad said  It includes funding for a number of high tech projects that will be conducted in North Dakotas colleges and universities to help strengthen the military  Thats good for our nations security  and good for North Dakota   A list of North Dakota projects in the bill is below   Projects in Minot   Universal

components can be used covertly in the war on terrorism   Advanced Fouling and Corrosion Control Coatings  2 million This funding will be used by NDSUs Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering to help develop environmentally compliant coatings to protect ships against fouling and corrosion  This will save the Navy hundreds of millions of dollars per year in maintenance and fuel costs   Autonomous Border and Intrusion Surveillance Sensor Networks   2 million This funding will be used by Pedigree Technologies  a Fargo based company  to develop technology that will significantly improve the militarys ability to monitor borders and facilities in remote areas    Detecting and Inhibiting Corrosion on Army Vehicles  1 2 million This funding will be used by NDSU and Turtle Mountain Manufacturing  a Native American owned company in North Dakota  for a project aimed at extending the life of Army vehicles  Researchers will work to develop novel ways to detect corrosion in military vehicles before it is visible  as well as to find ways to replace the old coatings now used with more effective corrosion control coatings   Durable Hybrid Coatings for Aircraft Systems  1 2 million This funding will be used by NDSU to develop environmentally compliant and longer lived anti corrosion coatings needed to protect aircraft against weathering and corrosion  This project is part of an Air Force program aimed at eliminating  150 million a year in costs from dealing with hazardous wastes associated with painting  stripping and repainting aircraft   Spartan Advanced Composite Technology  1 6 million This funding will be used by Fargos Space Age Synthetics to improve the performance of the Spartan  an unmanned Navy patrol vessel  This project will be used to demonstrate whether the Spartans performance can be improved by significantly reducing the vessels weight by replacing engine covers and other parts with components made from composite materials
