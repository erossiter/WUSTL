Conrad Pressures Japan to Lift Beef Ban Senator s Bipartisan Bill Will Impose Retaliatory Tariffs on Japanese Exports                   June 21  2006     Washington    Senator Kent Conrad introduced bipartisan legislation today  pressuring Japan to reverse a two year ban and open its domestic market to  American beef  Senator Conrad introduced his bill just days before Japanese  Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is scheduled to meet with President Bush to  discuss trade  U S  beef is among the safest in the world  Senator Conrad said  My  legislation is designed to send a clear message to the Prime Minister that it is  time for Japan to re open its market to U S  beef  Senator Pat Roberts  a Republican from Kansas  joined Senator Conrad in  drafting the bill  If Japan does not re open its domestic market to  U S  produced beef by August 31  the Conrad Roberts bill would require the  Treasury Secretary to impose tariffs on Japanese products  Japan closed its market to U S  beef following the December 2003 discovery of  a case of mad cow disease in the United States  That particular cow was born in  Canada  Prior to the ban  Japan was the top importer of U S  beef  As a result  of Japan s ban on U S  beef  American producers have lost  3 14 billion  annually  For cattle producers in North Dakota  these losses amount to more than   118 per head  Last year  after pressure from Senator Conrad and Senator Roberts  Japan  reopened its market to U S  beef  However  the resumption of trade was short  lived  Japan suspended imports after only five weeks  citing a U S  violation of  import rules  Today  Japan reportedly agreed to resume beef imports after US  meat packing facilities receive a clean bill of heath from Japanese inspectors  Our goal is a resumption of trade   not promises that trade may resume  We  will proceed with our sanctions bill until Japan opens it s beef market to fair  trade  Senator Conrad said  We ve had promises made before that have turned up  empty  We re going to keep up the pressure until American ranchers have access  to Japan s market again  Cosponsors of the Conrad Roberts legislation include Senators Byron Dorgan   D N D    Max Baucus  D Mont    Conrad Burns  R Mont    Ken Salazar  D Colo     Sam Brownback  R Kan    Wayne Allard  R Colo    Tim Johnson  D S D    John Thune   R S D    Blanche Lincoln  D Ark    Mike Enzi
