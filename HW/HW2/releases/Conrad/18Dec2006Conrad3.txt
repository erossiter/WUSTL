Delegation Urges Defense Secretary to Maintain Bomber Force ND s Leaders Fight for B 52 Fleet  Call on Secretary Gates to Review  Misguided Plan                    December 18  2006  Washington  Only hours after being sworn in today as the new defense  secretary  Robert Gates was being pressed by the North Dakota Congressional  delegation to ensure the future of America s B 52 bomber fleet  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy today  strongly urged Gates to adhere to a Congressional mandate to retain a robust  fleet of B 52s  Under the previous Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld  the  Pentagon proposed dramatic cuts to America s bomber force  Congress has taken a very skeptical approach to the Administration s  proposal to retire a large portion of our B 52 force  the delegation writes in  the letter to Gates  As you assume the duties of Secretary of Defense and  conduct your final review of the FY 2008 budget request  we would urge you to  carefully consider removing from the budget draft which you have inherited any  proposal to retire additional B 52s  In the letter to Gates  the delegation stressed the strategic importance of  maintaining the nation s fleet of 94 B 52s and warned that reducing the fleet  would weaken the nation s military preparedness by reducing America s ability to  respond to future threats  Last year  the Defense Department had announced a  plan to retire 38 bombers  cutting the total fleet to 56 aircraft by fiscal year  2008  Earlier this year  Congress successfully blocked the plan by passing  legislation barring the Air Force from retiring any B 52s until the completion  of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study  The detailed study would address  America s long range strike capabilities during the time between the proposed  drawdown of the B 52 fleet in 2008 and the delivery of new bombers in 2018  In  addition  Congress passed legislation blocking the bomber level from falling  below 76 active aircraft  The delegation is asking Gates to uphold the  Congressional mandates  It absolutely makes no sense to try to save money by cutting America s B 52  fleet  the delegation said in a joint statement  We are asking Secretary Gates  to start his tenure at the Pentagon with a clean slate and reevaluate what we  consider a misguided plan to restructure the bomber fleet  The letter to Gates follows  Congratulations on your confirmation as Secretary of Defense  You have taken  on an extremely difficult job  and we want you to know that as Americans and as  proud supporters of our nation s Armed Forces  we are wishing you every success  We wanted to follow up on an important matter that you discussed with Senator  Conrad during your personal meeting  the future of our nation s B 52 bomber  force  As he mentioned  Congress has taken a very skeptical approach to the  Administration s proposal to retire a large portion of our B 52 force  In the  2007 Defense Authorization Act  the Congress barred the Air Force from retiring  any B 52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study  and  further mandated that the Air Force maintain a fleet no smaller than the present  force of 44 combat coded B 52s until 2018 or the fielding of a next generation  bomber  As you assume the duties of Secretary of Defense and conduct your final  review of the FY 2008 budget request  we would urge you to carefully consider  removing from the budget draft which you have inherited any proposal to retire  additional B 52s  Such a proposal would weaken our nation and harm our ability  to respond to future threats  Like the House and Senate Armed Services Committees  we are gravely concerned  that the Department of Defense has not fully thought through its decision to  retire nearly 40 percent of our nation s B 52 bomber force  Our bomber fleet is  a vital national asset  The B 52  B 1 and B 2 offer global reach  operational  responsiveness  and close air support for troops on the ground in ways that  their designers could never have imagined  At the same time  there is virtually  no chance that new long range bombers will enter the fleet before 2020 at the  earliest  If we remove bombers from our active force and do not furnish them  with critical upgrade programs  they will quickly become irretrievably lost   even if they are preserved in inviolate storage  This will create a bathtub in  bomber capabilities that will last over a decade  We believe that cutting our bomber force risks leaving us with insufficient  bombers to support two nearly simultaneous conventional campaigns  much less  keep enough bombers in reserve to execute missions under OPLAN 8044  formerly  known as the Single Integrated Operations Plan  or SIOP   It is our  understanding that the total proposed inventory of 56 B 52 bombers would be  sufficient to provide 24 for the first contingency and 18 for a second  contingency  If so  it would be impossible for the Air Force to deploy a bomber  force comparable to the one we used during Operation Iraqi Freedom  During the  initial 30 days of combat in Iraq  the Air Force used more than 80 B 52s so it  could sustain a deployed force of 42 B 52s at forward operating locations  overseas  Obviously  the Air Force could not repeat that feat with just 56  B 52s  We support the Air Force s effort to reduce the average age of its aircraft  fleet by retiring worn out and obsolete aircraft  but the B 52 is not part of  that problem  The B 52 remains a young aircraft in flying hour terms  The Air  Force has said that today s H model B 52 is flyable for another 40 years  Most  commercial airliners have several times as many cycles per aircraft and airframe  hours as the B 52  which spent most of the Cold War sitting alert on the ground  The B 52 fleet maintains the highest mission capable rate in the bomber force  and higher mission capable rates translate directly into increased combat  effectiveness  According to Air Force data  the B 52s are programmed for more  flying hours per primary authorized aircraft in FY 2006 than the newer B 1Bs and  B 2s  Despite their age  the FY 2006 reimbursement rate for the B 52 is  10 000  per flying hour less than the B 1B and  4 000 per flying hour less than the B 2  We fully support Air Force plans to modernize the bomber force and field a  new bomber  but we believe that the current Air Force program is not  appropriately balanced between short range tactical aviation and long range  bombers  Moreover  we would note that it makes little sense to try to save money  by cutting the portion of the bomber force that is by far the least expensive to  operate but has the highest utilization and mission capable rates  Thank you for your commitment to public service  We look forward to working  with you on this important issue
