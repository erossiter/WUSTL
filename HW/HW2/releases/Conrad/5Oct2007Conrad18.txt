Senate Panel Passes Conrad Ag Disaster Plan Senator Continues Fight for Disaster Aid  Bio Energy Incentives in Farm Bill                   October 5  2007  Washington  As negotiations continue on the 2007 Farm Bill  a key Senate Committee today adopted Senator Kent Conrads proposal to establish a disaster relief program for farmers and ranchers devastated by natural disasters  This is an exciting day  The Senate Finance Committee has passed my disaster aid proposal  We will no longer have to go hat in hand every time disaster hits farm country  Senator Conrad said  My program is also fiscally responsible  Having a relief system in place before disaster strikes  as opposed to piecing one together on a case by case basis  will save taxpayer dollars in the long run  A senior member of the Finance Committee  Senator Conrad worked with Montana Senator Max Baucus  the Chairman of the Finance Committee  to develop the comprehensive ag disaster program that will be added to the new Farm Bill  Once in place  the program will complement crop insurance and provide family farmers and ranchers the assistance needed to keep them in business in wake of a severe disaster  The Conrad proposal uses tariff revenue to set up an agriculture disaster trust fund  It covers weather related losses for all crops  including specialty crops and forage  and provides assistance to livestock producers  Most importantly  the trust fund will ensure that farmers and ranchers who are hit by natural disasters can get relief without having to wait for ad hoc emergency spending  Congress has passed numerous agriculture disaster measures  the most recent this spring after a two year effort by Senator Conrad to bring aid to ranchers and farmers in North Dakota  Senator Conrad also succeeded in securing a number of energy tax incentives in the Finance Committees funding package  The tax provisions complement Senator Conrads work on the Energy Title of the Farm Bill and will further bolster North Dakotas growing bio energy sector  The biggest industry in North Dakota is agriculture  The next biggest is energy  Today we are taking steps that will strengthen both  Senator Conrad said  In addition to serving on the Finance Committee  Senator Conrad serves as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and also serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  He will return home next week to brief North Dakotans on the status of the Farm Bill
