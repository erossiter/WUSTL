Delegation Questions Ag Secretary on FSA Closings Conrad  Dorgan Pomeroy Fight to Ensure FSA Remains Accessible to America s Farmers                    October 7  2005  Washington    U S  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy today questioned Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns about the proposed closings of Farm Service Agency  FSA  offices around the country  including several in North Dakota  Although final determinations about which offices to close have not been made  we have serious questions about how these closures will impact local communities  and whether longer travel distances will result in producers having less access to FSA and reduced quality service  the delegation wrote in the letter to Johanns  The changes proposed by USDA would close six FSA offices in North Dakota as part of a plan to eliminate 713 offices around the country  Although USDA claims that producers will have access via the Internet to the same services they currently receive in person  the delegation is skeptical of this approach  We are particularly concerned with unrealistic expectations that Web based FSA services can replace personal service  In many parts of North Dakota and rural America  Internet availability is limited and costly  Web based assistance is a poor substitute for the kind of face to face personal assistance our farmers and ranchers depend on  There are additional concerns with the transition time to a Web based system exemplified by FSA s on going difficulties in processing payments for the Livestock Assistance Program  LAP   which resulted from offices transitioning to a Web based system  The transition for LAP has taken a full year  leaving the delegation wondering if producers who depend on the FSA offices will be left without assistance in a similar situation  Senator Conrad is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  Senator Dorgan serves on the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the Appropriations Committee  and Rep  Pomeroy is on the Agriculture Committee in the House of Representatives  Attached below is the text of the letters sent to Johanns  October 7  2005 The Honorable Michael Johanns Secretary U S  Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave Washington  DC 20510 Dear Secretary Johanns  Recently  the USDA announced plans to close six Farm Service Agency  FSA  offices in North Dakota and a total of 713 FSA offices around the country  Although final determinations about which offices to close have not been made  we have serious questions about how these closures will impact local communities  and whether longer travel distances will result in producers having less access to FSA  and reduced quality service  Before you undertake office closures in North Dakota  we request that you provide answers to the following questions  1  What savings do you anticipate will result from closing Farm Service Agency offices in North Dakota and what are the financial impacts on other operations of the USDA  2  What analysis has been done on the added cost to producers that will result from increased distance and travel time  and additional burdens of receiving service at greater distance  3  How has the USDA evaluated the difficulty this presents to producers if they are required to go to one office for FSA assistance and another for conservation assistance through the Natural Resources Conservation Service  4  Why is USDA moving forward with an FSA consolidation plan instead of establishing a USDA Service Center plan that incorporates the need to coordinate services among agencies  5  How will you ensure that producers living in counties where offices are closed  as well as producers living in counties that will experience an increase in workload  will receive the same quality of service they currently receive from the Farm Service Agency  6  Can you assure us that this consolidation of FSA offices today is a one time occurrence  and will not lead to further staff reductions in the future  We are particularly concerned with unrealistic expectations that web based FSA services can replace personal service  In many parts of North Dakota and rural America  Internet availability is limited and costly  Web based assistance is a poor substitute for the kind of face to face personal assistance our farmers and ranchers depend on  Moreover  we are concerned that the transition to an Internet based system will not go smoothly  and that producers will be left without assistance in the interim  For example  FSA s on going difficulties in processing payments for the Livestock Assistance Program  LAP  resulted from offices transitioning to a web based system  North Dakota s farmers and ranchers cannot afford to experience the same year long delay that occurred with the LAP when they try to access the farm programs they depend on  Mr  Secretary  the Farm Service Agency  its employees  and field offices are critical components to effective and efficient delivery of programs farmers and ranchers depend on  We look forward to your response to our questions and a general explanation about how service will not be diminished by USDA s consolidation plans
