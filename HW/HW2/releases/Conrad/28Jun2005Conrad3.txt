National Energy Bill Passes Senate Conrad Secures a Dozen Provisions Benefiting ND  Creating Jobs  Boosting Industry                    June 28  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad cast his vote today for a national energy bill that takes steps toward greater energy independence for the United States and promotes substantial investment in North Dakota s energy sector  I m committed to developing a national plan for greater energy independence    a plan that makes North Dakota an energy leader  Senator Conrad said  This bill lays the groundwork for that goal  But still  bolder steps must be taken to make the U S  more energy independent  The comprehensive legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 85 to 12  It included many energy tax provisions authored by Senator Conrad that would increase the development of North Dakota s energy industry  For example  Senator Conrad included incentives in the bill that will increase the use of renewable energy  make North Dakota s coal burning plants cleaner  make it easier for utilities to invest in needed transmission lines  and promote greater efficiency for existing oil wells  A senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad crafted 12 energy tax incentives that were included in the legislation  including  Three Year Extension of the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit  North Dakota is ranked number one in the nation in potential wind power production  One of Senator Conrad s most important energy policy goals is to develop North Dakota s potential for this cheap  clean  natural source of energy  To that end  Senator Conrad secured a three year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit and a mandate that electric utilities produce 10 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020  Clean Coal Tax Credits  The earth underneath North Dakota contains enough lignite coal to generate electricity for more than 800 years  Senator Conrad included a provision in the Energy Bill that provides tax credits for power utility companies that use clean coal technology  Senator Conrad s measure would strengthen North Dakota s lignite coal sector  an industry that has created some of the best paying jobs in the state  In addition  the Energy Bill includes a loan guarantee to build a zero emissions lignite fired power plant in North Dakota  Ethanol and Biodiesel Tax Credits  Ethanol and biodiesel carry tremendous potential to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil  They also offer tremendous economic potential for North Dakota  which is home to many fuel producing crops  Senator Conrad secured an assortment of tax credits in the Energy Bill to encourage the production of these renewable fuels  In another provision  Senator Conrad created a credit for ethanol plants that install pollution control equipment  giving North Dakota s ethanol industry greater incentive to expand while still meeting federal air standards  Senator Conrad also won a commitment to clarify an Internal Revenue Service regulation in order to make North Dakota biodiesel blenders eligible for the biodiesel tax credit  Senator Conrad also helped secure a Renewable Fuels Standard  This amendment would require the use of 8 billion gallons of renewable fuels  like biodiesel and ethanol  by 2012  The amendment would increase demand for many of North Dakota s fuel producing crops  Expanded Existing Ethanol Tax Credit  Senator Conrad expanded an existing tax credit for ethanol to include larger scale production facilities  As a result  additional North Dakota ethanol manufacturing plants will be eligible for the credit    encouraging the production of this renewable energy source  Coal to Liquid Fuel Federal Loan Guarantees  As the price of oil increases  coal to liquid fuel is becoming a more attractive option in coal rich states like North Dakota  Senator Conrad secured a provision in the Energy Bill to ensure that any future facilities that produce transportation fuel from coal in North Dakota will qualify for federal loan guarantees  Renewable Energy  Clean Coal Credit Bonds for Co Ops and Public Power Plants  This Conrad provision provides new sources of investment capital and financing to membership co ops and public power systems  allowing them to pay the costs of upgrades  maintenance and service expansion  Enhanced Oil Recovery Tax Credit  Concerned about the impact of high fuel prices  Senator Conrad drafted a provision to increase the tax credit for the use of carbon dioxide to recover more oil from existing wells  The measure could increase oil production and lead to decreased carbon dioxide emissions from North Dakota power plants  In addition  the Energy Bill includes  30 million to develop 10 demonstration sites in the Williston basin to test the use of carbon dioxide in increasing oil well production  Investment in North Dakota s Transmission Capacity  Senator Conrad has taken action to make sure that rural electric consumers continue to receive cheap  reliable power  He secured a tax incentive to help utilities invest in electricity transmission and pollution control  This will foster a growing demand for North Dakota s energy resources and help keep our air clean  We are facing serious problems that threaten America s energy independence  Senator Conrad said  While this bill does not solve the entire problem  it is a first step in increasing the development of domestic sources of energy  many of which we have to offer in North Dakota
