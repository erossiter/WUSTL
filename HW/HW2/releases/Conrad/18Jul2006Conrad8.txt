Conrad Honors Patriot Guard Riders Senator Recognizes Group for Supporting Families of Fallen Soldiers                   July 18  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad introduced a Senate resolution today  honoring the Patriot Guard Riders  a national organization whose members attend  the funeral services of fallen American soldiers to protect grieving families  from protesters  America s fallen soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation   They deserve our utmost honor and respect as they are laid to rest  Senator  Conrad said  We should honor those who guard our fallen soldiers  the Patriot  Guard Riders  Since being formed in 2005  the Patriot Guard Riders have attended military  funerals across the nation  Many in the group of more than 45 000 are also  military veterans  Members of the radical Westboro Baptist Church are known to picket military  funerals to reflect their belief that the deaths of U S  soldiers are God s  punishment for the United States  tolerance of homosexuality  Patriot Guard members attend funerals after being invited by the family of a  fallen soldier  At funerals they form a human wall to shield the grieving family  from protesters  The Patriot Guard Riders hold up large American flags to cover  picket signs and rev the engines of their motorcycles to drown out the chanting  of protesters  Last month  Senator Conrad attended funeral services in Fargo for Michael  Hermanson  a North Dakota soldier killed in Iraq  Protestors from the Westboro  Baptist Church tried to disrupt the funeral but more than 150 members of the  Patriot Guard were on hand to protect the sanctity of the services  I was  appalled by the behavior of protesters who used the funeral to convey their  hatred for our soldiers and their families  Senator Conrad said  Earlier this month  Senator Conrad attended the funeral of Paul Beyer in  Jamestown where the Patriot Guard again provided a buffer between those grieving  the loss of the young soldier and the out of state groups who shouted at the  funeral goers and held up signs with extraordinarily vicious messages  Upon returning to Washington  Senator Conrad began work on the Senate  Resolution honoring the Patriot Guard Riders  He also supported an amendment to  prohibit demonstrations at the funerals of all deceased members of the Armed  Forces  not only at national cemeteries  but also at private cemeteries  funeral  homes and houses of worship  All across the nation  and right here in North Dakota  Patriot Guard Riders  are protecting mourning families from further hurt  For that  they deserve our  sincere gratitude  Senator Conrad said
