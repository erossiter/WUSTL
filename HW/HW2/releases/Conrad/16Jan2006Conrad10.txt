hearing of the U S  Senate Budget Committee at North Dakota State University today to discuss ways to fight the spread of methamphetamine use in North Dakota and across the United States  Meth abuse is spreading like wildfire and we need to respond  Senator Conrad said  Congress needs to better understand that this deadly drug spreading across America has become a national epidemic  That s why today s hearing is so important  I intend to share the testimonies and stories I ve heard today with my colleagues in Congress  They need to know how meth is devastating lives and destroying our communities  Senator Conrad  the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  chaired the field hearing in response to cuts in federal programs combating the spread of meth  Among those testifying at the hearing were  Drew Wrigley  U S  Attorney  Wayne Stenehjem  North Dakota Attorney General  Keith Ternes  Interim Police Chief  Fargo  and Karin Walton  Program Director of the North Dakota University System Consortium for Substance Abuse Prevention  Clearly  preventing drug use and the related consequences is not something that any one entity can handle alone  Walton testified  There need to be resources available to continue efforts that have been successful in North Dakota in reducing access to products that contribute to the manufacturing of meth  increase law enforcement to support penalties for possession  and the development of affordable treatment  At today s hearing  Senator Conrad called for Congress to pass his Combat Meth Act  This bill focuses on providing millions of additional dollars for law enforcement and imposing national restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine  a key ingredient in meth commonly found in cold medicine  The Senate approved this legislation last year  and Senator Conrad is seeking full approval by Congress  Currently  the Combat Meth Act has 48 co sponsors in the Senate  It is crucial that we pass the Combat Meth Act  so we can coordinate local  state and federal agencies to fight trafficking of this deadly drug  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad recently helped establish the Senate Anti Meth Caucus  a bi partisan group of Senators dedicated to stopping the spread of meth  The specific provisions of the Combat Meth Act include  Provide an additional  15 million under the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program to train law enforcement  This funding will provide state and local law enforcement resources to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine offenders  Expand the methamphetamine hot spots program  This program will make funds available for personnel and equipment for enforcement  prosecution and environmental clean up  Provide  5 million to hire additional federal prosecutors and train local prosecutors in state and federal meth laws  Cross designate local prosecutors as Special Assistant U S  Attorneys  This provision allows local prosecutors to bring legal action against cooks and traffickers in federal courts under tougher guidelines  Restrict the sale of necessary ingredient to make meth  The nationwide initiative will amend the Controlled Substances Act to limit and record the sale of medicines containing pseudoephedrine by placing them behind the pharmacy counter  Set a limit of 7 5 grams month  This initiative limits the amount of products  such as cold medicines  used to make meth a person can buy and also requires his or her signature and identification to purchase them  Provide  5 million for states and businesses that legally sell ingredients used to cook meth with resources to monitor purchases of methamphetamine precursors  Provide  5 million in grant funding for Drug Endangered Children rapid response teams to promote collaboration among federal  state  and local agencies to assist and educate children that have been affected by the production of meth  Authorize  13 million to enhance treatment options  This funding will create the Methamphetamine Research  Training and Technical Assistance Center  which will research effective treatments for meth abuse and disseminate information  Create alternate procedures for stores without pharmacies and stores in rural areas  The DEA and States will now be able to develop additional procedures to continue to allow cold medicine that meet security criteria to be sold at retail stores without pharmacies and in rural areas  Establish a uniform federal standard that strengthens all existing state laws by allowing states the authority to determine appropriate penalties  Some general facts regarding meth are  Methamphetamine is an addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system and has a high potential for abuse and addiction  Use of meth can result in strokes  heart attacks and psychotic and violent behavior  Meth Labs  Meth is easily made in home laboratories with commonly found ingredients such as anhydrous ammonia  found on farms  pseudoephedrine  found in cold medicines  and red phosphorous  the substance on the tip of a matchstick  In 1997  one meth lab in North Dakota was seized  That number steadily increased to 297 in 2003  In 2005  the number of meth labs busted decreased to 190  Meth Trafficking  It is estimated that 95  of meth trafficked into North Dakota comes from outside of the state  Arrests involving meth  During the 2003 fiscal year  the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  made 5 766 arrests for meth  representing more than one fifth of all DEA drug arrests  Capt  Al Hanson of the Minot Police Department recently estimated that more than 60 percent of the inmates now in the State Penitentiary and the Ward County Jail are there because of meth  Meth abuse among children  According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  approximately 11 7 million Americans ages 12 and older have tried meth at least once  In addition  a recent survey by the National Association of Counties found that 54  of responding counties in North Dakota reported a growth in out of home placements of children because of meth in 2005  Treatment  The number of people seeking treatment for meth abuse in the U S  increased from 20 776 in 1993 to 116 604 in 2003  In 2005  22  of those treated at private ND drug treatment centers had problems related to meth
