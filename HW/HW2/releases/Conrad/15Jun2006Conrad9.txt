Conrad Bill Opens New Markets For ND Beef Senator s Bill Benefits Farmers  Ranchers  Businesses and Consumers                   June 15  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad introduced bipartisan legislation today to  open new markets for small businesses producing meat and poultry products and  promote North Dakota s  740 million cattle industry  Senator Conrad s legislation  the Agriculture Small Business Enhancement Act  of 2006  would repeal a 39 year old law that banned interstate shipments of  state inspected meat and poultry products  Currently only federally inspected  plants are allowed to ship meat and poultry between states  This ban doesn t protect the consumer  it only stifles competition in the  marketplace and penalizes small business owners and their employees  Senator  Conrad said  Interstate shipment will spur more competition in the industry   give farmers and ranchers more opportunities to sell their livestock at a better  price and ultimately provide consumers with more choices in the supermarket  The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1967 and the Poultry Products Inspection  Act of 1968 required all state meat and poultry inspection programs to be equal  to or exceed federal standards  But the food safety legislation also prohibited  the sale of these products in interstate commerce  North Dakota s Meat and Poultry Inspection Program has grown to 15 companies  in just the past few years  said North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Roger  Johnson  This new legislation would dramatically increase the market for their  products and would likely inspire other North Dakota entrepreneurs to establish  meat processing operations  The Conrad legislation  which is cosponsored by Utah Republican Orrin Hatch  is supported by a broad based coalition of agricultural and farm organizations  including the North Dakota Stockmen s Association  North Dakota Farmers Union   and the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture  These state plants  in North Dakota and across the nation  already have  the highest safety standards  Allowing them to broaden their market and ship  their products interstate will only increase economic opportunities and expand  rural development benefiting both the community and the consumer  Senator  Conrad said  Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  which oversees  farm and ranch policy  as well as the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees  trade
