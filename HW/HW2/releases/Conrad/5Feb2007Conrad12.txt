Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on Release of President s FY 2008 Budget                    February 5  2007  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today regarding the release of President Bush s budget plan for Fiscal Year 2008  which will begin Oct  1  The President s budget is filled with debt and deception  disconnected from reality  and continues to move America in the wrong direction  This administration has the worst fiscal record in history and this budget does nothing to change that  The President is trying to wrap himself in the mantle of fiscal rectitude  showing a budget that claims to reach balance by 2012  But this is achieved only by leaving out large expenses  While the President has done a better job this year of accounting for near term war costs  his budget again fails to include full out year war costs or the cost of Alternative Minimum Tax reform beyond 2007  And the budget again assumes cuts in domestic programs  without specifying where these cuts are to occur beyond 2008  The President has also missed an historic opportunity to reach out to Democrats and work with a new Congress to address the nation s long term fiscal problems  Our long term imbalance has significantly worsened since President Bush took office  yet his budget offers no credible options for putting us back on a sustainable path  The President has chosen again to reject compromise and stay the course  The truth is that putting our fiscal house back in order will require tough choices  a bipartisan effort  and real Presidential leadership  I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the White House to find a bipartisan solution and get the job done  For North Dakota  the President s delivers mixed news  Agriculture The President s budget undermines the current Farm Bill by cutting funds for safety net commodity programs and crop insurance by a combined  14 billion over 10 years  Veterans The Bush budget recommends an increase of  2 5 billion for medical care in FY08  The budget also includes annual enrollment fees and an increase in the prescription co payment from  8 to  15 for a 30 day supply of medications for certain veterans  Health The President s budget calls for  76 billion in Medicare cuts over the next five years  North Dakota s hospitals stand to lose more than  25 million  The Health Outreach Grant Program  which has delivered more than  10 million to North Dakota since it was founded  was completely eliminated  In addition  the FLEX Program was once again eliminated   it has provided  3 1 million to North Dakota s Critical Access Hospitals since 1999  Finally  the Rural and Community Access to Emergency Devices program was eliminated  This program placed more than 440 vital medical devices in 130 North Dakota communities  Homeland Security The President s budget cuts  450 million from homeland security grants to states  a 50 percent reduction  Last year  North Dakota received more than  10 million in homeland security grants  Justice The President s budget eliminates  170 million from Byrne Justice Assistance Grants  which are used to combat methamphetamine abuse  and slashes funding for the COPS program by 94 percent  The most recent statistics indicate that North Dakota received  730 000 in Byrne grants  and  197 446 for COPS in FY06  The President s budget also cuts  5 million from the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas  HIDTA  program  In 2006  North Dakota received  563 092 in HIDTA funding to fight the drug problems affecting North Dakota  particularly methamphetamine abuse  Defense The President allocated funding to make Grand Forks Air Force Base the second Main Operating Base for Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs   The budget includes  877 million for the procurement of five new Global Hawk aircraft and  278 million for 24 new Predator UAVs  While the budget continues to fund the modernization of the current B 52 force  it only includes funding for 56 of the nation s 94 bombers  Earlier  Congress passed legislation blocking the reduction of the B 52 fleet below 76 active aircraft  The President s budget also includes  505 million for upgrades to the nation s Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile  ICBM  force   150 of which are based at Minot Air Force Base  Finally  the budget includes a total of  314 million for research and development of the next generation of air refueling tankers  The Grand Forks Air Force Base is home to the 319th Air Refueling Wing  which flies and maintains 38 KC 135 Stratotankers  Military Construction The President s budget allocates  18 2 million to Minot Air Force Base for new housing and dorm modernization  Fargo s Hector Field would receive  1 6 million for construction of facilities related to Predator UAV operations  Education The President is seeking  2 3 billion in cuts to education  Vital programs such as the Impact Aid  Safe and Drug Free Schools  and Vocational Education would suffer setbacks  On a positive note  the budget would raise the Pell Grant maximum for students to  4 600 next year  and to  5 400 over the next five years  North Dakota received  37 million in Pell Grants in FY06  But the budget would eliminate Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  SEOG  and Perkins Loans  North Dakota is expected to receive  2 8 million in SEOG funds in FY07  Energy The President calls for a 46 percent increase in the Clean Coal Power Initiative  However  the President s budget also calls for a 24 percent cut in Rural Utilities Service loans to rural electric cooperatives  This program is important to rural electric cooperatives in North Dakota  In FY06  North Dakota received  182 8 million in loans to rural electric cooperatives  This year s budget proposal also cuts funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  by 43 percent from the FY06 funding level  More than 45 000 North Dakotans receive LIHEAP payments  with the state receiving  24 7 million in federal LIHEAP funds in FY06  Housing The Administration is seeking to cut the Community Development Block Grant formula program to  2 98 billion  In FY06

facility  Transportation The Essential Air Service program  which underwrites passenger service to North Dakota s cities  is funded at  50 million in the President s budget  The request under funds the EAS program  which subsidized 18 000 flights in North Dakota last year  In addition  Amtrak is cut from  1 1 billion in FY07 estimated funding to a proposed  900 million in FY08  Long distance routes  like the Empire Builder  would likely be eliminated at this level of funding  Last year  more than 114 000 passengers traveled on Amtrak in North Dakota  Water The President s budget brings bad news for North Dakota s municipal  rural  and industrial water supply projects  The budget cuts the development of these water supply projects by 27 percent from this year s anticipated funding level  This decrease will severely hurt efforts to deliver safe drinking water to thousands of people across North Dakota
