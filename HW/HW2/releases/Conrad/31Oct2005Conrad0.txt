Days After Tariff Threat  Japan Signals It May Open Market U S  Beef Producers Losing  3 14 Billion Annually Under Japanese Ban                    October 31  2005  Fargo    Just days after Senator Kent Conrad introduced legislation that would levy tariffs against Japanese goods if Japan fails to lift its ban on U S  beef  Japanese food safety officials signaled they may be willing to reopen their market  This is a victory for our beef producers  and it shows that the United States can win trade disputes if we re willing to fight  Senator Conrad said  Our threat of tariffs showed the Japanese that we are willing as a nation to stand up for ourselves  I m hopeful now that the Japanese government will follow through and reopen what is a critical market to our producers  Japan s Food Safety Commission announced Monday that American beef was at low risk of mad cow disease  Last Wednesday  Senator Conrad introduced legislation he had co authored with Senator Pat Roberts  Republican of Kansas  to levy as much as  3 14 billion in annual tariffs against Japanese goods  More than 20 senators  including Senator Saxby Chambliss  R Ga   Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee  joined as co sponsors  The  3 14 billion figure amounts to what ranchers and other beef producers say is the amount they lose on an annual basis due to direct export losses in the Japanese market and to price losses due to a glutted U S  domestic market  The timeline for Japan moving on opening their market is unclear  I expect that we will continue to consider our legislation as long as the ban remains in place  Senator Conrad said  However  I d welcome this sign by our trading partners to relax a ban that the World Trade Organization would rule illegal
