Conrad Briefs Community on Future of Minot Air Base Pentagon Review Poses Risk  Community Must Remain Vigilant  Senator says                    August 10  2005  Minot  Senator Kent Conrad briefed community leaders and members of the Task Force 21 base retention committee today on his efforts to maintain America s nuclear missile force  including the 150 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBM  controlled by Minot Air Force Base  Senator Conrad also announced plans to convene a summit meeting this fall to prepare for a Pentagon evaluation of the U S  missile force  Our nation continues to face real threats  many of which I believe are deterred by the strength of our missile force  Senator Conrad said  Maintaining these missiles is key to deterring aggression from rogue nations and other potential adversaries  The Pentagon is currently undergoing what is known as the Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR   a process in which the Defense Department undergoes a top to bottom appraisal of its war fighting ability  Senator Conrad has learned from high level military sources that this review may recommend reductions in the nation s 500 ICBM missile force  Every serious study of the missile force over the last decade has reaffirmed the fact that a force of 500 ICBMs is critical to the nation s defense  I don t think now is the time to change that  Senator Conrad said  But the biggest risk to Minot is that the QDR report may recommend reductions in the total ICBM force  Minot AFB is the nation s only dual nuclear mission installation  hosting B 52 bombers as well as controlling 150 Minuteman III missiles spread across North Dakota s northwestern landscape  In an effort to protect America s missile force  Senator Conrad has drafted legislation to affirm that it is U S  policy to maintain a force of 500 ICBMs  In addition  Senator Conrad is convening a bipartisan coalition of U S  Senators and Congressman from states hosting ICBMs to prepare for the QDR  Key decisions regarding the QDR are expected to be made in September and October  with a final report to Congress due in February with the President s budget submission  North Dakota s air bases are in a strong position coming out of the BRAC  We have the bombers and missiles here in Minot  We will have Predators and Global Hawks in Grand Forks  And we re working towards a new manned flying mission for the Hooligans  Senator Conrad said  But we can t stop now  We need to remain vigilant on the QDR
