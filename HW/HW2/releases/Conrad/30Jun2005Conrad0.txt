CAFTA Should Be Defeated  Conrad Says North Dakota Senator Says CAFTA A Bad Deal For United States                    June 30  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad said today that he will cast his vote against the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  and urged his colleagues in the U S  Senate to defeat a deal that will balloon the trade deficit and devastate the domestic sugar industry  I support free trade that opens markets and that benefits America s farmers  businesses and workers  Senator Conrad said  But I have come to the conclusion that our trade policy is not working  This is not a free trade policy  This is not a fair trade policy  This is a failed trade policy  During a Senate floor debate on CAFTA  Senator Conrad said  This is the wrong agreement at the wrong time  It adds more than  110 million to our trade deficit in the region  it puts the  7 billion American sugar industry at risk  and it means little or no gain for our country s economy  In his floor speech  Senator Conrad said that the U S  trade deficit is expected to grow to  700 billion this year  At the same time  the U S  International Trade Commission reported that CAFTA s impact on the nation s Gross Domestic Product was too low to register  The combined economic activity of the countries in CAFTA is equivalent to that of Columbus  Ohio  Not only will CAFTA add to our trade deficit with the region  the U S  International Trade Commission says it will add nothing    zero    to the Gross Domestic Product of the United States  Zero is a very low number  Senator Conrad said  We keep signing these agreements that are supposed to benefit our country  and our position keeps getting worse  Under CAFTA  Central American nations and the Dominican Republic would be able to send 109 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States annually  With talks underway to negotiate bilateral trade deals with Thailand  South Africa and the Andean nations  that provision would eventually allow as much as 500 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States  In addition  USDA now projects that Mexico could increase its sugar exports to the United States this year by as much as 650 000 tons  Between Mexico and the CAFTA precedent  we re facing more than a million tons of new sugar imports  Senator Conrad said  CAFTA would trade away an entire industry that employs 146 000 people in the United States  an industry that means  2 billion in the Red River Valley  This is a failed trade policy
