Conrad Seeks to Make Rural Doctor Program Permanent Underserved Areas Get Medical Professionals with Conrad State 30                    March 16  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad introduced bipartisan legislation that would permanently reauthorize the Conrad State 30 program  a popular initiative that allows foreign born physicians who study in the United States to remain in the country to practice medicine in underserved areas  Rural clinics and hospitals in North Dakota and other rural states in our country are in a constant struggle to find and keep good doctors  Senator Conrad said  If we can make the Conrad State 30 permanent  we will be preserving an effort that has helped countless children and families in rural America get quality health care  Senator Sam Brownback  Republican of Kansas  is the Senate co sponsor of the legislation  introduced late Wednesday  A similar bill is expected to be introduced soon in the House of Representatives  where it will be co sponsored by Reps  Jerry Moran  Republican of Kansas  and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota  The Senate bill has been added to broader immigration legislation that the Senate is expected to consider later this spring  Senator Conrad created the State 30 program in 1994 in an effort to help rural communities attract doctors  The program has proven to be extremely successful  having recently placed more than 1 000 doctors in underserved communities across the nation in a single year  Without a State 30 doctor nearby  routine health care would be out of reach for many people  Senator Conrad said  That is unacceptable  Like anyone else in this country  people in rural America deserve quality  accessible health care  The State 30 program gives rural hospitals and clinics a chance at finding and keeping good doctors  The American Hospital Association has estimated that more than 20 million Americans live in areas where there is a lack of physicians  The Health Policy Institute forecasts a shortfall of 200 000 physicians by 2020  In order to receive the Conrad State 30 waiver  the physician undergoes numerous background and security checks  and must agree to serve a medically underserved community for three years  If he or she fails to fulfill the three year commitment  the physician is subject to immediate deportation  In exchange for their service  the doctors are granted a waiver to a provision normally requiring them to return to their home countries for two years before immigrating to the U S
