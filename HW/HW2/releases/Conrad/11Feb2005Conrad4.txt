Conrad  USDA Misstep May Block Rule Senator Says Ag Dept Failed To Properly Notify Congress                    February 11  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today said that the U S  Department of Agriculture failed to properly notify Congress of its intent to open the Canadian border to beef trade    a procedural misstep that should delay implementation of the controversial plan  Senator Conrad found out about the Agriculture Department s failure to follow the law for rulemaking when he sought to file a resolution of disapproval that would overturn the USDA rule to open the border  We were promised by USDA that they had followed the letter of the law in writing this rule  We found out they had not followed the law when we attempted to file this  resolution of disapproval   Senator Conrad said  It is our belief that they cannot enact this rule until they go through the process that is required by law  This is a good development  The evidence is strong that Canada is failing to protect both consumers and the American beef industry  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  has urged Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to reconsider the minimal risk ruling  citing Canada s feed ban violations  USDA has been unwilling to review its ruling  A series of Canadian newspaper reports recently cited government tests that discovered animal tissue in more than half the vegetable only cattle feed  This raises questions as to whether rules designed to prevent the feeding of cattle remains to other cattle  the primary way in which mad cow disease is spread  are being routinely violated in Canada  Senator Conrad s resolution of disapproval was cosponsored by Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Harry Reid  D NV   Craig Thomas  R WY   Pete Domenici  R NM   Max Baucus  D MT   Ken Salazar  D CO   Tim Johnson  D SD   and Jeff Bingaman  D NM
