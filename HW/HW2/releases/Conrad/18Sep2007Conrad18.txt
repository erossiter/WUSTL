Conrad Launches Bipartisan Task Force to Tackle Fiscal Challenges  Team is Critical to Safeguarding the Nation s Economic Health   Senator says                   September 18  2007  Washington   Senators Kent Conrad  D ND  and Judd Gregg  R NH   chairman and ranking member  respectively  of the Senate Budget Committee  today joined forces to offer a blueprint for prompting swift  bipartisan action to substantially improve the nations long term fiscal condition  Our nation faces a fiscal challenge of unprecedented proportions  said Chairman Conrad  We cannot ignore the coming crisis and hope that future leaders will solve this problem  The longer we wait  the harder the choices become  We refuse to hand this problem off to yet another outside commission  The time for action is now  With our legislation  we have a chance to adopt a bipartisan plan that will assure American economic security for generations to come  The retirement of the Baby Boomers will seriously exacerbate a problem that has been building for years  said Senator Gregg  Now is the time to address the unsustainable shortfall between our expected revenues and the trillions we know we will be spending for federal health and retirement programs  A bipartisan effort to find solutions  which will be fast tracked through Congress and guaranteed an up or down vote  is the best approach to ensuring that future generations inherit a government they can afford  not one that will bankrupt them  The Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2007 establishes a 16 member task force comprised of eight Democrats and eight Republicans  designated by Congressional leaders and the President  Fourteen members of the task force will be current Members of Congress  and the remaining two members will be from the current Administration  The Secretary of the Treasury will chair the task force  The task force will review all aspects of the current and long term financial condition of the federal government  It will identify factors that jeopardize the governments long term fiscal balance  or that create a gap between expected federal revenues and spending  It will analyze all potential solutions  and make legislative recommendations to Congress and the President on how to substantially improve the long term fiscal balance in a report due December 9  2008  To ensure the bipartisanship of the recommendations  at least three quarters of the task force  or 12 members  must agree to them before the report can be submitted  Once Congress receives the recommendations as a legislative proposal  it must be fast tracked to final consideration in both the Senate and House  Final passage of the bill requires a supermajority in each chamber  three fifths of the Senate and three fifths of the House  which is intended to ensure strong bipartisan support  It is critical that any solutions to our fiscal challenges be bipartisan and that both political parties are invested in the outcome  said Conrad and Gregg  This is not a simply Democratic or Republican problem  but one that impacts all Americans  so the solutions should reflect that  Our task force will create an environment where the members can work together to find compromises that both parties can agree upon  All recommendations will require strong bipartisan support from the task force  and require supermajority support from Congress for final passage  This task force is a key first step toward putting the country back on the right fiscal path  and we hope that our colleagues will join us in this effort
