company  to develop vaccines that can protect military personnel against high priority biological threats such as botulinum toxin  Ebola and Marburg viruses  and influenza virus  Electronics and Materials for Flexible Sensors and Transponders   3 million  This funding will be used by NDSU to employ state of the art materials and manufacturing processes to design and create prototypes of flexible  low cost  disposable radio frequency sensors and transponders  Such components can be used covertly in the war on terrorism  Advanced Fouling and Corrosion Control Coatings   2 million  This funding will be used by NDSUs Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering to help develop environmentally compliant coatings to protect ships against fouling and corrosion  This will save the Navy hundreds of millions of dollars per year in maintenance and fuel costs  Autonomous Border and Intrusion Surveillance Sensor Networks    2 million  This funding will be used by Pedigree Technologies  a Fargo based company  to develop technology that will significantly improve the militarys ability to monitor borders and facilities in remote areas  Detecting and Inhibiting Corrosion on Army Vehicles   1 5 million  This funding will be used by NDSU and Turtle Mountain Manufacturing  a Native American owned company in North Dakota  for a project aimed at extending the life of Army vehicles  Researchers will work to develop novel ways to detect corrosion in military vehicles before it is visible  as well as to find ways to replace the old coatings now used with more effective corrosion
