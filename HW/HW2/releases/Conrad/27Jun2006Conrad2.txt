Bipartisan Flag Protection Act Secures Conrad Vote                    June 27  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad voted today for a bipartisan bill  protecting the American flag    legislation which includes a ban on political  demonstrations at all military funerals    but voted against a Constitutional  amendment on the flag  I voted in support of bipartisan legislation that would make it a crime to  desecrate the flag  Senator Conrad said  We can make flag desecration a  federal crime under this bipartisan bill  We don t need to rewrite the  Constitution  The First Amendment has served our nation for more than 200 years  and I m opposed to changing that now  The statute has won endorsements by a range of law experts who believe it  would prevail in a challenge to whether it is Constitutional  As personally repugnant as I find desecration of the flag  it is my view  that we ought to exhaust all possible alternatives before we decide to rewrite  the Bill of Rights and the Constitution  Senator Conrad said  The bipartisan bill includes a provision that would expand the scope of the  Respect for America s Fallen Heroes Act  which prohibits demonstrations at and  around national cemeteries  The amendment would broaden the ban to the funerals  of all deceased members of the Armed Forces  not only at national cemeteries   but also at private cemeteries  funeral homes and houses of worship  Senator Conrad attended funeral services last month in Fargo for Michael  Hermanson  a North Dakota soldier killed in Iraq  Protestors from a Kansas  church had tried to disrupt that funeral  I was disgusted by the twisted message of hate that these protestors brought  to what was a somber time for a family to grieve  Senator Conrad said  It s  appalling that families of our fallen would have to endure that  and that is why  I am supporting this bill
