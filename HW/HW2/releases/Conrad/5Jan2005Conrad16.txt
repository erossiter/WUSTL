Conrad Questions Ag Nominee on Cattle Ban FDA Alerts on Canadian Cattle Raise Safety Concerns  Senator Says                   January 5  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad urged Gov  Michael Johanns  Agriculture Secretary nominee  to reconsider the administration s decision to allow cattle imports from Canada in light of evidence that Canada is not effectively enforcing its rules designed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease  Senator Conrad detailed his concern in a letter to Johanns released today  Senator Conrad was joined on the letter by Congressman Henry Waxman  of California  The joint Conrad Waxman letter raises evidence that Canada s efforts to prevent the mad cow disease have not been effective  The letter refers to the FDA import alerts  documents by Canadian regulators and Canadian inspections citing problems with that nation s control over contaminated feed  Senator Conrad specifically asks Johanns to consult with the FDA and Canadian regulatory authorities before going ahead with plans to reopen the Canadian border Johanns is to appear before the U S  Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing  Senator Conrad  who serves on the Agriculture Committee  said he intends to question Johanns at the hearing  The text of the letter follows  January 5  2005 The Honorable Michael Johanns Governor State of Nebraska Office of the Governor P O  Box 94848 Lincoln  NE 68509 4848 Dear Governor Johanns  On January 4  2005  the U S  Department of Agriculture announced that it would lift the ban on cattle imports from Canada  effective on March 7  A principal rationale for USDA s decision is that Canada has a rigorous and effective feed ban in place  which prevents the spread of mad cow disease by preventing protein derived from cattle from being fed to cattle  It appears  however  that USDA has failed to review significant evidence that calls into question the effectiveness of the Canadian feed ban  If  as expected  you are confirmed as Secretary of Agriculture  we urge you to assess this new information carefully before proceeding with the plan to reopen the U S  border to the importation of millions of Canadian cattle  We have learned that   U S  regulators have discovered animal muscle  hair  blood and bone in Canadian feed  Over the last 15 months  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has issued import alerts blocking the importation of products from 17 Canadian companies  including two of the largest feed manufacturers in the country  FDA found muscle tissue in 15 products  animal hair in five  blood in eight  and bone in two  Eight import alerts on Canadian feed are still active today   Recent tests have shown that Canadian feed often contains unanticipated animal protein  Over two thirds of samples of vegetarian animal feed manufactured in Canada and recently tested by the Canadian regulators contained undeclared animal materials  In an internal memo  a senior regulator called the test results worrisome   Major noncompliance with Canadian feed rules persists  Recent inspections have revealed that seven Canadian feed mills had major non compliance issues  and three were failing to prevent contamination of  feeds  In one recent case  potentially contaminated feed was consumed by cattle   Canada recognizes gaps in its own feed ban  On December 10  2004  Canadian regulators concluded that the current framework provides opportunities for prohibited proteins to be accidentally included in or cross contaminate feeds  Canada then proposed changes to its feed ban  These findings  which are discussed in detail in the attachments to this letter  have significant implications  The recent discovery of another case of mad cow disease in Canada underscores the potential risk of inadequate measures to prevent the spread of the disease  If Canada s feed ban is not effective  then Canada does not qualify as a minimal risk country under the new definition put forward by USDA  and the importation of Canadian cattle cannot resume  It is imperative that these issues be thoroughly investigated before authorizing Canadian imports  For these reasons  we urge you to consult with FDA about the import alerts against Canadian feed suppliers and assess their implications for the effectiveness of the Canadian feed ban  We also urge you to review the Canadian documents questioning industry s compliance with the feed ban and to talk to Canadian officials about the limitations of their current feed ban  After undertaking this investigation  we urge you to appear before Congress to communicate your findings  Sincerely  Kent Conrad U S  Senator Henry A  Waxman Ranking Minority Member Committee on Government Reform U S  House of Representatives Attachment 1  New Evidence Raises Questions about Cattle Imports from Canada On December 29  2004  USDA announced plans to permit the importation of cattle and specific beef products from countries that pose minimal risk for introducing bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE   commonly known as mad cow disease  into the United States  On January 4  2005  USDA ruled that Canada is a minimal risk country  and that Canadian imports  which were suspended after the discovery of a Canadian cow with BSE in May 2003  will resume on March 7  2005  This attachment explains USDA s new import policy and reviews the new evidence that raises questions about the effectiveness of Canada s feed ban  USDA s Minimal Risk Standard At the center of USDA s recent actions are criteria for countries to qualify as minimal risk  According to senior USDA officials  these criteria make the U S  approach consistent with the science based standards of the World Organization for Animal Health  known as the OIE  For example  Agriculture Secretary Ann M  Veneman stated  Our approach is in line with the guidelines issued by the World Organization for Animal Health  In fact  regarding measures to prevent transmission through animal feed  the USDA definition of minimal risk departs significantly from OIE standards  In the 2004 edition of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code  OIE requires that a minimal risk country with occasional cases of BSE have a feed ban that  1  prevents protein derived from ruminants  including cattle  from being fed to other ruminants and that  2  has been effectively enforced for at least 8 years  The requirement that the country effectively enforce the feed ban for eight years is stringent for two reasons  First  an effective feed ban is an essential protection against a disease that can be transmitted by the ingestion of just 1 milligram of infectious material  Second  BSE infection can remain latent inside cattle for as long as eight years  Under the OIE standard  a country assures that BSE will not spread by having an extended  effective feed ban in place  When USDA recently urged OIE to change the standard to five years  this proposal was rejected  The new USDA approach to minimal risk does not require countries to have an effective feed ban in place for eight years as OIE requires  USDA requires only the existence of a feed ban that is in place and is effectively enforced  This feed ban must  at a minimum  be equivalent in scope to the feed ban in place in the United States  This equivalency standard applies even to countries such as Canada  which has now experienced three indigenous cases of BSE  compared to none in the United States  USDA has justified its departure from the OIE approach on the grounds of flexibility  The Department chose to adopt an integrated approach to evaluating the BSE status of a country  that  considers the length of a feed ban within the context of all control measures in place  The absence of a set time period provides considerable discretion for USDA  The Canadian Decision Earlier this week  USDA exercised this discretion to classify Canada as a country at minimal risk of introducing BSE into the United States  Contrary to the OIE standards  Canada has not had a feed ban in effect for eight years  The Canadian feed ban was implemented in August 1997  seven and a half years ago  and was followed by a grace period       to allow feeds in the marketplace manufactured pre ban to clear the system  Prior to the ban  appropriate feed practices were not in place  Indeed  Canadian regulators have concluded that a dairy cow was likely infected with BSE soon after its birth in April 1997  This cow was identified six years later in Washington State  Aside from the duration of the Canadian feed ban  there are significant questions about its enforcement  In deciding to re open U S  borders to millions of Canadian cattle  USDA characterized the enforcement of the Canadian feed ban as rigorous and effective  There is mounting evidence  which USDA apparently did not review that conflicts with these findings  The New Evidence To evaluate the Canadian feed ban  USDA appears to have relied principally on two documents  The first is Canada s BSE risk assessment  which was published in December 2002  USDA characterizes this document as showing high levels of compliance with the feed ban by routine inspections of both renderers and feed mills  In fact  Canada s risk assessment showed that in 1999  of 65 feed mills inspected  20  31   were not in compliance  including four that did not have written procedures to prevent contamination of feed  In 2000  108 feed mills were inspected  of which 38  35   were not in compliance  including 14 that did not have written procedures to prevent contamination  USDA also cited a July 30  2004  memo from Canada s chief veterinarian to Dr  John Griffen  deputy administrator of USDA s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  USDA described the memo as indicating that   W ith respect to the Canadian commercial feed industry  non compliance of immediate concern has been identified in fewer than two percent of feed mills inspected during the period April 1  2003  to March 31  2004  Those instances of noncompliance of immediate concern are dealt with when identified  USDA explained that noncompliance of  immediate concern  includes cases where prohibited materials contaminate feed  The Department did not disclose the amount of feed involved or how problems have been dealt with  The Department also has neither released the June 30  2004  memo to the public nor provided complete information about compliance with the feed ban from 2001 to 2004  Recently  evidence has emerged to suggest that USDA s assessment of the Canadian feed ban may be mistaken  Three developments in particular raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the ban  Import alerts  On several occasions since October 2003  and most recently on August 24  2004  FDA has issued formal import alerts that permit the detention of animal feed that could cause the spread of BSE in the United States  These alerts  which are based upon random sampling and analysis       for the presence of animal tissues  have repeatedly cited feed made by Canadian companies  FDA has found muscle tissue in 15 Canadian products  animal hair in five  including bovine hair or apparent bovine hair in two cases   blood in eight  and bone in two  Over the last 15 months  FDA has cited products from 17 Canadian companies  including some of the largest feed producers in the country  A summary of these import alerts is included as Attachment 2  To be removed from FDA s import alert list  companies must show corrective actions  including  at a minimum  a description of the current processes being used to prevent contamination and verification that the processes are adequate  But not all Canadian companies have apparently been able to meet this standard  Nine import alerts on animal feed because of BSE risk are still active today  eight are against feed companies based in Canada  Contaminated vegetarian feed  On December 16  2004  the Vancouver Sun reported that secret tests by Canadian regulators of 20 of 28 samples of vegetarian animal feed manufactured in Canada contained undeclared animal materials  The tests found that more than half of all samples of feed used in Canada were contaminated  In an internal memo  a senior government regulator called the test results worrisome  In response to this disclosure  Canadian officials stated that the tests did not prove the presence of dangerous animal proteins  such as those derived from cattle   However  according to the Vancouver Sun  Canada decided against conducting additional testing that may have determined whether the contamination was from cattle protein  Additional problems with enforcement of the feed ban have also recently come to light  According to the Vancouver Sun  another memo written by a senior Canadian regulator stated that more than one in five Canadian feed mills continue to be out of compliance with the feed ban requirements  The Vancouver Sun also reported that in 2003  seven facilities were found to have major noncompliance  including three that were failing to prevent the contamination of cattle feed  In one of these cases  the contaminated feed was actually consumed by cattle  Canada s own assessment  On December 10  2004  the Canadian Food Inspection Agency  Canada s food safety agency  proposed changes to its feed ban  In explaining the need for these changes  the agency described gaps in its current approach  In a section of the proposal called vulnerabilities of current feed ban regulatory framework  the agency stated that the current framework provides opportunities for prohibited proteins to be accidentally included in or cross contaminate feeds for ruminants  The agency explained that assessing compliance with the current feed ban remains difficult because of the absence of definitive testing methods  The agency also found that opportunities for misuse of feed on farms with multiple species represent an area of vulnerability  The agency concluded that  t he present feed ban might have been acceptable without the incidence of BSE in this country  but with it  there is a need to strengthen the key points crucial to preventing the spread of the disease  Based on this analysis  the Canadian government has proposed prohibiting specified risk materials  such as brains and spinal cords  from animal feed and prohibiting the use of dead stock or condemned carcasses for animal feed  Canada has also proposed extending these prohibitions to pet food  segregating specified risk materials during the slaughter process  and using new procedures to identify specified risk materials and dead stock  A 75 day comment period for the proposal  which has yet to take effect  ends February 24  2005  Conclusion USDA s decision to allow imports of cattle from Canada rests in significant part on its determination that the enforcement of the Canadian feed ban has been rigorous and effective  There is significant evidence that calls these findings into question  This evidence includes a series of import alerts from FDA  as well as internal Canadian documents  It does not appear that this new evidence has been reviewed by USDA
