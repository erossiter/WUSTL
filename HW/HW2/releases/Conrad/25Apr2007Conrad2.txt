Conrad Warns of Fight Over Farm Bill  East Coast Media Misrepresents Rural America   Senator says                   April 25  2007      Washington    With Congress beginning to craft the 2007 Farm Bill  Senator Kent Conrad today warned agricultural leaders that the development of national farm legislation will be a difficult task     There are many road blocks ahead as we write this new Farm Bill   We re fighting against a growing public opinion fed by an East Coast media that simply doesn t understand farming   Senator Conrad said    This bill is critically important  and we must work together to gather support for America s family farmers     In a hearing today of the Senate Agriculture Committee  Senator Conrad noted that the Washington Post has reported a number of articles advocating against federal support for America s farmers      The stories in this big city newspaper paint an unfair picture of rural America   Senator Conrad said    It is clear that East Coast media has little understanding of federal farm policy and its effects on the lives of families in North Dakota        Senator Conrad was a chief architect of the current Farm Bill  which passed Congress in 2002  and has been widely recognized in farm country as a success   That legislation expires this year and Congress is beginning debate on its reauthorization  As both Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and a senior member of the Agriculture Committee  Senator Conrad is in a unique position to influence the next Farm Bill     Agriculture is North Dakota s top industry  employing about one in every five North Dakotans  and over a quarter of rural North Dakotans   The new Farm Bill is one of the most important pieces of federal legislation for the state s economy       Obviously  there is much work for us to do  but I am also optimistic that we can do great things for North Dakota in the next farm bill   Senator Conrad said   We can strengthen our commodity programs  create a permanent disaster title  and increase our domestic energy supply by increasing support for biofuels in this Farm Bill
