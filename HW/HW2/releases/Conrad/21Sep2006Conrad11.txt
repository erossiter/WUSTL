GOP Leaders Block Conrad Ag Disaster Bill Senate Leaders Deny Vote on Bill to Aid America s Farmers and Ranchers                    September 21  2006  Washington    The Republican leadership of the United States Senate today  again blocked efforts by Senator Kent Conrad to get a vote on bipartisan  legislation to provide assistance to farmers and ranchers recovering from  devastating natural disasters in 2005 and 2006  A fair vote has been denied here in the Senate today and the party in power  has turned its back on America s farmers  Senator Conrad said  But this fight  is far from over  I won t stand by and let this be swept under the rug  The  livelihoods of thousands of farm families are at stake   With only days left before Congress adjourns for the fall elections  Senator  Conrad again urged the Senate to immediately pass his emergency ag disaster  legislation to help producers recover from losses to natural disasters in the  2005 and 2006 production seasons  The bill  which has 22 co sponsors in the  Senate  combines legislation Senator Conrad previously introduced to support  ranchers and farmers impacted by frost  flood and disease during the 2005  growing season with legislation to aid producers suffering from the 2006 drought  devastating the Great Plains  Working with Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson  Senator Conrad called on the Senate  to debate and vote on his legislation  the Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006   However  Republican leaders objected to the request and denied a vote on the ag  disaster bill  According to scientists  the dry conditions now ravaging the Great Plains  make up the third worst drought in America s history  The current drought   combined with the effects of last year s frost  flood and disease have resulted  in an agricultural disaster of historic proportions  The Secretary of  Agriculture recently declared all 53 North Dakota counties agricultural disaster  areas  Senator Conrad s comprehensive ag disaster package provides emergency funding  to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production  shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock and feed supplies  The bill  also helps farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked  following last year s hurricanes  In addition  the disaster aid includes a  300  million provision to assist thousands of small  ag dependent businesses fighting  to keep their doors open  This is not a partisan issue  it is an issue of doing what is right and  doing what is needed  It is time for the leaders of the Senate  the House of  Representatives and the White House to support passage of an agriculture  disaster assistance package  Senator Conrad said  Without this action   thousands of family farms and ranches will be lost
