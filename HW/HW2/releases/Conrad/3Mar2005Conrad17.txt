Senate Passes Conrad Bill Keeping Border Closed Conrad Resolution Would Overturn USDA Rule Allowing Canadian Cattle Trade                    March 3  2005  Washington    A bipartisan majority of the United States Senate voted today to pass Senator Kent Conrad s resolution blocking controversial USDA plans to re open the Canadian border to live cattle trade despite concerns over that nation s inability to regulate mad cow disease in its beef herd  Senator Conrad said the 52 46 vote for his resolution of disapproval was a significant step toward revoking the Agriculture Department s rule opening the border  That rule was to take effect on Monday  but has    at least temporarily    been blocked by a federal judge while a separate lawsuit is considered  Citing Canadian government inspections that uncovered numerous violations of livestock regulations  Senator Conrad said the USDA rule threatens both American consumer health and the long term economic stability of the American beef industry  Senator Conrad said North Dakota ranchers have been vocal in their opposition to the USDA rule  The evidence is just overwhelming that Canada is not enforcing its own regulations  Their own government testing shows it  They ve got four cases of mad cow identified now in Canada  It s just the better part of wisdom is for us not to open the border prematurely  Senator Conrad said  The consequences are just too great for the American people  and for the American economy  The USDA had initially issued a broad ban on live Canadian cattle trade in May 2003  following the first discovery of cattle sick with BSE in Canada  Then last December  USDA reversed itself and designated Canada as a minimal risk region for the fatal mad cow disease  The resolution of disapproval now goes to the House for a vote  and then must be signed by the President in order to revoke the USDA rule  Supporters of the Conrad resolution include Sens  Byron Dorgan  D N D   Pete Domenici  R N M   Tim Johnson  D S D   Ken Salazar  D Colo   Harry Reid  D Nev   Max Baucus  D Mont   Conrad Burns  R Mont   Craig Thomas  R Wyo   Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Richard Durbin  D Ill   Mark Dayton  D Minn   and Gordon Smith  R Ore
