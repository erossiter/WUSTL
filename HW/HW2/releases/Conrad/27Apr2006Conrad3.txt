Senator Seeks to Simplify Medicare Benefit  Help Seniors Conrad Says Seniors Deserve  Consumer Friendly  Drug Benefit                    April 27  2006  Washington    Capping off a series of public meetings around North Dakota with seniors and their families  Senator Kent Conrad introduced legislation today that would simplify the Medicare prescription drug benefit  help overwhelmed pharmacists trying to assist their customers  and protect seniors who enroll for the new benefit  Time and time again I ve heard firsthand the problems seniors and their families have had navigating this new benefit    and the problems our pharmacists have had helping their customers  Senator Conrad said  Clearly a fix is needed  and that s what we re offering with these bills  This legislation will help seniors and their families make informed choices about their drug coverage  And it protects our seniors by making sure plans cannot drop coverage of the drugs seniors need  Senator Conrad filed two separate bills  the Medicare Prescription Drug Simplification Act  and the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006  Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees Medicare policy  Although Senator Conrad voted for the new Medicare prescription drug in 2003  he has repeatedly warned the Administration and Medicare administrators that the new drug benefit has been presented to the public in a very poor manner    confusing seniors and their families  and burdening already overworked pharmacists  particularly in rural communities  I have been back and forth across North Dakota at more than a dozen public meetings where I ve met with hundreds of seniors and their families  The report is the same where ever I go    this new benefit could save seniors money  but it is far too confusing  Senator Conrad said  These bills will make the program work better for our seniors  and our pharmacists  The Medicare Prescription Drug Simplification Act would allow easier comparison of drug benefit options by seniors who are choosing a benefit package  The bill would also prohibit plans from changing drug coverage during the benefit year  prohibit unfair marketing and advertising practices  and require an annual report by the Department of Health and Human Services rating each plan  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006 would require drug plans to reimburse pharmacies quicker  establish plan information hotlines for pharmacists and physicians  and cut back confusing co branding practices that have lead some seniors to believe that only certain pharmacies can provide their prescriptions
