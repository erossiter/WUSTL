Senator Conrad s Statement on President Bush s 2007 Budget                     February 6  2006  Washington   Senator Kent Conrad released this statement today following the release of President Bush s budget plan for Fiscal Year 2007  which will begin Oct  1  The nation needed a new budget plan this year  a dramatic and bold acknowledgment from this administration that we need to put our fiscal house back in order  Instead  we got more of the same   more deficits  more debt  and more hiding of the true fiscal condition of the country  President Bush s new budget is nothing new  It represents the same reckless fiscal course the Bush administration has followed for the last five years  It explodes deficits  but then conceals them by providing only five years of numbers and leaving out large costs  like long term Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  reform and realistic ongoing war costs  The result will be more debt passed on to our children  These aren t my values or those of the people I represent  We have seen this playbook before  Every year  the Bush administration talks about fiscal responsibility  but in the end  its policies dig us deeper into deficit and debt  It is results that matter  not talk  The results so far have been serious for our country and the ones who lose most are future generations  It is time to cut up the charge card and start paying our bills  And that will require real leadership from both Republicans and Democrats  For North Dakota  the President s delivers mixed news  Defense  The Defense Department would increase the number of new Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles acquired from nine to 26  This would help to ensure that Predator UAVs are quickly assigned to the North Dakota Air National Guard  to be based at Grand Forks AFB but flown from Fargo   However  the President is also seeking to cut 17 B 52s from Minot Air Force Base  Military Construction  The budget provides  176 7 million in military construction funding for North Dakota  a record request level  This includes  5 5 million for a new Predator Operations Complex at Fargo s Hector Field  home of the North Dakota Air National Guard  The remaining military construction budget is slated for the completion of a long term housing project at Minot Air Force Base  Energy  The President calls for a 90 percent cut in the Clean Coal Power Initiative  a program that is important to North Dakota s lignite coal industry and for ensuring a source of safe  clean burning energy  The President s budget also calls for a 29 percent cut in Rural Utilities Service loans to rural electric cooperatives  in the 2005 Fiscal Year  RUS gave  16 9 million to North Dakota for rural electric service  Education  President Bush is seeking  2 1 billion in education cuts  including the total elimination of vocational education funding  which amounted to  4 6 million for North Dakota in the current fiscal year  The President is also seeking to continue his freeze on Pell Grants  North Dakota received  37 million in Pell grants in the current fiscal year  Finally  the President is seeking to eliminate the Safe and Drug Free Schools program  a partner in fighting methamphetamine abuse  North Dakota received  1 7 million in Safe and Drug Free funding this year  Agriculture  The President is seeking policy changes  such as a 5 percent across the board cut in commodity programs and a 1 2 percent marketing fee on sugar producers  that would mean cuts of  1 1 billion in Fiscal Year 2007 and  5 billion over the next five years  The budget also calls for farmers and ranchers to pay  135 million in new user fees imposed by USDA  Homeland Security  President Bush seeks to slash Homeland Security Grants to small states  Last year  North Dakota received  9 34 million in Fiscal Year 2005  Under the President s proposal  North Dakota would see a cut of about  6 million in its Homeland Security funding  Water  The President seeks to cut several water projects in the state  including a  3 4 million cut in funding for the Garrison Diversion  The President s plan also cuts all funding for the Buford Trenton Irrigation District  the Missouri River sedimentation project  and the rehabilitation of the Garrison Dam power plant  Rural Health Care  The President is seeking a cut of  133 million  or 83 percent  from rural health programs  The President calls for completely eliminating the FLEX Program  which has provided more than  3 million to North Dakota s Critical Access Hospitals  Indian Affairs  For the fifth straight year  the President is seeking to eliminate funding for United Tribes Technical College  Further  the budget does not include any funds for the Three Affiliated Tribes health facility from the Bureau of Indian Affairs  Justice  The President s budget eliminates Byrne Justice Assistance Grants  which are used to combat methamphetamine abuse  and slashes funding for the COPS program  The most recent statistics available indicate that North Dakota received  730 000 in Byrne grants this year  and  8 9 million for COPS in Fiscal Year 2005  Transportation  The Essential Air Service program  which underwrites passenger service to North Dakota s cities  is reduced by more than half under the President s plan  In the current fiscal year  Essential Air Service provided  110 million  the President is asking for  50 million  Further  he is seeking to cut Amtrak s funding from  1 3 billion this year to  900 million next year  This level of funding would likely mean long distance routes like North Dakota s Empire Builder line would be eliminated  Housing  The Administration is seeking a change to the Community Development Block Grant formula to cut allocations by 23 percent  Two years ago  the latest statistics available  North Dakota s CDBG allocation was approximately  5 6 million  and funded 40 projects  Social Security  The President s budget proposes to eliminate the  255 Social Security lump sum death benefit  which is paid to surviving spouses  Many low  and moderate income seniors in North Dakota rely on this modest death benefit to help pay for burial services for their loved ones
