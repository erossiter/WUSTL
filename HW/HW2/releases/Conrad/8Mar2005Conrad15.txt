Conrad Introduces Open Fields  Senator s Bill Could Bring Boost to Rural America                    March 8  2005           Washington   Surrounded by outdoors enthusiasts and Congressional colleagues  Senator Kent Conrad today announced the introduction of his Open Fields initiative to the 109th Congress  The popular bipartisan legislation  authored by Senator Conrad and Senator Pat Roberts  R KS   provides incentives to farmers and ranchers who voluntarily open their land to hunting  fishing and other wildlife related activities  I remember growing up  I used to walk through open fields to go fishing  like a lot of American boys  Senator Conrad said  But all too often today our hunters  fishermen  and hikers are having difficulty accessing nature because it is on private land  Open Fields will help change that and offer another generation of America s youth the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors just like I did  Senator Conrad s legislation would direct the USDA to back existing state based programs that support landowners who volunteer to make their lands accessible for outdoor recreational uses  The federal government would help provide funding  but the states would continue to manage the programs  Senator Conrad and Senator Roberts first introduced Open Fields in the fall of 2003  The bipartisan initiative has grown in popularity and has received the support of more than 20 U S  Senators  In addition  Open Fields has been endorsed by a long list of sportsman s  conservation  and farming groups  ranging from the Izaak Walton League to Ducks Unlimited  the National Farmers Union  and Pheasants Forever  Rarely  do we propose a program here in Washington that leaves control in the hands of landowners  does not tell states how to manage their own programs  provides an economic infusion into rural communities  and is supported by both agriculture and environmental organizations  I am excited about this legislation  and I am pleased to join Senator Conrad in pushing for its passage  Senator Roberts said  Nearly 100 million Americans participate in wildlife related recreation annually  spending in excess of  100 billion each year on their outdoor activities  Outdoor recreation is worth nearly  1 billion annually in North Dakota alone  and Senator Conrad noted that Open Fields should create an opportunity to further boost the state s nature based industries  Hunting and fishing is a tradition as old as America itself  And through Open Fields  I am intent on keeping that tradition alive for generations to come  Senator Conrad said  This bill offers a win win situation for everyone  The farmers and ranchers who voluntarily enroll their land get an incentive payment  Hunters  fishermen and birders find more land available to enjoy the outdoors  and our rural communities get a tremendous economic shot in the arm
