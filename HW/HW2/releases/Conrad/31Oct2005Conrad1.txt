Conrad Calls on President to Close WTO Loopholes Currency Devaluation Puts U S  Farmers at Disadvantage  Senator says                    October 31  2005  Fargo    Standing before more than 200 farmers  ranchers and agricultural leaders  Senator Kent Conrad today urged President George W  Bush to clamp down on loopholes used by foreign countries that put U S  farmers at a disadvantage in world markets  The simple fact is that there are many countries that have greatly expanded their agricultural exports through currency devaluation and the use of indirect subsidies that operate outside current WTO rules  Senator Conrad said  That is not fair to the American farmer  That s not a fair fight  In a letter sent today to the White House  Senator Conrad requested that the President s trade negotiators secure an agreement on agriculture that both eliminates the inequities between U S  and European support levels and addresses the currency manipulation by developing nations  This currency manipulation allows these countries to sell into dollar denominated world markets at fire sale prices while their farmers continue to earn good prices in their domestic currency  Senator Conrad writes  If we fail to address currency manipulation  no amount of increased market access in the WTO negotiations will be able to offset the loss in income U S  farmers will suffer  Senator Conrad unveiled his letter today at his national conference on the future of agriculture in the United States  The conference  entitled 21st Century Farm Policy  Challenges and Opportunities  features nationally renowned experts discussing WTO negotiations and other international trade issues  Senator Conrad s letter comes just six weeks before the WTO ministerial meeting at Hong Kong where trade negotiators will attempt to break a deadlock on a global trade agreement  known as the Doha Round Attached is the text of the letter sent to the President  October 31  2005 The President The White House Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  In just six weeks  the United States will participate in the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Hong Kong  At this meeting  the WTO will make decisions on agricultural trade rules that could have enormous implications for U S  farm policy  farm families  and rural communities  I urge you to insist that your negotiators secure an agreement on agriculture that both eliminates the inequities between U S  and European support levels and addresses the new challenge from developing countries like Brazil  Unfortunately  the U S  approach falls short on both counts  It will allow the European Union to spend twice as much on farm programs as the United States  In addition  it completely fails to address the factors that have allowed Brazil  Argentina  China and other developing countries to significantly expand their production and exports at the expense of U S  farmers  The simple fact is that these developing countries have greatly expanded their agricultural exports through currency devaluation and the use of indirect subsidies that are not captured by current WTO rules  On currency alone  the Brazilean real has been devalued 60  over the last decade against the dollar  Argentina s currency has declined 65   and China s currency is estimated to be undervalued by 15 40   This currency manipulation allows these countries to sell into dollar denominated world markets at firesale prices while their farmers continue to earn good prices in their domestic currency  If we fail to address currency manipulation  no amount of increased market access in the WTO negotiations will be able to offset the loss in income U S  farmers will suffer as a result of the proposal to reduce U S  government support programs  The unfortunate reality is that Brazil  Argentina  China and others will simply continue to devalue their currencies to capture any new market access opportunities that are generated  We need an approach that addresses these issues and benefits U S  farmers  Our negotiators must settle for nothing less  Sincerely  KENT CONRAD United States Senate
