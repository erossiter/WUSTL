Senator Conrad Responds to President s Veto of SCHIP                    October 3  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today in response to President Bushs veto of the State Children Health Insurance Program renewal that passed overwhelmingly in Congress last week    I am disappointed by the Presidents decision to veto a bill that would protect the health and well being of thousands of children in North Dakota and millions across the country    The fact that the President is unwilling to spend in a year for our childrens health what he spends every three weeks refereeing a civil war in Iraq indicates that this Administration is out of touch with the priorities of the American people
