Majority of Senators Join Conrad on Trade Conrad Letter Calls on White House to Reject Unfair WTO Deal                   June 23  2006  Washington    A bipartisan majority of U S  senators signed onto a letter  from Senator Kent Conrad to President Bush today calling on the President to  reject a World Trade Organization  WTO  proposal that would cut farm support  while failing to open new global markets for U S  agriculture  An unbalanced proposal that asks U S  agriculture and rural communities to  give more while getting less in market access is unacceptable  Senator Conrad  wrote to the President  The letter responds to recent reports that the Bush Administration is  considering proposals to make even deeper cuts in U S  farm programs while  dropping its demands for new export opportunities for U S  agriculture  We urge you to direct your negotiators to reject any such proposal and  instead insist on an ambitious  balanced result that will level the playing  field for U S  agriculture  open foreign markets to U S  agricultural exports   and increase net income prospects for U S  farmers and ranchers  the senators  wrote  By Friday  57 senators had signed the Conrad letter  At issue are WTO talks that appear headed for an agreement that would force  deep cuts in U S  farm programs  but would not significantly open new export  markets for U S  farmers and ranchers  Without greater market access to  compensate for the loss of government support  the deal would hurt North  Dakota s agricultural producers and rural communities  Senator Conrad is one of the Senate s most vocal critics of Bush policies  that have ballooned the nation s trade deficit  The deficit reached  718 billion  last year  Senator Conrad was the sole member of the Finance Committee to vote  against the nomination of Susan Schwab as U S  Trade Representative  citing the  deepening trade deficit as the reason  This nation s trade policy has us on the road to disaster  And American  trade negotiators appear willing to trade away the future of American farm and  ranch families  Senator Conrad said  This letter sends a clear message to the  White House  we will not trade away our farm families  The following is a copy of the letter to President Bush  June 23  2006 The President The White House Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  When discussions on the current round of negotiations in the World Trade  Organization  WTO  began  there was a broad  bipartisan consensus that our  negotiators should focus on producing a good result for U S  agriculture  As  this summer s deadline for agreeing on the outlines of a WTO agreement  approaches  we write to express our deep concern about the direction of the  negotiations on agriculture  Our support for an agreement depends on achieving a  balanced  ambitious outcome in which gains from new market access and the  elimination of export subsidies provide net gains for U S  agriculture in  relation to reductions in trade distorting domestic support  Last October  the United States put forward an ambitious proposal that  included substantial cuts in U S  domestic farm programs if other countries  would agree to significantly reduce their tariffs on agricultural products and  provide greater access to their markets  Many of the farmers we represent were  concerned that the cuts in farm programs would directly reduce their income   while the market access gains were speculative at best  However  your  Administration insisted that its offer was conditional  if the market access  gains did not materialize  the United States would not agree to a  disproportionately ambitious reduction in domestic support  Unfortunately  many of our trading partners continue to call for greater cuts  in U S  farm programs  even as they reject any movement toward real improvements  in market access  These countries have refused to make significant tariff  reductions  and they insist on exceptions for sensitive and special products  that will render meaningless the modest tariff reductions they have proposed  It is not only U S  agriculture that stands to gain from reduced tariffs and  greater market access in food and agriculture trade  Most economic studies  conclude that the majority of benefits of trade agreements in agriculture are  generated by significantly cutting tariffs on food and agriculture products   Thus  a failure of the WTO negotiations to achieve an ambitious outcome on  market access will hurt not only U S  agriculture but also the global economy  and people around the world  It is simply untenable for some of our WTO negotiating partners to suggest  the onus is on the United States to accept an unbalanced proposal B one with  substantial cuts in our trade distorting support but only minimal gains in  access by U S  agriculture to foreign markets B in order to save the Doha Round  from their reluctance to make ambitious market access offers  This is not an  honest framing of the issue  An unbalanced proposal that asks U S  agriculture and rural communities to  give more while getting less in market access is unacceptable  We urge you to  direct your negotiators to reject any such proposal and instead insist on an  ambitious  balanced result that will level the playing field for U S   agriculture  open foreign markets to U S  agricultural exports  and increase net  income prospects for U S  farmers and ranchers
