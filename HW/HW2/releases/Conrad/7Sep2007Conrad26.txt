ND Leaders Urge Administration to Assist Northwood Residents In Addition to Disaster Declaration  Individual Assistance Still Needed                   September 7  2007  Washington  North Dakota s Congressional delegation and Governor today announced that the White House has declared the tornado stricken town of Northwood  North Dakota as a federal disaster area eligible for Public Assistance to repair and rebuild  However  the disaster declaration stopped short of awarding Individual Assistance for those Northwood families whose homes were destroyed  and the state s leading officeholders jointly urged the Administration to complete the federal recovery effort by awarding that Individual Assistance  Todays announcement is a good start  the delegation and the governor said in a joint statement  While the healing process for Northwood begins with the disaster declaration and the awarding of Public Assistance  the federal support offered does not address all the needs of the people of Northwood  We are hopeful the Administration recognizes the dire need for Individual Assistance  Last week  officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  said that since 90 percent of the homes in Northwood were insured  homeowners would not likely qualify for Individual Assistance However  the delegation and the Governor have argued that the homeowners should qualify for Individual Assistance  because many were underinsured as far as rebuilding costs  The decision today did not rule out the possibility of awarding Individual Assistance at a future date  but its exclusion from the initial disaster declaration is cause for concern  We have been pushing for a full federal response to the Northwood disaster  hoping FEMA would perform the way they did for us in Grand Forks  Senator Conrad said  We hope the FEMA we are working with today is dramatically different from the Katrina FEMA Now is their chance to prove it with this Individual Assistance  This tornado has been devastating to Northwood  but people from all across the state have chipped in to help get this community on the road to recovery  Senator Dorgan said  Now  its time for the federal government to step in  and Im going to keep pushing to make that happen  Its critical that federal assistance be triggered as quickly as possible so people can make decisions about how to rebuild    The city of Northwood suffered significant damage in the storm and the Public Assistance will help this city rebuild  said Congressman Pomeroy  I will continue to fight to ensure that help for the individual losses folks incurred will follow as well    We have our state agencies  together with relief organizations like Salvation Army and the Red Cross  in Northwood working to help the citizens recover and rebuild  Governor Hoeven said  At the same time  we are pushing FEMA to provide as much assistance as possible to aid our recovery efforts
