Statement By Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad on OMB Mid Session Review                    July 11  2007  The President has no credibility when it comes to fiscal matters  The record surplus he inherited has been wiped out and debt has exploded on his watch  His focus on the short term in todays deficit announcement simply serves as a distraction from the continued long term budget deterioration  And once again he has played this game of inflating his February deficit estimate so that he could claim an improvement now and later in the year  The American people deserve better  They deserve a President who acts fiscally responsible instead of just talking about it  And they deserve a President committed to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to confront all of the fiscal challenges still facing our nation
