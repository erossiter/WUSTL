Senators Fight for Fair Compensation for Farmers Conrad and Dorgan Press for Quality Loss Provisions for North Dakota s Farmers                    March 11  2005  Washington    Leading a bipartisan group of farm state lawmakers  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan today urged the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to ensure that  2 9 billion in emergency aid for America s farmers and ranchers is distributed in a fair and accurate manner  In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns  Senator Conrad and Senator Dorgan request that compensation to producers reflect the actual quality losses they sustained in the market  They urged USDA not to measure quality losses by a standardized formula  which could fail to gauge the full impact of losses suffered by farmers and ranchers  We write to request that you ensure individual State Committees of the Farm Service Agency  FSA  have the flexibility provided in the disaster assistance legislation to carry out the quality loss provisions of the Crop Disaster Program  Conrad and Dorgan wrote to Johanns  It is critical USDA provide the flexibility to State FSA committees so they can address these local and regional circumstances if the intent of Congress is to be met  Last year  Senators Conrad and Dorgan introduced legislation that formed the basis for the  2 9 billion in emergency aid for farmers and ranchers hit by weather disasters across the nation  The disaster legislation will mean as much as  200 million for North Dakota s producers to overcome various production losses  Concerned about how USDA may determine payments when distributing the emergency aid  Senators Conrad and Dorgan are requesting that Johanns implement a Crop Disaster Program that contains provisions to reflect the actual discounts that have been applied to a producer s crop  The current Crop Disaster Program specifically cites market value and directs you to implement the program   in the same manner  as the earlier Crop Disaster Program  wrote Senators Conrad and Dorgan  We expect that you will ensure that the information used will most accurately reflect losses or discounts actually encountered by growers in their local marketplace  Eleven Senators joined in signing the letter  including Senators Max Baucus  D MT   Conrad Burns  R MT   Sam Brownback  R KS   Tim Johnson  D SD   Norm Coleman  R MN   Mike Crapo  R ID   Ben Nelson  D NE   Larry Craig  R ID   Patty Murray  D WA   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   and Maria Cantwell  D WA   Senator Conrad  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  is also a senior member of both the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Dorgan serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee  including the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  and the Senate Commerce Committee
