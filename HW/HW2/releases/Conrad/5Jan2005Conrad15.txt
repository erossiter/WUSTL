Senator Conrad s Op ed on Social Security Reform  Finding Common Ground on Social Security Reform by Senators Kent Conrad and Lindsey Graham                   January 5  2005  With a renewed debate over the future of Social Security now underway  Republicans and Democrats alike need to begin by setting aside our differences and focusing on the common ground between us  As two policymakers    one from each party    who have been committed to the well being of Social Security throughout our careers  we have agreed that the following common principles should guide our deliberations going forward  First  Social Security must be preserved  Since its inception in 1935  the program has provided a basic safety net for Americans  Millions of workers pay into the Social Security system with the expectation of receiving a benefit at retirement  as well as insurance for their family in the event of their death or disability  According to the Social Security Administration  two thirds of today s retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of their income  And nearly 50 percent of Social Security beneficiaries would be in poverty without Social Security  Second  it is also clear that Social Security must be strengthened  The demographic tidal wave of the baby boom generation will mean we will soon have too many beneficiaries and too few workers to keep the system in balance  By 2018  for the first time  the program will begin to take in less in payroll taxes than it pays in benefits  And by 2042  it is estimated that Social Security will be able to provide only 73 percent of promised benefits  Doing nothing is not an option  Third  strengthening Social Security will require tough choices and  if done in a responsible manner  can greatly improve our nation s fiscal outlook  Acting sooner will give us more time to adjust and allow for more gradual solutions to be adopted  But there are no easy answers  To address Social Security s funding challenges  all options should be on the table for discussion  Under some reform plans  transition costs could reach several trillion dollars over the next ten years  Borrowing all of those funds would pass on an unfair burden to future generations and could undermine the fiscal strength of the nation  Fourth  the costs of changing Social Security must be open and transparent  The American people need to be provided with an honest accounting of the costs of maintaining the current system and the costs of reform  If private accounts  either on top of or carved out of the existing program  are created  real dollars will be required now that will have a very real impact on a federal budget that is already deeply in deficit  Proposals to conceal the costs of reform by placing them Aoff budget     ignoring or minimizing the real and upfront fiscal impact    should be rejected  If the corporate scandals have taught us anything  it is that hiding debt is a recipe for disaster  The public must be aware of the difficult trade offs between benefit cuts  tax increases  and additional borrowing that will be required regardless of how we strengthen the system  And they must be aware of the impact of these reforms on the federal budget  the economy  and individual beneficiaries and taxpayers B in the short term and over the long term  In 1983  President Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O Neill worked together across party lines to protect Social Security    setting an example for future generations  We need to do the same thing now  A solution must be bipartisan  presidential leadership will be needed  rigid ideology must give way to workable solutions  and reasonable sacrifice will be required  Both parties have been far too hesitant to ask the American people to make sacrifices for the common good  It is our belief the American people  if asked in a responsible manner  will embrace the hard choices necessary to save Social Security for younger workers and future generations  It is time to address this problem  Social Security must be preserved and strengthened  But we need to be candid about the costs and willing to make the tough choices that real reform will require  If Republicans and Democrats can agree on this  we can save a vital program for generations to come  Senator Conrad is a Democrat from North Dakota  Senator Graham is a Republican from South Carolina
