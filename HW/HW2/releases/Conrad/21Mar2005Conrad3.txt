Conrad Vows to Fight Cuts to CDBG Program Grants Energize Communities and Develop Economies  Senator says                    March 21  2005  Grand Forks  Standing deep within the heart of a city rebuilt with Community Development Block Grants  CDBG   Senator Kent Conrad today pledged continued support for the popular program that has sparked economic development in communities across North Dakota and the nation  Community Development Block Grants are making a real difference  energizing our communities and developing their economies  Senator Conrad said  Nowhere is this more evident than here  in Grand Forks  where the grants played such a critical role in the community s recovery from the devastating flood of 1997  President Bush s proposed budget for fiscal year 2006 eliminates close to  2 billion in funding for community development programs  including the CDBG program  In addition  the President s plan transfers CDBG from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the Commerce Department  a move that will likely eliminate funding for North Dakota s rural housing and economic development programs  Last week  the Senate took an important step to block the President s proposal by voting to restore full funding to CDBG  Senator Conrad supported the bipartisan amendment  Over the past three years  Senator Conrad has helped secure more than  40 million in CDBG funds for North Dakota  This funding has been used by dozens of communities to support infrastructure improvement projects  such as repairing roads and schools  and constructing playgrounds and sewer systems  As a result of these projects more than 1 000 new jobs have been created in North Dakota  CDBG funds have also been distributed to vital community service agencies to help homeless  elderly  and disabled people in communities across North Dakota  Senator Conrad noted that CDBG funding also helped more than 11 000 Americans purchase their first home last year  51 of those families were in Grand Forks  Our nation does face a serious financial crisis  But the elimination of CDBG is the wrong path to take  Senator Conrad said  This program is extremely efficient and has revitalized communities and stimulated their economies  helping people find jobs  purchase homes  and fulfill the American dream
