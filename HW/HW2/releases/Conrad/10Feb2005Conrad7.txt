Conrad  Devils Lake Water an  Urgent  Priority  Senator Continues To Fight For New City Water Supply Funds                    February 10  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad said today that he is renewing efforts to secure federal funds to offset the local cost of constructing a  15 million municipal water supply system for the City of Devils Lake  The President s budget for fiscal year  FY  2006 does not contain any money for the project  and  in fact  significantly reduces spending by the Army Corps of Engineers  the agency that would oversee the work  Senator Conrad submitted legislation today that would authorize full funding for the project    which would bring the federal share of the costs up to  11 25 million  It will be more of a challenge because the President has substantially reduced the Corps budget  But this is an urgent  urgent need  and I believe we ve got a very powerful case for funding the Devils Lake water project  Senator Conrad said  Ultimately  I believe we ll be successful  The Conrad bill would help the City of Devils Lake by building a safe  reliable water supply to replace a system of pipelines that are currently under water  Rising lake waters have covered a third of the city s 40 year old water pipeline  If a failure in the submerged section of the line were to occur  it would be almost impossible to identify the leak and make the necessary repairs  That would leave the more than 7 000 residents of the city without a source of drinking water  Senator Conrad already secured more than  1 2 million in initial funding for the new water supply system through the FY 04 05 Omnibus appropriations bill  Senator Byron Dorgan is a co sponsor of today s legislation  Drinking water is a fundamental need  and we must do everything we can to ensure that it is never cut off to the residents and businesses of Devils Lake  Senator Conrad said
