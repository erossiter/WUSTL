President s Plan for  Korea Like  Presence in Iraq Will Cost Trillions                    September 20  2007  Washington  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  today released a report  requested by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad  D ND   showing that the cost of maintaining a Korea like presence in Iraq over the next 50 years could exceed  2 trillion  The report found that even after a significant drawdown of U S  forces  it could cost up to  25 billion each year  more than two thirds of our nations homeland security budget  to keep a military presence in Iraq similar to that now on the Korean peninsula   President Bush has repeatedly drawn an analogy between the Iraq and Korean wars and his administration has suggested that our ongoing presence in Korea could provide a model for Iraq  said Senator Conrad  The American people deserve to know that they are going to be handed a multi trillion dollar bill from this President to cover the cost of his misguided policy in Iraq  CBO has previously projected that war costs could reach  1 trillion over the 2009 2017 period  assuming a gradual drawdown to 75 000 deployed U S  troops  Based on CBOs new report  which projects the annual cost of permanently maintaining 55 000 U S  troops in Iraq  roughly the equivalent of the U S  commitment in South Korea   it could cost another  1 trillion  in constant FY 08 dollars  for operations in Iraq over the 2018 to 2057 period  In other words  taken together  CBOs reports show that the long term presence in Iraq envisioned by the Bush administration could cost  2 trillion over the next 50 years  And this cost comes on top of the approximately  567 billion already appropriated and requested for Iraq through 2008  The Bush administration has been trying to hide the cost of this war every step of the way  said Senator Conrad  Now the President is considering a significant ongoing presence in Iraq  long after he leaves office  Yet  he gives no indication of the cost or how it should be paid for  except to throw it all on the charge card and continue to run up the nations debt      CBOs projections of Iraq war costs have been consistently lower than actual amounts requested by the administration  For example  CBO previously projected that war costs could reach  154 billion in fiscal year 2008  However  the administration has already requested  147 billion in war funding for fiscal year 2008  and the President is reportedly planning to ask for another  50 billion on top of that  If this trend continues  the long term presence in Iraq envisioned by the Bush administration could cost even more than projected under CBOs figures
