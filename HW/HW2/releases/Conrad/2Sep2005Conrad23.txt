Senator Urges NWA to Abandon Plans to Cut Service  Northwest Airlines Serves as a Vital Link to North Dakota  Conrad says                    September 2  2005  Bismarck   Senator Kent Conrad today said a proposed plan by Northwest Airlines to reduce service to North Dakota would have a profound impact on the state and urged the airline s CEO to reconsider  As someone who flies Northwest to North Dakota on a regular basis  I know how vital the airline is to our state  Senator Conrad said  Northwest is our main provider of jet service and is a key link for both business and leisure travelers to and from North Dakota  It is vital that we keep these planes up and operating  In a letter sent today to Northwest Airlines chief executive Doug Steenland  Senator Conrad urged the airline not to follow through on plans to cut the number of seats and flights in and out of Bismarck and Grand Forks  According to the proposed plan  Northwest would reduce service nationwide by 10 percent  beginning October 1  As a result  Grand Forks would lose one flight per day and Bismarck would lose two flights per day  Additionally  some of the flights would downsize from DC 9 planes to smaller regional jets that only hold 50 passengers  The change would result in a loss of 136 seats per day for Bismarck and 129 seats per day for Grand Forks  Statewide airplane boardings are up 8 percent from a year ago  We need to increase air service to North Dakota  not reduce it  Senator Conrad said  Northwest s flights in and out of Bismarck and Grand Forks are often full to capacity  These are growing communities that are projected to add population over the next years  which will only increase passengers  I hope we can work with Northwest to restore the seats on these flights and further develop a plan that benefits both Northwest and North Dakota  Senator Dorgan  Congressman Pomeroy and several North Dakota mayors met with Steenland on Friday at Minneapolis Airport to make the case against cutting seats from North Dakota markets  Northwest is based in Eagan  Minn  According to Northwest  the flight reductions are a result of soaring fuel prices  Senator Conrad could not attend the Minneapolis meeting because he was in Bismarck  unveiling a detailed plan that calls for immediate steps to reduce fuel costs while taking long term measures to avert a potential energy crisis
