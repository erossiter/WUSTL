Conrad Fires Back at USDA  Urges Ag Support  Senator Calls on Johanns to Address Needs of Farmers   Ranchers                    April 28  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today said he completely disagrees with recent assertions by the Bush Administration that disaster assistance for America s farmers and ranchers is unnecessary  Senator Conrad  joined by 18 Senators  wrote a letter responding to published statements by Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns in which the Secretary said he could not support ag disaster legislation because it is unnecessary  We have read with interest your comments concerning agricultural disaster assistance as reported by Jim Wiesemeyer on April 21  2006  We completely disagree with your analysis of the situation concerning the need for both production loss and energy related disaster assistance for our farmers and ranchers due to the losses they sustained during 2005 as well as damage that has already manifested itself this year  the Senators write  We know of no farm families in this country who wish to have their crops destroyed or their production costs dramatically increased because they believe  as you suggest  the federal government will make them more than whole through assistance programs  Last month  Senator Conrad introduced the Emergency Agriculture Disaster Assistance Act of 2006  The legislation  which has 27 bipartisan cosponsors  provides emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies  It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock and help farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last year s hurricanes  The Senate Appropriations Committee recently adopted Senator Conrad s ag disaster legislation in a unanimous vote as part of a larger spending bill for Hurricane Katrina relief and Iraqi war costs  The supplemental spending bill  including the disaster aid legislation  is currently being debated in the Senate  A vote is expected next week  Eighteen Senators joined in signing the letter  including Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Max Baucus  D MT   Tim Johnson  D SD   Bill Nelson  D FL   Patty Murray  D WA   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   Blanche Lincoln  D AR   Mary Landrieu  D LA   Dick Durbin  D IL   Ken Salazar  D CO   Daniel Inouye  D HI   Mark Dayton  D MN   Mark Pryor  D AR   Ted Kennedy  D MA   John Kerry  D MA   Harry Reid  D NV   Barack Obama  D IL   and Maria Cantwell  D WA   Dear Mr  Secretary  We have read with interest your comments concerning agricultural disaster assistance as reported by Jim Wiesemeyer on April 21  2006  We completely disagree with your analysis of the situation concerning the need for both production loss and energy related disaster assistance for our farmers and ranchers due to the losses they sustained during 2005 as well as damage that has already manifested itself this year  We know of no farm families in this country who wish to have their crops destroyed or their production costs dramatically increased because they believe  as you suggest  the federal government will make them more than whole through assistance programs  You indicated that USDA has provided about  5 billion in hurricane related disaster assistance through grants  loans  loan guarantees and food assistance for hurricane losses  As important as these programs are to economic recovery in the Gulf  they generally do not apply to the production losses sustained by producers in that region in 2005 and ignore the thousands of producers in other parts of the nation who also suffered significant losses due to weather related causes  You tout the national levels of production  cash receipts and net cash farm income as a reason to oppose disaster assistance  We are well aware that some producers had the good fortune to produce above average crops in 2005  Unfortunately  not all farmers  and particularly those in areas most negatively effected by the hurricanes  floods  drought  wildfires and crop diseases  have shared equitably in those aggregate measures  Our crop disaster program targets production loss assistance to those who have suffered production losses in excess of 35 percent  It does not benefit those who had production losses less than 35 percent  normal or above average production  You criticize removal of the 95 percent cap as a policy mistake  But you ignore the fact that previous programs with a cap also reduced disaster benefits by any crop insurance proceeds a producer might have received  These provisions unfairly penalized those who purchased higher levels of coverage  Our disaster legislation provides for a 50 percent payment rate on losses greater than 35 percent  We do not believe this program is going to come close to making farmers whole  It will provide many operators the opportunity to continue to farm in 2006  providing economic stability to rural communities and financial help to farm families  You claim the energy related economic loss payments only benefit program crop producers  USDA has estimated that energy related input costs in 2005 were about  5 billion over the 2004 level  A large majority of those additional expenses were born by program crop producers who are by far the largest users of fuel and fertilizer in the nation  For example  based on USDA data  increased costs for fuel and fertilizer in 2005 amounted to about  4 4 billion    nearly 90 percent of the total increase in energy related input costs  Over  2 billion of this amount was incurred by wheat  corn and soybean producers and represents nearly 50 percent of the total increase for those inputs  In addition  those who produce the majority of our program crops also represent a large percentage of the production of non program crops and livestock  If the Administration believes there is a need for energy payments to other agricultural sectors  perhaps it would be more constructive to sit down with us and discuss those alternatives  rather than issuing directives to Congress through the press  The agricultural disaster legislation that was introduced in both the House and the Senate and that has been incorporated into the Senate supplemental appropriations bill received broad bipartisan support from all regions of the country  Mr  Secretary  we are always willing and available to discuss the disasters that have impacted so many farmers and ranchers across our nation and would look forward to working with you for additional ways to adequately address these very real needs
