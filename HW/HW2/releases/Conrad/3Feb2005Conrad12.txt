Conrad Urges Dialogue For Dealing with Social Security Senator  Massive Borrowing Won t Fix Solvency Issue                    February 3  2005  Fargo  Following the President s Social Security presentation to North Dakotans today  Senator Kent Conrad said he welcomed the opportunity to discuss the program s long term challenges  but warned against massive borrowing and steep benefit cuts  I listened carefully to the President s remarks  There are areas where I agree with the President  But there are also places where I have concerns with his plan  Senator Conrad said  I hope this is the start of a meaningful dialogue  Whatever we do  we must preserve the promise of Social Security  not only for this generation  but for generations to come  Senator Conrad agreed with the President that any plan for Social Security should not increase payroll taxes  He said he also agreed that changes should not affect people who are currently receiving Social Security benefits  or who are near retirement  I also support additional incentives for savings and investment  And we also should try to achieve a higher rate of return on funds invested through Social Security  Senator Conrad said  However  Senator Conrad said he could not support a plan that contains steep benefit cuts or that borrows heavily to cover the costs of private accounts  I do not support massive new borrowing to pay the costs of private accounts  I also don t support cutting benefits more than 40 percent with the hope that stock market gains make up the difference  Finally  I believe the first step toward strengthening Social Security is to stop the raid on the Social Security surplus  Right now the President s budget calls for spending more than  2 trillion over the next 10 years from the Social Security surplus  I cannot endorse that policy  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad  who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  said the President should broaden the discussion to include the long term funding of Medicare and fundamental reform of the tax code  The Medicare shortfall is eight times the Social Security shortfall  Tax reform is important because the tax gap  the difference between what is owed and what is paid  is now over  300 billion a year  Before any tax increase is considered  we ought to insist that those who are ducking their tax obligations be expected to pay like the vast majority of Americans who already pay what they owe  Senator Conrad said
