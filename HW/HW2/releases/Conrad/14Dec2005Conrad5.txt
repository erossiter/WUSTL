Conrad Fights to Restore Funding for Rural Healthcare While Pleased Some Programs Were Restored  Senator Says Fight is Far From Over                    December 14  2005  Washington  In response to pressure from Senator Kent Conrad and members of the bi partisan Senate Rural Health Caucus  congressional leaders agreed to restore funding to several vital rural health programs  Close to 92 percent of North Dakotans live in medically underserved areas  Programs must be available to ensure that the children and families in these rural communities in North Dakota  and across the nation  have access to the quality health care they deserve  Senator Conrad said  Earlier this year  the Senate unanimously passed a bi partisan amendment drafted by Senator Conrad that restored  100 million in rural health funding to the FY 2006 budget  money that President Bush had eliminated from his budget proposal  Senator Conrad s amendment was drafted in a way that restored rural health funding without adding to the deficit  In negotiations with the House of Representatives last month  the rural health care funding was severely cut and  in some cases  health programs for rural America were completely eliminated  In response  Senator Conrad and Senator Craig Thomas  R WY  led the effort to restore the rural heath funding as part of the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations bill  Senator Conrad along with 41 of his Senate colleagues wrote a letter to congressional leaders stressing the importance of these health programs to rural America  While current spending for all rural health discretionary programs is relatively small  it plays a critical role in solidifying the fragile health care infrastructure common in rural communities  the bipartisan group of Senators wrote  Maintaining fiscal discipline is a top priority and we want to work with you toward that goal  However  we respectfully request that you consider the important role these programs play in rural communities  Earlier this week  Members from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees agreed to restore funding for several important rural health initiatives including  the Rural Health Outreach grant program  rural health research  and Area Health Education Centers  I have seen  first hand  how important accessible  quality health care is to rural communities  These programs should not and cannot be eliminated  And each time funding for rural health care programs is cut  I will fight to have it restored  Senator Conrad said  This revised bill is far from perfect  It still includes cuts to rural health funding  so this fight is far from over  The new conference report has passed the House and will now go to the Senate floor for a vote
