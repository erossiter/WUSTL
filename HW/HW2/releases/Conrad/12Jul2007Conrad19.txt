Conrad Fights to Secure B 52 Force Strength Bombers at Minot Air Force Base Critical to Nation s Air Defense  Senator says                   July 12  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced legislation that would upgrade the nations fleet of B 52s and block a Pentagon plan to dramatically reduce Americas bomber force    The B 52 is indispensable  Its used in combat overseas on a daily basis   We must maintain an effective bomber force  and outfit each plane with the newest technology  Senator Conrad said  Senator Byron Dorgan is a co sponsor of the legislation    Senator Conrads amendment was offered as part of the 2008 Defense Authorization bill  It blocks a Department of Defense proposal to reduce the nations B 52 force to just 56 aircraft   The Pentagons proposed plan would greatly impact the nations only two B 52 bomber bases    Minot Air Force Base and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana      The amendment Senator Conrad introduced today expands on Conrad legislation signed into law last year which required a B 52 force of no less than 76 aircraft   The new amendment specifies the composition of the B 52 force  mandating that it include 63 active aircraft  11 backup aircraft and two reserve aircraft   The amendment was drafted as a result of a Pentagon plan to reduce maintenance of some B 52s  despite their heavy use     Senator Conrad strongly opposes the creation of so called hangar queens  planes that are not regularly flown   His amendment requires technological upgrades to the entire fleet to ensure the planes are using the latest in weaponry and military communications     Senator Conrads legislation also continues to bar the Pentagon from retiring any B 52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study required by Congress   This detailed study would address the impact of a bomber gap in Americas long range strike capabilities during the time between the proposed drawdown of the B 52 fleet in 2008 and the scheduled delivery of new bombers in 2018     Senator Conrad is a longtime proponent of the B 52 and its mission at Minot Air Force Base  In ongoing talks with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen  T  Michael Moseley  Senator Conrad has stressed the strategic importance of maintaining the nations fleet of B 52s and warned that reducing the fleet would weaken Americas ability to strike overseas targets    It absolutely makes no sense to cut Americas B 52 fleet  They are the cheapest bombers to operate in our inventory  With conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  it is no time to allow a gap in our nations defenses  Senator Conrad said
