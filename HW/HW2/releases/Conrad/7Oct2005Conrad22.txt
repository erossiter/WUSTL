Conrad Talent Seek Change in Tax Code to Help Farmers Purchase New Equipment                    October 7  2005  Washington  Producers still hanging on to outdated farm equipment for the tax benefits would have a new incentive to purchase the latest tractor  combine and other agricultural machinery under a proposal by U S  Senators Kent Conrad  D N D   and Jim Talent  R MO   Conrad and Talent today introduced a bipartisan bill  S  1864  to address an injustice in the tax code that spreads tax benefits for farm equipment over seven years even though the average big ticket farm machinery has a five year life span  Original co sponsors of the legislation include U S  Senators Mike Crapo  R Idaho   Tom Harkin  D Iowa   Craig Thomas  R Wyo    Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   and Jim Bunning  R Ky    The current system penalizes farmers when they upgrade their farm equipment  That s not the purpose of a depreciation system  said Senator Conrad  who serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture committees  This bill is a bipartisan effort to fix what is a mismatched system  By shortening the depreciation period  we re encouraging farmers to make the investments they need to boost their productivity  and increase farm income  Farmers have told me they want to purchase state of the art equipment to improve productivity and keep pace with technology  but the tax code treats them unfairly  said Sen  Talent  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  The tax code has failed to keep pace with advances in agricultural technology over the last 20 years  This is not the 1980 s  Our bill updates the tax code making it more consistent with the life span and utility of farm machinery  Currently  if a farmer purchases a  300 000 combine  he or she can deduct the cost of the combine over a seven year period  This is a system known as depreciation  However  due to the intense usage of farm equipment  the life span and utility of this machinery is only about five years  In other words  farmers are hanging on to outdated equipment because the tax code is outdated  The Conrad Talent bill would change the farm equipment tax schedule from seven years to five years  allowing producers to receive the tax benefit on a schedule that better reflects the life span of their machinery and their farm income  The rules that govern tax depreciation schedules for farm equipment remain largely unchanged since the 1980 s when the Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986  During previous tax reform efforts  the tax laws governing farm equipment were not examined separately as were the ones governing construction equipment  As a result  construction equipment is on a five year schedule and farm equipment remains on a seven year schedule  Newer farm equipment allows farmers to operate more efficiently and safely  and with the latest environmentally sensitive technology  Senators Conrad and Talent are urging the Senate to consider their proposal  stressing that the legislation would be a boost to the nation s agricultural economy and help our producers remain competitive
