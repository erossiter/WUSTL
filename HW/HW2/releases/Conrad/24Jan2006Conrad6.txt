Farm Trade Plan Not Based on Reality USDA  Gambling  on WTO Proposal  Conrad Says                    January 24  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad released a letter today that accuses the Agriculture Department of endorsing a plan in World Trade Organization talks to slash support for U S  agriculture without a proper analysis of the economic impact that would have on American farmers and ranchers  As you well know  U S  agriculture and the agri food industry have invested tens of billions of dollars based on current policy  The U S  WTO proposal would result in significant changes to that policy  putting those investments at risk  Senator Conrad wrote to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns  In effect  you are gambling    betting the farm  if you will    with other people s money  And now it appears that you are doing so without even bothering to calculate the odds of success  Senator Conrad wrote  Read the letter here  Senator Conrad cited recent statements by Secretary Johanns saying it is unnecessary for USDA to prepare a rigorous economic analysis of the likely effects on U S  agriculture of the U S  proposal in WTO farm negotiations  I could not disagree more  Senator Conrad wrote  Failing to analyze the proposal is irresponsible and does a disservice to the American farmers and ranchers you represent  More than two months ago  Senator Conrad wrote Secretary Johanns seeking a detailed analysis of the U S  proposal s effect on American agriculture in general and North Dakota farmers in particular  To date  USDA has failed to respond  Senator Conrad serves as the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  He also serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  and the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees trade policy
