Senator Says Soldiers Deserve College Benefits Longest Serving Unit Denied Benefits  Conrad Seeks Fix                   October 16  2007  Washington  More than 1 100 members of the longest serving National Guard unit in Iraq have been denied GI Bill college benefits unfairly  and Senator Kent Conrad announced today he is asking President Bush to fix bureaucratic disparities that prompted the benefit denials  Im asking the President to take action because of the extended service of these National Guardsmen  and because of the extreme circumstances under which they served  Senator Conrad said  These troops and their families deserve nothing less  At issue is the eligibility of National Guardsmen for a benefit called Chapter 30 of the Montgomery GI Bill  a National Guard soldier called up for 730 days    or two years    is eligible for  894 per month in college support while enrolled full time after their service  Typically  Guardsmen who serve on active duty 729 days or less are entitled to a benefit of  660 per month  but lose that benefit upon leaving the military  Upon returning from the longest deployment in Iraq of any combat unit  many members of the Minnesota National Guards First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry were told their orders were just shy of the 730 days needed for eligibility to receive Chapter 30 benefits of the Montgomery GI Bill  In some cases  they covered 729 days    exactly one day shy of eligibility  However  the way the days were calculated raised questions from the troops  who noted that the arrival of deployment orders varied by several days among members of the unit   The combat unit  nicknamed the Red Bulls  is made up of 2 500 soldiers from North  Dakota  Minnesota and Iowa  The Red Bulls were deployed in Iraq 30 days longer than any other unit serving as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom  and during their time they drove more than 4 500 round trip convoy missions  logging 2 2 million miles on the worlds most deadly highways  It is estimated that as many as half of the unit s soldiers have been denied the better benefit   What s clear to me is that these soldiers put everything on the line  I don t think its unreasonable to ask the Army to look at the deployment dates and grant those who served as Red Bulls the education benefits they deserve  Senator Conrad said   Senator Conrad was joined by 27 Members of Congress  including Senator Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy  in signing a letter to President Bush  asking that he resolve the inequity surrounding soldiers of the First Brigade Combat Team  Dear President Bush  We write today to request your assistance in resolving a matter of great inequity affecting some of the finest members of our nations armed forces  We respectfully request that you take corrective action regarding a disparity relative to eligibility for Montgomery GI education benefits for the First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry   The First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry recently returned from an active duty tour in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF   This unit  known as the Red Bulls  has a history of excellence and bravery that dates back to the Civil War  Just as their comrades who served before them  the members of the 1 34th performed magnificently in their duties in the Middle East consistent with the highest tradition of armed services  Their deployment kept them in Iraq 30 days longer than any other unit serving as a part of OIF  During their time  they drove over 4 500 round trip convoy missions logging 2 2 million miles of convoys in Iraq  In other areas they fought al Qaida and provided critical security to our military bases  saving countless lives of their comrades in arms  Approximately half of the 1 34th BCT  including 1 162 members from Minnesota alone  have realized that despite their extended service  they are not eligible for the education benefits they deserve  Because of an inexplicable difference in their active duty orders  soldiers who were deployed for the same amount of time to Iraq as many of their comrades are not able to claim Chapter 30 education benefits  In many of the cases  their orders reflect 729 days of service when 730 is the necessary number   Many of us have been in touch with Secretary of the Army Peter Geren about the issue but unfortunately the Secretary does not have the authority to amend these orders to reflect the true service of these troops  The issue has been referred to the Board for Corrections of Army Records  but the board has disallowed these affected service members from applying as a group   delaying their prospects for success and jeopardizing their ability to enroll in the 2008 spring semester at colleges and universities across the country  Because of their extended service and the extreme circumstances involved in their particular case  we ask that you take action  including the issuance of an Executive Order if necessary  to grant the members of the 1 34th Chapter 30 Active Duty GI Bill education benefits immediately  These troops and their families deserve nothing less
