Statement by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad on CBO August 2007 Budget Update                    August 23  2007  CBOs revised deficit estimate for 2007 should not distract from the failed fiscal record of President Bush  His administration is poised to leave office as the most fiscally irresponsible in the history of the country  The  5 6 trillion surplus projected when the President took office has been wiped out  And the nations debt burden continues to climb at the worst possible time  just before the retirement of the baby boom generation  In fact  the Bush administration is once again asking Congress to raise the nations debt limit to allow for more borrowing  The President calls for more spending on Iraq and more tax cuts for the wealthiest and refuses to pay for any of it  He just continues to run up the debt  The administrations latest debt limit request represents the fifth time it has asked for more borrowing authority  In total  the nations debt has already climbed by more than  3 trillion under President Bush  much of it borrowed from foreign nations like China and Japan  I dont hear anyone in the administration crowing about that statistic  The bottom line is that our country continues to face significant fiscal challenges that can only be addressed in a bipartisan fashion  The President came into office claiming to be a uniter and not a divider  I hope he will use the little time he has left to set aside his failed fiscal policies and work with Congress to constructively address these fiscal challenges  The American people expect and deserve nothing less
