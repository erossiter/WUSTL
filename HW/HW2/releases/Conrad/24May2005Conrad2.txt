Conrad Casts  Good Faith  Vote on Owen  Senator Seeks to Give Controversial Nominee Up or Down Vote                    May 24  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad voted today to end debate in the United States Senate on the nomination of Priscilla Owen of Texas  clearing the way for an up or down vote later in the week to confirm her to a seat on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals  The vote on Owen came shortly after a bipartisan team of Senate moderates negotiated an 11th hour compromise that averted a Constitutional crisis in the U S  Senate  The deal will clear the way for confirmation of most of the previously stalled judicial nominees  It also ensures that  as the Founding Fathers intended  a determined minority in the Senate can make sure decisions are not made in haste  That preserves an important component of the checks and balances set forth in the Constitution  As a gesture of good faith I am going to vote to end debate on Judge Owen  and help avoid the filibuster  Senator Conrad said  The U S  Senate had neared a historic crisis when the majority leadership took steps to break from longstanding Senate tradition and eliminate the right of senators to engage in extended debate  Normally  it requires 60 votes for cloture  to end debate and force an up or down vote on a nomination or legislation in the Senate  On Monday night  fourteen U S  Senators    seven Republican and seven Democrats    crafted a deal in which each Democrat pledged to vote for cloture on certain nominations to avoid a possible filibuster  and in exchange  each of the Republicans vowed to block the majority s plans to rewrite Senate rules  Senator Conrad was an original negotiator among the Senate moderates  but did not sign because he was concerned that the language lacked clarity  In our part of the country  good fences make for good neighbors  And clear agreements make for durable understandings  Senator Conrad said  This deal pulls the Senate away from an immediate crisis  But I would have preferred better agreement on what constitutes compliance with the terms
