Conrad Calls for Extension of the Patriot Act Senator Urges Colleagues to Extend Current Law  Not Let Legislation Expire                    December 20  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today called on his Senate colleagues to reach agreement on an extension of the current USA Patriot Act while negotiations continue on several controversial provisions  The one thing we should absolutely be able to agree on is that we will not allow the Patriot Act to lapse  That s the one thing that this deeply divided chamber should be able to agree on  an extension of the Patriot Act  Senator Conrad said on the floor of the U S  Senate  Members of the Senate are debating several provisions of the Patriot Act that allow the federal government to conduct surveillance and obtain personal records of law abiding private citizens  The antiterrorism law is scheduled to expire Dec  31  Senator Conrad is concerned about intrusive government surveillance of private citizens and the bill s movement towards the creation of a federal registry of gun owners  He is calling for an extension of the current law for several months  An extension will give Congress time to strike a balance between the need to vigorously pursue terrorists and the need to protect innocent Americans from unreasonable searches  There is an opportunity in these final hours to extend the Patriot Act for some period of time so this nation remains protected  I hope very much that cooler heads prevail and that we find a way to keep the Patriot Act in force  Senator Conrad said  In 2001  Senator Conrad voted in favor of the establishment of the USA Patriot Act  and he supported its reauthorization earlier this year  which passed the Senate unanimously
