Conrad Applauds Northern Border Patrol North Dakota Border Security Vital to Keeping Country Safe  Senator Says                   August 9  2007  Grand Forks  Homeland Security officials briefed Senator Kent Conrad today on the construction of the new Customs and Border Protection Air Branch being built in Grand Forks  Senator Conrad also met with Border Patrol agents and delivered a message to highlight the importance of patrolling the northern border  Much of the attention and resources is focused on the southern border  but we must remain equally diligent in protecting our northern border  Senator Conrad said  Recent events show the northern border can be equally susceptible  The work being done by the men and women of North Dakotas Customs and Border Patrol is vital to keeping America safe  Last year  law enforcement officials arrested 17 alleged terrorists in Canada with 3 tons of ammonium nitrate  the same kind of fertilizer used to make the Oklahoma City bomb in 1995  Additionally  the recent border crossing in New York of an individual on the no fly list carrying a dangerous strain of tuberculosis has sparked debate nationwide over whether the northern border is adequately protected  After conducting a thorough review of border patrol resources  a Congressional review found that Customs and Border Patrol is short handed by more than 1 700 officers and nearly 500 agents  Senator Conrad has long expressed concern with the lack of resources being deployed to protect Americas northern border  which is almost twice as long as the southern border  In todays meeting  Senator Conrad noted that America only has about 1 000 border patrol agents on the northern border compare to more than 12 000 on the southern border  In an effort to address the shortfall in resources and manpower along the northern border  Senator Conrad successfully pushed for Senate passage of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill last month  The bill contains  570 million to hire 3 000 new border patrol agents  It also funds the construction of new border fencing  and improves airport screenings to detect explosives
