Conrad  Tax Code Unfair To Military Senator Seeks Fix to Unjust IRS Rule on Combat Pay                    March 10  2005  Washington    Citing an Internal Revenue Service rule that he described as unfair and unjust to American fighting men and women  Senator Kent Conrad introduced legislation today that would allow our troops serving in combat zones to contribute to retirement accounts  Under existing IRS rules  troops who have been deployed to a combat zone for an entire calendar year can t legally contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts  Pay earned in a combat zone is not taxed  and only people who have had taxable income to report can contribute to an IRA  Senator Conrad s bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow military personnel to contribute to IRAs regardless of their deployment status  Many of our uniformed men and women have served in combat zones for more than a year  But that shouldn t prevent them for being able to contribute to their retirement  said Senator Conrad  This IRS rule is unfair and unjust  and I m asking my colleagues to join me in fixing it  Senator Conrad took the initiative to fix the law after hearing from a North Dakota based airman who had been told he had to withdraw money he had already contributed to his IRA  Senator Conrad s bill has won the support of the Military Officers Association of America  an organization with more than 370 000 members  We strongly support Senator Conrad s initiative to ensure that people in combat zones don t lose their ability to deposit money in IRAs  Every American needs these savings opportunities  and you shouldn t lose it simply because you re defending your country in a combat zone  said Steve Strobridge  a retired Air Force colonel and chief of governmental relations for the association  North Dakota is home to two Air Force bases and several National Guard units  including the 141st Engineer Combat Battalion  which only recently returned to North Dakota after a year long deployment in Iraq  Senator Conrad s bill would allow military personnel to amend their 2004 tax returns in order to contribute to IRAs from their combat pay
