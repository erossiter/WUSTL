Conrad and Dorgan Fight for North Dakota s Hospitals Enactment of Medicare Provisions are Vital to Secure Rural Health Care                   September 27  2007  Washington     U S  Senators Kent Conrad  D ND  and Byron Dorgan  D ND  secured a commitment from the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee today to take up two pieces of Medicare legislation that would help strengthen hospitals across North Dakota and secure critical funding for St  Josephs Hospital in Dickinson  Conrad and Dorgan secured a commitment from Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D MT  to take up legislation that would extend a Medicare provision that provides federal funding for nine North Dakota hospitals to better account for high labor costs  The provision  known as Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act  was originally introduced by Senator Conrad in 2003 in an effort to ensure that rural hospitals were compensated fairly by Medicare  Dorgan and Conrad also pressed Baucus to support legislation that would allow the state of North Dakota to designate St  Josephs as a Critical Access Hospital  The designation would recognize the hospitals role as the lone hospital in the Dickinson area and bring more revenue to the facility  but federal laws currently prevent it from being named a Critical Access Hospital because it is too near another facility with that designation  St  Josephs and many other North Dakota hospitals count on Medicare to make ends meet  That is why these two Medicare policies are so important  If they are not enacted  many of our rural hospitals might not be able to provide the kind of health care that North Dakotans deserve  Senator Conrad said  Access to health care is a critical issue for communities in our rural areas  and St  Josephs offers just one example of some changes that need to be made to ensure that is possible  said Senator Dorgan  a leader in the effort to strengthen rural hospitals by insisting that they be fairly compensated by Medicare  We need to change both the reimbursement rates for rural hospitals and the way we designate Critical Access Hospitals so residents of our rural areas dont have to wonder whether theyll have to drive hundreds of miles for basic care  Im glad Chairman Baucus agreed to take up this legislation and I look forward to working with him to move it through Congress  Senator Conrad is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees Medicare  He created the Section 508 Program in the Medicare drug bill which enables rural hospitals to make infrastructure improvements and offer competitive wages ensuring a highly qualified staff  He also helped create the Critical Access Hospital program in 1997 which has helped North Dakota rural hospitals secure additional federal funding
