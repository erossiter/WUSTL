Conrad  Bush Budget Irresponsible  Deceptive Rural Health  Farmers  Schools Take Cuts While Deficits Climb  Senator Says                    February 7  2005  Washington    North Dakota s schools  farmers and health care systems would suffer deep cuts under a budget proposed by President Bush that fails to address the nation s deepening deficits  according to Senator Kent Conrad  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  This budget hides the true fiscal condition of the country from the American people  Senator Conrad said today  When we pull back the curtain  we see the reality  more deficits  more debt  and more focus on the wrong priorities  We can do better  The bad news for North Dakota in the President s budget for Fiscal Year 2006  starting on Oct  1  far outweighs the good news  Senator Conrad said  Among the good things are a  40 million allotment to complete the flood control project in Grand Forks and an increase in military construction spending more than twice that of the current budget for Grand Forks and Minot Air Force bases  Senator Conrad said  But many of North Dakota s priorities    a strong agriculture industry  good schools  quality health care and water supply projects    would be shortchanged under the President s spending plan  Senator Conrad said  Besides the cuts in programs important to North Dakota  the President s budget fails to include the costs of several White House proposals  Senator Conrad said  It   ignores the  4 5 trillion  20 year cost of the President s Social Security privatization plan   neglects to fund the  774 billion 10 year cost of reforming the Alternative Minimum Tax   leaves out the  1 6 trillion 10 year cost of making his tax cuts permanent   fails to acknowledge the long term cost for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond 2005  and  provides only one year of discretionary spending policy detail  concealing the real impact of proposed funding levels  An analysis shows the President s spending plan shortchanges North Dakota priorities in agriculture  health care  education and elsewhere  Agriculture  The President s budget would enforce an across the board 5 percent cut in farm program payments  a shift in the cost of crop insurance payments to farmers  and a cap on loan deficiency payments  The across the board cut in counter cyclical payments and direct payments would cost North Dakota farmers and ranchers at least  17 million in lost revenues  Health care  The budget slashes rural health care funding and includes large cuts in Medicaid  The proposed cuts would result in a loss of  1 3 million per year for North Dakota s hospitals  rural clinics and training programs  Defense  The budget would retire 17 B 52 bombers based at Minot Air Force Base  Education  The President s budget eliminates  2 1 million in North Dakota funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program and  2 3 million for education technology grants to North Dakota schools  It shifts  4 2 million in education funding for North Dakota to an initiative that would require high school students to meet No Child Left Behind requirements  Overall  the President s plan fails to adequately fund No Child Left Behind  mandates  Veterans  The Bush budget shifts many costs of the Veterans Administration health programs to the veterans in the form of increased co payments and enrollment costs  The VA proposes collecting nearly  659 million from veterans in FY06  Energy  The President s budget directs the Power Management Agencies to increase their wholesale electricity rates 20 percent annually for the next several years until their rates reach market based rates  This provision will mean many North Dakota consumers of power from rural electric cooperatives could see rate hikes  Roughly 250 000 North Dakotans get their power from rural electric cooperatives  Water Projects  The Bush plan would eliminate  2 million in funding for Grafton  Wahpeton  and Buford Trenton Irrigation District projects    flood control projects that are critical to protecting residents and businesses from flooding threats  Indian Affairs  The President s plan eliminates federal support for the United Tribes Technical College  which has more than 600 students  Last year  UTTC received  3 5 million in federal aid  Economic Development  The President proposes cuts and continued centralization of both the Economic Development Administration and the Small Business Administration  jeopardizing badly needed economic development support in North Dakota  Transportation  The President s budget cuts passenger rail service by 71 percent  a move that would effectively force Amtrak into bankruptcy and will eliminate the Empire Builder  the line that runs through North Dakota  The plan also cuts funds for Essential Air Service contracts and provides insufficient highway bill funding  Senator Conrad noted that there are a few bright spots in the budget plan  The  40 million allotted for completion of the Grand Forks flood control project  This series of levees and flood walls is designed to prevent catastrophic flood damage similar to the devastation wrought by flooding in 1997  Minot and Grand Forks Air Force bases will see military construction funding more than double to  150 million  This total includes  130 million for military housing  making North Dakota the top state in Air Force housing construction in Fiscal Year 2006  The housing investment allotted for Grand Forks   87 million  is more than triple last year
