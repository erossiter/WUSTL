Senator Pays Tribute to Heroes of Flight 93 Conrad Introduces Legislation To Honor Passengers  Crew of Hijacked Plane                    April 12  2005  Washington   With overwhelming bipartisan support  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced legislation honoring the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 who died September 11  2001  when they wrestled for control of their hijacked plane  sending it to the ground rather than to a target such as the White House or the U S  Capitol  We know that terrorists hijacked Flight 93 to use as a weapon against our nation  Senator Conrad said  The plane was almost certainly headed for either the White House or the United States Capitol  The crew and passengers of Flight 93 stopped that from happening    and became heroes  We must not forget their courage and sacrifice  Senator Conrad s bill calls for a memorial to be built in the United States Capitol to honor the passengers and crew of Flight 93 who perished when their plane crashed in Shanksville  Penn  He first introduced his legislation in September 2004  on the third anniversary of the terrorist attacks that killed thousands when hijacked airliners were flown like missiles into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  Joined by Senator Rick Santorum  R PA   Senator Conrad has introduced his legislation to the 109th Congress  Senator Santorum has agreed to be the lead Republican co sponsor of Senator Conrad s bill in the Senate  Similar legislation was also introduced in the House of Representatives by a pair of Pennsylvania congressmen  Rep  Bud Shuster  a Republican  and Rep  John Murtha  a Democrat  It is appropriate that we commemorate the heroes of Flight 93 here at the Capitol  within the very walls that might have crumbled had they not made the ultimate sacrifice  Senator Conrad said  We are forever indebted to them
