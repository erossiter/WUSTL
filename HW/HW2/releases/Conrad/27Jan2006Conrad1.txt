Conrad Says  No  to Filibuster  Senator Meets Again With Supreme Court Nominee Judge Samuel Alito                    January 27  2006  Washington    Following his second private meeting with Judge Samuel Alito  Senator Kent Conrad announced today that he would not support a filibuster of the Supreme Court nominee  I will not participate in a filibuster of Judge Alito s confirmation to the Supreme Court  I do not believe it is warranted  Senator Conrad said  The American Bar Association has given him its highest rating  he was unanimously confirmed for his current spot on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals  and the majority of the American people are in favor of his confirmation  We should have a simple up and down vote by the full Senate  Judge Alito looked me in the eye and told me that he is not an ideologue  He promised he would not bring an ideological agenda to the Court  He said his commitment is to protect and defend the liberties set out in the Constitution  I take him at his word  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad first met with Judge Alito on Nov  5  At today s interview  which was offered by the White House  Senator Conrad questioned Judge Alito about his willingness to protect the American people from the unchecked power of big government  I had a lengthy discussion with Judge Alito about a wide range of issues  including Presidential power  He assured me that he believes the President is bound by the statutes passed by Congress and that he supports the system of checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution  Senator Conrad said  Based on today s meeting  I am leaning in favor of voting for Judge Alito  Senator Conrad said  However  I will not make a final determination until I have had the opportunity to further review several cases we discussed today  A final vote on the confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court has been scheduled for Tuesday morning
