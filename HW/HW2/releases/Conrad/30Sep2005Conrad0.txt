Statement of Senator Kent Conrad                     September 30  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement regarding Governor John Hoeven s announcement that he will not run for the United States Senate in 2006  I welcome the Governor s decision  I never believed he d be a candidate for the U S  Senate in 2006  because he had given his word that he would complete his four year term when he ran for governor just last year  The fact is  we have worked together effectively as a team for North Dakota  most recently in the fight to save our bases  I look forward to continuing to work together to serve the people of our state
