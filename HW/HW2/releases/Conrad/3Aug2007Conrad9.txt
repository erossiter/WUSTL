Conrad Calls for Increased Support for Soldiers Families Senator Sponsors Bills to Protect Families Caring for Wounded Warriors                   August 3  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today called for increased support for military families and co sponsored legislation to protect the jobs of family members who take time off to care for loved ones injured in combat  When a soldier is injured in combat they often face a long road to recovery  Family members are the key to their recuperation and are needed to give round the clock care  Senator Conrad said  They have enough to worry about in caring for their loved one  They do not need to worry about losing their job too  Currently  the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave to a spouse  parent or child acting as a caregiver for a person with a serious illness during a 12 month period  Senator Conrad is calling to extend that leave to between 24 and 52 weeks so that a family member can take time off to care for their loved one  The legislation Senator Conrad is sponsoring extends the FMLA to provide job protections for family members who are caring for a recovering service member at a military medical facility  The bipartisan bills enact key recommendations of the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors  According to the Commission report  FMLA is already used extensively by families of wounded troops  A survey of wounded personnel showed 33 percent of active duty and 22 percent of reserve troops report that a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they were in the hospital  It is common for severely injured service members to spend months recovering at facilities far away from home  As a result  some family members have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping their jobs  We must provide better support to our military families  They are the heart and soul of the men and women serving overseas  Senator Conrad said  This legislation will give the family members of our wounded soldiers the extra time and support they need to help their loved ones heal
