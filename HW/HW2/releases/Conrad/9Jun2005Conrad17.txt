Negotiations Begin on Highway Bill  Conrad Says Senator Leads Efforts to Reconcile Nation s  295 Billion Highway Spending Package                    June 9  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today met with House and Senate leaders to begin negotiations on a national highway bill  Senator Conrad s appointment to the House Senate conference committee puts him in a position to influence legislation that could direct close to  1 4 billion to North Dakota over six years  This is an important bill for our state  It could mean thousands of new jobs and more than a billion dollars in new road and bridge construction over the next five years  Senator Conrad said  I will continue to fight to make sure a real investment is made in our state s transportation infrastructure  The House Senate conference committee is seeking to reconcile differences in the legislation passed by both chambers earlier this year  Last month  the Senate passed a  295 billion bill containing  1 4 billion for North Dakota s roads  highways and interstates  In March  the House passed a version authorizing  284 billion  The legislation passed earlier by the Senate would also assure that North Dakotans get a greater return on the gas tax than under current law  Under the plan  North Dakota would get  2 08 back for every  1 in federal gas tax collected in the state  Only four states in the nation get a better return on tax dollars sent to Washington  The Senate bill also secures approximately  45 million in public transit formula funding for North Dakota    nearly double what the state received in the last transportation bill  In addition  Senator Conrad was successful in attaching an amendment to the highway bill that would cut the costs to the State and the cities of Bismarck and Mandan for replacing Liberty Memorial Bridge  Senator Conrad also included a provision to deal with the serious safety issue of roads in the Devils Lake basin holding back the lake s rising waters and functioning as dams  Senator Conrad was named to the conference committee because of his position as Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee and the key role he played in negotiating financing for the Senate highway bill  The 90 member conference committee consists of 30 Senators and 57 House members  We have a very short construction season in North Dakota  so we need to get to work on these projects as soon as possible  Senator Conrad said  It is not only critical that we come to a timely resolution  but we must come to a responsible solution  keeping in mind the value of infrastructure investments for future economic growth  The Senate bill has the right funding level for the nation and for North Dakota
