Conrad Continues to Fight for Farm Disaster Aid Republican Senators Join Conrad  Dorgan to Demand Vote on Disaster Assistance                   September 29  2006  Washington   A bipartisan group of more than 20 senators joined North  Dakota s Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan in demanding a vote today on a  bill to provide relief to farmers and ranchers recovering from natural disasters    including drought  flood and disease  The bill  introduced by Senator Conrad with 24 additional co sponsors  was  the third attempt this year by the two North Dakota senators to get a vote on  agriculture disaster assistance  Senator Conrad s first disaster assistance bill  easily passed the Senate  but was stripped out of a spending bill by the House  Republicans after the White House threatened a veto  Since then  Senate  Republican leaders have prevented any other votes on assisting farmers overcome  natural disasters  The clock is ticking  This legislation needs to pass today  Family farmers  and ranchers on the Great Plains are in dire need because of natural disaster    no different than any other family run firm on the Gulf Coast that lost their  business or home to last year s hurricanes  Senator Conrad said  No one would  be made whole by this bill  All we re asking is that we give family farmers and  ranchers a fair fighting chance to stay on the land  and stay in business  In an attempt to overcome objections to farm disaster relief voiced by the  Administration  the Senate bill drops assistance to help producers pay the  skyrocketing costs of fuel   costs that have eaten into the income of farmers  and ranchers substantially  Early forecasts predict that farm income in 2006 has  fallen  20 billion since last year  The most recent bill contains  4 9 billion  in assistance for producers who demonstrate yield losses of more than 35  percent  quality losses  and damage to livestock feed supplies  It also provides  payments for livestock losses  Besides Senators Conrad and Dorgan  the bill s co sponsors include Sens  Max  Baucus  D Mont   Maria Cantwell  D Wash   Tim Johnson  D S D   Ben Nelson   D Neb   John Thune  R S D   Ken Salazar  D Col   Conrad Burns  R Mont   Dick  Durbin  D Ill   Barack Obama  D Ill   Norm Coleman  R Minn   Chuck Schumer   D NY  Pat Roberts  R Kan   Mark Dayton  D Minn   Pat Leahy  D Vt   Harry Reid   D Nev   Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Jim Jeffords  I Vt   Tom Harkin  D Iowa  Patty  Murray  D Wash   Craig Thomas  R Wyo   Hillary Clinton  D NY  Daniel Inouye   D Hawaii  and Chuck Hagel  R Neb
