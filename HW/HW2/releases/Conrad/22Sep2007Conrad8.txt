Conrad  Hoeven See Progress in Northwood Recovery Public  Individual  Small Business Aid to Speed Town s Revival  ND Leaders Say                   September 22  2007  Northwood  Following an inspection of Northwoods efforts to recover from an August 26 tornado  Senator Kent Conrad and Governor John Hoeven today praised Northwood residents and community leaders for remaining steadfast in the face of adversity    The people of Northwood have demonstrated what it means to persevere  and what it means to be a good neighbor  Senator Conrad said  Together at the state and federal levels  we have secured public and individual recovery assistance that will help Northwood residents as they begin to rebuild their homes and lives    The residents of Northwood are working hard to rebuild their community  and we are working hard to support them with their efforts  Gov  Hoeven said  Thats why we worked to secure both Individual and Public Assistance  as well as help through our state and agency programs  There is much yet to be done  but were seeing real progress in the community  I commend them for their hard work and perseverance    The inspection of the Northwood clean up comes on the heels of the Federal Emergency Management Agencys  FEMA  declaration that Individual Assistance will be granted to eligible Northwood residents  The granting of Individual Assistance  coupled with the earlier awarding of public assistance  will soften the effects of underinsurance that Senator Conrad and Governor Hoeven said would have hindered the towns recovery efforts    FEMA officials recently said that since 90 percent of the homes in Northwood were insured  homeowners would not likely qualify for Individual Assistance   However  North Dakotas Congressional Delegation and Governor successfully argued that homeowners should qualify for Individual Assistance  because many families werent carrying sufficient insurance to cover rebuilding costs      The decision also triggered Small Business Administration disaster loans for businesses and homeowners     Current estimates show  3 5 million in residential uninsured losses in the community   2 5 million of which is on residential structures alone  Because residential damage assessments are ongoing  estimates of the extent of the damage are expected to grow        Based on current estimates  nearly 40 percent of the homes in Northwood were significantly impacted by this disaster   At least 22 were completely destroyed and 46 had major damage     Governor Hoeven and Senator Conrad were joined on the inspection of recovery efforts by Northwood Mayor Richard Johnson  Northwood City Administrator Marcy Douglas and City Councilman Ray Withers
