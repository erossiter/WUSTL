Delegation Leads Rural Health Briefing with Medicare Chief Accessible Health Care  Medicare Reimbursement Key Topics Addressed by Administrator                   December 10  2007  Bismarck  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy were joined by Kerry Weems  the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services  CMS   today for a meeting with health care providers from across the state to discuss ways to make health care more affordable and accessible for all North Dakotans    As head of CMS  Weems oversees Medicaid and Medicare    which together provide health benefits for about 90 million U S  residents    and manages a federal budget of about  600 billion     Weems was in North Dakota at the invitation of Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees Medicare    The programs of CMS are vital to so many North Dakotans  Senator Conrad said   I trust that Mr  Weems will leave North Dakota with a better understanding of the challenges our health care providers face and a new appreciation for the quality of care they provide   I hope he will then work with us to find ways to more adequately reimburse them for their services    I was pleased to accept Senator Conrad s invitation to visit with North Dakota health care leaders and discuss ways in which we can continue to assist and improve the lives of the state s Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries  Weems said     The health care industry in North Dakota faces unique challenges  and I appreciate Mr  Weems willingness to come to North Dakota and work with us on this critical issue  Senator Dorgan said  We need to make changes to ensure families across North Dakota get the high quality care that they deserve and that our providers are fairly paid so that they can continue to operate in rural parts of the state  This is an important step forward in that effort    I am pleased to welcome Mr  Weems to North Dakota and am excited to show him what North Dakotas health care providers have to offer   North Dakota provides some of the best health care in the country at the lowest cost  Congressman Pomeroy said   Despite the great service they provide  many of our providers are struggling to keep their doors open or continue to offer the same level of services because they are receiving inadequate payments from Medicare   I look forward to working with Mr  Weems to address this inequity    A key concern of North Dakotas hospital executives is the pending expiration of Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act  which ensures that North Dakota hospitals are compensated more fairly by Medicare for high labor costs   Senator Conrad originally created this provision in 2003  and Senator Conrad and Congressman Pomeroy led the House and Senate negotiations that successfully enacted Section 508 in to law    Congress continues to work to reauthorize Section 508  ensuring vital federal funding for nine hospitals in North Dakota and 120 hospitals across the nation     Prior to the Bismarck meeting  the delegation and Weems traveled to Dickinson to meet with the board of St  Josephs Hospital  The meeting focused primarily on efforts to have CMS designate the facility as a Critical Access Hospital   The designation would recognize St  Josephs role as the lone hospital in the Dickinson area and bring more revenue to the facility   Federal laws currently prevent St  Josephs from being named a Critical Access Hospital because it is too near another facility with that designation
