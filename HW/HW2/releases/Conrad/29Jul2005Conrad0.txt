National Energy Bill Passes Congress Bill Contains Conrad Provisions Benefiting ND Creating Jobs  Boosting Economy                    July 29  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad announced today that a national energy bill that promotes substantial investment in North Dakota is one step closer to becoming law  The comprehensive energy bill has passed both chambers of congress and is now on its way to the President for his signature  This bill takes steps toward greater energy independence for the United States and lays the groundwork for a plan that promotes substantial investment in North Dakota s energy sector  Senator Conrad said  But still  even bolder steps must be taken to make the U S  more energy independent  A senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad crafted several energy tax incentives intended to increase the development of North Dakota s energy industry  The legislation  approved by both Houses of Congress  includes many of Senator Conrad s initiatives  including a provision that will help develop plans for a proposed  750 million coal to liquid fuel plant in North Dakota  Additional Conrad provisions include  An Extension of the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit  One of Senator Conrad s most important energy policy goals is to develop North Dakota s potential for wind power  a clean  abundant source of energy  To that end  Senator Conrad secured a two year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit  Clean Coal Tax Credits  The energy bill includes Senator Conrad s tax credits for power companies that use clean coal technology  These credits include  800 million for a 20 percent investment tax credit for power plants using the most advanced clean coal technology  and  500 million for a 15 percent investment tax credit for other advanced clean coal power plants  During consideration of these tax credits in the Finance Committee  Senator Conrad worked with his colleagues to ensure that plants burning lignite coal would qualify for the credits  Senator Conrad s measures would strengthen North Dakota s lignite coal sector  an industry that has created some of the best paying jobs in the state  Ethanol and Biodiesel Tax Credits  Ethanol and biodiesel offer tremendous economic potential for North Dakota  which is home to many fuel producing crops  Senator Conrad drafted an assortment of tax credits in the Energy Bill to encourage the production of these renewable fuels  These include the extension of existing biodiesel credits through 2008 and the creation of a 10 cents per gallon credit for biodiesel producers  Senator Conrad also helped secure a Renewable Fuels Standard  requiring the use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels  like biodiesel and ethanol  by 2012  This standard will increase demand for many of North Dakota s fuel producing crops  In addition  he expanded an existing 10 cent per gallon ethanol credit for 30 million gallon per year ethanol plants to include facilities that produce up to 60 million gallons of ethanol per year  This tax credit could be worth up to  1 5 million for most of North Dakota s existing or planned ethanol plants  Expanded Existing Ethanol Tax Credit  Senator Conrad expanded an existing 10 cent per gallon tax credit for ethanol plants to include plants that produce up to 60 million gallons of ethanol per year  As a result  additional North Dakota ethanol manufacturing plants will be eligible for a tax credit worth up to  1 5 million per year    encouraging the production of this renewable energy source  Coal to Liquid Fuel Federal Loan Guarantees  As the price of oil increases  coal to liquid fuel is becoming a more attractive option in coal rich states like North Dakota  Senator Conrad inserted a provision in the Energy Bill to ensure that any future facilities that produce transportation fuel from coal in North Dakota will qualify for federal loan guarantees  This provision will help obtain funding for a proposed  750 million coal to liquid fuel plant in North Dakota  Renewable Energy Bonds for Cooperatives and Tribes  Senator Conrad drafted this provision in an effort to encourage co ops  public power systems and Indian tribes to invest in wind and other renewable energy projects  The Energy Bill provides  800 million for these organizations to expand their renewable energy development by issuing a new category of tax credit bonds  Investment in North Dakota s Transmission Capacity  Senator Conrad has taken action to make sure that electric consumers in North Dakota continue to receive cheap  reliable power  He developed tax incentives to help utilities invest in electricity transmission and pollution control  Specifically  the energy bill accelerates the depreciation period of transmission lines  providing a needed boost in funds for companies to invest in new high voltage transmission lines  Another Conrad provision will facilitate investments in pollution control property by providing critical financial assistance to power companies that have made the decision to spend more money on pollution control  This will foster a growing demand for North Dakota s energy resources and help keep our air clean  Natural Gas Incentives  Senator Conrad supported several provisions in the Energy Bill to encourage companies to invest in new natural gas infrastructure  Specifically  these provisions will accelerate the depreciation period of natural gas distribution and gathering lines  This initiative could result in lower natural gas prices in the long term  The federal energy bill also calls for  30 million to be set aside for the development of 10 enhanced oil recovery demonstration projects in the Williston Basin  These demonstration projects will not only increase oil production  but will also prevent carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere by injecting it underground  In addition  the energy legislation calls for further development of clean coal technology  The bill secures federal loan guarantees for new lignite fired coal plants and authorizes a Department of Energy program to study mercury removal from lignite coal
