Senator Conrad s Floor Statement Supporting Judge John Roberts                     September 28  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today delivered a statement on the Senate floor supporting the confirmation of Judge John Roberts for the U S  Supreme Court  The following is the Senator s Statement  From the beginning I told the White House that I would like to see a nominee that the vast majority of the American people would say   yes  that is the quality of person that ought to be on the United States Supreme Court   When the nomination of Judge Roberts was first announced  my initial impression was that he met that test  I had a chance to visit with personally at some length in my office  and I concluded from that visit that Judge Roberts is exceptional  Not only is he of high intelligence and strong character  he also is someone of Midwestern values and honesty and decency  I have looked at his record  I find that he is in the judicial mainstream  I think he has a healthy conservativism  believing that the job of a justice is not to make the law  but to interpret the law  That is the appropriate role for a judge in our system  And I think has it right with respect to that issue  I know there are groups who feel very strongly on one side or another  and there are colleagues who have made different judgments  I respect that  But I believe Judge Roberts is the kind of nominee that deserves our support  And he will have mine  The Senate is expected to vote on the confirmation of Judge Roberts tomorrow morning
