Conrad  Adopt North Dakota Teacher Standards Senator Urges Education Secretary to OK North Dakota Teacher Plan                    January 25  2005  Washington    At a meeting in his Capitol Hill office  Senator Kent Conrad urged the Education Secretary to reverse an Education Department s earlier ruling that North Dakota s elementary school teachers don t meet highly qualified standards under No Child Left Behind  This is exactly what we feared with  No Child Left Behind     that Washington wouldn t recognize the flexibility we need in rural states to meet the new highly qualified standards for teachers  Senator Conrad said  I remember many of my teachers growing up in North Dakota  I can tell you that many of them would have made fine United States Senators    they were people of outstanding character and intelligence  Yet I wonder if they would have met this burdensome qualification  Under No Child Left Behind  elementary school teachers must demonstrate competency in several subjects  including English  math  science  social studies and foreign languages  The Education Department rejected a North Dakota plan that state officials and educators say would have met federal standards by requiring teachers to hold teaching degrees with majors in the field of instruction and a state license  At stake are the futures of about 3 800 teachers in North Dakota who were affected by the Education Department s decision  Education officials in North Dakota fear that the federal agency s ruling would prompt a wave of retirements by teachers who would rather leave the classroom then endure onerous training in subjects many have been teaching for years  Approximately 40 percent of elementary teachers in North Dakota are eligible to retire  I ve asked Secretary Spellings to reconsider the Administration s decision  It poses a great hardship on North Dakota and our school children and educators  and I don t believe that was the intent of  No Child Left Behind    Senator Conrad said  North Dakota s teaching requirements are rigorous and reasonable enough as our national test scores demonstrate
