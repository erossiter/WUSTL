Canadian Dike Must Be Removed  Conrad says Senator Urges Ambassador to Remove Barriers Responsible for Flooding ND                    May 18  2006  Washington  In a meeting on Capitol Hill today Senator Kent Conrad told Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson that Canada must completely remove a Canadian dike that flooded thousands of acres of farmland in Pembina County  North Dakota  This Canadian dike is a road to ruin for many North Dakota farmers  Senator Conrad said  We must take action now to protect our farmers and our communities against future flooding  The only appropriate solution is to remove the dike completely  The flooding problem involves a 26 mile stretch of dike built along the Canadian side of the international border between the U S  and Canada  Last month  as both the swollen Red River and Pembina River overflowed their banks  natural drainage of the floodwaters was blocked by the dike in Canada  As a result  floodwaters were forced back into North Dakota  flooding farmland in Neche and Pembina  Canada has described the dike as a road  Today s meeting was the result of a letter Senator Conrad sent to Wilson last month in which he said the current situation was unacceptable and called on the Canadian government to come to the table and discuss the dike  Senator Conrad told Wilson today that the dike has too few culverts to allow the proper drainage of water and the culverts that do exist are too small in capacity to provide any relief  Senator Conrad said the road dikes must be removed as soon as possible in order to allow water to follow its natural flow  Canadian officials have said that they are willing to address North Dakota s concerns regarding the dike in exchange for concessions to the Devils Lake outlet  We ve already negotiated a deal with Canada regarding Devils Lake  I m not going be forced into making concessions on that agreement to have this dike removed  I m not going to rob Peter to pay Paul  Senator Conrad said  This dike is acting as a bottle cork  preventing the natural drainage of the Red River into Canada  It is wreaking havoc on our farmers and our communities  Canada needs to remove this dike now
