Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on USDA s Announcement of Ag Disaster Assistance                    August 29  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement in response to  Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns announcement today  After touring drought  stricken farms in South Dakota Johanns said the USDA would provide  50 million  to states with severe drought counties  In addition  the USDA would provide  18  million in emergency conservation program funding to allow producers to cover  losses associated with the drought and  11 million to refurbish native  grasslands in drought areas  After spending months denying the existence of a slow moving disaster on the  plains  the Secretary of Agriculture has finally recognized that our farmers and  ranchers are facing a crippling drought and other natural disasters  But what s  being offered is too little  too late  This disaster aid doesn t even come close to meeting the needs of rural  America  The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administration should be  embarrassed if this is their response to this devastating disaster  This is like  giving a Band Aid to someone who has lost a limb  They are still going to bleed  to death  We need nothing less than a comprehensive disaster bill to cover 2005 and  2006 losses  I will pursue this assistance at every opportunity  Last week  hundreds of farmers and ranchers gathered with Senator Conrad at  the Bismarck Civic Center demanding that the White House and the Republican  Congress stop blocking federal disaster relief  Earlier this year  Republican leaders in the House of Representatives  eliminated a natural disaster aid package authored by Senator Conrad that would  have provided  175 million for North Dakota farmers and ranchers recovering from  last year s natural disasters  including flood  frost and disease  Senator  Conrad s legislation passed the Senate earlier this year with bipartisan  support  Joining Senator Conrad were Governor John Hoeven  Senator Byron Dorgan   Congressman Earl Pomeroy  Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson  North Dakota  Farmers Union President Robert Carlson  With rainfall less than 20 percent of normal in parts of North Dakota  and  temperatures more than 90 degrees on at least 23 days in July  many producers  face dramatic losses  while ranchers experiencing feed and water shortages are  selling off their herds  Last year  natural disasters in North Dakota prevented  farmers from planting more than a million acres
