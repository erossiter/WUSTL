Rural Ambulance Squads Get Boost in Conrad Bill                    May 6  2005          Bismarck    Flanked by representatives of a dozen rural North Dakota ambulance squads  Senator Kent Conrad today unveiled bipartisan legislation to improve funding for rural squads that have been historically shortchanged under federal policies  This is about saving lives  Ambulance squads save lives  and this bill helps to save our rural ambulance service  Senator Conrad said  People who live in rural areas shouldn t have to worry whether an ambulance will come when called  And rural ambulance squads shouldn t have to worry whether unfair Medicare policies will reduce readiness  Senator Conrad s Rural Access to Emergency Services  RAES  Act is important because 54 percent of North Dakota s population live in areas served by rural emergency medical service squads  When rural squads provide care and transport to Medicare patients  their Medicare reimbursement falls short of the actual costs for providing that care    creating a fiscal hardship for the squads that are largely volunteer organizations  The RAES Act would take steps to reduce inequities in current Medicare reimbursement  and provide new training and technology resources to rural squads  Dean Lampe  executive director of the North Dakota EMS Association  said his statewide group endorses Senator Conrad s RAES Act  Ambulance service is a critical part of rural health care  Our rural ambulance squads would have a much harder time providing care without the kind of resources provided in Senator Conrad s legislation  Lampe said  We re pleased to stand with Senator Conrad and endorse his bill  We re pleased that we have someone like Senator Conrad in Washington  D C   making health care in North Dakota better  Senator Conrad said he intends to introduce the bill  when he returns to Washington  D C   with Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas  a Republican  as co sponsor in the Senate  The House version of the bill has already drawn bipartisan sponsorship  with Rep  Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota  a Democrat  and Rep  Mark Kennedy of Minnesota  a Republican  The RAES Act serves to correct several inequities that have long put rural ambulance squads at a disadvantage  Rural EMS is too important a part of our health care network to neglect  Senator Conrad said
