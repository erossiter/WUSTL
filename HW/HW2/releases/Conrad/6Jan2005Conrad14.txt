Conrad Questions Ag Secretary Nominee Stresses Need for Greater USDA Oversight to Protect Consumers from Mad Cow                    January 6  2005  Washington    Citing the emergence of a new case of Canadian mad cow and evidence of that nation s failure to effectively enforce rules designed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease  Senator Kent Conrad today called for immediate Congressional hearings into Administration plans to reopen beef trade with Canada  Senator Conrad made his request during a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing into the confirmation of Nebraska Gov  Michael Johanns  the nominee to be Secretary of Agriculture  Senator Conrad also questioned Johanns  position on the proposed rule to allow the renewed cattle trade  I believe we need to address this new case of Canadian mad cow  We need to take action to ensure we fully consider the implications of these issues before the March implementation of the USDA s rule  Senator Conrad said  There are many concerns here  including public safety  trust of the market  and future trade potential  In May 2003  Canada discovered its first case of mad cow and the U S  closed its border to Canadian beef and cattle imports  Months later  a second case of mad cow was found  this time in a Canadian born Holstein in Washington state  In wake of the U S  case of mad cow  Senator Conrad convened the first Senate hearing on the deadly disease and gathered testimony from North Dakota ranchers and agricultural health experts  In a separate letter Senator Conrad co authored with Congressman Henry Waxman  of California  the Senator detailed evidence gathered by the U S  Food and Drug Administration that prompted the FDA to issue import alerts to suspend beef products from certain Canadian companies  I am far from convinced that Canada is effectively enforcing its own regulations  Senator Conrad told Johanns  If confirmed  I urge you to reconsider  for the moment  the reopening of trade with Canada until we have greater assurances they are following their own rules  Timeline of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  BSE in the U S  Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  which oversees farm policy  and on the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees trade  He has been a longtime proponent of initiating safeguards to prevent disease from contaminating our nation s livestock  1986   The deadly disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE   commonly called mad cow disease  is discovered in cattle in Britain  1988   The British government bans cattle feed containing cow parts and begins destroying more than 3 million BSE infected cattle  May 20  2003   Scientists confirm a case of mad cow disease in Canada  Within hours  the U S  announces a ban on all imports of Canadian beef  Aug  9  2003   The USDA announces it is easing its ban on Canadian beef to allow for the importation of select cuts from cattle under 30 months old  Dec  23  2003   The USDA announces the discovery of a case of mad cow disease in a dairy cow in Washington state  Dec  24  2003   The U S  cattle industry suffers a drastic drop in cattle prices and the loss of beef exports to several countries  including Mexico  Russia  Brazil  Japan  and South Korea  Dec  27  2003   The USDA announces that an ear tag on the infected Washington state cow identifies it as being born in Canada  Dec  30  2003   The USDA announces new regulations on cattle slaughter  including bans on using downer cattle for human consumption  Jan  6  2004   Senator Conrad calls on the USDA to indefinitely postpone its proposal to allow the resumption of live cattle imports from Canada  Jan  10  2004   Senator Conrad convenes a Senate field hearing in Bismarck to gather testimony from ranchers  agricultural economists and animal health experts on the USDA s handling of the mad cow incident and how that case impacted North Dakota  and our nation s  beef producers  Our ranchers are vital to North Dakota and to our country  Their future livelihood depends on our ability to continually reassure consumers that U S  beef remains the safest in the world  Senator Conrad said  Jan  27  2004   Senator Conrad questions Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman over the four day gap between the USDA s Dec  23 announcement that a Holstein in Washington state was sick with mad cow and the agency s Dec  27 release that the cow was Canadian bred  We need to establish when in fact it was known by USDA that this dairy cow carried a Canadian ear tag  and when that information was reported to the public  Senator Conrad said  That lag in information had an effect on our markets and on our cattle producers  Jan  27  2004   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission questions whether some traders had early knowledge of the mad cow discovery prior to the USDA s Dec  23 announcement  Those traders may have bet on a decline in live cattle prices following the USDA s first public announcement on Dec  23  Feb  13  2004   Senator Conrad  is joined by Senators Tom Harkin and Patrick Leahy in pressing the Bush administration to keep its pledge to immediately adopt a verifiable  uniform and efficient livestock ID system  Weeks prior  Secretary Veneman promised to immediately adopt the ID system  April 6  2004   Unconvinced that Canada has taken the necessary steps to fully protect the livestock destined for shipment to the U S   Senator Conrad urges Secretary Veneman to maintain the ban on the import of live Canadian cattle  May 13  2004   Federal regulators tell Senator Conrad that they are investigating allegations of illegal insider trading in the live cattle markets prior to the USDA s December announcement of a case of mad cow in the U S  If there was a leaked report  that is really something that cannot be tolerated  That is something that throws the credibility of the markets in question  Senator Conrad said May 20  2004   News reports detail cases of the USDA granting exemptions to certain U S  beef processing companies  allowing these companies to import ground beef and other processed beef from Canada  The import of such Canadian beef products is supposed to have been banned by USDA  May 20  2004   Senator Conrad urges President Bush to ask for the resignation of Secretary Veneman following news reports that the USDA had ignored its own ban on the import of Canadian beef  It now appears that the USDA has secretly and selectively violated its own publicly announced ban on the importation of processed beef from Canada  Senator Conrad wrote in a letter to President Bush  In fact  the report is so damaging to the credibility and integrity of the USDA that I believe you should ask the Secretary of Agriculture to resign  Oct  1  2004   Senator Conrad writes Secretary Veneman to express his concern over reports indicating the Canadian Food Inspection Agency  CFIA  has determined that livestock feed produced from a rendered Canadian cow that had mad cow was sold and possibly fed to other cattle  The report also notes that the CFIA is not enforcing standards consistent with the recommendations of the scientific community to ban the use of specified risk material  a primary way by which mad cow is transmitted  in livestock feed and control the potential for feed contamination  Dec  30  2004   The CFIA says initial tests may have turned up another case of mad cow    in a 10 year old dairy cow  Dec  29  2004   The USDA announces that beginning March 7  2005  young live cattle from Canada will be allowed across the border into the U S  Jan  3  2005   CFIA confirms that the Canadian dairy cow tested positive for BSE  Jan  5  2005   Senator Conrad urges Gov  Michael Johanns  the Agriculture Secretary nominee  to reconsider the administration s decision to allow cattle imports from Canada in light of evidence that Canada is not effectively enforcing its rules designed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease  Jan  6  2005   Gov  Johanns appears before the U S  Senate Agriculture Committee for a confirmation hearing  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Committee  questions Johanns about the discovery of a third Canadian born cow with mad cow disease  If confirmed  I urge you to implement tougher regulations and better testing to ensure the safety of both livestock and consumers in North Dakota and across the nation
