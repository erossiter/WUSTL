Reinforce FREEDOM Act Introduced by Conrad Legislation Supports First Responders that Lose Personnel to Military Call Ups                   August 2  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced legislation to assist local law enforcement and emergency agencies that lose personnel called up for service in the National Guard or Reserves  Many of our nations first responders double as citizen soldiers  As more and more of these police and emergency personnel are called up to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan  a void is left in communities across the nation  Senator Conrad said  My legislation will help fill the gaps and ensure we keep the ranks of first responders full while their colleagues are fighting overseas  Earlier this year  Senator Conrad held a special field hearing of the U S  Senate Budget Committee in Fargo with first responders  Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes testified that one of the greatest challenges he faced was losing officers called up for military service in Iraq or Afghanistan  At one point  15 of the Fargo police department s 125 sworn officers were serving Guard duty abroad  In response  Senator Conrad drafted the Reinforce First Responders and Emergency Employees Deployed Overseas in the Military Act  better known as the Reinforce FREEDOM Act  The Conrad bill makes grants available to first responder agencies that have employees in the National Guard or Reserves on active duty  The grants help pay for temporary staffing needs  equipment  as well as additional overtime for personnel  A report by the nonpartisan Institute for Policy Studies found that 44 percent of the nations police forces had at one time been deprived of officers by Guard call ups  The frequent call ups of first responders puts an added strain on the smaller departments that operate on shoestring budgets
