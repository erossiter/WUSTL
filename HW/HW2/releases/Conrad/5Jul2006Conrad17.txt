Farm Leaders Join Conrad to Declare Trade Victory Senator  No WTO Deal is Better Than a Bad WTO Deal                    July 5  2006  Bismarck    Flanked by leaders from North Dakota s most prominent farm and  commodity organizations  Senator Kent Conrad today said the failure of World  Trade Organization talks to force steep cuts in U S  farm programs is a victory  for North Dakota agriculture  At issue were efforts by foreign countries in those global trade talks to  slash domestic support for U S  farmers and ranchers    a move strongly opposed  by Senator Conrad  Those talks  in Geneva  Switzerland  collapsed over the  holiday weekend  Despite the failure to reach a deal over the weekend  Senator  Conrad warned foreign trade partners will continue to seek competitive  advantages over U S  farmers  Having no deal at all is better than a bad deal for American agriculture   The collapse of WTO talks is a victory for our farmers and ranchers  Senator  Conrad said  But this won t be the end of it  Our trading partners will  continue to demand what amounts to unilateral disarmament for American farming  Last year  the Bush Administration had offered to cut U S  farm programs by  60 percent if other countries would open their markets to accept more  agricultural imports  But other countries failed to significantly open their  markets  and instead demanded far deeper cuts in U S  farm programs  Amid recent reports that the Administration might agree to this proposal   Senator Conrad sent a letter to the President saying that would be  unacceptable  The letter was signed by a majority of the U S  Senate    a  bipartisan coalition of 57 senators    and was supported by most of the major  national commodity groups  as well as the National Farmers Union and American  Farm Bureau  Our letter sent a clear signal that the Senate will not support selling out  American agriculture  Today  I m standing with North Dakota s agriculture  leaders to show our continuing  united opposition to any deal that would shred  our farm programs and fail to produce new market gains  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad was joined at the press conference today by representatives  from the North Dakota Grain Growers Association  the North Dakota Wheat  Commission  the North Dakota Farmers Union  the North Dakota Farm Bureau and  other agriculture organizations
