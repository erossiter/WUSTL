Conrad Secures B 52 Force Strength Congress Votes to Maintain Bomber Numbers at Minot Air Force Base                   December 14  2007  Washington  Legislation Senator Kent Conrad authored that would upgrade the nations fleet of B 52s and block a Pentagon plan to dramatically reduce Americas bomber force cleared its final hurdle today as Congress overwhelmingly approved the 2008 Defense Authorization Bill    The B 52 is an indispensable tool for our nations military  I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate and the House recognize that it is in the strategic interest of our country that we maintain a sizeable bomber force and that each plane is outfitted with the most technologically advanced equipment  Senator Conrad said     Senator Conrads amendment blocks a Department of Defense proposal to reduce the nations B 52 force to just 56 aircraft   The Pentagons proposed plan would have greatly impacted the nations only two B 52 bomber bases Minot Air Force Base and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana      This legislation mandates that the Air Force maintain 63 active aircraft  11 backup aircraft and two reserve aircraft   As a result  the Senators amendment also blocks a Pentagon effort to downgrade the maintenance status of some B 52s      Senator Conrad strongly opposes the creation of hangar queens  planes that are not regularly flown   His amendment requires technological upgrades to the entire fleet  ensuring the planes are using the latest in defense technology     Senator Conrads legislation also continues to bar the Pentagon from retiring any B 52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study required by Congress last year   This detailed study would address Americas long range strike capabilities during the time between the proposed drawdown of the B 52 fleet in 2008 and the scheduled delivery of new bombers in 2018     Senator Conrad is a longtime proponent of the B 52 and its mission at Minot Air Force Base  In ongoing talks with Air Force Chief of Staff General T  Michael Moseley  Senator Conrad has stressed the strategic importance of maintaining the nations fleet of B 52s and warned that reducing the fleet would damage Americas long range strike capabilities    It makes absolutely no sense to try to save money by cutting Americas B 52 fleet   They are the cheapest bombers to operate in our inventory   With ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  the last thing our nation should do is deplete our B 52 strength  Senator Conrad said    Senator Byron Dorgan is an original co sponsor of the amendment
