Senate Passes Conrad Farm Disaster Bill  Senator s Legislation Provides Badly Needed Relief to Farmers   Ranchers                    May 4  2006  Washington    The U S  Senate today voted overwhelmingly to pass Senator Kent Conrad s legislation to provide federal disaster relief to North Dakota farmers and ranchers who saw crop and livestock losses during last year s episodes of frost  flooding and disease  This is a big win for North Dakota agriculture    a major step toward keeping our state s top industry operating  Senator Conrad said  The vast majority of my colleagues agree that farmers and ranchers across the country were dealt an unfair hand by Mother Nature last year  This bill won t make any family farmer or rancher completely whole  but will help keep some of them from leaving farming  Earlier this spring  Senator Conrad introduced the Emergency Agriculture Disaster Assistance Act of 2006  The legislation  which has 27 bipartisan cosponsors  provides emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies  It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock and help farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last year s hurricanes  Senator Conrad said his legislation would provide about  175 million to North Dakota farmers and ranchers  The bill also includes  6 million for flooded lands in the Devils Lake region  The bill was co sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators  including Conrad s North Dakota colleague  Sen  Byron Dorgan  Both Governor John Hoeven and Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson had flown to Washington to lobby for passage of the bill  The Administration has openly stated that it is against disaster aid to America s farmers and ranchers  Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns has told reporters he could not support the ag disaster legislation  For the Secretary of Agriculture to say that only farmers in the Gulf States have been impacted by disaster is completely incompetent  We need a new Secretary of Agriculture if that is what this one reports to the President  Senator Conrad said
