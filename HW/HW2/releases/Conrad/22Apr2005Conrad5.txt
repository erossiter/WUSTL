Bush  Conrad Talk About Social Security President Asks Senator to White House For One on One Talk                    April 22  2005  Washington    In response to questions from the press following a story in Friday s edition of The New York Times detailing an hour long meeting in the White House residence with President Bush  Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement  The President invited me down to the White House on Wednesday for a conversation about Social Security and related issues  It was a far ranging conversation  and I spoke to him about the need to address the broader financial challenges facing the country    not just Social Security  but Medicare  the trade deficit and the budget deficit as well  I told the President that our country has to deal with the entire collection of fiscal imbalances  That means we have to look at the shortfall in Medicare  which is far greater than the shortfall in Social Security  We need to deal with the budget deficits  which are at record levels  And we have to look at the trade deficit  which threatens the value of the dollar  You have to deal with all of these challenges together so people can understand the kind of threat they pose to the nation s economic security  As I said to the President  if we re going to make progress  it s going to require a bipartisan approach  Both sides have to be willing to negotiate across a broad range of issues  and unless you deal with the full picture it is unlikely that people will be persuaded of the need for action  Without the full agenda in front of the American people  and in front of my colleagues  I don t think there will be action on any one of the challenges facing us  Unfortunately  the plan that the President has fails to address the problem of solvency for Social Security  In fact  in many ways  it makes it worse because they want to borrow a boatload of money  I think that is most unwise  Between the massive debt and the steep benefit cuts  that is a combination that I simply could not support  and the people who sent me here would not support
