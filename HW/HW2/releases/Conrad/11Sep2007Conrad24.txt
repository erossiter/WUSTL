Conrad Goes to Bat for Young Veterans Senator Backs Bill Helping Former Service Members Find Job Opportunities                   September 11  2007  Washington   Senator Kent Conrad today signed on to support the Hire a Hero Act  national legislation to help military personnel find jobs as they transition into civilian life  These servicemen and women are among our nations best  The skills  values and training of these young men and women are unmatched  They should not be going from the frontline to the unemployment line  Senator Conrad said  Our economy is in need of this type of quality work force  We just need to help connect the dots  The national unemployment rate for young veterans  many of whom have served in Iraq and Afghanistan is three times the national average  This unemployment has placed a financial and emotional strain on young veterans and their families  At the same time  many industries are facing skilled labor shortages that could be offset by the influx of military personnel transitioning back to the workforce  The Hire a Hero Act would create a grant program to assist members of the National Guard and Reserve as well as former and current members of the Armed Forces in securing employment in the private sector  The bi partisan legislation authorizes  25 million annually to the National Guard Bureau which will  in turn  award funding on a competitive basis to nonprofit organizations that assist former members of the Armed Forces in finding quality jobs  The men and women of our Armed Forces have fought to ensure our freedom and the future of our nation  We have a responsibility to help them pursue their dreams for a bright future  For many  that future starts with finding meaningful employment  Senator Conrad said
