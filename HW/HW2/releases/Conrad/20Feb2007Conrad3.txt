Conrad Fights to Keep COPS in ND Communities Senator s Hearing Examines President s Proposed Cuts to First Responders                   February 20  2007  Fargo  Senator Kent Conrad today convened a special field hearing of the U S  Senate Budget Committee at the Fargodome to discuss the President s proposed budget cuts to state and local law enforcement and emergency personnel and their impact on North Dakota s communities  No one is more concerned with getting our budget deficits under control than I am   However  we cannot do it at the expense of safe streets and safe communities  Senator Conrad said  One of the most basic responsibilities for a government is to ensure the safety of its citizens  Senator Conrad  the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee  chaired the field hearing in response to the President s fiscal year 2008 budget proposal which dramatically cuts public safety programs in rural states like North Dakota   Among those testifying at the hearing were Birch Burdick  State s Attorney for Cass County  Keith Ternes  Fargo Police Chief  Paul Laney  Cass County Sheriff  Bruce Hoover  Fargo Fire Chief  Terry Traynor  Assistant Director of North Dakota Association of Counties  and Ken Habiger  President of Casselton Volunteer Ambulance Service  On February 5  the President released his budget proposal for fiscal year 2008   The President proposes steep cuts in federal funding for numerous public safety and law enforcement programs including State Homeland Security grants  cut 65    Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grants  cut 31    Assistance to Firefighter Grants  cut 56    and COPS Grants  cut 94     COPS Grants are especially vital to North Dakota because they provide resources to fight the methamphetamine crisis plaguing the state  North Dakota has received more than  36 million in COPS funding since the beginning of the program   This funding has provided more than 200 additional police officers and sheriff deputies to engage in community policing activities  crime fighting  anti meth activities  and meth lab clean up   More than 70 local and state law enforcement agencies in North Dakota have directly benefited from COPS funding   Also  more than  2 million in COPS funding has gone to school officers to improve safety for students  teachers  and administrators  The witnesses at today s Budget Committee hearing testified to the importance of the partnership among federal  state  and local governments and highlighted how federal funds for law enforcement have been put to good use in North Dakota  This is about the safety of our citizens   To deny the federal government s responsibility in this arena is simply wrongheaded  Senator Conrad said   This is not the time for the federal government to step away from its responsibilities                           Fact Sheet Federal support for first responders comes from several programs at the Department of Justice  DOJ  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    At DOJ  the COPS program and the Byrne JAG formula grant program provide direct assistance to local law enforcement agencies  Federal Support  COPS  The COPS program awards funds to local law enforcement agencies that can be used to hire police officers  rehire police officers who have been laid off  and obtain equipment or support systems that result in an increase in the number of officers deployed in community oriented policing   COPS funds can also be used for non hiring purposes such as training  purchasing equipment  or providing resources to develop community oriented policing strategies   One notable COPS program is for meth grants   This funding supports enforcement  training  and lab cleanup activities nationwide  but is concentrated in areas with the greatest need for assistance in combating methamphetamine production  distribution and use   For 2008  the President s budget requests  32 million for the COPS program  a cut of  510 million below the 2007 level   The level of funding for COPS meth grants for 2007 will be determined by DOJ   The 2006 level was  64 million   North Dakota has received more than  36 million in COPS funding since the beginning of the program   This funding has provided funding for more than 200 additional police officers and sheriff s deputies to engage in community policing activities  crime fighting  anti meth activities  and meth lab clean up   More than 70 local and state law enforcement agencies in North Dakota have directly benefited from COPS funding  Federal Support  Byrne Grants  The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program is the other principal law enforcement grant program at DOJ   This is a formula grant program that provides funding directly to local law enforcement agencies   Funds may be used to provide personnel  equipment  training  technical assistance  and information systems for more widespread apprehension  prosecution  adjudication  detention  and rehabilitation of offenders who violate state and local laws   In North Dakota  Byrne JAG funding is a vital part of the state s efforts at tracking and destroying meth labs   North Dakota has received over  34 million in Byrne JAG funding since 1988 and more than  7 million from Local Law Enforcement Block Grants  a program which was merged into the Byrne JAG program in 2005   For 2008  the President s budget proposes  350 million for Byrne JAG  a cut of  170 million below the 2007 level   In addition  the administration proposes to restructure the program so it no longer is distributed under a formula that guarantees a share of funding to North Dakota   Instead  the administration proposes to let DOJ distribute the funds   Homeland Security  North Dakota receives additional federal support for local first responders through grant programs administered by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    These formula grants are  State Homeland Security Grants  Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grants  and Assistance to Firefighter Grants   Although these DHS grants are focused on terrorism prevention  the support they provide to state and local first responders  law enforcement  firefighting  and other emergency response personnel  have overlapping benefits to public safety  o The State Homeland Security Grants program is a formula grant program that requires states to allocate 80 percent of funds to localities   Use of these funds is geared toward addressing terrorism threats   Funds can be used for training and equipment  o The Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program provides funds to support activities to establish and enhance state and local efforts to prevent and deter terrorist attacks  o The Assistance to Firefighters Program awards one year grants directly to fire departments and ambulance services to enhance their abilities to respond to fires and fire related hazards  The President s budget proposes cuts to all of these programs  o State Homeland Security formula grants are proposed to be cut by  338 million below the 2007 enacted level of  525 million   348 million or 65 percent below the 2007 level adjusted for inflation   o Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grants are cut by  112 million below the 2007 level of  375 million   119 million or 31 percent below the 2007 level adjusted for inflation   and o Assistance to Firefighter Grants are cut by  362 million below the 2007 level of  662 million   375 million or 56 percent below the 2007 level adjusted for inflation    North Dakota received  6 2 million in State Homeland Security grants   4 3 million in Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention grants  and at least  500 000 in Assistance to Firefighter grants in 2006
