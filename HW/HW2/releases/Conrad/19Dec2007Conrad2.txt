Key BOLD Provisions Signed into Law Conrad Initiatives Included in Energy Bill                   December 19  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today in response to President Bush signing into law the 2007 Energy Bill that included key provisions from the BOLD Energy Act  Senator Conrads comprehensive blueprint for leading the nation to greater energy independence    Our nation has been addicted to foreign sources of energy for far too long  That addiction has come at a cost  both to our economic and national security     While this bill does not go as far as I would like to develop and promote domestic  renewable sources of fuel  it does make important initial investments  This energy bill is a good first step to a sustainable national energy policy  The key is to now build on this bill and incorporate more provisions from my BOLD energy proposal     Moving forward  I will do what I can to increase domestic energy production and bring even greater economic security to our nation     Provisions from Senator Conrads BOLD Act in the 2007 Energy Bill     Senator Conrads BOLD Act required 30 billion gallons of renewable fuel use by 2025  The bill signed by the President requires 36 billion gallons by 2022   Of that  21 billion gallons will have to be advanced biofuels  produced from sources like the prairie grass native to North Dakota     Like the BOLD Act  the Senate bill advances a long term solution with research and development and demonstration programs for electric drive transportation technology      Similar to the BOLD Act  the Senate bill also authorizes  80 million for research and development of lightweight vehicle materials that will boost both the safety and the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks       As in the BOLD Act  the Senate bill instructs the Department of Energy to take the lead in planning how to modernize the nations electricity transmission grid in order to improve the capacity and security of the grid  avoid power shortages  and lower costs for consumers   A modernized grid would help bring North Dakotas vast energy resources for sale to the rest of the country
