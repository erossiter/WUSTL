Senate Passes Conrad Small Business Tax Breaks Tax Breaks Included In Minimum Wage Package                   February 1  2007  Washington    The United States Senate passed a package of small business tax breaks  including several written by Senator Kent Conrad  as part of its 94 to 3 vote today to increase the minimum wage for American workers  Senator Conrad worked with a bipartisan group of Finance Committee colleagues to draft the small business tax provisions in the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007  The cuts are designed to encourage growth in the economy by spurring job creation and encouraging small business owners to invest in new equipment and improvements  North Dakota s economy runs on small business  This package of tax breaks will help Main Street business owners improve their shops  buy new equipment and hire a few new workers  Senator Conrad said  These tax incentives are passing along with a raise in the federal minimum wage  which hasn t been increased in more than a decade  This is a good bill for the middle class  The Small Business Administration estimates that there are 61 700 small businesses in North Dakota  The tax relief provisions authored by Senator Conrad include an increased deduction for building improvements and a measure to allow for a simpler  cash basis method of bookkeeping for small businesses  Other provisions supported by Senator Conrad include tax credits for those businesses that hire hard to employ workers and greater flexibility in small business expensing  which allows small businesses to deduct the costs of purchasing certain equipment in the same year  The Senate Minimum Wage Act would raise the federal minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25 over the next two years  The House had earlier passed its own version of a bill to raise the minimum wage  but it did not include similar tax incentives   The differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will now have to be negotiated
