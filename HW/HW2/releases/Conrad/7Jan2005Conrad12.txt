Conrad Warns New Trade Talks Continue to Threaten Sugar  Trade with Panama and Andean Nations is a Recipe for Disaster  Senator says                    January 7  2005  Washington  As U S  negotiators attempt to complete trade agreements with Panama and the Andean nations  Senator Kent Conrad today made a bipartisan request to the White House to reject any agreement that would dump foreign subsidized sugar on the U S  market  unfairly hurting domestic sugar producers  In a letter to Robert Zoellick  the U S  Trade Representative  Senator Conrad  joined by Idaho Republican Senator Larry Craig  warned that trade deals being brokered with Panama  Colombia  Peru and Ecuador may threaten the Red River Valley s  2 billion sugar beet industry  Negotiating sugar trade in bilateral free trade agreements is a recipe for disaster for the U S  sugar industry  and it is unnecessary  writes Senator Conrad  In the letter to Zoellick  Senator Conrad warns that the Administration is pursuing a course that will jeopardize the U S  sugar industry by opening our domestic market to subsidized sugar produced by Panama and the Andean nations  Senator Conrad pointed to the Central America Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  as an example of how this Administration s negotiated trade with sugar producing nations can flood the domestic market  As negotiated  CAFTA allows 100 000 tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the domestic market  with an additional 2 percent each year thereafter  In addition  CAFTA sets a precedent that  if extended to other trade agreements currently under negotiation  could lead to an additional 500 000 tons of sugar flooding the U S  market  a move that economists say would cause severe economic damage to the U S  sugar industry  If unfairly subsidized foreign sugar is allowed into the United States  domestic market  it would drive the price of sugar below what farmers can sustain  That  in turn  would drive farmers  processors and the local industries that rely on them out of business  We seek your commitment that sugar will be excluded from the Panama and Andean FTAs  write Senators Conrad and Craig  This is particularly important because these countries collectively produce 4 million tons of sugar  enough to swamp the U S  sugar market
