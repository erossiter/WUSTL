Senator  Tax Break for Multimillionaires  Irresponsible   Billionaire Families Spreading Tax Myth                   June 7  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad  ranking member of the Senate Budget  Committee  warned today that middle class families would likely face an  increased tax burden in the future if the Congress votes to repeal the tax  currently levied on multimillion dollar estates  There is a great hoax being perpetrated on the American people  There is no  death tax  No one in America pays a tax upon death  We do have a tax on estates  worth millions of dollars  That is an estate tax  And of all the estates in this  country  only one half of one percent pay any tax at all  Senator Conrad said  Recent press reports have indicated that a handful of families worth hundreds  of billions of dollars have spent more than  200 million trying to repeal this  tax on their estates  In contrast  the vast majority of ordinary business owners  and family farmers don t pay estate taxes  Ordinary Americans  including small business owners and family farmers   should be worrying that the estate tax will be repealed    because if it is  it  is ordinary Americans who will have to make up the difference  either through an  increased debt to the nation  or from an increase in taxes on the middle class   Senator Conrad said  Under existing law  families can exempt up to  4 million in inherited worth   Current law would raise that exemption to  7 million in 2009  Repealing the estate tax would cost  776 billion in the 10 year period from  2012  when it would take affect  to 2021  If that loss to the Treasury were  borrowed  the cost including interest would be about  1 trillion  according to  estimates by the Senate Budget Committee  This is unconscionable  It is reckless  And it would contribute to an  economic decline in our country because it would increase our debt  increase  interests rates and weaken our economy  Giving a tax break right now to the very  wealthiest families in this nation would be profoundly unwise  Senator Conrad  said
