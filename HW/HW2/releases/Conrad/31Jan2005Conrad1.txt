Conrad Accepts Invite to Join President in Fargo Senator Welcomes Opportunity to Discuss Social Security                    January 31  2005  Washington   Senator Kent Conrad announced today that he has accepted an invitation from President Bush to join him on Air Force One on the flight from Washington  D C   to Fargo on Thursday for an event to discuss the future of Social Security  I ve accepted the President s invitation to accompany him to Fargo and I will be there to welcome him  We ll have a chance to discuss Social Security  As I ve made clear  there are places where I agree with the President  and there are places I have concern with the President s plan  We re waiting for the details of what he may propose  Senator Conrad said  I agree with him that there should not be an increase in payroll taxes  We already have an over reliance on payroll taxes  which only serves to tax work and creates a disincentive to hire Americans  I also support additional incentives for savings and investment  We also should try to achieve a higher rate of return on funds invested through Social Security  Senator Conrad said  However  Senator Conrad said he does have concerns about the President s plan  such as heavy borrowing to pay for private accounts and steep benefit cuts  I do not support massive new borrowing  much of it from China and Japan  to pay the costs of private accounts  I also don t support cutting benefits by 40 percent with the hope that stock market gains make up the difference  Finally  I believe the first step toward strengthening Social Security is to stop the raid on the Social Security surplus  Right now the President s budget calls for spending more than  2 trillion over the next 10 years from the Social Security surplus  I cannot endorse that policy  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad  who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  said it would be useful for the President to broaden this discussion beyond Social Security to cover Medicare and fundamental reform of the tax code  Tax reform is important because the tax gap    the difference between what is owed and what is paid    is now over  300 billion a year  Before any tax increase is considered  we ought to insist that those who are ducking their tax obligations be expected to pay like the vast majority of Americans who already pay what they owe  Senator Conrad said  I m hopeful we can have a discussion about these long term concerns facing the country  Whatever we do  we must preserve the promise of Social Security  not only for this generation  but for generations to come
