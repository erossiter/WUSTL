Conrad Wins Fight For Rural Pharmacies Senator s Amendment Ensures Access to Life Saving Medications                    November 3  2005  Washington    The United States Senate today voted to pass a provision authored by Senator Kent Conrad that gives rural pharmacies the support needed to provide life saving medications to Medicaid patients  A rural community s pharmacy is a vital lifeline  especially for the community s older citizens  If it closes  then many senior citizens could be forced to travel great distances to fill their prescriptions  Senator Conrad said  This legislation would ensure that rural communities across America continue to have access to their local pharmacy  Senator Conrad offered his Critical Access Pharmacies Amendment today during debate on the budget reconciliation bill  Senator Conrad expressed concern that without this fix  the reconciliation bill would cut Medicaid reimbursements for small  independent druggists    many of which are in rural areas  Without taking action to protect these pharmacies  many could be forced to turn away Medicaid patients or go out of business  depriving rural residents of access to life saving medications  Senator Conrad s amendment creates special protections for small  retail pharmacies that are the sole provider within a 20 mile radius  It would allow qualifying pharmacies to be reimbursed at a higher rate to account for the increased costs they incur and their inability to access the deeper discounts afforded large  urban pharmacies  This amendment would even the playing field and helps smaller pharmacies cover the costs that larger pharmacies don t have to pay  Senator Conrad said  With these safeguards  residents in rural communities could have better access to the lifesaving medications they need  Senator Conrad  who is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  also serves on the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees Medicaid policy
