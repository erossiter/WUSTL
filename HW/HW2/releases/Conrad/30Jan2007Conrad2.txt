Delegation Urges Air Force Chief to Make Grand Forks Home to New Tankers ND s Leaders Call for Level Playing Field in Competition for New Aircraft                   January 30  2007  Washington  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy today urged Air Force Chief of Staff Gen  T  Michael Moseley to base a fleet of the next generation of air refueling tankers at Grand Forks Air Force base  and asked him to ensure that current tanker bases are considered equally as the Air Force debates where to base the new aircraft  As the tanker replacement competition proceeds and the Air Force turns its attention to making choices about where to allocate the new aircraft  we urge you to ensure that current tanker bases compete on an equal and even playing field  the delegation said in a letter to Moseley  The Air Force intends to replace the half century old fleet of KC 135 Stratotankers with a new generation of air refueling tankers   Designated the KC X by the Air Force  179 new planes are expected to roll off the assembly line starting in 2011  Senators Conrad and Dorgan and Congressman Pomeroy have been pushing the Air Force to base some of the new tankers in Grand Forks  The base is currently home to the 319th Air Refueling Wing  which flies and maintains 38 KC 135s   The Air Force in the past has supported future tanker missions at Grand Forks Air Force Base  declaring that the base would be one of the first to receive the new aerial tanker  In their letter to Moseley  the delegation continued to press the fact that Grand Forks is one of the top bases in the Air Force  highlighting the many advantages the base offers the next aerial refueling tanker fleet  The delegation touted the bases many assets  including its strategic location  infrastructure  growth potential  strong community support  and outstanding performance of base personnel  There is no better tanker team in the Air Force than the one here in Grand Forks  the delegation said in a joint statement   We will continue to battle it out in the competition for this new strategic tanker mission   Working together  we hope to welcome the first fleet of the KC X to the Grand Forks community in the near future  Below is the text of the letter to Moseley January 30  2007 General Michael Moseley Chief of Staff Headquarters U S  Air Force The Pentagon Washington  D C  20330 Dear General Moseley  You have eloquently stated the importance of modernizing our aerial tanker fleet   We strongly agree that updating our tankers is crucial if we are to continue to project American military power around the globe    The U S  National Security Strategy depends on a robust air refueling capability  as do our coalition partners   No other nation in the world has a comparable capability   The U S  advantage in tankers is at the center of almost all the other strategic capabilities of our Air Force  As the tanker replacement competition proceeds and the Air Force turns its attention to making choices about where to allocate the new aircraft  we would urge you to ensure that all current active duty tanker bases compete on an equal and even playing field   Nothing in the recommendations of the BRAC Commission would prevent the Air Force from bedding down a KC X unit at Grand Forks   Furthermore  we wanted to call your attention to some of the distinctive advantages that Grand Forks AFB offers for the KC X mission  Nothing in the BRAC Report Blocks Assigning KC X to Grand Forks AFB  As you well know due to your intense personal involvement  Grand Forks Air Force Base remains an active base not closed by the 2005 Base Closure  Realignment Commission   In fact  the BRAC Commission formally rejected the idea of even considering closing GFAFB by a 3 6 vote  7 votes affirmative votes were required for further consideration   As an active base  Grand Forks is eligible to receive any missions that the Air Force deems appropriate to assign there  including KC X   Legally  the Air Force may assign any new mission to any base  and may move any existing mission to any base as long as the Air Force complies with section 2687 of Title 10  United States Code   Theoretically  this could mean moving any new mission  including  for example  a new Army Combat Brigade  or relocating any old mission  such as KC 135 aircraft or a new KC 135 unit  Additionally  the Air Force has repeatedly supported future tanker missions at Grand Forks AFB   Commissioner Philip E  Coyle noted in the final hearing of the BRAC Commission  I think all the Commissioners will recall that we ve heard testimony from the Department of Defense that they intend to put tankers at Grand Forks      And we also heard  from high level Air Force officials  that they intended to put tankers at Grand Forks   However  the 767 fracas  which really has nothing to do with Grand Forks  ended up having the program canceled   1  The Air Force s previous strategic plan for the next generation tanker aircraft declared that Grand Forks AFB would be one of the first bases to receive the KC 135 replacement aircraft and the first to bed down its full contingent   This decision was based on enduring strategic factors that have not changed since 2002   2   If anything  the case for making Grand Forks the lead recipient of KC X is even stronger now   The BRAC Commission s recommendation to drawdown KC 135R aircraft at Grand Forks and the somewhat smaller size of the incoming Predator and Global Hawk missions create the potential for a manpower bathtub that could have disruptive effects on the base infrastructure and the local community if too long of a gap is left between the departure of the KC 135s and the arrival of KC X  Why Grand Forks for KC X  Grand Forks AFB is an outstanding asset for the Department of Defense   It is strategically located in the center of the North American continent  accessible to any theater  at a maximum distance from sea launched threats including cruise missiles  and close to polar routes to Europe  the Middle East  and Asia   Grand Forks AFB is the most efficient location for tankers swinging to support deployments from both the East and West coasts   Grand Forks and McConnell are the only tanker bases that can efficiently support deployments both to the east and to the west  and in almost every case  Grand Forks offers faster trip times than McConnell   Due to the advantages of polar flying routes  Grand Forks is also closer to key destinations in the Middle East than any other active duty tanker base  Grand Forks AFB also has unique advantages that provide maximum flexibility to expand facilities and accept new missions   While other bases will experience massive increases in encroachment over the next twenty to thirty years  Grand Forks has absolutely no problems with air or ground encroachment restricting operations   Encroachment is not a problem in North Dakota now  and it won t be a problem twenty years from now   Senior Department of Defense officials have repeatedly testified that encroachment and urban sprawl are major threats to military readiness   Service officials have told the Government Accountability Office  GAO  that population growth around military installations is responsible for much of their past and present encroachment problems  and that higher than average population growth around their installations makes further encroachment losses likely  Grand Forks additionally offers ready access to the least congested area for air traffic in the U S   airspace that is ideal for training and routine flight operations  Grand Forks AFB also offers ample space for new construction and nearly unlimited potential for expansion outside the current fence line   Grand Forks has the second most total available buildable acreage for airfield operations and maintenance of all the flying bases in the Air Force  behind only Eglin AFB   Grand Forks AFB has over 2 000 acres available  almost 10 million square yards of available land   It also ranks near the top of all Air Force bases  8th  for unconstrained buildable acreage for airfield operations with more than 400 acres  At a time when other bases have fallen short on air pollution standards  or will fail under new regulations  Grand Forks has excellent environmental attainment and will continue to comply with pollution restrictions well into the future  The Air Force has testified to Congress that considerations related to air emissions may supersede readiness as a key driver in basing and operating decisions because the Air Force must comply with the provisions of the Clean Air Act   Aircraft emissions generate the largest percentage of criteria pollutant emissions at most Air Force installations   About eighty five Air Force installations are located in areas that do not achieve minimum air quality standards  meaning the Air Force may not be able to deploy additional systems at those bases because of emissions restrictions  Grand Forks AFB has no issues with air emissions attainment  The base is also in great physical shape   Its infrastructure has been comprehensively renewed in the last dozen years with more than  300 million in investment   The runway was completely rebuilt in 2005   In the last dozen years  the base has received four new Squadron Operations Centers    state of the art facilities capable of supporting tankers  Predator  Global Hawk or nearly any other mission area   Thanks to tremendous investments in family housing  Grand Forks offers outstanding quality of life to the Airmen assigned there  These attributes have helped Grand Forks AFB and the 319th ARW to consistently achieve the highest levels of operational efficiency   Grand Forks AFB has maintained the highest levels of operational efficiency of any tanker base   For instance  in fiscal year 2004 it conducted more missions and flew more hours in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom than any tanker base   On a per assigned aircraft basis  Grand Forks produced nearly 50 percent more flying hours in support of those operations than the average AMC tanker base   While outstanding airmen deserve much of the credit  this high operational efficiency has been sustained over many years  through numerous changes in personnel and leadership  suggesting that intangible factors specific to the base have some influence  The outstanding performance of GFAFB personnel is significantly aided by top notch community support   The relationship between the city and the base  always strong  was permanently solidified when the Air Force Base came to the rescue of thousands of civilians during the catastrophic flood and fire of 1997   The city of Grand Forks offers high quality of life at very low cost  as well as an excellent education system in which military and civilian students are treated in an equally outstanding way   The city of Grand Forks won the 2005 Abilene Trophy for the best community support in Air Mobility Command  making it only the second city ever to twice be honored with this coveted trophy  You have been a tremendous friend to the State of North Dakota and to Grand Forks Air Force Base   We look forward to continuing to work closely with you on this important issue   Thank you as always for your wise leadership of one of our nation s great institutions  the United States Air Force
