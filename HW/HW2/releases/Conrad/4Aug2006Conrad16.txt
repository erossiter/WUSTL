Delegation Invites President to Tour Drought Stricken Areas in North Dakota Delegation hopes a tour by the President would end his opposition to disaster relief                    August 4  2006  Washington D C   Senators Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl  Pomeroy Friday invited President Bush to North Dakota to tour drought stricken  areas of the state and see firsthand the damage caused by the severe lack of  moisture  The delegation said they hope the tour would convince the President   who has repeatedly blocked agriculture disaster assistance legislation  to  support help for family farmers and ranchers  In a letter sent Friday  the delegation called on the President to travel to  North Dakota to tour the parched landscape and visit with producers who have  lost crops or cattle to the drought  which has spread across most of the central  United States  The delegation has led the fight to bring disaster relief to family farmers  and ranchers  securing the U S  Department of Agriculture s agreement to open  CRP land for haying and grazing and pressing in Congress for an agriculture  disaster package  The President has used veto threats to repeatedly block  legislation that would bring assistance to producers who were hit by  weather related disasters in 2005 and 2006  We are hopeful that after meeting with these hardworking American men and  women  and seeing first hand the destruction caused by this ongoing natural  disaster  you will end your opposition to providing desperately needed  assistance for agriculture producers across the country  the delegation wrote   We hope that seeing the drought conditions for yourself  and hearing directly  from American farmers how desperately they need your assistance  will persuade  you to support our effort rather than kill it once again with a veto threat
