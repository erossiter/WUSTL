Conrad Urges VA to Open New Clinics for ND Veterans Facilities Could Dramatically Reduce Wait Time for Rural Veterans  Senator says                    September 27  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today called on the Department of Veterans Affairs to take immediate action to open several new veterans outpatient clinics that were promised to the state last year  In a letter to R  James Nicholson  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Senator Conrad requested a detailed schedule for when the VA would open new Community Based Outpatient Clinics  CBOC  in Dickinson  Jamestown  Devils Lake  Williston  and Grand Forks  Last year the Capital Assessment Realignment for Enhanced Services Commission recommended that five new clinics be built in the state of North Dakota  Senator Conrad writes to Nicholson  Unfortunately  there has been little action on the part of the VA to open these new facilities  In the letter to Nicholson  Senator Conrad emphasizes that veterans living in rural states  such as North Dakota  are forced to travel long distances to access health care services offered by the VA  Currently  the VA operates community outpatient clinics only in Grafton  Minot  and Bismarck  The five new North Dakota clinics could dramatically reduce driving distances and wait times for access to veterans  health care facilities  Last year  responding to pressure from Senator Conrad  the VA revised its criteria for establishing CBOCs to emphasize the importance for access to care for rural veterans  The VA called for the establishment of new clinics by 2012  and made rural states such as North Dakota a high priority because they are currently below the VA s standards for access to primary health care  More than 60 percent of North Dakota veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system do not have access to any care facility that meets the VA s guidelines  Nearly 26 000 of North Dakota s 59 000 veterans sought treatment in VA s health care facilities in 2003  up from about 17 400 in 2000  The members of our military  past and present  have served our country bravely across the world  They have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our nation  and America s veterans deserve the highest possible level of care  Senator Conrad writes
