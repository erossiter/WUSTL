Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on Iraq Policy                    June 22  2006  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement today in  support of an amendment authored by Michigan Senator Carl Levin proposing to  begin redeploying troops from Iraq by the end of this year  but does not set a  specific timetable  I do not believe that it is wise policy to set a specific date for a  withdrawal from Iraq  I do believe it makes sense to begin to redeploy our  forces sometime this year  Therefore  I will support the Levin Amendment  That  is the right policy  I believe  for the following reasons  Number one  our military commanders have made clear that is their intention   In fact  the news this morning says in a headline  U S  Military to Send  Equipment Home  The story goes on to say  the U S  military has begun sending  thousands of Humvees and other war equipment home as more Iraqi units join the  fight  The move also anticipates the number of American troops in Iraq will  decline  Is anybody suggesting our military is engaged in a cut and run strategy  I  don t think so  That is not a cut and run strategy  It has been the long term  plan to begin to redeploy this year  Number two  the president has repeatedly said  we will stand down as the  Iraqis stand up  Well  according to the Administration  tens of thousands  even  hundreds of thousands of Iraqis  have now stood up  It is time for us to begin  to redeploy  That does not constitute a cut and run approach  but is simply  common sense  Third  Iraq is ultimately the responsibility of the Iraqis  We cannot  forever do the job for them  They must defend their own freedom  Number four  there are other priority threats that require our attention   including the worldwide al Qaeda conspiracy  North Korea s nuclear weapons and  missile development  and Iranian nuclear development  For those reasons  I support a policy of beginning to redeploy our forces  from Iraq this year  But without a specific timetable or an arbitrary pace for  reducing those troop commitments  That is the right policy  That is the policy  outlined in the Levin Amendment
