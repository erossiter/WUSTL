Fed Support Crucial for Minot State  Conrad says Senator Releases Study of Federal Impact on Local Colleges   Universities                   February 22  2006  Minot    Senator Kent Conrad released a U S  Senate analysis of federal support for higher education today  which concluded that Minot State University receives 24 percent of its annual budget from the federal government in the form of student aid  research contracts and project funding  Senator Conrad called for continuing what he described as crucial federal investment in North Dakota s higher education system  As our deficits widen and our national debt grows  there is growing pressure to cut spending on higher education  Senator Conrad said  We must decide what we value  and where we want our federal dollars invested  This report clearly shows federal funding for North Dakota s public universities and colleges is a sound investment in our future  Senator Conrad s report  unveiled at the Minot State University  comes just weeks after President Bush proposed slashing federal funds for higher education programs across the nation  According to Senator Conrad s report  North Dakota s colleges and universities offer more than excellent educational opportunities  They also provide good paying jobs  stimulate the local economy  and serve as vibrant centers for their communities  Federal support is greater than almost any other single source of funds for North Dakota s higher education system  The support comes in a variety of forms    such as research grants  program funding or tuition assistance for students  After touring MSU s federally funded Rural Crime and Justice Center  Senator Conrad met with students and faculty working with the Rural Meth Education Project  For the past five years  MSU has received more than  4 million in federal funds to help law enforcement officials and community leaders prevent both the manufacture and use of methamphetamine  From 2001 to 2005  MSU received  38 1 million from federal programs  In 2005 alone  the university benefited from nearly  9 2 million in federal programs for student aid  grants  contracts and other support  24 percent of its total budget  The 2005 funding includes nearly  2 2 million obtained directly by the North Dakota Congressional delegation for specific projects at MSU  The federal government is crucial to supporting North Dakota s universities and colleges  Without it  our public education system would either shrink  or become so expensive that a college degree would be out of reach for a growing number of North Dakotans  Senator Conrad said  We can t let higher education get out reach to North Dakota s working families  I will continue to fight for the federal funding our colleges and universities need and deserve
