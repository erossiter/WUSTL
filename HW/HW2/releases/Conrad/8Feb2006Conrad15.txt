Conrad Grills Medicare Chief on New Rx Drug Plan Senator Calls Government s Implementation of Drug Benefit a Fiasco                    February 8  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad questioned the government s top Medicare official at a high level Senate hearing today and said his agency has done a terrible job in implementing the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  I have never seen a bigger failure of government since Katrina  The roll out of this program has been botched and bungled every step of the way  Senator Conrad told Mark McClellan  head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Everywhere I go in my state there is an endless stream of complaints  People are furious at your agency  Senator Conrad posed his questions to McClellan during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee investigating the benefit s rollout  The program took effect January 1  but has been hampered by numerous glitches including inaccurate information  computer errors and red tape  Senator Conrad has held a series of public presentations across North Dakota to help seniors understand their best options under the Medicare prescription drug benefit  Hundreds of seniors and their families have attended Senator Conrad s presentations  In meeting after meeting I have heard the same thing  there is widespread confusion and growing anger  Senator Conrad said  There are too many plans  People can t access the Medicare Web site  They can t get through on the 1 800 number  And when they do get through the information is no good  There are more than 40 government approved private prescription plans that are being offered in North Dakota  each with its own price structure and list of covered drugs  While Senator Conrad has criticized the plan as unnecessarily complicated  he is committed to helping seniors sort through what is a maze of enrollment detail  To date  an estimated 8 700 people in North Dakota have voluntarily signed up for Medicare s stand alone drug plans  Senator Conrad noted that there are more than 103 000 people eligible for the program in the state  a clear signal that Medicare s management of the benefit roll out is not working  North Dakota seniors are not alone in their confusion surrounding the Medicare prescription drug benefit  A recent Gallup poll surveyed Americans 65 and older about how well they understood the new drug program  Sixty one percent said not too well or not at all  Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Finance Committee  which oversaw the writing of the Medicare Modernization Act  signed into law by President Bush in 2003  Senator Conrad voted for the bill because it included benefits he wrote to increase funding for rural hospitals  as well as the prescription drug benefit  I was proud to support this bill  But the launch of this program has been a fiasco  Senator Conrad said  We need to fix this  We need to get this right  for North Dakota and the nation
