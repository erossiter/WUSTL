Senator Urges President to Budget for War                    December 21  2006  Washington  As the White House prepares its annual budget submission to  Congress  Senator Kent Conrad is calling on the Bush administration to include  the full costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan military operations in its regular  budget submission  In a bipartisan letter to President Bush today  Senator Conrad  the incoming  Senate Budget Committee Chairman  cited a public law  signed by the President  earlier this year  requiring his regular budget to include full year funding for  the war  The current Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg  R NH  and incoming House  Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt  D SC  joined Senator Conrad in writing  the letter  The three budget leaders and others in Congress have grown increasingly  concerned with the Bush administration s practice of funding the war outside of  the regular budget process  using emergency supplemental appropriations  In  their letter to the President  they explain why they find continued reliance on  supplemental appropriations so problematic   I t has skewed deficit  projections  minimized the rational tradeoffs in the budget  and obscured  oversight of war costs  Senators Conrad  Gregg and Representative Spratt point out in their letter  that the Iraqi Study Group  ISG  also weighed in on the war funding issue in its  recent report  One of the ISG s 79 recommendations specifically called for the  President s annual budget request to include full costs for the war  and noted  that the normal budget process should not be circumvented  The ever expanding  shadow budget  of supplementals and bridge funds  disrupts the Pentagon s financial management process and congressional oversight  of defense spending  the three members write in the letter to the President   Full disclosure of war requirements and costs in your FY 2008 budget would be a  step toward fiscal responsibility and a sign that your Administration intends to  work closely with Congress on vital issues related to the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan  The full letter to the President follows  Dear Mr  President  In the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007  PL 109 364   Congress  directed that your budget for fiscal year 2008 include full funding of the costs  of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  As the bipartisan  bicameral  leadership of the Congressional Budget Committees  we write to underscore the  importance of this directive  In addition  we urge you to include in your budget  the best possible projection of war costs beyond 2008  and to specify war costs  with the same level of detail as items in the regular budget in order to make  transparent the incremental cost of each operation  Thus far  nearly all of the funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  has been obtained through supplemental appropriations  This has been problematic  for several reasons  it has skewed deficit projections  minimized the rational  tradeoffs in the budget  and obscured oversight of war costs  We believe that  when troops are deployed  they should have our unstinting support  but we also  believe that Congress should be able to examine supplemental requests and see  that our forces are receiving the support they need  and that funds are not  being diverted to other unrelated needs  Including in the budget the best  feasible projection of war requirements and providing the same level of  specificity for supplemental war costs as for regular items in the budget would  help solve these problems  Including war costs in the regular budget is consistent with historical  practice  Nearly all funding for the Korean War was provided through regular  appropriations after FY 1951  Similarly  all funding for the Vietnam War after FY 1970 was provided in  regular appropriations  From FY 1997 on  funding for ongoing military operations  in Southwest Asia and in Bosnia was also requested in the regular budget  process  After its in depth analysis  the Iraqi Study Group reaffirmed Congress s  direction to budget for war costs  In Recommendation 72 of their report  the  group stated  Costs for the war in Iraq should be included in the president s annual budget  request  starting in FY 2008  the war is in its fourth year  and the normal  budget process should not be circumvented  Funding requests for the war in Iraq  should be presented clearly to Congress and the American people  Congress must  carry out its constitutional responsibility to review budget request for the war  in Iraq carefully and to conduct oversight  The ever expanding shadow budget of supplementals and bridge funds disrupts  the Pentagon s financial management process and congressional oversight of  defense spending as well  Full disclosure of war requirements and costs in your  FY 2008 budget would be a step toward fiscal responsibility and a sign that your  Administration intends to work closely with Congress on vital issues related to  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
