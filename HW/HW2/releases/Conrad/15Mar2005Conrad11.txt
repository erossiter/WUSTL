Statement by Senator Kent Conrad Supporting National Farmers Union  Hundreds of Farmers and Ranchers Rally at U S  Capitol to Oppose CAFTA                    March 15  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today in support of the National Farmers Union rally to oppose the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   We are debating the budget on the Senate floor today  In its budget  the Bush Administration proposed policies that the non partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would cut farm program spending by nearly  18 billion  Yet the Administration tries to call itself farmer friendly  The fact is  this Administration s policies are fundamentally hostile to family farmers and ranchers and Main Street businesses across rural America  So when this Administration tries to tell you CAFTA is farmer friendly  don t believe it  The fact is  the CAFTA is a dagger aimed right at the heart of the Red River Valley s  2 billion sugar beet industry  It will put our highly successful U S  sugar program at serious risk  And if the CAFTA model is followed in the other free trade agreements this Administration is negotiating with major sugar producing countries and regions  the cumulative total new imports will put the U S  sugar industry out of business  Under this Administration s trade policies  our total trade deficit skyrocketed to more than  600 billion last year  And USDA is now projecting that we will fail to have a surplus in agricultural trade for the first time in decades  It is time to put a stop to these failed trade policies  defeat CAFTA  and stand up for a better deal for U S  agriculture  Senator Conrad is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  He also serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  which oversees farm policy  and the Senate Finance Committee  which writes trade policy
