CAFTA Would Add to Record Trade Deficit  Conrad says  Agreement Would Swamp U S  Sugar  Put Producers Out of Work                    June 7  2005  Washington  During a key committee hearing today on the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   Senator Kent Conrad warned that the proposed trade pact provides no benefits to the nation s economy and would devastate the U S  sugar industry  We have been told repeatedly by this Administration that CAFTA would help the economy  Senator Conrad said  But our own International Trade Commission has reviewed this treaty and concluded that it adds nothing to our economic output  In the meeting of the Senate Agricultural Committee  Senator Conrad argued that CAFTA would destabilize the entire U S  sugar program and worsen the nation s trade deficit with the CAFTA region  The U S  trade deficit rose from  38 billion in 1992 to a record  617 billion last year  CAFTA would allow more than 109 000 tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States annually from five Central American nations and the Dominican Republic  That alone could disrupt the U S  sugar market  but CAFTA creates a precedent for other sugar producing countries  And as the U S  negotiates trade pacts with the Andean nations  Thailand and South Africa  Senator Conrad said he fears the amount of sugar allowed in the United States would eventually swamp domestic producers  We re not talking about a teaspoon of sugar here  Senator Conrad said  This agreement paves the way for an additional 500 000 tons of foreign subsidized sugar to flood the U S  market  That level of imports would crush the price of sugar  fundamentally threatening the entire industry  putting our growers and factory workers out of work  The Red River Valley is a major producer of sugar beets and is home to a  2 billion sugar producing industry  including farmers  processors and workers  Senator Conrad has organized rallies opposed to CAFTA  and collected signatures from farmers and business owners opposed to the deal  Senator Conrad has argued that sugar should be handled within the World Trade Organization  and not negotiated in bilateral trade agreements like CAFTA  When I look at CAFTA  I see an agreement that adds to our trade deficit with the region and threatens an industry that employs 146 000 Americans  Senator Conrad said  I see a trade deal that only hurts North Dakota and our nation  The U S  signed CAFTA last year  Congress must approve the agreement for it to take effect  The Senate Finance Committee  on which Senator Conrad is a senior member  is scheduled to start the congressional approval process next week
