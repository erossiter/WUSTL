Conrad to White House  Stand Up for America s Farmers Senator Urges President to Approve Bill to Help Farmers Recover from Disasters                   April 4  2007      Bismarck    Farmers and ranchers from the Bismarck Mandan area gathered with Senator Kent Conrad today to call on the White House to drop its opposition to the Senator s ag disaster legislation and provide badly needed aid to farm families devastated by weather related disasters     It has been a long  hard fight but our farmers and ranchers are one step closer today to getting the assistance they need   The final hurdle lies with the White House    We need to send a clear message today to the President     don t turn your back on America s farm families     Last week  the US Senate approved the emergency supplemental appropriations bill which included bipartisan legislation Senator Conrad authored to assist thousands of farm and ranch families across the nation whose livelihoods have been devastated by years of weather related disasters   However  the White House continues to oppose the legislation and has threatened a Presidential veto     Last year  the Senate had approved Senator Conrad s farm disaster assistance program as part of another emergency bill  But the provision was stripped by the House of Representatives after the White House issued a veto threat  Today  Senator Conrad and North Dakota agriculture leaders called on the President to stand up for family farmers and sign the bill into law      All across the nation  farmers and ranchers have faced severe cycles of natural disasters over the past three years   In North Dakota alone  floods in 2005 and severe drought in 2006 resulted in millions of acres of crops being destroyed       Senator Conrad s agriculture disaster package     which was advanced through the Appropriations Committee by Senator Byron Dorgan     would provide  4 16 billion in emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies  It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock  Senator Conrad s bill would mean about  200 million for North Dakota      If the White House vetoes the ag disaster package they are saying that America s farmers are unimportant and they don t care if thousands of farm families are forced off the land   Senator Conrad said    I wholeheartedly disagree and will continue to fight for our family farmers      Earlier in the day  Senator Conrad met with farmers in Minot to gather support for his ag disaster bill
