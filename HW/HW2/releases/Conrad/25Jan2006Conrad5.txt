Devils Lake Drinking Water a Priority for Conrad Senator Fights for Federal Funding for New Water Supply System                    January 25  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad told Devils Lake leaders today that he will fight for additional federal funding to construct a new municipal water supply system to replace the city s threatened water line  Families in Devils Lake deserve to have clean  safe and reliable sources of drinking water piped into their homes  Safe drinking water should be a priority  and I will continue to fight to keep this critical project on track  Senator Conrad said  However  the reality is this water project faces an uphill climb  The nation s finances and budget are in very bad shape  Senator Conrad  who is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  met in his Capitol Hill office with Devils Lake Mayor Fred Bott and Mike Grafsgaard  city engineer  They discussed Senator Conrad s efforts to secure emergency funding to construct a new  15 million supply system that would provide the Devils Lake community with safe drinking water  Last year  Senator Conrad drafted legislation that would authorize full funding for the project  Devils Lake has risen steadily since 1993  In that time  the lake has tripled in surface area from 40 000 acres to more than 120 000 acres  The lake s rising water is wreaking havoc on the region  inundating roads  homes  and farmland  Currently  lake waters cover a third of the city s 45 year old water pipeline  If a failure in the submerged section of the line were to occur  it would be almost impossible to identify the leak and make the necessary repairs  That would leave the city s 7 000 residents without a source of drinking water  The city is planning to construct a system that would tap a new aquifer southeast of Devils Lake that would provide the community with a safe  reliable water supply  Construction is scheduled to begin in 2007  Drinking water is a fundamental need  and we must do everything we can to ensure that it is never cut off to the residents and businesses of Devils Lake  Senator Conrad said
