Canada Must Drop Unfair Trade Subsidy  Conrad says Senator Urges USDA to Reject Canadian Policy Putting U S  Ranchers at Risk                    July 27  2005  Washington  As cattle trade resumes with Canada  Senator Kent Conrad today urged the Department of Agriculture to take action to curtail an unfair subsidy of Canadian exports to the U S  I write to urge you to take immediate action regarding subsidies of Canadian cattle that put American ranchers at an unfair disadvantage  Senator Conrad writes in his letter to Secretary of Agriculture Michael Johanns  In response to USDA actions to protect the U S  cattle herd from mad cow disease  the Canadian government instituted a  200 per head subsidy payment to Canadian cattle producers  Now that the border has been re opened to Canadian cattle and beef imports  Senator Conrad believes these payments constitute an unfair trade subsidy of Canadian exports to the U S  While the subsidy program was suspended earlier this month  Senator Conrad is concerned with the impact of the subsidies on herds of cattle now being exported to the U S  There can be little question that the ongoing effects of these subsidies are contributing to the drop in prices experienced by U S  cattle producers since the border was re opened  Senator Conrad writes  I cannot fathom why USDA did not insist that the ongoing benefits of this subsidy of Canadian cattle be removed before we allowed a resumption of beef and cattle imports  In the letter to Johanns  Senator Conrad urges the USDA to demand that Canada completely dismantle the subsidy program before any additional Canadian cattle are sold in the U S  If Canada fails to discontinue the subsidy program  Senator Conrad wants the Department of Commerce to impose tariffs that offset the benefits to Canadian producers benefiting from the subsidies  In addition  Senator Conrad is calling for the U S  Trade Representative to investigate whether the Canadian subsidies violate World Trade Organization rules  Read the letter here
