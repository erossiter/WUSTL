Court Gives  Green Light  to Continued NAWS Construction   Pipeline is Crucial to People of North Dakota  Conrad says                    April 15  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad called a court s decision today to let construction proceed on the Northwest Area Water Supply  NAWS  project welcome news to the people of northwestern North Dakota  It is unfortunate that Manitoba  as a neighbor  has chosen to attack this critical project in the courts  Senator Conrad said  However  today s decision is a big win in this ongoing legal battle  NAWS is designed to bring Missouri River water via a pipeline from Lake Sakakawea to Minot  When completed  the project will supply clean drinking water to more than 60 000 people in Minot and the surrounding 10 county area  The Province of Manitoba had sought to stop construction of the NAWS project completely due to environmental concerns  In February  the District Court ruled that the NAWS project needed additional scientific study  The Bureau of Reclamation had not yet fully analyzed the consequences of failing to fully treat the water before crossing into the Hudson Bay Drainage  Today s ruling allows the construction of the next 15 miles of pipeline to proceed while the Bureau of Reclamation does additional environmental reviews  I have been assured by the Bureau of Reclamation that the letter of the law has been met here  Senator Conrad said  This project has gone through the most thorough analysis and review and has passed with flying colors  The need for NAWS is real and is one step closer to becoming a reality
