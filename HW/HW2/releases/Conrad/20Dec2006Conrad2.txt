Conrad  North Dakota EMS Funds Saved Senator Fought to Overturn Rule Cutting Rural Ambulance Service                   December 20  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad announced today that the Secretary of  Health and Human Services has reversed an earlier decision to dramatically cut  funding to rural ambulance squads across the nation  including services in  several North Dakota communities  Senator Conrad had written to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt on Dec  4th   calling for immediate action to correct changes to payment policies that would  have shortchanged 11 ambulance squads in North Dakota  This is a victory for our ambulance squads and for anybody who relies on  emergency health care  The rule they were proposing would have left our  ambulance squads with an insufficient level of federal funding to bear the costs  of responding to calls  Senator Conrad said  Fifty four percent of North Dakotans live in areas served by rural emergency  medical service teams  Rural ambulance squads often need to travel greater  distances to transport patients to health care facilities and face higher costs  for caring for patients  To alleviate the budget crunch on rural EMS service   Senator Conrad helped secure a bonus payment for rural ambulance squads in the  Medicare Modernization Act  which passed in 2003  However  earlier this year  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services   CMS  had proposed stripping the bonus payment to rural ambulance squads in 11  North Dakota communities  Grand Forks  Larimore  Wing  Wilton  New Salem   Hebron  Glen Ullin  Dickinson  Fargo  Rugby and Bismarck  If Secretary Leavitt  had not reversed that decision at Senator Conrad s urging  it would have  amounted to a 23 percent cut in funding for those 11 ambulance services  There are more than 2 000 EMS workers on 140 ambulance services in North  Dakota whose work for the public is better because of this    and we wish to  thank Senator Conrad publicly for his work on behalf of us  said Dean Lampe   Executive Director of the North Dakota EMS Association  Senator Conrad pushed  Medicare for a fix  and got one  It means better health care and better  emergency services for North Dakota  I m pleased that Secretary Leavitt has responded to the concerns I raised  and reversed a ruling that made absolutely no sense  People in rural America  should not have to worry whether an ambulance will come when called  Senator  Conrad said
