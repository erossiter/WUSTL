Conrad   40 Million Allotted for Grand Forks Flood Control Senator Presses White House to Reverse Decision and Fund Vital Project                    February 4  2005  Grand Forks  Standing with community leaders  Senator Kent Conrad announced today that Bush Administration officials have responded to his request to provide  40 million to complete the Grand Forks flood control project  Senator Conrad met last week with White House budget director Joshua Bolten and urged the White House to include the funding needed to finish the Grand Forks flood control project next year  Previously  the Administration had a policy that would have prevented funding for the Grand Forks flood control project from being included in this year s budget  Senator Conrad made the argument to budget director Bolten that the project is near completion and that a finished floodwall and dike would safeguard the city from another disastrous flood  Until this project is completed  the people of Grand Forks remain vulnerable to another devastating flood  Senator Conrad said  We can t let that happen  This project needs to be completed  and it needs to be completed as soon as possible  Administration representatives called Senator Conrad s office yesterday to report that the  40 million he requested will be included in the budget President Bush submits to Congress next week  Since the devastating flood of 1997  Senator Conrad has been fighting to secure the federal funding necessary to construct a comprehensive flood protection system for the Grand Forks East Grand Forks communities  To date  the North Dakota Congressional delegation has secured  170 million in federal funding for the  400 million project  The additional support announced by Senator Conrad today will cover the remaining costs for completing the project by the end of next year  The U S  Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the flood control project in 2000  The project consists of a series of levees and floodwalls around the community  When completed  the flood control system will protect Grand Forks and East Grand Forks from water levels equivalent to those experienced during the1997 flood that caused large scale damage and destruction
