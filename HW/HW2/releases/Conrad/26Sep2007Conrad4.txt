Senate Adopts Conrad Plan to Secure B 52 Force Legislation Builds on Conrad Proposal Signed into Law Last Year                   September 26  2007  Washington  The US Senate today approved legislation authored by Senator Kent Conrad to bolster Americas defense by securing the future of the B 52 bomber  Senator Conrads amendment adopted into the 2008 Defense Authorization Bill blocks a Pentagon plan to reduce the nations B 52 fleet from 94 to just 56 aircraft  a move that would dramatically impact the nations only two B 52 bomber bases  Minot Air Force Base and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana  The Conrad amendment instead calls on the Pentagon to make significant upgrades to Americas bomber force  ensuring the planes are using the latest in defense technology  The B 52 is the least expensive bomber to operate in the entire Air Force inventory  and can carry the widest variety of weapons  It makes absolutely no sense to try to save money by cutting Americas B 52 fleet  With ongoing conflicts in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world  our nation should be expanding rather than reducing our bomber force  Senator Conrad said  Conrads B 52 amendment mandates that the nations bomber force include no fewer than 63 active aircraft  11 backup aircraft and two reserve aircraft  As a result  it would help ensure that there are no hangar queens  planes that are not regularly flown  in the bomber force  Senator Conrads legislation dovetails with a law he authored last year  which bars the Pentagon from retiring any B 52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study that addresses the national security risks of making reductions to the bomber force before the scheduled delivery of new bombers in 2018  Once that study is complete and has been reviewed by Congress  the Air Force would be permitted to retire the 18 B 52s currently assigned to attrition reserve status  Senator Conrad is a longtime proponent of the B 52 and its mission at Minot Air Force Base  In ongoing talks with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen  T  Michael Moseley  Senator Conrad has stressed the strategic importance of maintaining the nations fleet of B 52s and warned that reducing the fleet would weaken Americas ability to strike overseas targets  The B 52 is indispensable  Its proven its value in combat overseas over Iraq and Afghanistan  We must maintain an effective bomber force  and outfit each plane with the newest technology  Senator Conrad said  Senator Byron Dorgan is a co sponsor of the legislation
