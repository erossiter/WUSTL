ICBM Force Focus of Minot Meeting Conrad Briefs Task Force on Defense Legislation                   October 19  2006     Minot    Senator Kent Conrad delivered a briefing today on new legislation  that helps to secure the future of the nation s intercontinental ballistic  missile force to the Executive Committee of Task Force 21  Minot s  base retention committee  At issue is a provision of the Defense Authorization bill requiring the  Defense Department to draw up a road map for the future of the country s ICBM  forces  The Pentagon had proposed retiring 50 Minuteman III missiles based at  Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana  which some experts believed was a first  step toward deeper reductions to the ICBM force  The new law blocks retirement of any missiles until the comprehensive road  map is submitted to Congress  In discussing the legislation  Senator Conrad  noted that North Korea and Iran s moves toward nuclear armament show how crucial  ICBMs are to the nation s defenses  This is a significant victory for the future of ICBMs    and for the defense  of the nation  What we re going to see is a plan to sustain and modernize the  missile force while we assess what our missile needs will be  Senator Conrad  said  What the Congress has done is pass a law that requires we handle our  ICBMs in a responsible way    that we don t rush to retire a potent weapon in  the arsenal of our nation s defenses  The bill requires the Defense Department to prepare several reports   including  1  A detailed analysis of the effects of reducing the ICBM force from 500 to  450 missiles  2  An assessment of how many test missiles and spare missiles would be needed  to maintain a force of both 500 and 450 deployed Minuteman III missiles through  2030  as well as an assessment of whether halting upgrades to the Minuteman III  missiles withdrawn from the deployed force would compromise the ability of those  missiles to serve as test assets  3  A plan to sustain and complete the modernization of all deployed and spare  Minuteman III missiles  a test plan  and an analysis of the funding required to  carry out modernization of all deployed and spare Minuteman III missiles  4  A description of the plan of the Department of Defense for extending the  life of the Minuteman III missile force beyond fiscal year 2030  In the last few weeks  we ve seen ample evidence for why the Air Force  missions based here at Minot are some of our nation s most important ones   Senator Conrad said  With North Korea testing a long range missile this summer  and now a nuclear weapon  it is clear that we need to preserve our nuclear  deterrent force       Minot    Senator Kent Conrad delivered a briefing today on new legislation  that helps to secure the future of the nation s
