Statement by Senator Kent Conrad on Revised FY 2005 Deficit Estimate                    October 6  2005  Today s revised deficit estimate from CBO is nothing to cheer about  A  317 billion deficit still represents the third worst deficit in our nation s history  And when the Social Security and other trust fund surpluses also being spent are added in  the debt in 2005 will actually increase by  575 billion  The cost of recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will add to the deficit in 2006 and beyond  The administration s slow response in getting aid to those impacted by the storms has meant that relatively few of the federal dollars committed to relief have actually been spent so far  As a result  we can expect the deficit to be even worse than expected in 2006 and later years  as aid finally gets out the door and recovery projects get underway  While the hurricane response costs will have a short term impact on the deficit  our primary concern should be over the longer term outlook  The current Republican budget plan takes us further down the road of deficits and debt  It calls for spending cuts in areas that affect our most vulnerable citizens  but then adds to the deficit by cutting taxes for our most fortunate  Clearly  we need to change those priorities and adopt a more sound fiscal course
