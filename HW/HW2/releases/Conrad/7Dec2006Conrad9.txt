Senate Passes Conrad Bill Banning Protests at Military Funerals Conrad s Bipartisan Legislation Guards the Honor of Fallen Soldiers                   December 7  2006  Washington    The U S  Senate today unanimously approved legislation Senator  Kent Conrad cosponsored to preserve the sanctity of America s fallen soldiers by  prohibiting protestors from disrupting their funeral services  These soldiers have given their lives for our liberty and freedom  We must  honor their sacrifice and allow the families of the fallen to mourn with peace  and dignity  Senator Conrad said  Earlier this year  federal legislation was signed into law prohibiting  demonstrations at and around national cemeteries during military funerals   However  protesters often got around the law by protesting at houses of worship   In addition  the majority of veterans are buried at private cemeteries not  covered by the federal law  Senator Conrad s legislation broadens the ban to the  funerals of all deceased members of the Armed Forces  not only at national  cemeteries  but also at private cemeteries  funeral homes and houses of worship  Senator Conrad s bipartisan legislation is largely in response to the  activities of a Kansas based radical church group that has staged protests at  military funerals around the country  Members of the Westboro Baptist Church  picket the military funerals because they believe U S  soldiers are fighting for  a country that accepts homosexuality  The radical religious group recently announced plans to protest the funeral  of North Dakota National Guard Cpl  Chris Kleinwachter  this Saturday   Kleinwachter  29  was a member of the 188th Air Defense Artillery based in Grand  Forks  He was killed last week in an accident while serving in Afghanistan  It sickens me to see our fallen soldiers being dishonored by protestors  No  one deserves this  It must stop  and it must stop now  Senator Conrad said  I  hope this legislation puts an end to the harassment and hate and gives some  comfort to these grieving families  They must know that this nation cares deeply  and that their loved ones sleep in peace with God
