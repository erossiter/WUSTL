Conrad  Spending Bill Has Misplaced Priorities Budget Gives Tax Breaks to Rich  Raises Deficit and Debt  Senator says                    December 21  2005  Washington    In debate on the U S  Senate floor today  Senator Kent Conrad said Republican budget proposals would actually increase both the nation s deficit and debt  This budget process does not make sense  When you put together all of the pieces it increases deficits and increases debt and at the worst possible time  before the baby boomers retire  said Senator Conrad  the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  The spending reconciliation bill debated today includes  40 billion in cuts to programs such as Medicaid  Medicare and student loans  In addition  a final deal on  70 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans is being negotiated  The combined impact is an increase in the federal deficit by  30 billion over the next five years  The spending bill passed the Senate by the narrowest of margins  51 50  with Vice President Dick Cheney casting the deciding vote  Prior to the vote  Senator Conrad was successful in striking several provisions to the reconciliation bill including a measure harming children  the elderly  and the less fortunate  Using budget rules  Senator Conrad overturned a provision that would have allowed hospitals to deny medical treatment to some Medicaid beneficiaries  Here we are  just days before Christmas  and the Majority is offering a series of measures that take from the least among us and give to those that have the most  That is not right  Senator Conrad said  This budget package is full of misguided priorities  It doesn t represent the values of the people I represent in North Dakota  It does not represent the values of the American people  The successful action by Senator Conrad will send the amended spending reconciliation bill back to the House of Representatives  where it will have to be changed and voted on again
