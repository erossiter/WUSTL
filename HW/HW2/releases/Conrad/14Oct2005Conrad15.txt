Conrad Works to Combat Spread of Bird Flu Senator Urges Health Secretary to Increase Supply of Antiviral Medications                    October 14  2005  Washington  In response to the growing threat of an avian bird flu pandemic  Senator Kent Conrad today urged U S  Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to increase the nation s supply of the medication to treat the disease  Senator Conrad also gave Leavitt the opportunity to postpone an upcoming trip to North Dakota in order to concentrate on developing a plan to prevent the spread of bird flu  During a Senate hearing in July  Leavitt accepted an invitation from Senator Conrad to come to North Dakota and meet with citizens to discuss the new Medicare prescription drug benefit program  Leavitt accepted the invitation and is scheduled to visit the state on October 28  Pandemic avian flu is a real threat that we must address  Senator Conrad writes in a letter to Leavitt  Given the priority of this threat  I would fully understand and support a delay to your trip  If you decide to visit North Dakota now to conduct outreach sessions on the prescription drug benefit  I request that you also meet with representatives of the North Dakota public health infrastructure  including public health officials  hospital administrators  physicians and others on the threat of avian flu  In the letter  Senator Conrad writes of his concern with the current U S  supply of the flu treatment Tamiflu  The United States currently possesses only 2 3 million courses of the antiviral medication  Tamiflu  Together with the additional two to three million courses recently ordered  our nation would have only enough antiviral medication to treat less than two percent of our nation s population  Senator Conrad writes  That is grossly inadequate and steps must be taken to immediately ramp up the acquisition of Tamiflu  To learn more about Senator Conrad s position on issues of importance to North Dakota

200 Independence Avenue SW Washington  DC 20201 0004 Dear Secretary Leavitt  I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for accepting my invitation to visit North Dakota and conduct meetings on the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  As you know  you agreed to come to North Dakota before your briefing with members of the Senate on the serious dangers presented by the avian bird flu  I want you to know that given the priority of this threat  I would fully understand and support a delay to your trip  If you do decide to visit  I can assure you of a warm North Dakota welcome  Pandemic avian flu is a real threat that we must address  In the briefing you recently gave to a group of us  you indicated that the United States currently possesses only 2 3 million courses of the antiviral medication  Tamiflu  Together with the additional two to three million courses recently ordered  our nation would have only enough antiviral medication to treat less than two percent of our nation s population  That is grossly inadequate and steps must be taken to immediately ramp up the acquisition of Tamiflu  I am especially concerned with recent press reports that the Administration s goal is to acquire only 20 million doses of Tamiflu  In your briefing you stated that perhaps as much as 25 percent of the American public could contract bird flu  Clearly  a goal of having 20 million doses does not match the threat you outlined  that is especially true given the fact that there is limited and perhaps no effective vaccine against bird flu  You indicated during the briefing that 81 million doses of Tamiflu may be required  however  I question if even that is the appropriate number  How can we assume that there will be efficient distribution of Tamiflu  Who will decide who gets the medicine  As we witnessed during last year s flu vaccine shortage  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s distribution plan fell short  and many who should have received the flu shot did not get one  What if there is panicked buying as we have recently seen in Turkey  What if Tamiflu is needed to treat other flu strains  What if there is a hoarding affect  This week  USA Today reported that Tamiflu s sales went up 713 percent from the same period last year  That is an indication of what could be exploding demand  Have we explored with the one maker of Tamiflu the opportunity to have other manufacturers to acquire licenses to produce the product  These are among the very serious questions that must be answered promptly if we are to protect our nation from a pandemic  Given this critical situation  I would certainly understand if you need to postpone your trip to North Dakota in order to address these difficult questions  It seems to me that your department must carefully reconsider its plan to cope with this potential crisis  If you decide to visit North Dakota now to conduct outreach sessions on the prescription drug benefit  I request that you also meet with representatives of the North Dakota public health infrastructure  including public health officials  hospital administrators  physicians and others on the threat of avian flu  I believe it is vital that the federal government work with state and local entities to begin planning the full range of responses to cope with a pandemic  Sincerely  KENT CONRAD United States Senate
