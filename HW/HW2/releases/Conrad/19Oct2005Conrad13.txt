Conrad Urges Colleagues to Back America s Farmers   Senator Votes Against Budget Cuts that he says  Abandon America s Farmers                     October 19  2005  Washington  In a key Agriculture Committee meeting today Senator Kent Conrad voted against a plan to cut vital agricultural programs and urged his colleagues to stand up for America s farmers  What is being proposed here today is a cut and run policy on our farmers  Senator Conrad said prior to the vote  We are cutting support to our farmers so that we can shoehorn in more tax cuts  primarily going to the wealthiest Americans  That is simply unfair and I can t support it  The Senate Agriculture committee then voted 11  9 to approve  3 billion in cuts to farm programs  The cuts were supported despite the fact that farm programs have cost  15 billion less than projected when the Farm Bill was passed in 2002  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Agriculture Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee  argued against the cuts to agricultural programs  saying the overall reconciliation plan would not reduce the nation s deficit  The combined spending and tax cuts actually add  35 billion to the deficit over the next five years  No one should believe that these agriculture cuts are part of a deficit reduction package  They are not  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad also criticized the disproportionate cuts to farm programs  Agriculture is less than one percent of the budget and is being asked to take almost nine percent of the cuts  Senator Conrad said  What you re voting for here is to cut support for farmers to offset more tax cuts  Senate Agriculture Chairman Saxby Chambliss  a Republican of Georgia  proposed the cuts to farm assistance programs  Specifically  he is calling for a 2 5 percent across the board cut in farm subsidies and delaying the advance direct payments that farmers receive each winter  Senator Conrad pointed out that the cuts to agriculture programs come at a time when America s farmers are recovering from natural disasters and facing rising energy costs and declining commodity prices  In addition  he stressed that the United States is in the middle of negotiations of a global trade agreement  known as the Doha Round  This plan makes no sense  We are cutting support to our farmers on the eve of trade negotiations  Senator Conrad said  In effect  these cuts serve as a unilateral disarmament in a trade conflict  We would never do this in a military confrontation  why we do it in a farm fight is beyond me
