ND Leaders Fight to Keep Hooligans Flying  Fargo s 119th Fighter Wing Likely to Receive C 130 Aircraft While Awaiting New Mission                   February 28  2006  Washington    North Dakota s congressional delegation and Governor met with top National Guard leaders today to press for new and expanded missions for the 119th Fighter Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard  In the meeting with Lt  Gen H  Steven Blum  chief of the National Guard Bureau  and Brigadier General Charles Ickes III  Deputy Director of the Air National Guard  the congressional delegation and Governor urged the Pentagon to quickly finalize plans to base Light Cargo Aircraft  LCA  at Fargo s Hector Field  They also received word from the generals that C 130 Hercules cargo aircraft will likely be assigned to Fargo as a temporary flying mission to maintain personnel levels at the base as the Happy Hooligans transition from flying F 16 fighter aircraft to Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs  and the Light Cargo Aircraft  While we are eager to get the Hooligans in the virtual cockpits of UAVs  their tremendous flying record indicates they can contribute even more with an additional flying mission  Piloting the Light Cargo Aircraft would be a great fit and we are urging the Guard to base this mission in Fargo  the delegation and Governor said in a joint statement  In the meeting in Senator Conrad s Capitol Hill office  General Blum and General Ickes detailed plans to base LCA at Fargo s Hector Field  The planes  which are capable of carrying 50 troops  would be used for both national defense and natural disaster response  General Blum has indicated that the Hooligans are at the head of the line for the LCA  While pilots from the 119th Fighter Wing are slated to retire their F 16 jets next year  the LCA will not be available until about 2009  Happy Hooligan pilots are expected to begin flying Predator UAVs by the end of 2006 but the difference between the personnel needed for the Predator unit and the F 16 unit could create a temporary reduction in staffing at Hector Field  The delegation and Governor have been fighting for an additional  temporary mission for the Hooligans to ensure there are no personnel cuts between the retirement of the F 16s and the arrival of the LCA  Responding to the North Dakota leaders  request  the generals detailed an LCA transition plan for Hector Field that includes temporarily stationing four C 130 aircraft at the base  The Air National Guard complex in Fargo will require renovations and new construction to host both the Predator UAVs and the Hercules cargo transports  The 2007 Defense budget includes  5 5 million for a new Predator Operations Complex at Fargo s Hector Field  The Hooligans are some of the best pilots in the world  For the security of both North Dakota and the nation  we need to keep them in the air  the North Dakota leaders said  We need to ensure that there is a continuous flying mission for the Hooligans
