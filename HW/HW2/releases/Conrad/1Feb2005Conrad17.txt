Remarks by Senator Kent Conrad at the Senate Budget Committee Hearing on CBO s Budget and Economic Outlook                      February 1  2005  Thank you Mr  Chairman  Thank you first of all for the many courtesies that you have extended to our side of the aisle during the transition  We appreciate very much the way you and your staff have accommodated us as changes were made  It is certainly a very good start to a relationship  and I want to thank the Chairman  I also want to welcome him to his new responsibility  and to indicate that I look forward very much to working with him  We have a long relationship  having served many years together in the Senate  We have areas where we very much agree  I think both of us believe that deficits do matter and that these budget deficits that we have now are too large and they need to be reduced and that we have a role with our colleagues  a responsibility in trying to put forward plans to get these deficits under control  I want to thank Mr  Holtz Eakin for his appearance today and for the hard work of his organization  They help us judge where we are and where we are headed  I would like to  if I could  to start out with just a few slides with respect to our current condition  and put it in some perspective and look ahead to what we see coming at us if we don t take action  This first slide shows what has happened over the last several years  Back in 2001  we had a budget surplus of  128 billion  Every year since then  the deficit has gotten larger  Record deficit of  377 billion in 2003  That increased to  412 billion last year  Now  the administration is projecting a deficit this year of  427 billion  a new record  The great concern that I have is not just the next four years or five years  The President has set a goal of reducing the deficit  cutting it in half in the next five years  My great concern is what happens right outside the budget window  The President has proposed making the tax cuts permanent  This dotted line shows the effect for the five years of the budget window  But  look at what happens after the five years of the budget window to the cost of the proposed tax cuts    it absolutely explodes beyond the five year budget window  That is not only true of the tax cuts proposed by the President  That same pattern pertains to fixing the alternative minium tax  the old millionaires tax that has now become a middle class tax trap  Three million people affected now  Ten years from now  there will be 40 million people caught up in the alternative minimum tax if we fail to take action  It costs over  770 billion to address that  That s not in any of the budget numbers  It s not in the CBO report today  I am not faulting CBO  It is not their fault it s not there  It s the rules they are governed by  I think we should make clear that CBO is required to do their estimates based on current law  And so when the President proposes additional tax cuts  that s not in the CBO estimate  When we have a challenge of the alternative minimum tax  that s not in their estimates  We see the same pattern with respect to the cost of the war  There s the  80 billion the President has just requested  But  the long term outlook over the next 10 years is  426 billion of additional spending that most estimates indicate will be required with residual war costs  If we put all those things back in  what we see over the next 10 years is red ink as far as the eye can see  We see massive deficits  not only this year  but every year going forward over the next 10 years  and very little improvement during this period  And  if as some are proposing we would fund the transition cost of changing Social Security  with borrowing   moving to some part of Social Security being in private accounts  that would make the deficit situation far more dire  We d go from an ocean of red ink to an expanding ocean of red ink so that by the end of the 10 year period  we d be approaching a shortfall of  800 billion a year  Our debt  if we put all those things back into the calculation that CBO does not include because they are not allowed to under the rules that govern them  we see the publicly held debt of the United States exploding to  11 trillion by 2015  And this money is being borrowed not only ourselves  but we re borrowing money all around the world  We ve now borrowed over  700 billion from Japan  over  190 billion from China  We ve even borrowed more than  69 billion from South Korea  Some of us are alarmed by this dramatic increase in our external debt  Our external debt has increased 82 percent in just the last three years  This is why it matters  Financial Times ran this headline last week  Central banks shun US assets  And the point they re making in this article is that increasingly foreign banks are concerned about the debt of the United States  both the trade deficit and the budget deficit and the extraordinary borrowing that are required by both  That sums up the additional comments I wanted to make  Mr  Chairman  as we head into a review by Mr  Holtz Eakin of their longterm outlook  I thank you  Click here to view the charts used by Senator during his remarks
