Statement from Senator Kent Conrad in Response to New Missions for Fargo and Grand Forks Air Bases                    June 27  2006  Washington   Senator Kent Conrad announced today that the Air Force and  National Guard have agreed on additional details of three new missions for North  Dakota s air bases in Grand Forks and Fargo  The National Guard Bureau notified Senator Conrad today that the new missions  had received formal approval as part of the Air Force s Total Force Integration  program  Under this program  the North Dakota Air National Guard s 119th Wing  has been assigned two missions at Hector International Airport  flying the Joint  Cargo Aircraft and operating a Predator UAV Ground Control Station  In addition  the North Dakota Air National Guard has been ordered to create a  new maintenance unit at Grand Forks Air Force Base that will support Predator  launch and recovery operations  The new maintenance squadron may also be asked  to support Global Hawk UAV operations once those aircraft arrive at Grand Forks  Air Force Base  This is another important step for both Grand Forks and the Happy Hooligans  in Fargo  We knew this was coming as a result if our hard work with BRAC   Nonetheless  it is welcome news and a great victory for North Dakota  North Dakota s air bases are among the best in the nation  a fact  highlighted by the decision to base Predator UAVs at Grand Forks and Joint Cargo  Aircraft at Fargo  These new missions are important and I am proud of the  critical role North Dakota plays in protecting our nation  When we began preparing for the 2005 BRAC round several years ago  no one  would have predicted that the North Dakota National Guard would be trading in  their aging F 16 aircraft for a vital role operating three different  state of the art aircraft  This success is a tribute to the amazing record of  the Happy Hooligans
