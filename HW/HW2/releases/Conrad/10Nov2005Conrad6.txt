Conrad Fights to Preserve Veterans  Honor  Senator s Bi Partisan Legislation Clamps Down on Phony War Heroes                    November 10  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced bipartisan legislation to penalize those who falsely claim to be decorated war veterans with phony military medals  America s veterans have made so many sacrifices for our country  They deserve our utmost respect and admiration  Senator Conrad said  It is disgraceful that there are imposters across the nation claiming to have received medals they did not earn  My legislation will punish those who are stealing the honor and recognition of the brave men and women who earned these medals through valor  Senator Conrad s legislation  entitled the Stolen Valor Act  is co sponsored in the Senate by Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter and eight other senators  Colorado Democratic Congressman John Salazar has also introduced a similar version of the bill in the House of Representatives in which Congressman Earl Pomeroy is a co sponsor  Currently  federal law prohibits individuals from fraudulently wearing military valor medals without permission  But existing laws do not stop imposters from identifying themselves as medal recipients  claiming it on their rsum or hanging fake medals on their walls  These imposters often impersonate distinguished veterans in places such as parades  schools  and the funerals of soldiers  Many con artists also use fraudulent medals to gain credibility to commit crimes against individuals or their community  Senator Conrad s legislation will expand the law making it a federal crime to impersonate a decorated veteran  Specifically  the Conrad bill will allow law enforcement to prosecute imposters who falsely claim  either verbally or in writing  to be recipients of the Medal of Honor  Distinguished Service Awards  Silver Star  or Purple Heart  In addition  this legislation calls for a one year maximum sentence and a fine of up to  100 000 for improper use of the distinguished service medals  It is my hope this legislation will serve to honor the courageous heroes who have rightfully earned these awards  Senator Conrad said  In addition to Senator Vitter  the lead Republican sponsor of the bill  co sponsors include  Senators Ken Salazar   D CO   Ben Nelson   D NE   Tim Johnson   D SD   Saxby Chambliss   R GA  John Thune   R SD   Chuck Hagel   R NE   Frank Lautenberg   D NJ   and Johnny Isakson   R GA
