Korea Trade Deal Falls Short  Conrad says Senator Urges Seoul to Immediately Reopen its Market to American Beef                   April 2  2007      Washington    Senator Kent Conrad said he was increasingly skeptical about the announced trade deal between the United States and the Republic of Korea and that still more needs to be done to reopen the Asian nation s domestic market to American beef     The Administration portrays this as a landmark deal   This truth is  this is a lousy deal  one that continues to fail ranchers in North Dakota and across the nation   Senator Conrad said     Yesterday  the White House announced that a bilateral free trade agreement had been concluded between Korea and the U S   While the deal would create export opportunities for U S  farmers and manufacturers  it still fails to lift strict limitations on the importation of U S  beef     South Korea   once America s third largest overseas beef market    closed its markets to U S  beef following the December 2003 discovery of a case of mad cow disease in the United States   That particular cow was born in Canada   Senator Conrad has been fighting to reopen world markets to U S  beef       After the series of trade negations concluded on Sunday  Korea made only vague promises to lift trade barriers on U S  beef in the near future  Then South Korea s Agriculture Minister announced that negotiations to establish new import guidelines for American beef will resume around June    The trade agreement between Korea and the U S  must now be ratified by Congress  Senator Conrad indicated he would continue to resist the agreement     We ve seen these empty promises before and it s unacceptable for the White House to sign off on this trade agreement without Korea lifting its ban on U S  beef   Senator Conrad said    North Dakota s cattle industry had  800 million in cash receipts in 2005  representing 20 percent of overall North Dakota farm receipts    Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  which oversees farm and ranch policy  as well as the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees trade
