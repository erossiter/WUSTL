Delegation Applauds Opening of Jamestown VA Facility Lawmakers Fight for More Access to Quality Health Care for Rural Vets                   April 20  2007      Jamestown     Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy led a ceremony today to open the new Veterans Administration  VA  community based outpatient clinic in Jamestown  The lawmakers cut the ceremonial ribbon and called the facility a step toward better health care for North Dakota s rural veterans     Unfortunately  many of North Dakota s rural veterans are having difficulty accessing medical facilities  They are forced to drive hundreds of miles to get the vital health care they need  This clinic here in Jamestown will ensure many of these men and women have access to the vital care they need and deserve   Senator Conrad said       Our veterans made significant sacrifices for our country  and we owe them top notch health care that does not require driving long distances to get timely medical attention   said Senator Dorgan   We worked hard to secure this new facility  and it s good to see this new clinic opening so veterans in the Jamestown area can get the access to health care they deserve      In a rural state like North Dakota  community based outpatient clinics are the difference between accessible health care and living in isolation   Congressman Pomeroy said    This new clinic will ensure quality  local care for veterans in the Jamestown area       The Jamestown clinic was one of three new outpatient clinics to open in North Dakota over the past couple months   Last year  after several meetings with the Department of Veterans Affairs  the congressional delegation won a commitment to open new veterans outpatient clinics in Williston  Dickinson and Jamestown     The VA also operates community outpatient clinics in Grafton  Minot  and Bismarck  The three new clinics could dramatically reduce driving distances and wait times for veterans seeking health care  In addition  clinics are planned in Devils Lake and at the Grand Forks Air Force Base    More than 20 percent of America s veterans live in rural areas and are forced to travel great distances to Veterans  Affairs  VA  health facilities   As a result  it is difficult for rural veterans to receive timely medical care  making them susceptible to additional health problems      America s veterans have dedicated their lives to our nation  It is our responsibility to ensure they receive the treatment they need  no matter where they live   the delegation said in a joint statement
