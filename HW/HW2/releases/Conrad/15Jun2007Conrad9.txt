Conrad Seeks Tax Change to Help Farmers Bipartisan Bill Speeds Tax Breaks on Equipment                   June 15  2007  Washington  Farmers who are keeping outdated field equipment for the tax write offs would have an incentive to upgrade sooner under a bipartisan proposal introduced by Senator Kent Conrad  Senator Conrads bill  introduced late Thursday  would shorten the depreciation period on farm equipment to five years from the current seven years  Senator Conrad called the seven year period an injustice because the average big ticket piece of farm machinery has life span of about five years  By shortening the depreciation period  farmers will be able to take larger annual write offs on equipment  such as combines and tractors  and would be able to afford replacing outdated or worn equipment sooner  Senator Conrad called the tax code outdated  The current tax code penalizes farmers when they upgrade their farm equipment  Thats not how a depreciation system is supposed to work  Senator Conrad said  My bill is a bipartisan effort to fix a mismatch in the system  This would encourage farmers to make the investments they need to boost productivity  and increase farm income  The bill has the support of Sen  Mike Crapo  a Republican of Idaho  as lead co sponsor  Other co sponsors of the bill include Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa  Pat Roberts of Kansas  Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas  Ken Salazar of Colorado and Jim Bunning of Kentucky  During previous tax reform efforts  the tax laws governing farm equipment were not examined separately as were the ones governing construction equipment  As a result  construction equipment is on a five year schedule and farm equipment remained on a seven year schedule  Senator Conrad serves on the tax writing Finance Committee and on the Agriculture Committee  He is Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
