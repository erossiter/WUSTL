Delegation Applauds Bismarck Public Works Facility New Biomass Project Makes Fiscal  Environmental Sense for Bismarck                   November 20  2007 Bismarck  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy were joined by Bismarck community leaders today to unveil the new Bismarck Landfill Biomass Project  The  352 000 project  funded in part by federal grants the Congressional delegation helped secure  will utilize wood waste from the landfill to heat a newly expanded Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility   Utilizing renewable and domestic energy sources is the next great opportunity for North Dakota  Senator Conrad said  The launch of this project is a perfect example of how our state is at the forefront of biomass power generation and can help lead our nation towards energy independence   This is a forward thinking and innovative project that will not only save taxpayers money  but also establish Bismarck as a leader in renewable energy  Senator Dorgan said  When we put together the energy bill  this was exactly the kind of project we hoped to encourage  It will use a renewable resource in a way that saves money and improves our environment  and thats good for our country and our state   Each year this innovative project will save thousands of dollars in taxpayer money and hundreds of tons of waste from taking up space in the landfill  I commend the city of Bismarck for leading the way in creating renewable energy that will benefit the environment and taxpayers  Congressman Pomeroy said  North Dakota is a national leader in renewable energy production  With this project our state is again setting an example for the rest of the country to follow on how to become more energy independent   The delegation noted that the Farm Bill now making its way through Congress will include significant increases in energy development  including support for converting existing heat and power systems from fossil fuel to renewable sources like biomass    The Bismarck Landfill Biomass Project will annually burn an estimated 300 tons of wood waste from construction projects and forest management projects to heat the newly expanded 18 000 square foot Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility  The project is projected to save Bismarck taxpayers nearly  1 million over a 30 year timeframe   Developers of the project hope the Biomass Project sparks the creation of additional facilities in Bismarck and throughout the state  It is believed that the Bismarck landfill could support a number of similar boilers that could benefit Bismarck as well as communities throughout central North Dakota   North Dakota currently produces more than 17 million tons of biomass  the fifth highest level of all states
