New Treasury Chief Faces Serious Challenge  Conrad says Senator Urges Paulson To Be More Than a Cheerleader for President s Agenda                   June 14  2006  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad used a face to face meeting today with Henry  Paulson  the President s nominee to be the new Treasury Secretary  to stress the  urgent need to cut the deficit and debt and begin to get the nation s fiscal  house back in order  As the new Treasury Secretary  Mr  Paulson will face some of the greatest  economic challenges in our nation s history  He needs to be more than a  cheerleader for the President s agenda  Senator Conrad said  It is my hope  that Mr  Paulson will address the President s failed economic policies and  provide some real solutions to get the deficit under control  Since President Bush took office  record budget surpluses have been turned  into record budget deficits  with this year s deficit projected to exceed  300  billion for the fourth year in a row  The President s policies of increasing  spending while at the same time cutting revenue have caused the debt to explode   The debt has grown from  5 8 trillion in 2001 to an expected  8 6 trillion by  the end of this year  and is projected to grow to nearly  12 trillion by 2011  under the President s policies  Additionally  the trade deficit  the difference  between what America sells abroad and what it imports  stands at about  800  billion  As Treasury Secretary  Paulson would be tasked with advising the President   setting tax policy and promoting America s economy in the global marketplace   Paulson  currently a Wall Street executive  will replace John Snow  who  announced his resignation after serving three years in the post  Paulson  60  grew up on a farm in Illinois  A graduate of Dartmouth College  and Harvard Business School  he served briefly in the Pentagon and White House  before joining the investment firm Goldman Sachs  He remained there for more  than 30 years and is currently the chairman and chief executive officer  Mr  Paulson is clearly an expert in financial markets which should equip him  well for the many responsibilities that fall under the Treasury Department  I  look forward to working with Mr  Paulson on a bipartisan basis to address the  many economic challenges facing our country  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad is the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee and a  senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  The Finance Committee will review  Paulson s nomination and schedule a confirmation hearing in the near future
