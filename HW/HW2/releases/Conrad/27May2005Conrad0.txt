Conrad Named Conferee on Highway Bill Senator Will Negotiate Nation s  295 billion Highway Spending Package                    May 27  2005  Washington    Senate leaders appointed Senator Kent Conrad today to the team that will negotiate the final transportation reauthorization bill    a move that puts him in a position to influence legislation that could direct close to  1 2 billion to North Dakota over the next five years  The funding slated for North Dakota s transportation system is a 31 percent increase over the previous highway bill  This bill is very important to North Dakota  It means new roads  new bridges and improved public transportation systems for our state  Senator Conrad said  It is a real investment that will mean thousands of good paying jobs for North Dakota  Passage of the  295 billion highway spending package also opens the way for approximately  45 million in public transit formula funding for North Dakota    nearly double what the state received in the last transportation bill  Senator Conrad will represent the Senate in a conference committee  made up of House and Senate members  which will negotiate the final version of the transportation bill  The Senate and the House have passed different versions of the legislation  and the conference committee must come up with a single version  Being named to the conference committee is significant because I will be working to ensure that North Dakota s interests are protected in those talks  Senator Conrad said  It is critical that we get this important legislation enacted into law quickly  We have a very short construction season in North Dakota and we need to get to work on these projects as soon as possible  The legislation passed earlier by the Senate would also assure that North Dakotans get a greater return on the gas tax than under current law  Under the Senate bill  North Dakota would get  2 08 back for every  1 in federal gas tax collected in the state  Only four states in the nation get a better return on tax dollars sent to Washington  Senator Conrad was named to the conference committee because of his position as Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee and the key role he played in negotiating financing for the Senate highway bill
