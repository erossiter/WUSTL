Senate Passes Patriot Guard Riders Resolution Conrad Legislation Honors Group for Supporting Families of Fallen Soldiers                    July 12  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad announced today that the U S  Senate  unanimously approved his resolution honoring the Patriot Guard Riders  a  national organization whose members attend the funeral services of fallen  American soldiers to protect grieving families from protesters  America s soldiers deserve our utmost respect as they are laid to rest   Their families and friends deserve a peaceful time of mourning and should not be  harassed and caused further pain  Senator Conrad said  The Patriot Guard  Riders stand watch as protectors of the fallen soldiers family and friends   allowing these service members to be honored and remembered with dignity  The Patriot Riders were formed in 2005 by members of an American Legion  motorcycle club who came together after a Kansas based radical church began  picketing military funerals  Members of the Westboro Baptist Church are known to  picket military funerals because they believe U S  soldiers are fighting for an  army that represents a country that accepts homosexuality  Over the past year  the Patriot Guard Riders have grown into a nationwide  network of more than 45 000 people  many who are veterans  Patriot Guard Riders  attend military funerals across the country and form a human wall to shield the  grieving family from protesters  At the funerals they hold up large American  flags to cover picket signs and rev the engines of their motorcycles to drown  out the chanting of protesters trying to tarnish the memorial services  Last month  Senator Conrad attended funeral services in Fargo for Michael  Hermanson  a North Dakota soldier killed in Iraq  Protestors from the Westboro  Baptist Church tried to disrupt the funeral but more than 150 members of the  Patriot Guard were on hand to protect the sanctity of the services  I was appalled by the behavior of protesters who used the funeral to convey  their hatred for our soldiers and their families  Senator Conrad said  Earlier this month  Senator Conrad attended the funeral of Paul Beyer in  Jamestown where the Patriot Guard again provided a buffer between those grieving  the loss of the young soldier and the out of state groups who heckled the  funeral goers and held up signs with vicious messages  Upon returning to  Washington  Senator Conrad began work on the Senate Resolution honoring the  Patriot Guard Riders  It is an amazing scene to see the Patriot Guard Riders standing  shoulder to shoulder honoring those who died defending our freedom  Senator  Conrad said  My bill salutes those who protect the dignity of fallen soldiers   the Patriot Guard Riders
