Conrad Offers Hope to Governors of Devastated Gulf Coast Senator Cites North Dakota s Ability to Recover from Grand Forks Flood                    September 28  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today urged the governors of the three states hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina to take a close look at how Grand Forks successfully recovered from its devastating 1997 flood  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing  the North Dakota Senator suggested the Gulf States could learn some valuable lessons from the North Dakota experience  Certainly  you want to rebuild  and the country is behind you  and will help you  Senator Conrad said  But we need to build smartly so that we have a better line of defense the next time Mother Nature comes calling  That s what we did in Grand Forks  We are now better protected  Three governors of hurricane impacted states Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco  Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour  and Alabama Governor Bob Riley  testified before the Senate Finance Committee today and asked lawmakers for help in rebuilding their devastated states  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Finance Committee  also expressed his concern that the Army Corps of Engineers has not received the funding it requested in order to protect communities around the country  He lamented past fiscal decisions that have robbed the Corps of needed funding  There is a very strong link to budget priorities  and there s been a failure  I believe  to meet the funding requirements to fully protect some areas and be prepared to respond in the case of a disaster  said Senator Conrad  Senator Conrad said the cost of rebuilding the Gulf States has caused the nation to focus more of its attention on the growing budget deficit    a concern he has long warned about  He said while some estimate Katrina s cost could be as much as  200 billion  that expense represents just a fraction of the amount of money being added to the nation s debt over the next ten years  Senator Conrad called for a reexamination of our nation s budget priorities  Given the ongoing expenses associated with the war in Iraq and the response to Hurricane Katrina  now more than ever  we must get our fiscal house in order  Senator Conrad said  We need to take a hard look at all spending  eliminate waste  and prioritize our expenditures  And relief for these hurricane victims must be a top priority
