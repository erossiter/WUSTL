Ranchers Laud Conrad s Bipartisan Beef Bill  Senator Leads Effort to Reverse Japanese Beef Ban                    October 26  2005  Washington    In an effort to pressure Japan to reverse its two year embargo of U S  beef  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced bi partisan legislation to impose tariffs on Japanese products imported into the United States  U S  beef is among the safest in the world  Senator Conrad said  There is no scientific basis for Japan to continue blocking our exports  If Japan does not accept our beef  we will impose tariffs to compensate for the damage they have caused our ranchers  Senator Pat Roberts  a Republican from Kansas  joined Senator Conrad in drafting the bill  which seeks to press Japan to end its ban of U S  beef  If Japan does not re open its important domestic market to U S  produced beef by the end of the year  the Conrad Roberts bill would require the President to impose tariffs on Japanese products  It is unacceptable for this Japanese embargo to cause further economic damage to the U S  cattle industry  and we appreciate the leadership from Senator Conrad and the co signers of this legislation  said National Cattlemen s Beef Association President Jim McAdams  The United States has played by the rules and honored its commitments  Now it is time for Japan to do the same and lift the ban on U S  beef  It is time to demonstrate just how serious the Japanese ban on U S  beef products has become  Japan has had enough opportunities to do the right thing and open the border to our products  but they have failed  said Wade Moser  Executive Vice President of the North Dakota Stockmen s Association  We appreciate and support the bi partisan efforts of Senator Conrad and his colleagues to re open this important market for our producers  Japan closed its market to U S  beef following the December 2003 discovery of a case of mad cow disease in the United States  That particular cow was born in Canada  Prior to the ban  Japan was the top importer of U S  beef  In 2004  American beef producers lost  3 14 billion because of Japan s refusal to reopen its markets  The United States and Japan did negotiate an agreement  signed in October 2004  dictating the steps for Japan to open its market to U S  beef  Little has happened since then to implement the agreement  Our ranchers in North Dakota  and across the nation  are suffering from Japan s trade embargo  Senator Conrad said  The time has come for Japan and live up to its commitments and re open its borders to American grown beef  Cosponsors of the legislation include Senators Wayne Allard   R CO   Max Baucus   D MT   Kit Bond   R MO   Sam Brownback   R KS   Conrad Burns  R MT   Norm Coleman   R MN   John Cornyn  R TX   Larry Craig   R ID   Mike Crapo   R ID   Byron Dorgan   D ND   Mike Enzi   R WY   Tim Johnson   D SD   Blanche Lincoln   D AR   Harry Reid   D NV   Ken Salazar   D CO   Jim Talent   R MO   Craig Thomas   R WY   and John Thune   R SD   Senator Conrad serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee  which oversees farm and ranch policy  as well as the Senate Finance Committee  which oversees trade
