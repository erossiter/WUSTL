Statement of Senator Kent Conrad on the Firing of Amtrak President David Gunn                    November 9  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement today regarding the firing of Amtrak President David Gunn  I question what led to this action  As I see it  this firing will be a setback to Amtrak reform  Mr  Gunn has been a successful president  He had begun to improve Amtrak s finances  rebuild its infrastructure and increase readership  Mr  Gunn was fired because he did not endorse Bush Administration s proposals to terminate federal support of Amtrak  Amtrak ridership in North Dakota  and across the nation  is on the rise  Firing Mr  Gunn puts Amtrak on the wrong track  Senator Conrad noted that when an early snowstorm shut down North Dakota s airports and highways last month  Amtrak s Empire Builder passenger train  which runs through North Dakota  still ran on its regular schedule  Amtrak s Empire Builder has increased ridership every year Gunn has been president  The Empire Builder carried 437 200 riders in Fiscal Year  FY  2004  up 5 2 percent from FY 2003  In FY 2005  Empire Builder ridership was 476 531  a 9 percent increase  Last week  Senator Conrad helped pass legislation that implemented key reforms to make Amtrak viable over the long term and authorized  11 4 billion to support the national passenger rail service  The Bush administration has proposed terminating federal support of Amtrak  a move that would push Amtrak s bankruptcy and the end of long distance passenger rail
