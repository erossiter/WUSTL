Conrad s Chronic Care Initiative Advances  Senate Budget Committee Adopts Conrad Amendment                    March 9  2006  Washington   Senator Kent Conrad s effort to improve health care outcomes of chronically ill patients and reduce Medicare costs advanced today in the Senate Budget Committee  The panel approved  by unanimous agreement  Senator Conrad s amendment to set up a large scale demonstration project  Senator Conrad s amendment provides  1 75 billion to better coordinate the care of the chronically ill  Specifically  it will assign a case manager to oversee the care of these seniors  We need to focus like a laser on the six percent of beneficiaries who consume 51 percent of Medicare spending  Senator Conrad said  These Medicare patients usually have multiple chronic conditions and their care is poorly coordinated  They face duplicative testing and are taking multiple prescription drugs that work against each other or are no longer necessary  The result is increased costs and adverse health consequences  Senator Conrad noted that the results of a previous  smaller scale  demonstration project involving several thousand chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries showed that better coordination of their care resulted in substantial financial savings and better health care outcomes  By providing better coordinated care for these chronically ill patients we could save more than  100 000 per case manager and cut hospitalization in half  Senator Conrad said  Now we need to see if we can get the same results in this new effort as we increase the number of patients
