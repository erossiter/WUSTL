Senator Kent Conrad s opening statement for the debate on the Budget Resolution                    March 14  2005  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague  the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee  for the many courtesies he extended to me and to my staff during consideration of the budget in the Budget Committee  He described it accurately and well  that it was a very professional process and we had a good debate on a whole series of issues  Many of those debates will now be out on the Senate floor  I do not think it will surprise people that my take on this budget is somewhat different than the distinguished chairman s take on it  That is what debate is all about  That is what democracy is all about  the chance to have differences and to debate them and to vote on them  That is the genius of our system  The way we arrive at truth  to the extent we do in this system  is we have a debate and a discussion  and we have a contest over ideas  That is a healthy thing  It is a good thing  That is what we are about to go through  As I look at this budget  I see something quite different than the chairman sees  I see a failure to face up to the major challenges confronting the country  I agree with him in terms of his diagnosis of where this is headed with respect to deficits  debt  and the explosion of the costs of the entitlement programs  I agree with that diagnosis  Where I disagree is that this budget does anything in any significant way to confront those challenges  In fact  this budget makes it all worse  That is the fundamental reality  This budget digs a hole deeper  This budget produces more deficits than if we did not have a budget resolution at all  If we put it on autopilot  we would be better off than what this budget does  Each and every year of this budget  the deficit is increased over the so called baseline budget  That is the reality  Perhaps to understand how we got to this circumstance  we have to look back before we can look forward  We have to look back first to 2001  when the President told us   W e can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits  even if the economy softens  That is what the President told us in 2001  But look what happened  The President was wrong  We went from a surplus in 2000  the year before President Bush came into office  and the deficit situation has declined each and every year to now record levels of deficit  the biggest deficit in dollar terms we have ever had  So when the President assured us we could have massive tax cuts and we would not have deficits  he was simply wrong  But he was not just wrong on that issue  because the next year he told us      O ur budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term    He said this in his State of the Union Address on January 29  2002  Unfortunately  that was wrong  too  because these deficits are not small and they are certainly not short term  In fact  what we see going forward to 2015 is an ocean of red ink  the biggest deficits we have ever had in dollar terms  So when the President said they would be small  he was wrong  They are very large deficits  When he said they would be short term  he was wrong again  These are long term deficits and deficits that are as far as the eye can see  That is not just my conclusion  that is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office as well  If we put back the things the President has left out  the ongoing war costs  the need for alternative minimum tax reform  and the money he is taking from Social Security    it is an interesting thing because at the same time the President says there is a shortfall in Social Security  under his budget each and every year he takes every dime of Social Security money that is available to take and uses it to pay for other things  Again  the President was wrong when he told us these deficits were going to be small and short term  The next year the President told us in his budget submission   O ur budget gap is small by historical standards  Again  the President has simply proved to be wrong  Let us put up that next slide that shows a historical comparison of the deficits under President Bush compared to the three previous administrations  The President says the deficits he is writing are small by historical standards  One can look at the last three administrations and see that his deficits are by far the largest  Let us go to the next slide  The President now says to us  well  we have deficits  so forget about that assertion that there are not going to be any  They are clearly not small and short term  They are clearly not small by historical standards  So now he assures us he is going to cut the deficits in half over the next 5 years  Well  let us look at the reality with respect to that assertion  because what we find is something quite different  This is the President s claim  He says the deficit is going to be cut in half over the next 5 years  but he gets that result simply by leaving out things  He leaves out war costs past September 30 of this year  He leaves out the need to reform the alternative minimum tax  which is the old millionaire s tax which is rapidly becoming a middle class tax trap  It costs over  700 billion to fix  There is not a dime in this budget to do it  Surprisingly  he leaves out the cost of his major proposal  which is to change Social Security  and the cost of his proposed change is in the trillions of dollars  over  700 billion the first 10 years but over 20 years over  4 trillion of costs  He does not have any of it in his budget  The President also told us back in 2001      M y budget pays down a record amount of national debt  We will pay off  2 trillion of debt over the next decade  That will be the largest debt reduction of any country  ever  Future generations shouldn t be forced to pay back money that we have borrowed  We owe this kind of responsibility to our children and grandchildren  We can now look back and check the record and see if the President s assertions were correct or incorrect  Again  he was wrong with virtually every major claim he made on the deficit  Unfortunately  the same is true with respect to the debt  The President said he was going to pay down  2 trillion of debt  Unfortunately  we do not see any paydown in debt  The debt is exploding  The assertion by the President that he was going to pay down the maximum amount of debt available to pay down evaporated  like his claims on the deficit  Instead  the debt is skyrocketing  and under the budget the President has sent to us  we see nothing but continued growth of the debt  When the President came into office  the publicly held debt was  3 3 trillion  We now forecast by 2015 it will be  9 4 trillion  almost a tripling of the debt at a time the President said he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt  One of the most interesting claims I get from colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that these massive tax cuts have nothing to do with the deficits and nothing to do with the growth of the debt  Well  how is that  How can that possibly be true  I remember very well this chart that the Congressional Budget Office showed us back in January of 2001  This chart shows the range of possible outcomes for the deficit  and the administration chose the midpoint of this range in telling us in 2001 we could expect  6 trillion of surpluses over the next decade  But now we are able to go back and see what actually happened  I remember so well  my colleagues on the other side told me  when I warned them against taking this 10 year forecast in the Budget Committee to the bank    I repeatedly warned it was very risky to count on a 10 year forecast    many of my friends on the other side said  Kent  you are being much too conservative  Don t you understand the tax cut will generate even more revenue  Don t you understand  when we put in place these tax cuts  we are going to get a tremendous revenue impact  more revenue than is forecast  They told me we are going to be in the top end of this range  Let s look at what actually happened  We can now see the record  The record is the red line  This is what happened to the deficits  We didn t get more money  we got less money  and the result is  combined with more spending on defense and homeland security and rebuilding New York  that the deficits are far worse than even the low end of the range projected back in 2001  Let s check reality  When our friends say if you cut taxes you get more money  that has not been the experience  The experience has been very clearly when you cut taxes  you get less money  In fact  we got a lot less money  3 years in a row with less money than the year before  That is unprecedented since World War II  It is not just tax cuts  Tax cuts are about half the reason  The other half is economic downturn and forecasts that were overly optimistic  Nonetheless  I want to go back to the point  I don t want anybody to miss this point  Here is what is forecast  this possible range of outcomes  They chose the midrange on which to base their spending and taxing policies  Many said  with the massive tax cuts you will get more money  But here is the reality  Here is what happened in the real world  A lot less money  much bigger deficits  and an exploding debt  If we look at the budget turnaround since 2000  that is the difference between what was projected and what actually occurred  What we see is that the revenue loss accounts for the bulk of the budget turn around  In fact  reduction in revenue is three quarters of the reason for the move from dramatic surpluses to dramatic and growing deficits  I think it is very important for us to be dealing in facts here  not rhetoric  not hope  not ideological belief  but facts  The facts are that the revenue side of the equation collapsed  Do you remember  back in 2000  revenue was running at almost 21 percent of GDP  The President said  That is very high by historical standards  And he was right  He said  As a result we need to cut taxes  I must say I also supported cutting taxes  I didn t support the particular plan that he advocated  but I believed we needed to cut taxes to give lift to the economy at the time  But I also believed we needed to reduce the amount of the tax cut over an extended period so that we would avoid going back into deficit and debt  That is where the President and I parted ways  I believed we needed to have tax cuts  In fact  I supported greater tax cuts than the President proposed  to give lift to the economy at a time of economic weakness  But the President wanted to go much further  and here is what happened  We had 21 percent of GDP in 2000 coming in  in revenue  Last year we were down to 16 3 percent of GDP  That is the lowest it has been since 1959  The revenue side of the equation collapsed  Again  about half of that is due to tax cuts  I listened very carefully to my colleague  He talked about the reason the revenue had gone down  He never mentioned the single biggest reason  He never mentioned the tax cuts  But the tax cuts are the biggest single reason for the revenue collapse  Again  I  too  supported tax reductions at a time of economic weakness to give lift to the economy  I didn t think the particular mix of tax cuts was the most effective because  unfortunately  the tax cuts that were put in place were largely weighted to the wealthiest among us  I think we would have been much better targeting the middle class and lower middle class because those are the ones most likely to spend those tax cuts  But beyond that  the question is  going forward  How much can we afford  What is the relationship between spending and revenue  That is what is critical  That is what creates deficits  Our friends on the other side only want to talk about spending  Spending is one half of the equation  revenue is the other half of the equation  It is the difference between how much you are raising and how much you are spending that leads to deficits  This chart goes back to 1980  The red line is the spending line  the green line is the revenue line  You can see very clearly back in the 1980s we had a big gap between spending and revenue  We were spending much more than we were taking in  As a result  we had record deficits at the time  Then we got spending under control  In fact  interestingly enough  during a Democratic administration spending as a share of our national income went down every year  Spending went down in a Democratic administration and revenue went up  It was that combination of reducing spending and raising revenue that brought us back to balance  In fact  for 3 years we were running surpluses  We even ran surpluses sufficiently strong to stop taking Social Security money and using it to pay for other things  We stopped the raid on Social Security  Then President Bush came into office  We had the tax cuts  we had an economic slowdown  and the revenue side of the equation plunged  We didn t get more revenue from tax cuts  we got less revenue  Is anybody listening  We didn t get more money with tax cuts  we got less money  And spending went up    though still far below where it was in the 1980s and 1990s  but spending went up  I am not faulting the President  We all agree spending had to go up on defense  on homeland security  on aid for New York  on the bailout of the airlines  and 91 percent of this increase in spending was in just those areas  Defense  homeland security  aid for New York  and bailing out the airlines  That is where the increase in spending occurred  Still  the spending is substantially below where it was in the 1980s and 1990s  The biggest culprit in the explosion of deficits was on the revenue side of the ledger  These are facts  This is not an ideological argument  It is just facts  I think that is what we have to concentrate on if we are going to get out of this mess  It is going to take spending discipline without question  We have to deal on this side of the ledger  But we are also going to have to deal on the revenue side of the ledger  and our friends on the other side of the aisle never want to talk about it  This year  the President has said  We ve got to do something about the deficit    it s important  He is right  We have to do something about the deficit because these deficits are much too high  and as far as the eye can see there is no reduction anywhere in sight  If we look at the President s budget  what we find in terms of doing something about the deficit is largely rhetorical  What the President s idea is of doing something about the deficit is just leave out things  Leave things out of the budget and that makes the numbers look better  It doesn t really change things though  This is the way you fool yourself  and this is the way others might get fooled  This is how institutions  companies  and individuals get into trouble  They start not quite telling the whole story  Maybe they don t even quite tell the whole story to themselves  When I look at the President s budget  that is what he and his people are doing  They are not really including everything  They are leaving things out to make the numbers look better  What have they left out  First of all  they switched from 10 year budgeting to 5 year budgeting because they know right beyond the 5 year budget window things look much worse  They have left out funding for ongoing war costs beyond September 30 of this year  Just don t include it  They say to me  It is hard to predict what the war costs might be  That is true  it is hard to predict  That is what a budget is all about  Can you imagine a family leaving out their utility bills because they are hard to predict month to month  Can you imagine a family leaving out the food bill because it is hard to predict  But that is what the President has done  He has left out the war costs past September 30 of this year because it is hard to predict  He has left out the cost of alternative minimum tax reform  Alternative minimum tax  that is the old millionaire s tax  It affects 3 million people now  and 10 years from now it is going to affect 40 million  It costs over  700 billion to fix  The President doesn t have one dime in his budget to address this problem  Last year  interestingly enough he had 1 year of fix in his budget  This year he doesn t even do that  I can make a budget look pretty good if I leave things out  and that is what the President is doing  Most remarkably  he has left out completely the cost of his Social Security privatization plan  He doesn t have one dime in his budget to cover the cost of a Social Security privatization plan that in the first 10 years costs over  700 billion  He doesn t have a dime in his budget  Over 20 years  his plan costs over  4 trillion  His answer is  borrow the money  On top of the already record deficits  borrow the money  I am going to  in a minute  get into why that is a very risky course for this country  The President also does something very interesting in this budget  He only provides details on discretionary spending  Those are accounts like education  law enforcement  parks    he only provides what he intends to spend in those areas for 1 year  Not since 1989 has a President failed to tell Congress and tell the American people what the outyear effects of his programs are  what the future years  effects of his programs are  But this President  for the first time since 1989  says he is not going to tell us that  I suspect the reason he is not going to tell us that is because it gets pretty grim by the time you get out to the third  fourth  and fifth year  When the President s people came to me and said they had a plan to cut the deficit in half over 5 years  and they showed me the plan  I said to them  Why don t you leave out some more things and claim you balanced the budget because what you are doing is you are making progress by denial  by leaving things out  When I go back and add in what the President has left out  I get a very different picture than is being presented on this floor about the budget going forward  When I go back and add up the things the President has admitted    the need for alternative minimum tax reform and the war costs  when I put in the amount of Social Security money that the President is taking to pay for other things  to try to arrive at what the real operating deficit of the United States is  here is what I find  I find an operating deficit in 2006 of  579 billion  increasing in 2007 to  584 billion  in 2008 to  586 billion  in 2009 to  595 billion  and improving by  1 billion in 2007 to  594 billion  These are my best estimates of what the operating deficits are going to be under the President s plan  Not an improvement  There is no cutting the deficit in half  Instead  massive operating deficits  adding to the debt by almost  600 billion a year  each and every year for the next 5 years  and after 5 years  it gets much worse  This is not what the American people deserve in terms of being told about the fiscal condition of their country  Let me go back to the specifics of the things the President has left out  Here in war costs there is  82 billion in a budget supplemental put in this year  but there is nothing past September 30th of this year in the President s budget  The Congressional Budget Office says  383 billion is what we can expect  There is  300 billion left on the cutting room floor  real costs that a real budget would include  It is not only there that we see a hiding from the American people of how serious our fiscal condition is  If you look at the President s tax cut proposal  that is where it is most dramatic  The dotted line on this chart is the first 5 years of the President s plan  Making the tax cuts permanent has a modest cost in the first 5 years  But look what happens right outside the budget window  The costs of the President s tax cut plan absolutely explode  Is this  perhaps  a reason that the President moved from 10 year budgeting to 5 year budgeting  Did he want to disguise the full effect of what he is proposing from the American people  Did he want to hide it so that people did not see where this is all headed  I have already shown that in the next 5 years the operating deficits will be running in the neighborhood of  600 billion a year  But look what will happen if the President s plan is adopted  These deficits are going to skyrocket because the revenue hemorrhage will skyrocket  It is not just the revenue hemorrhage but the other items as well  This is  according to the Congressional Budget Office  the money that is needed to fix the alternative minimum tax  I said it was over  700 billion  It is actually  774 billion  Not a dime of it is in the President s budget  And it gets much worse after the first 5 years  Of course  the President s budget has none of it  That is hidden from the American people  On the President s Social Security plan  the first 10 years cost  754 billion  Here is what is in the President s budget  zero  Nothing  When we get to the 20 year cost  others are saying even more than this  My own projection is  4 4 trillion for the cost of the President s privatization plan  Why  Because if you take some of the payroll taxes and divert them into private accounts  you have to replace the money you have taken from somewhere  The President s proposal is  borrow it  Just borrow another  4 trillion  I am at a loss for words  I feel more and more as though I am involved in a surreal discussion in a surreal exercise on the budget of the United States  We have record deficits now  The President says  cut the revenue some more and add more to the spending  but he leaves a lot of it out of the budget and says he is going to cut the deficit in half  He has been wrong on each and every one of his forecasts  Not wrong by a little bit  but wrong by a country mile  Here is the Comptroller General of the United States  the head of the Government Accountability Office  He warns the fiscal outlook is worse than claimed  He said to the National Press Club in February of this year  The simple truth is that our nation s financial condition is much worse than advertised  That is the truth  That is the truth  right here  Here is a guy who is telling the truth  The simple truth is that our nation s financial condition is much worse than advertised  I go back to the chart  The President says he is going to cut the deficit in half  but he gets there by leaving out things  When you put the things back  what you see is massive deficits  massive additions to the debt  In fact  by 2015  each family s share of the debt will total  according to our calculations  over  73 000  That is where these fiscal policies are leading  When the President says the people s money  he is exactly right  It is the people s money  It is also the people s debt  The President says let s not pay the people s bills  Let s borrow the money  Guess what  In whose name is he borrowing it  He is borrowing it in our names  He is borrowing it in the names of all of us who are responsible for ultimately paying off this debt  So when the President says the people s money  absolutely  it is the people s money  it is also the people s debt  The President is running up the debt in a record way and at the worst possible time  right before the baby boomers retire  There is another part of this that I don t think is being shared with the American people  Where are we borrowing all this money from  Where is it coming from  Increasingly  it is coming from abroad  Here is what has happened  When the President came into office  we owed an external debt  Foreign holdings of our debt were just over  1 trillion  In the short time this President has been in office  that has almost doubled  Foreign holdings of our debt have gone up 92 percent in the term of office of this President  It took 200 years to get external debt of  1 trillion and this President has taken us to  2 trillion in just over 3 years  Here is where the money is coming from  We have now borrowed over  700 billion from Japan  Hard to believe  isn t it  We have borrowed over  700 billion from Japan  I read in the paper the other day that Japan now holds  840 billion of United States dollars  They are sitting on  840 billion of United States dollars  We have borrowed  712 billion from Japan  We borrowed  160 billion from England  We borrowed  69 billion from the so called Caribbean banking centers  We have borrowed  69 billion from South Korea  We have borrowed  60 billion from OPEC  That is the oil exporting countries  Here we are  We have borrowed money all over the world  And it is increasing dramatically  So what  What difference does it make  The difference it makes is it makes us more and more vulnerable to the decisions of foreign central bankers as to the economic security of this country  It is that simple  It is that important  What happens to your relationship with the banker when you owe money versus when you have a big deposit  Does your relationship change  Sure it does  Our relationship is changing with the rest of the world because we have gone from being the biggest creditor nation in the world to being the biggest debtor nation in the world  So now we are very dependent  When we have a bond action to finance the credit and debt  we are increasingly dependent on foreign governments and foreign central banks to buy this debt  This is a story from January from the Financial Times  Central Banks Shun US Assets  Shifting reserves to eurozone will deepen Bush s difficulties in funding deficit  Actions likely to undermine dollar s value further  Friends  that is the risk that is being run by these massive budget deficits  by these massive trade deficits  We are more and more dependent on others  We are more and more dependent on Japan loaning us money  on China loaning us money  on South Korea loaning us money  What happens if they decide some day they are not going to continue loaning us money  What happens then  We have had a couple of indications in the last few months  A few weeks ago  February 23  Korea said they were going to limit their dollar holdings  Central banks plan upsets exchanges  Fears flared anew yesterday that the United States dollar might lose a crucial underpinning of support    purchases by the world s central banks    after South Korea s central bank said in a report that it plans to invest more of its holdings in the currencies of other countries  What happened  news of the report      sent the dollar skidding on foreign exchange markets  The Euro was trading at  1 3259 late yesterday  up from Monday s close of  1 3067  The dollar fell against the 104 04 yen    and the greenback also sank against the British pound  the Canadian dollar and Swiss franc  The dollar s slide  together with a rise in oil prices  drove stock prices sharply lower  These are the risks being run due to a reckless fiscal policy  This fiscal policy of massive record deficits with no end in sight and record massive trade deficits with no end in sight is putting the economic strength of this country at risk  It is not only Korea  On March 11  last week  Japan followed Korea  Talk in Japan shakes dollar and treasuries  The dollar fell and treasury yields rose yesterday after the Japanese Prime Minister made remarks that suggested the country s industrial bank could be shifting some of its huge reserves out of dollars and treasury securities  What happened  The dollar took another hit  So now we have Korea saying they are going to diversify out of dollars  We have Japan  the biggest lender to our country  warning of the same thing  What would happen if they didn t show up at a bond action  We hold an auction of United States securities to float the boat to cover these deficits  because when you are spending more money than you are taking in  you have to borrow the money  In the past  we borrowed almost all of it from ourselves  Not anymore  Increasingly  we are borrowing from all over the world  And they are warning us  You are going too far  we might not continue buying this debt  What happens if they don t show up  We all know what happens  We would have to dramatically increase interest rates to entice them back  That would have severe consequences for our economy  It is not only Koreans and Japanese  Here is one of the most successful investors in the history of the United States  Warren Buffett  What is he saying  He says in 2005  he is still betting against the dollar  Warren Buffett  one of the most successful investors in America  is betting against the dollar  When the stock market was soaring in the late 1990s  Warren E  Buffett now says  he should have sold stocks rather than just complain that they were overvalued  Now Mr  Buffett  the billionaire investor  says he is acting on his view that the dollar is still headed down  even though it makes him nervous that so many agree with him  So he has bet a huge amount of money that the dollar is going to continue to decline in value  We have the South Koreans warning us  We owe them almost  70 billion  We have the Japanese warning us  We owe them over  700 billion  And we have Warren Buffett  I can tell you  I was with a man who is one of the foremost financial advisers in the country  and he told me last year he was at the annual meeting of one of the wealthiest families in America and the discussion at their annual meeting was exactly what we are talking about here  the enormous risks being run by the United States with these massive budget deficits  massive trade deficits  leading to unprecedented borrowing  not only from our own people  but from countries around the world  They saw that as a serious vulnerability    this  one of the wealthiest families in America  And the debate was whether they should diversify out of dollar denominated investments  They concluded  apparently  that they would do that  Now  all we have to do is look at what has happened to the dollar against the Euro since 2002 to see why they might be concerned  Look what has happened to the value of the dollar  It has declined 33 percent against the Euro in just that period of time  That is dramatic  Every dollar we have has lost 33 percent of its value against the European currency  So if you are a central banker in Japan  you are a central banker in Korea  and you have loaned all this money to the United States  and you see that those dollar holdings you have in your central banks have declined in value by almost a third against the European currency  might you conclude that it is time to invest some of your money somewhere else  Friends  this is the risk that is being run by this policy of debt and deficits  These deficits are out of control  They are undermining confidence in the American currency  They are undermining confidence in the long term economic strength of the country  And this budget does not do anything about it  In fact  this budget makes it all worse  This budget means bigger deficits  not smaller  The Congressional Budget Office put out a baseline budget  if we made no policy changes  of what would happen  But this budget does make policy changes  and you would think that given these facts  the policies would be to reduce the deficits  That is not what this budget does  This budget increases the deficits each and every year compared to a policy of putting everything on automatic pilot  Now  that is a fact  What are the potential consequences here  If the dollar were to decline even more precipitously than it has already  there are very few options left  You have to  first of all  dramatically increase interest rates  What difference would that make  Well  let s look for a typical American family  A 1 percent increase in interest rates will raise the payment on a 30 year home mortgage of  150 000 by  1 200 a year  On a  300 000 mortgage  it would raise it  2 400 a year  On a  450 000 mortgage  it would raise the payment  3 600 a year  And it would not be only on a house mortgage  It would be on a car payment  student loan payment  all the corporate debt that is out there  and all the Government debt  If interest rates rose dramatically in order to offset the effect of foreign central banks being unwilling to loan us more money  the economic consequences here could be severe  When I look at the tax policy that underlies this budget  it also raises the serious question of fairness  Because under the President s plan  the top 1 percent in our country  those who earn over  402 000 a year  get 30 percent of the benefit  The top 1 percent get 30 percent of the benefit  The top 20 percent get over two thirds of the benefit  They get almost 69 percent of the benefit  We hear a lot from our friends  Well  the higher income people pay more in taxes  That is true  They pay more in income taxes  But our friends on the other side always want to leave out the payroll taxes that everybody else pays  And when you put the two together  you find that the wealthiest among us do pay more  but they do not compare anywhere close to the proportion of the tax cuts they are getting  When we look at 2004 and how the tax benefits stacked up in that year  what we see is  from the combined effect of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts  a middle income household got  1 000 and the top 1 percent  those earning over  400 000  got  78 000  If we were going to have a bar on the chart to compare what those earning over  400 000 got in tax benefit as compared to what a middle income household got  the bar would have to go 17 feet higher  It would go almost to the ceiling of this Chamber to compare what the top 1 percent got in comparison to the middle income people in the country  Is that fair  That is what the President s tax policy says is fair  Give those who are the top 1 percent  78 000 in tax benefit  give the middle income  1 000  In this budget is a continuation of the dividend and capital gains tax cut  Those cuts will provide a millionaire  on average  with a tax cut of  35 000  Somebody earning  50 000 to  200 000 gets  112  Let me go through this again  This is the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center that has done this calculation  The dividends and capital gains tax cut that my colleague was praising gives those who earn less than  50 000 a year  on average  a  6 tax reduction  That is the vast majority of people in this country  For these tax types    dividends and capital gains    the average savings for an American earning less than  50 000 is  6  For somebody earning  50 000 to  200 000  they get a tax savings of  112  And the dividends and capital gains tax cuts are a major part of this budget  For those earning  200 000 to  1 million  they get an average tax cut of  1 480  But for those who earn more than  1 million  they get  on average  a tax cut of  35 000  Now  this is some people s sense of fairness  it is not mine   6 to those who earn less than  50 000 a year  and  35 000 to those who earn more than  1 million  We have the biggest deficits in the history of the country  and no end in sight  and this is what we are going to do  That is what we are going to do if we pass this budget  Our friends on the other side say  Well  those who are at the top pay more in taxes  That is true  Those who are at the top pay more in taxes  That is absolutely true  But do you know what  they are getting 30 percent of the benefit of this tax cut  and they pay 16 percent of the tax burden  So they pay more  but they are getting much bigger benefit than what they pay  My friends  at some point we are going to have to deal with reality  The reality is  we are not paying our bills in this country  We are not coming anywhere close to paying our bills  And our friends on the other side come with a budget that says we have no intention of paying our bills any time in the foreseeable future  We are not going to come anywhere close to paying our bills  Then you get to the question of priorities  which is a very important question as we go forward  Let me say to my colleagues  for those earning over  1 million in 2006  the total cost of the President s tax cut proposals for that 1 year alone is  32 billion  Let me repeat that  For those earning over  1 million a year in 2006  the tax cuts to them cost  32 billion in that year alone  On the other hand  the cost to maintain veterans funding at the 2005 level would be about  300 million  So in this budget  they are saying it is 100 times as important to give the Bush tax cuts to those earning over  1 million a year as it is to maintain funding for our veterans  Is it 100 times as important  Is it 100 times as important  Well  it is not only veterans  That same question can be asked of the COPS Program that has put 100 000 police on the street to make our cities and towns safer  Again  the cost of the tax cut for those earning over  1 million a year in 2006 is  32 billion for that year alone  The money to restore the COPS Program would be  500 million  So what you have to ask yourself is  is it 60 times as important or could the very wealthiest among us  those earning over  1 million a year  give up one sixtieth of their tax cut for that year to keep 100 000 police on the street  I think that is a question we should ask  I know what my answer would be  Education  It would cost  4 8 billion to restore the education programs cut in the President s budget  Again  for that same year  the tax cuts for those earning over  1 million cost  32 billion  Would the wealthiest among us be willing to give up one sixth of their tax cut to restore the cuts to education  The same applies to community development funding  I have heard from virtually every mayor in my State  It costs  1 7 billion to restore the cuts there  At the same time  we are going to give a  32 billion tax cut to those earning over  1 million a year in that 1 year alone  Low income heating assistance  It costs  220 million to restore the money  a little tiny sliver on the chart     220 million  At the same time  we are going to spend  32 billion on tax cuts for those earning over  1 million a year  For agriculture  this chart looks at it in a little different way  The President is cutting  7 5 billion there  The cost  over the same period of time  for those earning over  1 million a year is  185 billion  That is 25 times as much  My friends on the other side say that somehow this budget is going to reduce the deficit  No  this budget does not reduce the deficit  If we compare it to the Congressional Budget Office s baseline    there are no policy changes  we continue what we are doing now    this budget increases the deficit each and every year  The biggest increase is in the next year     63 billion of additional deficit if we pass this budget compared to continuing what we are doing now  If we make no policy changes  just continue what we are doing now  we would have  63 billion less in deficit than if we pass this budget  I want anybody who votes for this budget to go out and explain to the American people why  at a time of record budget deficits  they are passing a budget that increases the deficit  I want to hear that explanation  Again  when we go back and look at the things that have been left out of this budget compared to  if we go back and include the additional war cost that is left out of this budget  the alternative minimum tax expense that is excluded  if we take the money that is being diverted from Social Security and used to pay for other things  here are the operating deficits we see under the budget that is before us  It is a little better than the President s  but not much   587 billion   583 billion   582 billion   582 billion  What is all this talk about cutting deficits in half  The only way they get there is they leave out things  They leave out the money they are taking from Social Security  They leave out the money for the war  They leave out the money for the alternative minimum tax  Just leave out things  If you put them back  massive deficits  This is what is going to get added to the debt  not the numbers they are talking about  This is what is going to be added to the debt  And if you doubt this is the case  let s look in their budget  Let s look at their own document  This is their own budget resolution  Let s look year by year  I have said that they are going to be adding almost  600 billion a year to the debt  I understated it  I apologize  They are going to be adding much more to the debt than that  I was just doing an operating budget  If we look at what their own document says  they are going to add to the debt every year  For 2005   669 billion is going to get added to the debt  according to their own calculations  Next year they are going to add  636 billion to the debt  The next year is  624 billion  The next year is 622  By the fifth year  611  Where is the cutting of the deficit  Where is it  It is magical  There is no cutting  This is what they say about their own budget  This is what they say they are going to add to the debt  This isn t my number  This isn t my presentation  This is theirs  This is from their own budget document  And what does it say  They are going to add to the debt  600 billion every year of this budget  The President says it is important to do something about the deficit  They say it is important to do something about the deficit  They are not doing anything about the deficit  That is their own calculation about what is going to happen  Remember what the President told us about 2008  He told us in January of 2001 that there would be virtually no debt left by 2008  That is what he told us  This is what we now believe the debt will be in 2008  Instead of virtually no debt  we are going to have almost  6 trillion of debt  This is what he said was going to happen  This is what is really happening  The President of the United States has been wrong by a country mile on every one of his major assertions about the fiscal condition of our country  It has real consequences  When we look at the budget that our Senate Republican colleagues have put up  let me just say it is a little bit better than the President s in some ways  But it still has additions to the deficit  bigger deficits  more debt by their own calculations  It still has flawed priorities  Here is veterans funding  It costs  300 million to maintain veterans funding  They are going to give  32 billion in tax cuts to those earning over  1 million a year  On the COPS Program  it costs  500 million to restore the cuts in the COPS Program and put 100 000 police on the street  But they would rather give    in fact  by a sixtyfold margin    tax cuts to the wealthiest among us  That is more important to them  It is more important to them to give those tax cuts to those earning over  1 million a year than it is to restore the cuts to education  six times as important  Are those really the priorities of this country  Is that what this country thinks is important  I will have more to say about this budget as we go forward  But this is a budget that is not facing up to the real challenges facing our Nation  This is a budget that basically ducks and runs  This is a budget that basically says  We don t have to worry about that  We will talk as though we are worried  We will use the words  But the actual budget is not going to do anything about these mounting deficits and debt that fundamentally threaten the economic security of the country  Mr  President  we should be doing much better than this  At some point  I hope it is not a crisis that gets us that  I still believe we have the ability and the will to act to face up to the crisis rather than letting it overcome us  But this budget doesn t face up to it  This budget doesn t do that  This budget just lets the good times roll    more tax cuts  more spending  even though we cannot pay our bills now  I believe deeply that is a fundamental threat to the economic security of our country because we are not just borrowing this money from ourselves anymore  we are borrowing from countries all over the world  That makes us vulnerable to their decisions about whether they are going to continue to loan us money  I believe it is past time for the President to reverse course and to call on Congress and to put his administration to the task of an overall plan to face up to the shortfalls in Medicare  in Medicaid    by the way  the shortfall in Medicare is eight times the shortfall in Social Security  The President has no plan to deal with that  none  He would rather focus on Social Security  which is a challenge  a long term funding problem  I will repeat  the funding problem with Medicare is eight times as big as in Social Security  My own view is that we ought to be working on it all  We ought to have everything on the table    Medicare  Medicaid  I salute my colleague from New Hampshire who put a focus on Medicaid  where spending is going through the roof in States and for the Federal Government  but we ought to be putting the focus on all of these areas  including the budget deficits  because I believe only in that way will we come up with a plan that really strengthens the country  I yield the floor
