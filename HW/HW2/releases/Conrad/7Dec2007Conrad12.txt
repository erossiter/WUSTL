Conrad Helps Broker Deal to Move Farm Bill Forward Senator Optimistic that National Ag Legislation Will Pass Senate by Christmas                   December 7  2007 Washington  Senator Kent Conrad helped negotiate a deal late last night that will allow the Senate to move forward on the Farm Bill after weeks of stalled negotiations  In light of the deal to limit debate on the national farm legislation  a vote on final passage could occur before Christmas   This agreement shows that  despite significant differences  my colleagues understand just how important passing this Farm Bill is to all Americans  Senator Conrad said  This is a strong bill for North Dakota and I am pleased that common sense prevailed and we can now move forward   After quick and overwhelming bipartisan approval in the Senate Agriculture Committee  the Farm Bill had been bogged down by partisan disputes in the Senate over how many amendments should be allowed on the bill   The new agreement now calls for a maximum of 20 amendments each to be offered by Republicans and Democrats  paring down the more than 280 that were filed  many of which were unrelated to agriculture policy   Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Agriculture Committee and one of the bills authors had been negotiating with Democratic and Republican leaders in recent weeks to bridge the partisan divide and reach agreement   The bipartisan legislation  which Senator Conrad helped shape  builds on the success of the 2002 Farm Bill and significantly improves commodity  nutrition  conservation and rural development programs  It also creates a disaster program for family farmers and ranchers and invests in new priorities  such as making America more energy independent   Senator Conrad will detail the agreement for farmers  ranchers and business leaders at a meeting in the Mayville Senior Center Saturday at 3 pm
