Statement by Senator Kent Conrad on FY 2007 OMB Mid Session Review                    July 11  2006  Anyone celebrating today s deficit announcement is missing the bigger  picture  The long term deficit outlook is bleak  the nation s debt continues to  pile up at an unsustainable rate  and the Bush administration has done nothing  but make it all much worse  Despite claims that the deficit is coming down  it is still projected to  explode over the long term as the rising cost of the President s tax cuts  collide with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation  Is that the good  news being celebrated by some today  Meanwhile  the debt continues to soar  When we add in the Social Security and  other trust fund dollars being spent  the debt in 2006 will actually increase by   593 billion  That is  42 billion worse than the debt increase last year  Is  that what some are now celebrating  On the issue of revenue  real revenues     that is  adjusted for inflation    have experienced little growth since 2000  In  other words  despite claims that revenues are pouring into the federal treasury  due to the President s tax cuts  real revenues have only this year surpassed  where they were six years ago  And revenues in 2006 are still far below the  original projections for revenues for the year  Perhaps that is what they are  celebrating  The cheering is really about distracting    distracting the American people  from what is really going on with our nation s budget  The Bush administration   with the help of the Republican Majority in Congress  has increased spending  while dramatically cutting revenues  And the result has been an explosion of  deficits and debt  The American people deserve better  They deserve an honest assessment of our  long term budget outlook  And they deserve a real plan to put our fiscal house  back in order
