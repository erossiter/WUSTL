Conrad Honored by Fargo YMCA Senator is Recognized for Leadership in Protecting Employees Retirement Plans                    August 2  2005  Fargo    Senator Kent Conrad was presented with an outstanding leadership award today by the Fargo YMCA in recognition of his efforts to ensure that the retirement funds of more than 85 000 YMCA retirees are safe from being incorrectly taxed by the Internal Revenue Service  The YMCA provides a wonderful service to communities in North Dakota and across the nation  The men and women who work there are dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for young people  Senator Conrad said  These YMCA employees deserve a secure future as well  That is why I worked to develop legislation that would preserve their pension system  After learning that the IRS was questioning the YMCA s tax status as a church organization  a distinction that would threaten the retirement security of YMCA staff and retirees  Senator Conrad actively pushed for legislation to clarify the tax status of the organization  A senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad s legislation ensured that the YMCA s pension plan remains classified as a church plan    a type of pension plan offered by churches or their associations with a special set of rules and regulations under the Tax Code  The bipartisan legislation was approved by Congress and signed into law in December  2004  The YMCA pension plan is a significant component of the compensation package offered to all YMCA employees  Every full time employee of local YMCAs is required to participate to help ensure better retirement security for all employees  The pension provides employees with annuities that guarantee monthly income for life  The mission of the YMCA is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit  mind and body for all  YMCAs are the largest not for profit community service organizations in America  working to meet the health and social service needs of 18 9 million men  women and children communities in the United States  YMCAs can be found in 10 000 communities across the United States  In fact  there are six here in our state  serving more than 88 000 North Dakotans  Senator Conrad said  I hope that my legislation will provide a bit of security for YMCA employees  knowing that their pension benefits will be protected
