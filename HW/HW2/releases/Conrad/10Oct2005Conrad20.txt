Conrad Calls USTR Plan a Risk to America s Farmers  Proposal Strips U S  Producers of their Safety Net  Senator says                    October 10  2005  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today called a proposal by the US Trade Representative to slash farm support and eliminate agricultural tariffs extremely serious and said the Administration was selling out America s farmers  USTR Rob Portman unveiled his proposal in Zurich  Switzerland  today at a special session of the World Trade Organization  WTO  in an attempt to break a deadlock before an end of year deadline on negotiations of a global trade agreement  known as the Doha Round  Talk about betting the farm  Senator Conrad said  The USTR is making huge concessions to the WTO  gambling with the future of American agriculture  Under the plan  the U S  would impose deep cuts in farm support and eliminate future agricultural tariffs  Specifically  the proposal would eliminate export subsidies by 2010 and make a 60 percent cut in amber box support  slashing the farm income safety net  The proposal is contingent on other nations making concessions  including the European Union accepting an 83 percent cut in amber box support  The USTR has described the proposal as the first step toward President Bush s announcement of a U S  goal of completely eliminating all agricultural subsidies and tariffs  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  said the Europeans are sure to argue that an 83 percent cut is excessive and will push for greater cuts to U S  subsidies  Europe gives much greater support to their producers than we do to ours  Senator Conrad said  Europe now accounts for 87 percent of world agricultural export subsidies  The United States is 1 percent  In addition  the European Union is outspending the U S  on domestic support by a ratio of 5 to 1  EU farmers get  277 an acre in support every year  U S  farmers get about  48 an acre  We need to eliminate these distortions that put our farmers at a huge disadvantage in world markets  Senator Conrad said  Our farmers can compete against the French farmer and the German farmer  But we cannot expect them to compete against the French government and the German government  That s not a fair fight  Senator Conrad will host a national agriculture conference in North Dakota later this month to discuss WTO negotiations and other international trade issues  The conference  21st Century Farm Policy  Challenges and Opportunities  will be held Oct  30 31 in Fargo
