Canadian Road Dike Unacceptable  Conrad says Senator Calls for Meeting with Canadian Government on Flood Bottleneck                   April 26  2006  Washington  With Pembina County still dealing with floodwaters left by the springtime rise of the Red River  Senator Kent Conrad today called on the Canadian government to come to the table and discuss a Canadian road that is acting as a dike  preventing the flooded river from naturally draining out of North Dakota  In a letter to Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson  Senator Conrad says it is vital to ensure that interests on both sides of the border are protected in future flood events  The current situation is simply unacceptable  Senator Conrad writes  In the past few weeks  the road dike has been holding back water on the North Dakota side of the border flooding thousands of acres of farmland  up to ten feet deep in places  while the Canadian side remains high and dry  The flooding problem involves a 26 mile stretch of road dike built along the Canadian side of the international border between the U S  and Canada  Over the past couple of weeks  as both the Red River and Pembina River have overflowed their banks  natural drainage of the floodwaters has been blocked by the road dikes in Canada  As a result  floodwaters have been forced back into North Dakota  flooding farmland in Neche and Pembina  Senator Conrad noted that the Canadian road dike lacks a sufficient number of culverts to allow for the natural flow of water  The few culverts that do exist are far too small in capacity to provide necessary relief  Senator Conrad writes  All of this has combined to severely aggravate flooding on the U S  side of the border
