Sugar Producers Hurt by Colombian Trade Deal Conrad Says Pact  One More of a Thousand Cuts                     February 28  2006  Washington    The Colombian free trade deal approved yesterday by the Administration will erode the nation s sugar producing industry    shrinking farms and cutting jobs    by dumping 50 000 tons of foreign subsidized sugar on the U S  domestic market annually  Senator Kent Conrad said  The Administration has just added Colombia to the growing list of competing nations that are eating away at our own domestic sugar market  Senator Conrad said  Spoonful by spoonful  the Administration is killing domestic sugar production with foreign subsidized sugar  It is a death of a thousand cuts  Other nations that are negotiating to pour their unfairly priced sugar on the United States  following this deal  include Thailand and South Africa  Since the passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement last year  Senator Conrad has warned that the domestic sugar industry is in danger of being strangled by these unilateral trade deals  Each deal allows only a relatively small amount of foreign subsidized sugar into the U S   but the cumulative impact on the U S  sugar industry could be devastating  Senator Conrad has called on the Administration to move sugar negotiations to the World Trade Organization  where it could be regulated globally instead of through unilateral trade deals with individual countries or small groups of countries  The sugar industry is worth  2 billion in the Red River Valley alone  Senator Conrad said  It is unacceptable that the Administration continues to trade away our jobs  our businesses and our farms
