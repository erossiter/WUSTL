Trade Deal Badly Off Course  Conrad Says With CAFTA Vote Nearing  Conrad Warns Against Approving Pact                    June 28  2005  Washington    With a Senate vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  approaching  Senator Kent Conrad urged his colleagues on the Finance Committee today to oppose the deal  saying it would add to the region s trade deficit and erode the Red River Valley s  2 billion sugar industry  When I look at CAFTA  I see a trade policy that is badly off course  We get virtually no benefit from CAFTA  yet it would increase the trade deficit with the region by  110 million a year  Senator Conrad said  CAFTA also sets a precedent that would devastate our domestic sugar industry  That s a critical industry in my home state  Under CAFTA  Central American nations and the Dominican Republic would be able to send 109 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States annually  With talks underway to negotiate bilateral trade deals with Thailand  South Africa and the Andean nations  that provision would eventually allow as much as 500 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States  In addition  Senator Conrad revealed  USDA now projects that Mexico could increase its sugar exports to the United States this year by as much as 650 000 tons  Economists of every stripe agree that flooding our country with an additional 500 000 tons of sugar would wipe out our sugar industry  Between Mexico and the CAFTA precedent  we re facing more than 1 million tons of new imports  Senator Conrad said  I have no earthly idea why they would want to trade away an entire industry that employs 146 000 people in the United States for so little gain  What have we got to gain from CAFTA  We already have 94 percent of the wheat market  We already have 94 percent of the barley market  In fact  Senator Conrad said  economists believe the combined economy of the nations in the CAFTA deal is equivalent to a mid sized U S  city  They keep saying this is going to be a boon for the United States  But our own International Trade Commission says the agreement would add zero percent to our Gross Domestic Product  Senator Conrad made his remarks during Senate Finance Committee consideration of CAFTA  The Finance Committee is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to send the trade deal to the floor with a positive recommendation for a vote by the full Senate  The full Senate could vote on CAFTA later this week
