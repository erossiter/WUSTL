Bipartisan Conrad Bill Strengthens Social Security  Lockbox Legislation Would Stop Raid on Social Security                    September 20  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad is joining forces with a Republican Senator from Ohio  George Voinovich  to introduce a newly designed bipartisan lockbox bill to stop the raid on Social Security  The legislation would ensure that Social Security surpluses are protected and ultimately used only for providing benefits to Social Security beneficiaries  Enough is enough  Senator Conrad said  The raid on Social Security has got to stop  With this bipartisan legislation  Senator Voinovich and I intend to finally put Social Security in a lockbox that works  This bill says  Keep your mitts off Social Security    The Voinovich Conrad bill takes a new tack on the lockbox concept by fundamentally changing the way in which Social Security and other trust fund surpluses are invested  Importantly  trust fund surpluses would no longer be used to fund the general operations of government and the true size of the federal deficit would be revealed  In the current fiscal year   173 billion from the Social Security surplus is being used to partly cover the general fund shortfall  This legislation would not only take Washington s hand out of the Social Security cookie jar  it would literally take the cookie jar away  Senator Conrad said  If our bill is adopted  Social Security surpluses would no longer be used to fund other functions of government or mask the size of the federal deficit  Instead  Social Security payroll taxes would be used only to provide future Social Security benefits  as they were always intended  Senator Conrad has fought to preserve and strengthen Social Security throughout his career in the U S  Senate  As the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee and the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee s Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy  Senator Conrad has played a key role in the national debate on the future of Social Security  Social Security is particularly important in North Dakota  which has one of the highest rates of beneficiaries on a per capita basis  and where almost a quarter of beneficiaries are 80 years of age or older  Nearly one out of every five residents in North Dakota receives a Social Security check
