Other Nations Must Share Costs of War  Conrad says Senator Questions Secretary of State on Financial Burden of War in Iraq                    February 16  2006  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today about increasing reconstruction costs in Iraq and the ability of Iraqi security forces to take over U S  military operations  The inspector general says Iraq s infrastructure is getting worse  not getting better  Senator Conrad said  We ve already spent  16 billion on reconstruction  How much more do American taxpayers need to pony up  According to the inspector general for Iraq reconstruction  the performance of Iraq s public services has fallen below pre invasion levels  Electrical generation and oil production continue to be limited and the number of Iraqis with drinkable water and sewage service is lower now than before the start of the war  Senator Conrad noted that a large share of the donations and debt relief promised to Iraq by other nations has not yet materialized  The Government Accountability Office estimates that U S taxpayers alone have already dedicated  30 billion to reconstructing Iraq and building the Iraqi army  He called on Secretary Rice to do more to ensure that America does not bear the burden of the war s costs alone  We ve got to find a way to share this burden  because I can tell you  the patience of the American people is wearing thin  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad  the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  also asked Secretary Rice about recent reports that the Iraqi government does not have enough money to maintain its U S  trained security forces  It is the intent of Pentagon leaders for Iraqi security forces to take over the U S  military s responsibilities for protecting the country  I think we have a significant problem on our hands here  Senator Conrad said  If the Iraqi government does not have the funds available to provide an army to protect its people  it makes me extremely concerned that the administration will not be able to follow through on its plans to reduce U S  troop levels in Iraq over the coming year  In 2003  the World Bank estimated that  56 billion would be needed for rebuilding Iraq through 2007  But the Government Accountability Office now says that figure understates the likely costs
