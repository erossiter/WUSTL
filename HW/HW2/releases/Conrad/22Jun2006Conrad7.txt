Statement from Senator Kent Conrad on the Release of the Abramoff Report                    June 22  2006  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad made the following statement today regarding  the release of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee s final report on the Indian  lobbying scandal centered on former GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate  Michael Scanlon  Senator Conrad is a senior member of the Indian Affairs  Committee  This was the right thing to do  We had an obligation to the tribes   particularly the six who were so devastated by the actions of Mr  Abramoff and  Mr  Scanlon  to get to the bottom of this  Like all of you  I was appalled by the allegations raised by the Washington  Post in February of 2004  Not only did the Washington Post report that Mr   Abramoff and Mr  Scanlon milked the Tribes for tens of millions  it was also  reported they sold their access and influence with the leadership of the House  of Representatives as a way to con the Tribes out of their money  Unfortunately  we now know that those allegations were true and much worse  The information uncovered in the course of this investigation quite honestly  is appalling  It is a tale of extraordinary greed  deception  and exploitation  Abramoff and Scanlon wove an extraordinary web of deceit and at the bottom  showed a greed that was truly stunning  They used scare tactics to convince  tribes their gaming operations were threatened to induce them into paying huge  sums of money for protection  Abramoff and Scanlon also inserted themselves in tribal government elections  to get candidates elected who would support their proposals  I was particularly troubled by the scam they perpetrated on the Tigua Tribe  of Texas  Abramoff and Scanlon worked with Ralph Reed to support the efforts of  the state of Texas to close Tigua s casino  But before the casino doors closed   Abramoff and Scanlon connived and schemed to get the Tiguas to hire them for  over  4 million to re open the casino  Of course  as we know  those efforts were  unsuccessful  Their actions and the harm it caused to these six tribes is shameful and it  is by far the worst case of greed that I have seen in my 20 years in the United  States Senate  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee  I am particularly troubled by  the use of 501  c  3  and  c  4  entities in this scheme  I agree with the  Committee s recommendations that the Finance Committee should examine the use of  these nonprofit organizations to obscure the source of funds  the actual use of  the funds  and the evasion of taxes
