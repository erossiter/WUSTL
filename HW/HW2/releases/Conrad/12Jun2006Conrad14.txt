North Dakota Can be Nation s Powerhouse  Conrad says Senator Helps Kick Off Summit Promoting ND s Renewable Energies                   June 12  2006     Bismarck    With fuel prices again hovering at near record levels  Senator  Kent Conrad today addressed a conference of energy experts and policymakers at  Bismarck State College and stressed the urgency of moving the nation toward  greater use of domestic sources of renewable energy  It is time to end our nation s addiction to foreign sources of energy  Our  dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security and our economy  It is  time to look to the Midwest rather than the Middle East for our energy  resources  Senator Conrad said  And North Dakota can be a leader in this  effort  Senator Conrad joined Senator Byron Dorgan  Congressman Earl Pomeroy   Governor John Hoeven and leaders from the energy industry at the 2006 Renewable  Fuels Action Summit  The two day conference is examining ways the 2005 energy  bill is promoting new investments in North Dakota s growing renewable energy  industry  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad crafted  several tax incentives in the federal energy bill to increase the development of  North Dakota s energy industry  These measures were signed into law last year as  part of a national energy bill and will mean hundreds of millions of dollars and  many good paying jobs for North Dakota  More recently  Senator Conrad introduced the Breaking Our Long term  Dependence  or BOLD  Energy Act in an effort to move the nation toward greater  energy independence  Through a mix of tax credits  grants and renewable fuel  standards  the BOLD bill would promote alternative fuels  reward conservation   fund research into new energy technology  and increase production of renewable  resources  such as wind  biodiesel  and ethanol  Specifically  the BOLD Energy Act calls for ethanol use in the U S  to  increase from 4 7 billion gallons in 2007 to 30 billion gallons in 2025  It also  sets a benchmark of producing 100 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2010  and calls for the production of 2 billion gallons of alternative diesel by 2015   Alternative diesel includes biodiesel and coal derived diesel  The bill also extends existing income and excise tax credits for renewable  fuels through 2013  This includes an extension of the credit for small  agri biodiesel and ethanol producers  and an increase in the credit for ethanol  derived from sugar and cellulose  We can use our state s vast resources to reduce our dependence on foreign  oil  keep energy prices affordable  and grow our state s economy with new   high paying jobs  Senator Conrad said  North Dakota has a terrific opportunity  to create new jobs and boost our economy by serving as the nation s powerhouse       Bismarck    With fuel prices again hovering at near record levels  Senator  Kent Conrad today addressed a conference of energy experts and policymakers at
