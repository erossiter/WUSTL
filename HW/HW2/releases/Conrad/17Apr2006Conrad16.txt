Senators Pressure Pentagon to Retain Bomber Force Conrad and Dorgan Lead Fight to Stop Retirement of B 52s                    April 17  2006  Washington    Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan today pressed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to reconsider plans to cut the number of B 52s in America s bomber force  The Defense Department s proposed plan could greatly impact the nation s only two B 52 bomber bases  Minot Air Force Base and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana  We are gravely concerned that the Department of Defense has not fully thought through its decision to retire nearly 40 percent of our nation s B 52 bomber force  We urge you to reconsider these misguided plans for one of our nation s greatest military assets  Conrad and Dorgan wrote to Rumsfeld  If anything  our nation needs more bombers  not fewer  In the bipartisan letter  Conrad and Dorgan  joined by Louisiana Senators Mary Landrieu  D LA  and David Vitter  R LA   detailed the strategic importance of maintaining the nation s fleet of 94 B 52s  Retiring a significant portion of the current fleet when a new bomber is not even on the drawing board assumes too great a risk that we will find ourselves with a bomber shortage in the next 15 to 20 years if we have to confront a major competitor or even another Iraq type situation  the Senators wrote  Conrad and Dorgan also asked Rumsfeld a series of detailed questions about the reorganization of the B 52 fleet and requested an account of the bombers that will be retained in the Air Force inventory over the next 30 years  The Senators have warned that the reorganization could damage America s long range strike capabilities and said they would pursue legislation calling for a detailed bomber gap study addressing the time between the planned drawdown of the B 52 fleet in 2008 and the delivery of new bombers in 2018  Simply put  it makes little sense to retire the best bomb truck for the buck in the inventory  That is why the Congress has adopted legislation  signed by the President  providing   that the Secretary of Defense shall include in the Air Force budget request for fiscal year 2007 amounts sufficient to maintain a B  52 force totaling 94 aircraft   the Senators wrote  Earlier this year  the Defense Department proposed cutting the number of B 52s in the nation s fleet from 94 to 56 aircraft by fiscal year 2008 as a cost saving measure  As a result  Senators Conrad and Dorgan teamed up with the Louisiana Senators to draft legislation to increase the five year defense budget by  1 1 billion in order to stop the retirement of B 52s at Minot and Barksdale Air Force Bases  The Senate unanimously passed this amendment on March 16  2006  The North Dakota and Louisiana delegations are continuing to push for funding in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill to maintain the nation s fleet of B 52 bombers  The Senate is expected to consider that bill later this spring  Senators Conrad and Dorgan plan to meet with General Michael Moseley  Air Force Chief of Staff  in the coming weeks to discuss B 52 force structure
