Conrad Introduces BOLD Energy Bill Senator s Bill Aims to Break America s Dependence on Foreign Oil                    April 6  2006  Washington    Citing national security for the need to break America s dependence on foreign oil  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced sweeping energy legislation designed to massively increase domestic energy production and bring relief to American consumers  Our dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security and our economy  Senator Conrad said  It is time to do more than talk about this threat  It is time for a bold plan to end our nation s addiction to foreign sources of energy  Senator Conrad s bill is called the Breaking Our Long term Dependence  or BOLD  Energy Act  Through a mix of tax credits  grants and new renewable fuel standards set by the legislation  Senator Conrad s bill would increase production of renewable energy and alternative fuels  reward conservation  fund research into new energy technology  and upgrade our nation s electricity grid  The BOLD Energy Act would invest  40 billion in new energy initiatives over the next five years  In introducing his bill today  Senator Conrad said America has abundant domestic energy supplies that have yet to be tapped  With its vast reserves of coal and renewable resources such as wind  biodiesel and ethanol  North Dakota could serve as the nation s powerhouse  Senator Conrad said  It s time to look to the Midwest rather than the Mid East for our energy  We can turn to our farm fields to produce more ethanol and biodiesel  Senator Conrad told his Senate colleagues  Senator Conrad has long supported a national energy policy that seeks to secure sources of affordable energy  Last year  he convened an Energy Security Summit at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks  The Summit brought together top energy strategists from across the nation to explore ways our nation can reduce its dependence on foreign oil  From his position on the Senate Finance Committee  Senator Conrad has a record of authoring legislation to support exploration of alternative and traditional sources of domestic energy  many in North Dakota  Senator Conrad s 2005 legislation to develop North Dakota s energy industry was signed into law as part of a national energy bill  and ultimately will mean hundreds of millions of dollars and many good paying jobs for North Dakota  Due to his leadership on energy issues  Senator Conrad was recently invited by President Bush to participate in a White House meeting on the nation s energy policy  A BOLD Energy Act fact sheet is attached              Senator Conrad s BOLD Energy Act Fact Sheet Senator Kent Conrad introduced broad  comprehensive energy legislation today designed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and promote domestic energy sources  particularly biodiesel  ethanol and wind  The name of the bill is Breaking Our Long term Dependence  or BOLD  Energy Act   The BOLD Energy Act would require ethanol use in the United States to increase from 4 7 billion gallons in 2007 to 30 billion gallons by 2025  This requirement would provide a bigger market for ethanol and bring more economic development to farm states like North Dakota  North Dakota s ethanol production capacity has enormous potential  the state is producing 35 million gallons annually  compared to 350 million gallons produced annually in Minnesota  South Dakota and Nebraska  Construction of just one average sized ethanol plant is capable of supporting as many as 835 jobs in local economies   The BOLD Energy Act would establish a new biodiesel and alternative diesel standard of 250 million gallons in 2008  increasing to two billion gallons in 2015  creating greater demand for biodiesel as a transportation fuel    and greater demand for biodiesel manufacturing plants  Biodiesel plants proposed for North Dakota could produce as much as 82 million gallons annually  creating new markets for farmers and new jobs at the plants   The BOLD Act establishes a  500 million grant program to fund the development of coal to liquid fuel technology  This level of funding would fund the construction of 10 coal to liquid fuel plants capable of reducing our dependence on foreign oil by 219 million barrels a year by using domestic coal to make vehicle fuel  North Dakota s lignite coal industry is among the state s highest paying industries  annually  lignite creates  1 7 billion in economic activity in North Dakota and  75 million in tax revenue  The U S  Air Force and other companies have expressed interest in using North Dakota lignite to create fuel for jets and other vehicles  This grant program will help bring significant economic development to North Dakota   The BOLD Energy Act would extend tax credits for wind energy production for five years  It would also give state agencies greater freedom to finance upgrades to the nation s electricity grid    enabling North Dakota energy producers to move more power to market  North Dakota has annual wind energy potential of 138 400 megawatts  number one in the country  but existing wind energy facilities produce only 97 79 megawatts  The extension of this tax credit will extend North Dakota s current wind energy development boom   Recognizing the need for conservation  the BOLD Act encourages the manufacture and purchase of fuel efficient and flexible fuel vehicles  Purchasers of fuel efficient vehicles would quality for rebates of up to  2 500  Automakers would be encouraged to install advanced technologies  including flexible fuel technology  by 2017  They would be eligible for either a 35 percent tax credit or retiree health care grants to make this transition   The BOLD Act would also help increase domestic oil production by increasing tax credits for oil companies that use carbon dioxide to extract more oil from aging oil fields  This credit could be especially useful for new oil exploration in North Dakota  which ranks 8th in oil reserves out of all U S  states  The bill also authorizes responsible development of natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico to help increase domestic supply and keep prices lower for consumers   The BOLD Act has been endorsed by the North Dakota Farmer s Union  North Dakota Biodiesel Taskforce  the Midwest Electric Consumers Association and Basin Electric  The bill has also won praise from North Dakota s Lignite Energy Council  Missouri River Energy Services  and DMI Industries of Fargo  a manufacturer of wind turbines
