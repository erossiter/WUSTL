Conrad Leads Fight for Drought Assistance Senator Urges US Ag Secretary to Survey Devastation in North Dakota                   July 7  2006  Washington    As the weeks without rain continue in central and western North  Dakota  Senator Kent Conrad today urged Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to  take immediate action to address the needs of farmers and ranchers suffering the  effects of the devastating drought  In a letter to Johanns  Senator Conrad called for the immediate approval of  emergency haying and grazing requests for North Dakota  including extending  Conservation Reserve Program provisions  opening up restored wetlands  and  allowing farmers to hay and graze their fields now  instead of waiting until the  normal July 15 starting date  I had the opportunity to tour the southern part of North Dakota to view the  damage being caused by the severe drought that is rapidly spreading through my  state  Conditions are substantially worse than I had expected  Senator Conrad  writes in the letter to Johanns  Earlier this week  Senator Conrad led North Dakota officials on an inspection  of drought damage in central and western North Dakota counties  Senator Conrad   along with Senator Byron Dorgan  Congressman Earl Pomeroy  Agriculture  Commissioner Roger Johnson and Governor John Hoeven toured farms around Burleigh  and Emmons counties and spoke with producers about the effects of the drought  In his letter to Johanns  Senator Conrad says he intends to expand  agriculture disaster legislation he authored to help family farmers and ranchers  recover from natural disasters in 2005 to include losses from the 2006 crop year  as well  In addition  Senator Conrad invited Johanns to travel to North Dakota to  witness firsthand the disaster that is being caused by the drought and discuss  the situation with area farmers and ranchers  I hope you will take the opportunity to view the drought  impacted areas of  North Dakota  Senator Conrad writes to Johanns  For many counties it is  already too late for rain to reduce the impact of the drought  and the long term  weather forecasts suggest it will only get worse and spread to additional  areas  The letter to Johanns follow  Dear Mr  Secretary  Over the Senate s Independence Day recess  I had the opportunity to tour the  southern part of North Dakota to view the damage being caused by the severe  drought that is rapidly spreading through my state  At this point in time  I can report that conditions are substantially worse  than I had expected  Crop and forage production are likely to be reduced well  below the level achieved in 2004  when another drought caused significant  economic losses to producers in North Dakota  Livestock water shortages are  becoming a very real challenge for those ranchers who are trying to avoid a  forced sale of their livestock  For many counties it is already too late for  rain to reduce the impact of the drought and the long term weather forecasts  suggest it will only get worse and spread to additional areas  I was recently joined by the other members of the North Dakota delegation in  a letter to you urging that you expedite approval of emergency haying and  grazing requests for North Dakota  We also requested that you take other actions  within your authority to address the emerging needs of farmers and ranchers who  are suffering from the effects of drought  I hope you will implement our  recommendations as soon as possible  In addition  I invite you to travel to North Dakota to witness firsthand the  devastation that is being caused by this drought and take the opportunity to  discuss this situation and the potential for disaster assistance with our  farmers  ranchers and rural business people  As you are aware  I authored disaster assistance legislation to help  compensate farmers and ranchers across the country for the weather related  losses they sustained in 2005  I now plan to include assistance for the 2006  weather losses in that legislation  While I strongly disagree with your  assessment that there was not a need for disaster assistance for last year  I  hope you will take the opportunity to view the drought  impacted areas of North  Dakota  At that time I would like to discuss a multi year disaster package with  you that will reduce the economic hardship that back to back disasters are  having on the farmers and ranchers in North Dakota  Please know that I will be more than happy to help make arrangements for you  to travel to North Dakota to survey the current situation  Thank you for your attention to this issue
