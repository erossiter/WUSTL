USDA Approves Delegation Request to Open CRP Land Ruling Gives North Dakota Ranchers Access to Much needed Forage on CRP land                    July 11  2006  Washington  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl  Pomeroy announced Tuesday that the U S  Department of Agriculture has agreed to  open Conservation Reserve Program land in nine North Dakota counties to ranchers  who have struggled to find feed for their cattle during this summer s extreme  drought  The delegation said the announcement will bring much needed help to North  Dakota ranchers in McIntosh  Sioux  Morton  Burleigh  Kidder  McHenry and Pierce  counties  Emmons and Grant counties were approved last week and applications are  pending in three other North Dakota counties  Ranchers may begin grazing on CRP  land in those counties immediately  and may begin haying the land after July 15  Dorgan  Conrad and Pomeroy wrote to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns last week  asking him to allow ranchers to access the forage on the land  which is normally  set aside for wildlife habitat  Last week  they also toured drought stricken  areas in southern North Dakota and met with producers and local officials to  discuss ways to bring relief to the region  The delegation said they would continue to push to bring relief to ranchers  in North Dakota  including pushing for the opening of CRP lands in counties  adjoining drought stricken areas and pushing the President to support an  agriculture disaster package that would bring help to family farmers and  ranchers who have suffered from weather related disasters in 2005 and 2006  This is a good start that will bring some much needed relief to ranchers in  North Dakota  but the Administration needs to open more CRP land to emergency  haying and grazing now  the delegation said in a joint statement  The drought  has forced producers in our state to make some very tough choices  and without  some help many of them will not be able to continue ranching  We re glad  Secretary Johanns agreed to our request  and we ll continue to push the  President to support a disaster package that will give a fair shake to farmers  and ranchers in North Dakota and across the country
