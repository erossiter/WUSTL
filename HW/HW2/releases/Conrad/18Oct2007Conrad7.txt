Conrad Works to Increase Reservations  Water Supply Limited Access to Clean Drinking Water is Unacceptable  Senator Says                   October 18  2007  Washington  Senator Kent Conrad today introduced legislation that would fast track critical improvements to water infrastructure projects on our nations Indian reservations  It is unacceptable that in this day and age  there are places in this country where people do not have access to clean drinking water  Senator Conrad said  This legislation will open up a financing option for tribal governments to speed the construction of water supply systems and ensure access to clean water  The legislation authored by Senator Conrad and cosponsored by Senator Tim Johnson  D SD  and Senator Jon Tester  D MT  would allow tribes to utilize flexible financing in the construction of water supply projects  Tribes could utilize tax exempt bonds or enter into other loans to construct these projects now and use federal appropriations to pay the financing costs over time  Senator Conrads legislation is patterned after a similar financing model in the Indian Reservation Roads  IRR  program The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has utilized this IRR financing model to undertake a major road construction project and complete it in a few short years  Without the ability to use flexible financing  the tribes project would have taken an additional 20 years to complete and added an additional  27 million in costs  The legislation introduced by Senator Conrad today  the Tribal Water Resources Innovative Financing Act  will allow for the construction of these water infrastructure projects now utilizing todays dollars  providing an immediate benefit for users while saving costs to the federal government over the long term
