Conrad McCain Bill Strengthens Fiscal Responsibility  Right to Review  Would Block Abuse of Conference Report Process                    July 25  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad and Senator John McCain today introduced a bipartisan resolution to restore fiscal responsibility in the U S  Senate  The Conrad McCain Right to Review Resolution would prevent controversial provisions from being secretly inserted in legislation at the last minute by requiring a two day period before the Senate votes on final bill passage  Senator McCain and I hope to restore some common sense to the legislative process in the Senate  Senator Conrad said  The process is being abused  Senators are asked to vote on bills that they haven t had time to read    and we know that these bills are being stuffed at the last minute with expensive and unrelated provisions  Our bipartisan resolution will help put a stop to this practice  Senators Conrad and McCain decided to work together on this issue after Senator Conrad discovered an unrelated provision    which threatened the privacy of every U S  taxpayer    inserted in an omnibus appropriations conference report last November  The bill had been rushed to the Senate floor shortly after a handful of members and their staff finished writing it behind closed doors  The Senate was given just a few hours to review the 3 646 page bill before a scheduled vote on final passage  Fortunately  I was able to alert my colleagues that they were about to vote to strip every taxpayer of their basic right to privacy  The Senate agreed unanimously to strike the provision  Senator Conrad said  But this example shows how flawed our process has become  Increasingly  legislation is being written by a handful of members in secret  without a thorough debate in the Senate  Senator McCain and I believe this practice has to stop  Many problems lie in the writing of conference reports  Conference reports are final versions of legislation drafted by conference committees made of Senators and House members who negotiate the differences between similar House  and Senate passed bills  The Conrad McCain Right to Review Resolution would   Require that conference reports be available to all Senators at least 48 hours prior to a vote   Require a written cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office be provided so Senators know the cost of the legislation   Finally  conference reports would have to cover primarily the same subject matter as the original Senate passed bill  If any of these points are violated  a point of order could be raised to block the conference report
