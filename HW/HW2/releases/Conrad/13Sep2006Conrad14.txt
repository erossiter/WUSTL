Conrad Responds to USDA Disaster Declaration Senator Continues to Fight for ND s Farmers and Ranchers                    September 13  2006  Washington    Responding to a request from Senators Kent Conrad and Byron  Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy  the USDA today designated the entire state  of North Dakota an agricultural disaster area  The Department of Agriculture has finally acknowledged that our farmers and  ranchers have been devastated and they need help and they need it now  the  delegation said in a joint statement  But this is just a first step  We need a  comprehensive agriculture disaster bill to help farmers and ranchers recover  from their devastating losses in 2005 and 2006  Last week  the delegation urged the Secretary of Agriculture to clear the way  for emergency loan programs for North Dakota producers by designating the state  a primary agricultural disaster area  In a letter to Agriculture Secretary  Michael Johanns  the delegation called on the USDA to designate all 53 North  Dakota counties as primary agricultural disaster counties  Doing so opens the  door for farmers and ranchers in disaster counties to apply for emergency loan  programs through USDA  While we are glad that the USDA finally recognizes the seriousness of the  situation in North Dakota  the designation alone will not come close to giving  the help our farm families need  We need to get family farmers and ranchers help  by passing an agriculture disaster package so they can start to rebuild for next  year  the delegation said  Today  Senators Conrad and Dorgan introduced the Emergency Farm Relief Act of  2006  which is being considered as an amendment to a port security bill  The  amendment combines legislation Senators Conrad and Dorgan previously introduced  to support ranchers and farmers impacted by weather related disasters in the  2005 growing season with emergency legislation to aid producers suffering from  the 2006 drought devastating the Great Plains  In June  Senator Dorgan attached  a similar farm relief package to the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations  bill  During a Farm Bill hearing of the House Agriculture committee  Pomeroy  pushed Majority members to join the fight for disaster assistance  Unless the Administration takes action immediately we will begin to see farm  family after farm family put their homes and livelihoods on the auction block   We can t let that happen  the delegation said  We will not turn our backs on  our farmers and ranchers
