Conrad Reaffirms His Support for SCHIP President Threatens to Veto Vital Children s Health Program Again                   November 1  2007 Washington  Senator Kent Conrad and a bipartisan majority of his Senate colleagues tonight again passed legislation to renew the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   The President has threatened to veto the legislation that would double the federal support to North Dakota  where more than 14 000 children are without health insurance   Too many children in North Dakota and across the country are deprived of the health care they need  By vetoing this legislation  the President is turning his back on these children  Senator Conrad said  With tonights bipartisan vote  the Senate has demonstrated yet again that the health of our children is both a legislative and moral priority   The Senate voted 64 30 to renew the popular program which currently covers more than 6 6 million children nationwide  With the latest adjustments  SCHIP will now allow for an additional 3 2 million children to be enrolled   In addition to protecting our childrens health  enrolling children in a health insurance program also makes fiscal sense  Senator Conrad said  Many children without coverage use the emergency room for health care  which is the most expensive avenue to address their needs  Additionally  minor illnesses  if left unchecked  can end up costing more in the long run
