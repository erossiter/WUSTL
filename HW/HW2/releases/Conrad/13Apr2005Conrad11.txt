Senator  CAFTA Would  Devastate  Sugar  Conrad Skeptical of Claims That CAFTA Will Benefit North Dakota                    April 13  2005  Washington  Citing the danger it poses to U S  sugar producers  Senator Kent Conrad told Administration trade officials today during a key committee hearing that he will fight ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement  Senator Conrad questioned Peter F  Allgeier  Acting U S  Trade Representative  on the devastation that passage of CAFTA would mean for U S  sugar producers at a Senate Finance Committee meeting today  The Finance Committee  on which Senator Conrad serves  oversees general U S  trade policy and trade pacts like CAFTA  I am increasingly skeptical of claims that the latest trade agreement is another great success for U S  trade policy  All the evidence I ve seen shows that these deals are failures for the United States  Senator Conrad said  The trade deficit last year was  618 billion and growing  thanks in part to the North American Free Trade Agreement  If that s success  I d hate to see failure  At issue is more than 107 000 tons of foreign subsidized sugar that CAFTA would allow into the United States annually from five Central American nations and the Dominican Republic  That alone is not enough to dismantle the U S  sugar industry  but it creates a precedent for other sugar producing countries  And as the U S  negotiates with the Andean nations  Thailand and South Africa  Senator Conrad said he fears the amount of sugar allowed in the United States would eventually swamp domestic producers  It d be death by a thousand cuts  At my field hearings in North Dakota  economists of every stripe have told me that it would take only 500 000 additional tons of foreign subsidized sugar to devastate the American sugar industry  Senator Conrad said  The U S  sugar industry in this country has 146 000 employees  So as I see it you just negotiated away another industry here  The Red River Valley is a major producer of sugar beets and is home to a  2 billion sugar producing industry  including farmers  processors and laborers  Senator Conrad has organized rallies opposed to CAFTA  and collected signatures from farmers and business owners opposed to the deal  Senator Conrad has argued that sugar should be dealt with within the World Trade Organization  and not negotiated in bilateral trade agreements like CAFTA
