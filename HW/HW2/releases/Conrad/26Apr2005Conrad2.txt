Key Senate Panel Holds Social Security Hearings Conrad  Social Security Shortfall One of Several Fiscal Woes Facing Nation                    April 26  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad warned his colleagues that Congress is making a mistake by only focusing on the long term funding shortfall in Social Security while ignoring more serious problems in Medicare and record budget deficits  Senator Conrad made his remarks today during a key meeting of the Senate Finance Committee  This was the Finance Committee s first hearing on a plan to rewrite Social Security with new private accounts funded by steep borrowing and deep cuts in traditional benefits  We ve got a very serious budget problem here  Social Security is part of the problem  but we re making a mistake by not addressing Medicare  which has a shortfall seven times that of Social Security  Senator Conrad said  If we re going to convince people about the need for action  we must include the entire collection of fiscal imbalances that pose a threat to our economic security    including Medicare  and record budget and trade deficits  Senator Conrad is ranking member of the Finance Subcommittee on Social Security and is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  Today s hearing  called by Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  included witnesses who spoke both in favor of and against personal accounts  I ve always said there s a kernel of a good idea in personal accounts  but not financed by steep benefit cuts or massive debt  And personal accounts do nothing to address Social Security s solvency  as the President has now acknowledged  Senator Conrad said  According to the Social Security Administration  two thirds of today s retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of their income  And more than 30 percent rely on Social Security for at least 90 percent of their income  Social Security is particularly important in North Dakota  as nearly one out of every five residents receive some sort of benefit from the program
