Rural Health Care Gets Boost in Conrad Bill Bipartisan Legislation Seeks Broad Fix to Medicare Policy                   June 13  2006     Washington    A bipartisan bill introduced by Senator Kent Conrad today would  significantly overhaul Medicare s rural health policy    creating a fund for  small town hospitals to repair crumbling buildings  providing for home health  care and boosting payments to rural ambulance squads  The vast majority of health care providers in rural states like North Dakota  depend on Medicare  because so many of their patients are seniors  Senator  Conrad said  If we continue to let Medicare shortchange our rural health  providers  then we re really shortchanging rural Americans  This bill would fix  the imbalance and make sure rural Americans have access to quality health care  Senator Conrad s bill is called R HoPE  for Rural Hospital and Provider  Equity Act of 2006  Wyoming Republican Senator Craig Thomas  who with Senator  Conrad co chairs the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus  joined as main co sponsor  Rural folks get pinned with bigger health care bills due to the tremendous  inequity in what rural and urban providers get paid under Medicare  I was proud  to help lead the effort to put rural providers on a level playing field with  their urban neighbors  said Senator Thomas  Many rural health care providers  including hospitals  clinics and ambulance  squads  operate with overall negative Medicare margins  meaning Medicare  reimbursements don t cover the actual costs these providers incur  In its March  2006 report  the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission projected that rural  hospitals would experience a Medicare shortfall as high as 4 5 percent of costs  We can t continue to ask our providers to keep their doors open when they  lose money on every Medicare patient  Senator Conrad said  The R HoPE bill  would take dramatic steps toward closing that gap  R HoPE would extend several Medicare provisions Senator Conrad secured in the  2003 Medicare Modernization Act    such as a provision that boosts labor  payments to North Dakota hospitals    and includes new measures    such as  creating a new loan program to help rural hospitals repair aging facilities  Senator Conrad s bill has already won support from health care organizations  including the National Rural Health Association  the American Hospital  Association and the American Ambulance Association  Senator Conrad has been a champion for health care in North Dakota  said  Chip Thomas of the North Dakota Hospital Association  Senator Conrad knows what  needs to be done to fix federal health care policy to keep our hospitals  working  and make health care in North Dakota better       Washington    A bipartisan bill introduced by Senator Kent
