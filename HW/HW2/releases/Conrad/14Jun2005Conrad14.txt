CAFTA Would Trade Away U S  Industry Senator Conrad Warns Trade Pact Would Devastate American Sugar Producers                    June 14  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad used a key Senate committee meeting today to send a strong message to his colleagues that the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  would trade away the U S  sugar industry and would add to the nation s ballooning trade deficit  We need to carefully review the trade strategy of our nation  because if anything is clear  it is that this strategy is not working  Senator Conrad said  Our trade deficit has now skyrocketed to  600 billion a year  Foreign holdings of our debt have gone up 100 percent in four years  We owe large sums of money to other nations  That s utterly unsustainable  Senator Conrad was one of nine members of the Senate Finance Committee who cast a ballot against CAFTA  However  the Finance Committee  which oversees trade policy  voted 11 to 9 to ultimately approve the draft legislation the Administration submitted  Under CAFTA  the United States would have to allow as much as 109 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the country  This provision sets a precedent for other trade agreements  notably in talks with Thailand  South Africa  and the Andean nations  that would eventually allow as much as 500 000 metric tons of foreign subsidized sugar into the United States  Economists of every stripe agree that allowing that much sugar into the U S  would gut our domestic sugar industry  That s a  2 billion business in North Dakota that s being traded away by the Administration here  Senator Conrad said  Maybe other people don t care if we trade away entire industries  and the jobs  homes and businesses that rely on them  But I care  Senator Conrad has been a vocal opponent of CAFTA  He has rallied workers  growers and business leaders in the Red River Valley and held field hearings in North Dakota to gather testimony on CAFTA and its impact on the state
