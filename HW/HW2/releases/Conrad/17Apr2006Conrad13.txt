Conrad Bill Provides  175 Million for ND Farmers  Senator Fights for Disaster Assistance for America s Farmers and Ranchers                    April 17  2006  Thompson    Appearing today with area growers at a local farm  Senator Kent Conrad detailed bipartisan legislation he authored to provide emergency assistance to farmers and ranchers in North Dakota  and across the nation  recovering from natural disasters  Bad weather and skyrocketing fuel prices have battered America s farmers  said Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  My legislation will not make our farmers and ranchers whole for their losses  but it will give them a fighting chance to stay in business  North Dakota s farmers and ranchers were hit hard by natural disasters in 2005  Last year  every county in North Dakota received a disaster designation  Some parts of the state saw rainfall of more than 250 percent of normal  As a result  more than one million acres of North Dakota farmland was prevented from being planted  In addition  many farmers experienced reduced crop quality that resulted in large price discounts  And while weather disasters were cutting into farm income  energy related farm expenses rose by more than  5 billion last year  Senator Conrad introduced the Emergency Agriculture Disaster Assistance Act of 2006 last month  The legislation  which has 27 bipartisan cosponsors  provides emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies  It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock and help farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last year s hurricanes  Senator Conrad said his legislation  which incorporates many of the provisions in disaster legislation he introduced last fall  would provide about  175 million to North Dakota farmers and ranchers  The bill also includes  6 million for flooded lands in the Devils Lake region  Twenty two national farm organizations  including the National Farmers Union and the American Farm Bureau Federation  have written Congress to endorse disaster legislation  Senator Conrad s ag disaster legislation was adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee on a unanimous vote and now goes to the full Senate for approval  Earlier this month  House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Colin Peterson  Congressman Earl Pomeroy and 24 other House members introduced a companion bill  While I believe this legislation will pass the Senate  I m worried the leadership in the House of Representatives and the White House will once again derail assistance to farmers  Senator Conrad said  Our family farmers are in great jeopardy  The Administration must not turn its back on them again
