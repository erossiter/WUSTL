Conrad Bennett Bill Protects U S  Flag  Senator Introduces Bipartisan Legislation To Protect American Flag                    July 1  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad and Senator Bob Bennett  Republican of Utah  introduced bipartisan legislation today  on the eve of the Independence Day holiday  which would protect the American flag  The American flag is a powerful symbol in this country  I have the utmost respect for the flag as a symbol of our nation  our freedom  and the sacrifice by which that freedom was won  Senator Conrad said  Burning or dishonoring a flag is repugnant to me  That is why I am joining with Senator Bennett in introducing the Flag Protection Act of 2005  which would criminalize the desecration of our flag  Senator Bennett  in a speech from the floor of the United States Senate  said  I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and Senator Conrad that has to do with the desecration of the flag  All of us are angered when we see someone burn or otherwise desecrate the American flag  and I think it appropriate that we take such steps as are appropriate to deal with such desecration  The bill amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit intentionally destroying or damaging the U S  flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce violence  The Bennett Conrad legislation has been studied by the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service  which concluded it would pass Constitutional muster  Several other efforts to write legislation protecting the flag have been ruled unconstitutional  but Senator Conrad said he and Senator Bennett took care in writing their bill  I stand with Senator Bennett of Utah to call on my colleagues to give the Flag Protection Act of 2005 serious consideration  It is my hope that we can act quickly to pass this legislation and protect the flag  Senator Conrad said
