Delegation Urges Social Security Administration Head to Maintain Dickinson Office                    September 28  2007  Washington  In response to growing concerns among residents in southwest North Dakota  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy today sought documented assurance from the head of the Social Security Administration  SSA  to keep the Dickinson  North Dakota field office open and operating     There continues to be a great deal of concern from the residents in southwest North Dakota about the possibility that the Social Security Office in Dickinson will close  the delegation said in a joint statement   While we have received a verbal commitment from SSA that an office will remain open  we believe written confirmation is appropriate to ease the concerns of our seniors and persons with disabilities     In a letter to SSA Commissioner Michael Astrue  the delegation requested confirmation of the Administrations plans to maintain a contact station in Dickinson  calling it critically important to meeting the needs of seniors and persons with disabilities there  Specifically  the delegation has requested that both in person service be maintained and the teleconference capabilities implemented to meet the growing and diverse needs of North Dakotans    The delegation is also seeking a written update regarding SSAs current and future staffing plans for other field offices in North Dakota     The number of Social Security beneficiaries in North Dakota continues to grow at a rapid rate  the delegation said  It is vital that the local offices maintain full staffing levels and continue to provide the quality service North Dakotans have come to expect from their local SSA representatives  If this office closes  elderly North Dakotans will have to drive  in some cases  close to a hundred miles for a face to face meeting with someone to resolve a Social Security problem    After praising the efforts of SSA personnel in the states regional offices  the delegation also expressed concerns over short staffing that has affected the performance of SSA offices across the country  Budget cuts and increased workloads have led to increased wait times  a drop in the quality of telephone service and increased delays in processing disability claims  the delegation said    Attached is the letter sent to SSA from North Dakotas Congressional Delegation      September 28  2007   Commissioner Michael J  Astrue  Social Security Administration  6401 Security Boulevard  Windsor Park Building  Baltimore  MD 21235   Dear Commissioner Astrue    We are writing to seek written clarification of the Social Security Administrations  SSA  plans for providing ongoing service at the SSA field office in Dickinson  North Dakota    We would first like to commend you for the outstanding public service provided by all of SSAs field offices in the state of North Dakota   Because of this excellent record of service to the people of North Dakota  we as a delegation will continue to take a very active interest in your agency and work to ensure that adequate resources are available to accomplish your mission   We believe that Social Security field offices must provide an appropriate range of in person services to current and future retirees and disabled workers      As you are well aware  SSA offices in North Dakota and across this country are already short staffed due to previous funding cuts and new workloads   The quality of services offered at some SSA offices has deteriorated as a result   Staffing shortages in many SSA field offices have increased waiting times  negatively impacted the quality of telephone service  slowed the processing time for disability claims  and limited the number of continuing disability reviews   Hard working SSA employees are being overloaded and feel demoralized    For all of these reasons  we are very concerned about maintaining adequate staffing in all of the existing North Dakota SSA field offices    We are equally concerned about keeping all North Dakota SSA field offices open due to the great distances people must travel to receive the in  person service they expect and deserve    In particular  we continue to hear from concerned citizens who are apprehensive that SSA may close its field office in Dickinson  North Dakota   While we have received verbal assurances from members of your staff that SSA plans to continue providing in person service  as well as new teleconferencing capabilities  at a contact station in Dickinson  we are seeking a written clarification of your plans for providing ongoing service to this critically important field office   In addition  we would like an update from you regarding your current and future staffing plans for other field offices in North Dakota     We recognize that SSA must have adequate resources to continue to provide service to the American public and your agency remains a high priority for us    Thank you in advance for your update regarding the status of North Dakotas SSA field offices and your work on behalf of our constituents   We look forward to hearing from you soon    Sincerely       KENT CONRAD  BYRON DORGAN   EARL POMEROY
