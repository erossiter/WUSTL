ND Leaders  Individual Assistance Secured for Northwood Delegation and Governor Say Decision Will Bring Relief and Hope to Tornado Victims                   September 14  2007  Washington  Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan  Congressman Earl Pomeroy and Governor John Hoeven today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has approved the availability of Individual Assistance for the people of Northwood as they recover from the effects of a devastating tornado  We applaud FEMAs decision to grant Individual Assistance to the people of Northwood  the delegation and governor said in a joint statement  The public assistance approved last week will help rebuild the town  This aid will further help the victims of this terrible disaster rebuild their lives  The decision will also trigger Small Business Administration disaster loans for businesses and homeowners  Last week  officials from FEMA said that since 90 percent of the homes in Northwood were insured  homeowners would not likely qualify for Individual Assistance However  the delegation and governor successfully argued that the homeowners should qualify for Individual Assistance  because many were underinsured with regard to rebuilding costs  FEMAs Individual and Household Program  IHP provides financial assistance or direct services to qualifying individuals  often in the form of temporary housing and money for home repairs not covered by insurance  who have necessary expenses and serious needs  At least 22 were completely destroyed and 46 had major damage  Current estimates show  3 5 million in residential uninsured losses in the community   2 5 million of which is on residential structures alone  Because residential damage assessments are ongoing  estimates of the extent of the damage are expected to grow
