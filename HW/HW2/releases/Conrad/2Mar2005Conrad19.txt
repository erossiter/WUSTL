Conrad Bill Overturning Border Rule To Get Vote Citing  Mad Cow   Support Grows for Conrad Plan to Reverse USDA                    March 2  2005  Washington    A bipartisan list of 33 senators today have signed a petition in support of an immediate vote on a resolution of disapproval authored by Senator Kent Conrad that would overturn a controversial Agriculture Department rule opening the border to greater beef trade with Canada  The USDA s rule would allow the greater trade to resume on Monday  A resolution of disapproval is a form of legislation designed to reverse specific agency rules  With 30 signatures  the resolution can bypass the committee and be sent directly to the floor for an immediate vote  In this case  Senator Conrad and the bipartisan group of senators cited the threat of mad cow disease from Canadian beef as the purpose to block greater live cattle trade with Canada  This is simply too great a risk to open the border  The evidence shows Canada is not enforcing its regulations to protect consumers and the industry  Senator Conrad said  On Dec  29  2004  the USDA designated Canada as a minimal risk region for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  a fatal disease known both as BSE and as mad cow  Since USDA released its rule  Canada has had two new cases of BSE sickened cattle  The broader ban on live Canadian cattle trade came in May 2003  following the first discovery of cattle sick with BSE in Canada  Senators who support the resolution of disapproval include Sen  Pete Domenici  R N M   Sen  Byron Dorgan  D N D   Sen  Ken Salazar  D Col   Sen  Tim Johnson  D S D   Sen  Max Baucus  D Mont   Sen  Craig Thomas  R Wyo   Sen  Conrad Burns  R Mont   Sen  Mark Dayton  D Minn   Sen  Ben Nelson  D Neb   and Sen  Jeff Bingaman  D N M
