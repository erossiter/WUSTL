Conrad Says Proposed Rules Threaten Rural Ambulances National Standards May Leave Small Towns Without Ambulance Squads                    January 21  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad warned that new emergency training rules sought by the federal government could mean an end to many rural ambulance squads in North Dakota  which already have problems recruiting and retaining volunteers  Senator Conrad wrote to the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors  urging they rewrite a national plan that would standardize training requirements for emergency medical technicians  EMTs   Under the proposal  EMTs could have to increase training from the current 110 hour requirement to between 250 and 350 hours  While I agree that all emergency personnel should be highly trained  this is simply beyond the scope of what we can do in rural communities  Senator Conrad said  I m urging that they take into account the unique circumstances facing our rural ambulance squads and make sure that any new training rules ensure the viability of EMS in our part of the country  In North Dakota  membership in volunteer squads has been on a slow decline  In 1980  there were an average of 35 members per EMS squad  Today  the average squad size has decreased to about 12 volunteers per unit  Burdensome training requirements would make it even more difficult to recruit EMS volunteers and make it more likely that current volunteers would retire and leave communities with no EMS  Senator Conrad wrote in his letter  This is unsustainable federal regulation in North Dakota  and I hope we can fix it  said Senator Conrad  More generally  the senator said he is working with the National Rural Health Association on legislation that would help keep volunteer ambulance squads in rural communities
