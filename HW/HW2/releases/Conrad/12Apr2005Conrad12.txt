Conrad about issues facing North Dakota s bases as the Defense Department prepares for Base Realignment and Closure  The report was aired on WDAY s 5 o clock  6 o clock and 10 o clock newscasts  The full transcript is below  Reporter  Hi  Is this Senator Conrad  KC  Yes  Reporter  Hi this is Dana Turtle from WDAY  How are you  KC  Good  How are you Dana  Reporter  Are doing well are doing well  We are curious  What did you hear about the base closure here in ND  We heard that your sources are saying that there s a pretty good chance that they could be eliminated  What s happening here  KC  I think it s important to understand that all bases in the country are under review in the base closing project  That means that all bases across the nation are at risk including ours  With respect to the Hooligans  we know there is heightened risk because they re flying the oldest equipment in the air guard and the air force and the air guard intend to dramatically bring down the number of fighter planes in the inventory  Grand Forks is at some risk because the Department of Defense wants to have more tankers in the southeastern part of the country  Minot is at some risk because there is some emerging debate as to whether we should maintain 500 missiles in the ICBM inventory  That s what s made Minot safe so far  But that changing as this debate occurs to change from a missile standard to a warhead standard so all of our bases are at some risk  Reporter  We talked with Dave Sumdahl a little while ago and he s still remaining optimistic until the official list comes out on May 16  In light of what you know  what would you tell those folks working at those bases  KC  What we re doing is making a massive effort to keep off the list  keep all of our facilities off the list  That is our highest priority and we re working in very close coordination  The congressional delegation  the governor  the base retention groups in each of the communities  the mayors of each of the communities  we have an all out effort  That s why we have made dozens of contacts with the Department of Defense  with top air force officials  with the air guard senior staff  You know  we understand there s a tremendous amount at stake for our communities and for our state  Reporter  Talk about the economy  How would ND be affected if these three bases were to close  KC  That would be a stunning blow if all three were closed  I think there s no chance of that  The major risk is that we would lose a major base  Most of the economic analysis says the unemployment in a community where a base would close would be over 20   That would be a very very serious matter  Look  that s why this is a high priority for every leader in ND  That s why we have such a united effort  Mr  Groney  who is the chief civilian dealing with the BRAC process at the Pentagon  said after our most recent meeting  the fourth meeting we ve had with him  the governor was with us  Congressman Pomeroy and I  Senator Dorgan called in separately he said  you know the thing that impresses us is how united the state of ND is  We ve sent a very clear signal about how important these bases are to us and about how important we believe they are to the national security interest of the United States  Reporter  What about Sen  Dorgan  What have you guys been talking about in terms of the issue  KC  Well what we have done is come together with the Governor  with base retention groups in each of the communities  and have a very determined strategy to leave no stone unturned  That s our commitment  A couple of weeks ago  I talked to a top air force general about what we are hearing  He said  Kent  you have many friends  Call on every one of them  Push every button  Fight like a junkyard dog  That s what we re doing  We ve taken those words to heart  We have contacted the Air Force Chief of Staff multiple of times  The Deputy Chief of Staff  Gen   Mosey  I just had breakfast with him again last week  We have talked repeatedly to the combatant commander for GFAFB  Gen  Handy  We have talked to the top people at DOD  We have more meetings scheduled this week  We will be meeting with Mr  Wynn  who is the man who is Mr  Groney s boss at the Department  of Defense  We ll be meeting with him on Friday  I ve talked to Gen  Cartwright who is head of strategic command for the US  in charge of all the nuclear forces  I talked last Friday with Lance Lord  who is head of space command for the U S   who s in charge of all of our nuclear missiles  Look  we have as aggressive an effort as I have ever seen and the most united effort I have ever seen because the stakes have never been higher for our state  Reporter  Is there anything else you want to add at all KC  I want to say this  The community leadership of Fargo  of Grand Forks  and Minot  have been absolutely superb  As you know  I went home last week and briefed community leaderships in both Grand Forks and Minot  I d earlier done the same with the groups in Fargo  Their efforts have been outstanding  I think they re going to stand us in good stead  But we can take nothing for granted  We have to do every single thing we can think of because the stakes are so large for our individual community and our state  Reporter  Ok  Thank you very much Senator KC  You bet
