Conrad to Canada  Devils Lake Delay Unacceptable Outlet is Vital to Protect Life and Property in Devils Lake Basin  Senator says                    April 26  2005  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad met with top Canadian officials today to discuss the flooding crisis of Devils Lake basin and said he could not support a Canadian proposal that could delay use of the Devils Lake outlet to drain the rising water  There is an urgent need to act  The lake has risen 26 feet and there are roads acting as dams  Senator Conrad said  We need to begin moving water out of Devils Lake as soon as possible  There is a real risk that some of these roads could fail and put people and property in great danger  In the most recent in a series of meetings about Devils Lake  Senator Conrad today welcomed Canadian Cabinet minister Reg Alcock  president of Canada s Treasury Board  to his Capitol Hill office  At the meeting  representatives of the Canadian Embassy delivered a written proposal  first suggested to Conrad earlier in the month by Canadian Ambassador Frank McKenna  The Canadian proposal offers to limit the time for a review of the nearly completed Devils Lake outlet by the International Joint Commission  or IJC  to approximately one year  Further  the Canadian proposal offered a promise to agree to the IJC s conclusion  and not delay with endless appeals  The IJC is the bi national panel charged with overseeing cross boundary water issues  Ambassador McKenna delivered on his earlier promise of a written proposal  I ve told them that I d forward it to the governor for his reaction  Senator Conrad said  However  I indicated today that I could not recommend the considerable delays contained in their outline  The letter suggests at least a year long delay  something I simply can t support  Although Canada offered to agree to a one year IJC deadline  a recent study of IJC reviews by the Congressional Research Service found that the IJC took an average of 8  years to complete each of the 46 reviews it has conducted  That doesn t give people confidence that this review could be done quickly  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad noted that Canada rejected a U S  sought IJC referral in 2002 on the proposed federally funded outlet  He also noted that the United States has spent more than  350 million to raise roads  move buildings and build dikes in the Devils Lake basin
