Conrad Looks to Block Plan to Reopen Border to Canadian Cattle Senator Challenges USDA Grading Canada as  Minimal Risk   for Mad Cow                    February 10  2005  Washington  Citing evidence of Canada s failure to enforce measures to control mad cow disease  Senator Kent Conrad introduced bipartisan legislation today that stops the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  from implementing its controversial plan to reopen the Canadian border to cattle trade  If adopted by Congress  Senator Conrad s resolution of disapproval would nullify a USDA ruling designating Canada as a minimal risk region for mad cow  The resolution would  in effect  close the door on the USDA s plan to allow for Canadian cattle imports to resume on March 7  It is outrageous for USDA to continue pushing forward with this decision to renew cattle trade with Canada  a country known to have mad cow in its herd and a record of failure in its attempts to ban illegal feed  Senator Conrad said  Instead of taking precautions to protect our markets and our consumers  USDA is playing a game of chance  But I m not willing to put the American public and the American beef industry at risk  At the heart of Senator Conrad s campaign against the potential spread of mad cow in the U S  is his concern about the effectiveness of Canada s ability to prevent contaminated feed from being consumed by cattle  A series of Canadian newspaper reports recently cited government tests that discovered animal tissue in more than half the vegetable only cattle feed  This raises questions as to whether rules designed to prevent the feeding of cattle remains to other cattle  the primary way in which mad cow disease is spread  are being routinely violated in Canada  Senator Conrad  a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  has urged Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to reconsider the minimal risk ruling  citing Canada s feed ban violations  USDA has been unwilling to review its ruling  It now appears that the only way to stop this rule from going forward is for the Congress to block it  Then perhaps we can have a meaningful dialogue on how to ensure the safety of the U S  cattle herd and help open export markets  Senator Conrad said  Senator Conrad s resolution of disapproval was cosponsored by Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Harry Reid  D NV   Craig Thomas  R WY   Pete Domenici  R NM   Max Baucus  D MT   Ken Salazar  D CO   Tim Johnson  D SD   and Jeff Bingaman  D NM
