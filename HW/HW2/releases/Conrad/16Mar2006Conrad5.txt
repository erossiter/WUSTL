Bipartisan Disaster Aid for Farmers Introduced in Senate Republicans Join Conrad Effort to Help Farmers  Ranchers                    March 16  2006  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad introduced legislation today to help farmers and ranchers recover from losses to natural disasters including drought  flood and disease    as well as Hurricane Katrina  The bill has already won bipartisan backing  and has 20 co sponsors  including Senator Byron Dorgan  Rain  disease  floods and even anthrax have brought a wave of losses to North Dakota s farmers and ranchers  Last year  every single county in North Dakota was designated a primary disaster county by the Secretary of Agriculture  Senator Conrad said  Disaster prevented more than a million acres from being planted in North Dakota last year  This bill is a priority because our producers are in jeopardy  The bill would provide emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies  It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock  Co sponsors include Sens  Mel Martinez  R Fla   Bill Nelson  D Fla   Norm Coleman  R Minn   Mark Dayton  D Minn   Kit Bond  R Mo   Jim Talent  R Mo   Tim Johnson  D S D   John Thune  R S D   Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   Max Baucus  D Mont   Conrad Burns  R Mont   Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   Maria Cantwell  D Wash   and Ken Salazar  D Col   among others  The bill will also help farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last year s hurricanes  Energy related farm expenses rose by more than  6 billion last year compared to 2004  unlike other industries  farmers and ranchers are largely unable to pass on these costs  meaning those higher energy costs directly reduce direct farm income  Last June  rainfall was more than 250 percent of normal in several parts of the state  Higher than normal spring flooding washed out newly planted fields  while earlier spring rains kept farmers from planting more than one million acres  Disease reduced the quality of large parts of North Dakota s crop last year  And anthrax is responsible for the loss of more than 500 head of cattle in North Dakota alone  This bill wouldn t make any farmer or rancher whole  but it goes a long way to making sure that producers who have seen losses at the hands of Mother Nature have a chance to stay in business  Senator Conrad said
