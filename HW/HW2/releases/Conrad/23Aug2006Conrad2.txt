North Dakota Farmers Raise Their Voices Drought  Disaster Relief Focus of Senator s Farm Gathering                    August 23  2006  Bismarck    Hundreds of farmers and ranchers filled a hall at the Bismarck  Civic Center today demanding that the White House and the Republican Congress  stop blocking federal relief from drought and other natural disasters  Senator Conrad organized the farm gathering  The North Dakota Farmers Union  was the lead sponsor of the event  Joining Senator Conrad were Governor John Hoeven  Senator Byron Dorgan   Congressman Earl Pomeroy  Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson  North Dakota  Farmers Union President Robert Carlson    and hundreds of farmers and ranchers  who have lost crops and herds to drought  disease and other natural disasters  We need to turn up the volume and make sure the President hears that we are  hurting in the heartland  We are in the midst of a drought almost as bad as the  Dust Bowl  Senator Conrad said  This isn t a disaster of our making  But  unless we get some federal relief fast  we re going to start losing farm  families  I want to keep our family farms from going on the auction block  While more than 30 counties in North Dakota have been declared a disaster  area  assistance is not guaranteed  Declaring a disaster area really doesn t  bring any relief to those affected in that area  it just is a declaration   Carlson said  It takes a special act of Congress to allocate money and  compensate producers for their losses  The United States Senate had adopted Senator Conrad s disaster relief  legislation earlier this year by a wide  bipartisan majority  However  at the  demand of the President  Republican leaders in the House of Representatives  stripped the relief package from an emergency supplemental bill  Senator Conrad said he intends to continue to push for relief when the  Congress reconvenes in September  With rainfall less than 20 percent of normal in parts of North Dakota  and  temperatures more than 90 degrees on at least 23 days in July  many producers  face dramatic losses  while ranchers experiencing feed and water shortages are  selling off their herds  Last year  natural disasters in North Dakota prevented  farmers from planting more than a million acres  The economic pain of this kind of slow motion disaster doesn t end at the  farm gate  It echoes through the storefronts of every Main Street in rural North  Dakota  Senator Conrad said  Grain dealers  implement shops    everyone who  does business with farmers is going to hurt  That means the whole state will  hurt  because agriculture is still the tractor that pulls North Dakota s  economy
