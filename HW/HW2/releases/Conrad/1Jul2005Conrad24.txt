Senators Secure More Than  80 Million in Energy and Water Projects for North Dakota Conrad  Dorgan Push Through Legislation Benefiting Energy Research and Flood Control                    July 1  2005  Washington Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad announced today that North Dakota would receive more than  84 6 million in flood control  water and energy projects as part of a comprehensive energy and water appropriations bill that received full Senate approval early this morning  The 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 3  Senator Dorgan a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  and Senator Conrad  the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  secured funding for numerous North Dakota energy  environment and water projects  This bill will go a long way toward helping further develop the technologies to use North Dakota s traditional sources of energy in an environmentally friendly way  It will also protect North Dakotans from future flooding disasters  while maintaining our state s water resources  Senators Dorgan and Conrad said in a joint statement  The spending bill secures  40 million to complete the Grand Forks Flood Control Project and  30 8 million for Garrison Diversion and other area water projects  including the Northwest Area Water Supply  NAWS  project in Minot  The bill also includes a significant increase in flood protection funding for the Fargo Ridgewood Addition   1 24 million  compared to  420 000 last year  The bill also boosts funding for upgrades to boat ramps and recreational facilities at Lake Sakakawea with  900 000  compared to  625 000 last year  The bill also increases the federal funding for a fossil energy research and development project at the University of North Dakota s Energy and Environmental Research Center  EERC  in Grand Forks  In total  the EERC is slated to get  8 million from the bill  with earmarks for a National Center for Hydrogen Technology and a Center for Biomass Utilization  Following is a list of North Dakota projects funded by the bill  Grand Forks Flood Control  Army Corps of Engineers  Construction    40 million This funding will go to the Army Corps of Engineers for completing construction of long term flood protection for Grand Forks  North Dakota  and East Grand Forks  Minnesota  Completion of this project will help protect residents and businesses in the region from future flooding  and help prevent a recurrence of the devastating damage and loss experienced caused by 1997 flood  Garrison Diversion Project    30 837 million This funding will support Garrison Diversion and several other water projects  including the Northwest Area Water Supply  NAWS   the Williams County Rural Water System  the Williston water treatment plant  and water supply projects on four Indian reservations in North Dakota  Garrison Diversion was authorized by Congress to compensate North Dakota for the loss of land due to the dam s construction  and to help meet North Dakota s contemporary water needs  Buford Trenton Irrigation District    1 5 million This funding will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to purchase remaining flowage easements for cropland within the Buford Trenton Irrigation District that has been out of production due to the rising water table behind the Garrison Dam  The rising water table has made adjacent farmland unusable or less productive  Congress authorized these easements in the 1996 Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   Fossil Energy Research and Development   University of North Dakota  EERC     4 million This funding will be used by the EERC to continue the Department of Energy s Cooperative Research and Development Program  which conducts research on advanced clean coal technology and fossil fuels  National Center for Hydrogen Technology at the EERC    3 million This funding would be used by EERC to continue important research at its National Center for Hydrogen Technology  Senator Dorgan created the National Center with a  3 million earmark in last year s budget  The funds will help develop fuel conversion technologies in support of the Department of Energy s FutureGen Program  They will also go toward the study of coal refinery and for testing of advanced fuel cell systems used with coal derived  hydrogen rich fuels  Mosquito Control    Williston  Trenton Service Area    100 000 This funding will be used for mosquito control in the city of Williston and the Trenton Indian Service Area due to the levee construction  Fargo Ridgewood Addition    1 245 million This funding will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to complete plans and to begin construction on a series of levees and floodwalls aimed at protecting homes and businesses in the Ridgewood Addition of Fargo  North Dakota  The funds also will help protect the Veterans Administration Hospital from consistent threats of flooding along the Red River  Lake Sakakawea Recreation Upgrades    900 000 This funding would be used by the Friends of Lake Sakakawea to work in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure the recreational sites around Lake Sakakawea can be utilized  Low water levels at Lake Sakakawea  a federal lake operated by the Corps of Engineers  have damaged area tourism and recreational sites and limited boat ramp access  Center for Biomass Utilization  University of North Dakota   EERC     1 million This funding will be used by the EERC for research on ways to integrate biomass with fossil fuels in conventional power systems  This research is used to determine methods of increasing baseload electricity generation from renewable sources and using biomass in advanced power systems  The EERC established a biomass research center to develop and commercialize technologies using biomass in electric generation and transportation fuels  Hydrogen Wind Pilot Project    500 000 This funding will be used to continue a demonstration project near Minot  North Dakota  that will take hydrogen produced from wind energy turbines and store it as a transportation fuel for use in the agriculture sector or as electricity fuel running an internal combustion engine driven generator  The project partners Basin Electric Power Cooperative  Stuart Energy  John Deere and North Dakota State University with the U S  Department of Energy  The project may reveal a potential new market for wind energy in our state  Breckenridge Flood Control Project    1 5 million This funding is for the Army Corps of Engineers to use in the construction of the Breckinridge flood control project  which needs to be concurrently built with the Wahpeton flood control project  The Breckenridge project received no funding in the President s budget proposal this year  Without this funding  construction on the Wahpeton and Breckenridge flood control projects likely will cease  After the passage by the Senate  the Energy and Water Appropriations bill now moves to a conference committee to work out differences between Senate and House versions of the legislation  Senator Dorgan will serve as a member of this conference committee
