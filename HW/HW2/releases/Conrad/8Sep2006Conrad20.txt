Senate Passes Conrad s Stolen Valor Act Senator s Bipartisan Bill Fights to Preserve Veterans  Honor                    September 8  2006  Washington  The U S  Senate last night unanimously passed Senator Kent  Conrad s bill to penalize those who use phony military medals to fraudulently  claim to be decorated veterans  The medals earned by genuine American veterans  recognize their courage  honor  and sacrifice  Senator Conrad said  I will not  let imposters diminish the honor of America s veterans  Senator Conrad s legislation  entitled the Stolen Valor Act  is  co sponsored in the Senate by Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter and 27  other senators  Colorado Democratic Congressman John Salazar has also introduced  a similar version of the bill in the House of Representatives in which  Congressman Earl Pomeroy is a co sponsor  Existing laws do not stop imposters from identifying themselves as medal  recipients  claiming it on their rsum or hanging fake medals on their walls   These imposters often impersonate distinguished veterans in places such as  parades  schools  and the funerals of soldiers  Many con artists also use  fraudulent medals to accrue credibility with their eventual victims  Senator Conrad s legislation expands existing law  making it a federal crime  to impersonate a decorated veteran  Specifically  the Conrad bill will allow  prosecution of imposters who falsely claim to be recipients of the Medal of  Honor  Distinguished Service Awards  Silver Star  or Purple Heart  It is disgraceful that there are imposters claiming to have received medals  they did not earn  It is my hope this legislation will serve to honor the brave  men and women of our military who earned these medals through their service   Senator Conrad said  I appreciate the support my legislation has received from  veterans and veterans  organizations all across the country
