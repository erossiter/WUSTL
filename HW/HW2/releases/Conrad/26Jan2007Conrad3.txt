Conrad Takes on ND s Pressing Water Needs Senator s Legislation Would Ensure Safe  Reliable Water Supply for ND Communities                   January 26  2007  Washington    Senator Kent Conrad today introduced a pair of bills intended to ensure a safe  reliable water supply for North Dakota communities  There is nothing more important to the health of North Dakota families than a clean  safe  reliable water supply  Senator Conrad said  If water is not safe to drink  people s health is seriously threatened  Senator Conrad said  Communities across the state are facing critical situations with their drinking water supplies   In Fort Yates  Cannonball and Porcupine  thousands of people lost their water just days before Thanksgiving in 2003  and the hospital  schools and tribal offices were all shut down   In Parshall  water supply problems continue to loom because the level of Lake Sakakawea keeps dropping  And Mandan will have to build a new horizontal well because of sediment and flow problems related to the Oahe Reservoir  Senator Conrad s Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act authorizes  60 million through the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to assist communities with water supply and treatment projects   Under the Conrad bill  local communities could apply for the Corps to pay 75 percent of the cost for construction and repair of water supply systems  wastewater treatment plants and other water projects  Senator Conrad also introduced legislation today to authorize the Corps to construct a new municipal water supply system for the city of Devils Lake   The new system would replace the city s 40 year old water pipeline that is currently under rising lake waters  If a failure in the submerged section of the line were to occur  it would be almost impossible to identify the leak and make the necessary repairs  That would leave the more than 7 000 residents of the city without a source of drinking water  Safe drinking water is a basic necessity of life  Senator Conrad said   These bills make the investments we need to improve local water supplies throughout North Dakota  Senator Conrad is seeking to include his bills as part of the Water Resources Development Act that will be considered later this year   Senator Byron Dorgan is a cosponsor of both Conrad bills
