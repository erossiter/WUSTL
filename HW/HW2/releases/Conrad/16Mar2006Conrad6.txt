GOP Majority Rejects Conrad Avian Flu Amendment Amendment Would Have Boosted Efforts to Fight Sickness                    March 16  2006  Washington    The Republican majority in the U S  Senate rejected an effort by Senator Kent Conrad today to better prepare the nation for a bird flu pandemic  which Administration officials warn could hit in the next few months  Avian flu could be the disaster of our time  We ought to treat it as seriously as the threat it poses  Senator Conrad said  We are still unprepared to meet any potential pandemic  If the aftermath of Katrina has taught us anything  it s that we are not prepared  The Conrad amendment would have boosted health funding by an additional  5 billion in 2007  and it would have been fully offset    not adding to the deficit    by requiring tax withholdings on government payments to contractors like Halliburton  Specifically  the Conrad amendment would have provided    1 5 billion to increase the stockpile of antivirals and necessary medical supplies including masks  gloves  ventilators  antibiotics  and medical treatment for chronic care patients    2 5 billion to accelerate vaccine research  development and manufacturing  and   1 billion to increase state and local preparedness  Senator Conrad highlighted the recent prediction from the United Nations that bird flu will reach the United States within the next six to 12 months  Meanwhile  the Administration has estimated that the development of a bird flu vaccine is three to five years away  The Administration s own planning assumptions predict that if a pandemic were to hit  90 million people could become sick  and as many as 1 9 million people could die  In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee  Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said that a pandemic would mean a public health crisis that would require responding to as many as 5 000 different communities at the same time  We don t have enough ventilators  hospital beds  or a clear plan to develop a vaccine  It is critical that more resources are devoted to address this threat  Senator Conrad said  I think we can and should do more  The Conrad amendment failed 44 55  on a party line vote
