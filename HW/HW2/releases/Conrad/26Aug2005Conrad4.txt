North Dakota Teamwork Delivers on BRAC Vote Grand Forks Sees Tankers  UAVs  Fargo Open for Flying Mission                    August 26  2005  Washington    Following an intense campaign of persuasion by North Dakota s congressional delegation and governor  the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission voted unanimously to keep eight KC 135 tankers at Grand Forks Air Force Base until the end of 2010    providing a bridge to the new generation of tankers expected in 2012  The Commission also voted to remove Pentagon language blocking the assignment of a manned flying mission for Fargo s 119th Air National Guard unit  which will see its F 16 fighter jets retired in two years  The Happy Hooligans will be free to receive a manned flying mission in addition to the assignment they have already received  which is to fly some of the Predators to be based in Grand Forks  This is a victory for North Dakota and for our nation s defense  the delegation and the governor announced in a joint statement following the vote by the BRAC Commission  Today s vote recognizes that Fargo s Air National Guard pilots are the best fighter pilots in the nation  and that Grand Forks is in fact the  crown jewel  of the Air Mobility Command  Our team effort to present the facts results in a better military  and it has meant we are keeping two significant economic resources in North Dakota  The BRAC Commission also adopted the Defense Department s recommendation to base Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs  in Grand Forks  Under the Defense Department s plan  the Air Force would have moved all of the GFAFB tankers by 2009  Instead  the Air Force will keep the tankers at GFAFB approximately two more years  Commissioners cited testimony from Air Force officials about the intention to base new tankers in Grand Forks as the reason for retaining a core group of KC 135 tankers until the end of 2010  I ve received personal assurances from Gen  Moseley  the Air Force Chief of Staff  that he intends to base new tankers at Grand Forks  and we heard that again from the BRAC commissioners  We see great potential to make Grand Forks a dual mission base  with Global Hawk and Predator    the two most sought after missions in the Air Force    and the new generation of tankers  said Senator Kent Conrad  In Fargo  we got Predator  the fastest growing mission in the Air Force  and now we re completely free to seek a manned flying mission in addition to the UAV assignment  Keeping tankers until 2011 will allow us to bridge the gap to the new generation tanker  said Gov  Hoeven  Together with a new UAV mission  which includes both Global Hawk and Predator  Grand Forks Air Force Base has a solid future in North Dakota as a key part of overall Air Force structure  It also means that we have an opportunity to work with the Air Force and the National Guard to bring a new manned flying mission to Fargo  This is a great decision and has a big impact on our future  Dorgan said  It means we keep jobs and opportunity in North Dakota because both air bases will remain open and we ll continue to have an Air Guard Unit  Today s decisions about Grand Forks and Fargo are a win win for our state  As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  I will be working with the Air Force to expand a dual mission  tanker and UAV base in Grand Forks  and to get modern fighter planes for the Happy Hooligans in Fargo  The decisions today reflect the high quality of the installations in North Dakota  The Commission recognized the value these installations and their missions have to our national security  said Pomeroy  And that result is due to the combined work of the communities involved  the Governor and the delegation
