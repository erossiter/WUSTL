SEN. CORZINE SAYS CBO STUDY SHOWS BUSH COMMISSION'S PLAN WOULD CUT SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS ALMOST IN HALF
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today called on President Bush to publicly reject cuts in Social Security benefits proposed by the Bush Social Security Commission after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report finding that the Commission's plan would cut benefits for younger Americans almost in half.  
   "CBO's report highlights the deep cuts in benefits that would flow from President Bush's call to privatize Social Security," said Corzine. "The Bush privatization plan would take the security out of Social Security, and must be rejected," Corzine said. 
   The CBO report found that, under current law, young people born in this decade will be eligible for $26,400 in Social Security benefits when they retire at the age of 65. However, if the Bush Commission's proposal is enacted, benefits would be cut to $14,600, a 45 percent reduction. The $14,600 figure includes the proceeds from proposed privatized accounts. [See Table 2 of the CBO report, which is available at www.cbo.gov.] 
   Senator Corzine noted that, in 2002, 50 senators wrote to President Bush urging him to publicly reject the cuts in guaranteed benefits proposed by the Bush Social Security Commission. Senator Corzine is still awaiting a response. 
   "It's long past time for President Bush to publicly reject the benefit cuts that were proposed by his Social Security Commission," Senator Corzine said. "His silence only fuels suspicion that, if reelected, the President intends to dismantle Social Security as we know it."
