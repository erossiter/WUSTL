SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SHORTAGE OF FLU VACCINE IN U.S.
  In response to a question today at the National Press Club, Sen.  
 Jon S. Corzine said the lack of flu vaccine in this country was a failure of leadership on the part of President Bush and his Administration and a wake up call that we are unprepared for a potential chemical or biological attack by terrorists. Following his appearance at the Press Club, Senator Corzine released the following statement.
   "The President has once again failed us. Millions of Americans are at risk of going without the flu vaccine this year because the administration failed to act proactively to ensure an adequate supply. There is simply no excuse for this. The Government Accountability Office has warned for the last three years of an impending flu vaccine crisis, and just last month the FDA was notified that half of the U.S. supply of flu vaccine was in jeopardy because of bacterial contamination. Not only has the Bush Administration failed to act, but Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, had the gall today to declare that the vaccine shortage is 'not a health crisis.'
   "Mr. Secretary, there is a health crisis in America. Thousands of senior citizens have been lining up outside of pharmacies and supermarkets to get vaccines only to be turned away due to shortage. Just yesterday an elderly man in New Jersey had to be hospitalized for hypothermia after waiting outside in the cold for a vaccine and some people have collapsed from exhaustion while waiting for the vaccine.
   "If the Bush Administration cannot ensure Americans that they will be safe from the flu, how will they protect our country against a possible bio-terror or chemical attack? The American people deserve better."
