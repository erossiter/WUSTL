NEW JERSEY SENS. LAUTENBERG, CORZINE APPLAUD FINAL CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ON BILL TO EXPAND HIGHLANDS
  New Jersey's two Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine issued the following statements today following final passage of the Highlands Conservation Act.  
 The legislation Lautenberg and Corzine sponsored in the Senate passed its final hurdle before getting to the President's desk by passing the House of Representatives late last night.
   "This victory will allow a significant expansion of protected lands in the Highlands so millions of people can experience the beautiful wilderness and wildlife of New Jersey. Our work on this was free from politics and partisanship, and because of that cooperation we have ensured that future generations to come will also be able to bring their families to the Highlands and enjoy this wonderful area of New Jersey," said Lautenberg
   "This legislation recognizes the Highlands as a national treasure that must be preserved," said Corzine. "I am proud to have worked with Senator Lautenberg and Congressman Frelinghuysen to secure passage of much-needed financial and technical assistance to enable municipalities and homeowners throughout New Jersey preserve and protect open space in New Jersey."
   The Highlands Region supplies drinking water for more than 11 million people, provides habitat for over 200 plant and 50 animal species and provides recreational opportunities for the almost 25 million people who live within one hour's drive.
   Senators Lautenberg and Corzine introduced federal legislation, the Highlands Conservation Act, which authorizes $100 million over the next 10 years for land acquisition in the Highlands region. Similar legislation, which passed the House, was sponsored by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-5th Dist.).
