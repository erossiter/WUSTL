SEN. CORZINE ?DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED' IN JOHN BOLTON'S RECESS APPOINTMENT TO U.N. AMBASSADORSHIP
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today issued the following statement regarding President Bush's recess appointment of John Bolton as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations:  
   "I am deeply disappointed by the recess appointment of John Bolton to be Ambassador to the United Nations. He was not confirmed by the Senate because he was not suitable for the job. Senate Republicans and Democrats and former members of this administration all expressed serious concerns about Mr. Bolton during the confirmation process, and I had hoped that the administration would have reconsidered his nomination. Instead, this appointment seems to reconfirm the worst tendencies of this administration, toward isolationism, needless confrontation, and indifference to its own international credibility. 
   "As I have long said, President Bush has an opportunity to work with the international community to confront global terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea. The administration could find common ground with other democratic nations as it presses for democratization and human rights in the Middle East and around the world. And it can finally build a consensus in the U.N. Security Council to stop the genocide raging in Darfur, Sudan. As one of the administration's most outspoken proponents of unilateralism, John Bolton may become a roadblock to addressing these critical priorities."
