SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON 2004 GOVERNOR'S RACE
  Statement from Sen. Jon S. Corzine:
   "Today I spoke to Governor McGreevey to express my concerns about this difficult time for his family, the Governor himself, and most importantly, the people of New Jersey.  
   "The Governor made clear in our conversation his absolute intent to serve until November 15, 2004. I accept that decision as final. 
   "In light of the Governor's position, I want to make clear that my priority is to serve the people of New Jersey in the United States Senate. I will continue to work for the election of a Democratic majority in the Senate and for the election of John Kerry to the White House so that we can work together to improve our security at home and abroad, build a stronger economy for all Americans, improve health care, and provide educational opportunity for every child."
