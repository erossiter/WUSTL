SEN. CORZINE ANNOUNCES $993,406 IN SCHOOL SAFETY GRANTS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today announced $993,406 in U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants to 18 New Jersey municipalities and police departments. Nationwide, 220 local law enforcement agencies in 42 states were selected to receive awards. The grants are part of the COPS Secure Our Schools program, which provides funds to improve security at schools and on school grounds. 
   "In order for our children to learn, we must provide them an environment in which they feel safe. The COPS in schools program helps ensure the security of our school buildings and grounds and it essential that the Administration and Congress continue to fund this valuable program," Senator Corzine said.
   The Secure Our Schools program will provide up to 50 percent of the total cost for municipalities to install metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other equipment to help deter crime. The grants can also be used to pay half of the cost of security assessments, security training, and other measures that will provide a significant improvement in security.
   Secure Our Schools is one of several COPS initiatives that enhance school safety. Since 1994 the program has funded 4,779 additional New Jersey police officers and sheriffs deputies and over $39 million has been awarded to add 315 school resource officers in the state.
   In addition, over $42 million has been awarded for crime-fighting technologies which have allowed officers to spend more time on the streets of New Jersey fighting and preventing crime through timesaving technology, information sharing systems and improved communications equipment. COPS provides school safety training, and has published several technical assistance guides to help law enforcement agencies effectively address specific school and youth violence issues.
   COPS also supports innovative community policing initiatives, funds the purchase of crime fighting technology, provides training and technical assistance resources, and funds the hiring of local law enforcement officers. Since 1994, COPS has invested $10.6 billion in the advancement of community policing nationwide, including grants awarded to more than 13,600 state and local law enforcement agencies to hire over 118,000 officers.
