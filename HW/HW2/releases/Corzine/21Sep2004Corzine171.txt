SENS. LAUTENBERG, CORZINE CALL ON BUSH TO DECLARE FEDERAL DISASTER FOR AREAS HIT HARD BY FLOODING
  Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine today called on President Bush to declare parts of New Jersey federal disaster areas following severe flooding that hit over the weekend.  
 The remnants of Hurricane Ivan dropped an inch and a half of rain per hour on Sunday in pats of Hunterdon, Mercer, Sussex and Warren counties along the Delaware River in New Jersey. 
   "We are writing in anticipation of an imminent request by Governor James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, that you issue a disaster declaration for parts of Hunterdon, Mercer, Sussex and Warren counties along the Delaware River in New Jersey," the lawmakers wrote in their letter to President Bush. "The residents are in need of federal assistance to immediately help them recover from this devastation. Your prompt disaster declaration would enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to begin the task of helping our residents." 
   The storm caused causing extensive flooding due to the water overflow of the Delaware River, rising 23.8 feet above flood stage. This resulted in severe property damage; the evacuation of over 3,300 people from their homes and the closing of the State Capitol in Trenton. Further, local officials have identified significant public health concerns due to sewer line ruptures, infrastructure damage, possible drinking water contamination and the closure of several flooded sewage treatment facilities. 
   Senator Lautenberg today toured the areas hit by helicopter with Colonel Rick Fuentes, the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police.
