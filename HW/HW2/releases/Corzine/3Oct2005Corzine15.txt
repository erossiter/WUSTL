SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE MIERS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) today released the following statement regarding White House Counsel Harriet Miers' nomination to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "The Supreme Court, at the top of the judicial branch, is the keystone of our democracy, guarding the sacred and fundamental rights of all Americans. As we consider Harriet Miers' nomination, it is vital that we learn everything we can about her judicial philosophy and her commitment to mainstream American values. 
   "I am pleased that President Bush has selected a woman to replace Justice O'Connor, who is a voice of moderation and the swing vote in protecting fundamental rights. The Court, in its role as our nation's highest judicial body, ought to represent the face of America. What matters most, however, is not that President Bush has selected a woman, but that whoever is chosen protects the fundamental rights that women and all Americans have fought so hard to attain. 
   "I look forward to learning more about Ms. Miers and sincerely hope that President Bush has not chosen someone who places ideology over respect for precedent. I have worked with Ms. Miers in the selection of federal district court and appellate judges, and she has been professional in her dialogue with Senator Lautenberg and me. 
    "The Senate has a responsibility to the American people to make certain that our freedoms and constitutional rights are protected. It is essential that Ms. Miers fully answer questions about her constitutional and legal philosophy and her views on precedent, and that the White House provide access to documents related to her tenure in public life. 
   "Providing advice and consent on the nomination of Supreme Court justice, which is a lifetime position, should not be a shot in the dark. Americans want a Court that reflects their mainstream values."
