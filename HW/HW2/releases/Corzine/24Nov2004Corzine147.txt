SEN. CORZINE ON ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today criticized widespread fraud in the Ukrainian election and condemned the premature announcement of a winner by the Ukrainian Election Commission.  
   "There is overwhelming evidence that the elections were marred by extensive, systematic fraud,'' Senator Corzine said in a statement. "Today's declaration by the election commission is therefore premature, at best." 
   Senator Corzine called on Ukrainian authorities to retract the declaration and instead undertake a thorough review of the election. "The principle of fair and transparent elections must be upheld. Until there is a credible and objective accounting, neither the United States nor the international community should recognize the declared results,'' the senator said. 
   The U.S. Senate passed a resolution on Nov. 19, which was supported by Senator Corzine, calling for a free and transparent election. 
   Senator Corzine also called on Ukrainian authorities to exercise restraint with protesters and avoid all violence. "The people have the right to protest peacefully in support of their democratic rights," he said.
