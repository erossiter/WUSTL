FIRE GRANTS AWARDED TO 18 NEW JERSEY MUNICIPALITIES
  United States Sen. Jon S. Corzine announced today $1,833,594 in Federal Emergency Management Administration grants to 18 New Jersey fire departments. The grants are part of an on-going effort to fund first responders at the local level.  
   The grants are for various aspects of firefighting and firefighting safety. The allocations will be used for operations and firefighting safety such as new air packs, compressors and hoses to funds that will defray the local costs of new firefighting vehicles. 
   This important funding program is at risk. President Bush's Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposes cutting the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program from $715 million to $500 million. New Jersey received $13.4 million in Fiscal Year 2004 and could lose as much as $4 million under the proposed cuts. 
   "Providing local jurisdictions with the resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe is of the highest importance," said Senator Corzine. "But the proposed budget cuts by nearly one third homeland security block grants from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion. 
   "If this budget is adopted, our communities, our safety, our schools, our health care, our air and water quality will be sacrificed to pay for President Bush's wrong choices." 
   More than $510 million in grant money has been awarded to fire departments across the country this year. 
   This figure includes $9,536,949 that has been awarded to New Jersey fire departments.
