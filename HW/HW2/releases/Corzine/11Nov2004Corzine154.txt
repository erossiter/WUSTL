SEN. CORZINE COMMEMORATES VETERANS DAY
  On this Veterans Day, we solemnly and gratefully commemorate those who have defended our country.  
 We owe our freedoms to the men and women who have served in our armed forces and today we offer our most profound thanks. 
   The sacrifices being made by our troops today, in Iraq, Afghanistan and throughout the world, are reminders of what it takes to protect us. Like generations before, they are doing their duty, with honor and courage. Many have come home wounded. Many have made the greatest sacrifice of all. 
   We honor our nation's veterans by providing them the benefits they have earned. That is why I will continue to fight to ensure that our nation repays the debt we owe those who defend us. That means sponsoring legislation to lower the retirement age for reservists and to accelerate survivors' benefits. It also means fighting for an adequate VA budget, mandatory spending for veterans programs, better access to prescription drugs, and the right of disabled veterans to receive both their military retired pay and their VA disability compensation.
   We must take care of the men and women who fought for our country. We must ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned by serving in the armed forces and facing combat. And in this time of war, we must demonstrate a willingness to provide for those who came before, to those who fought so valiantly in defense of democracy.
