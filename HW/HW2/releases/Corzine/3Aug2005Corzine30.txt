SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON REINTRODUCTION OF 30-YEAR BOND
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today issued the following statement in response to the announcement by Treasury Department officials that they will be reinstating the 30-year bond.  
   "I am pleased that the Treasury Department has decided to reissue the 30-year bond. Since 2001, markets have felt the absence of the long bond, and the availability of longer-term borrowing options will allow the Treasury a more practical and flexible debt management strategy. Many, including myself, have long called for the 30-year's return. In fact, I led a bipartisan group of eighteen of my Senate colleagues on the Banking and Finance committees in writing to urge Secretary Snow to reinstate the security. 
   "While I welcome the news, this reversal draws new attention to our nation's mounting fiscal problems. The long bond was discontinued in 2001, the last year of budget surpluses. Since then, as those record surpluses have been replaced by record deficits, the bond has become all the more necessary in light of the federal government's excessive borrowing. 
   "Reissuing the long bond is the right decision for our markets, our economy and our nation."
