SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO JR.'S NOMINATION TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today released the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to replace Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "While I am pleased that a New Jerseyan has been nominated to the Supreme Court, I am concerned that it is an attempt by President Bush to appease radical conservatives in his party who derailed Harriet Miers' nomination before she even had a hearing. 
   "The U.S. Senate has a responsibility to provide advice and consent on the president's judicial appointments. That responsibility takes on increased significance when the Supreme Court justice being replaced is a voice of moderation and restraint. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was often the swing vote in cases affecting the rights of every American. 
   "Justice O'Connor was the first woman ever appointed to our nation's highest judicial body. With the selection of Judge Alito, the President has failed to make the court more representative, and failed to open the court to individuals of diverse backgrounds. The Supreme Court ought to look more like the face of America, not less.
   "The Senate is not a rubber stamp, and I will take all actions necessary to ensure that the next justice is not an ideological activist who would reverse decades of progress on issues of choice, the right to privacy, civil rights, the rights of consumers, federalism, the scope of executive power, and government's ability to help those Americans who need it most. 
   "While I look forward to learning all I can about Judge Alito, based on what I know so far, I am deeply concerned that he will dramatically shift the balance of the Court to the right."
