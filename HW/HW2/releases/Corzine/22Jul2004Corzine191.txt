SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORT OF 9/11 COMMISSION
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) made the following statement following a briefing this morning:  
   "The Commission's work is of profound importance to our nation. I have enormous respect for the critical, objective analysis the Commission has produced, which is a testament to its independence and nonpartisanship. 
   "The Commission has made clear that we need deep changes in how we organize, manage and execute our counter-terrorism efforts. There is real work ahead of us and we will need to bring courage and intellectual honesty to formulating plans and actions to deal with counter-terrorism and intelligence as well as Congressional oversight of these issues. We owe it to those who lost their lives on September 11, to their families and to all Americans to ensure that we do all we can to protect our nation. 
   "We should all be extremely proud of the Commission and of its leadership. New Jersey is especially grateful to former Governor Tom Kean who, along with Congressman Lee Hamilton, provided a vital and lasting service to our country."
