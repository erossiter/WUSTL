SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESULTS OF UKRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
  The Ukranian Supreme Court upheld the victory of Liberal Viktor Yushchenko in Ukraine's long running presidential election today, the same day of the U.S. Presidential Inauguration and Swearing in ceremony. Sen.  
 Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ), who as a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has promoted the ideals of human rights, freedom and democracy around the globe, including in Darfur, Sudan, released the following statement. 
   "The election in Ukraine is a triumph of democracy and the rule of law over the forces of a bygone Soviet era," Corzine said. "The people of Ukraine stood up for their democratic rights, and I look forward to working with the leaders they have chosen. This remarkable saga had many heroes: Poland and other newly democratic nations stood up for Ukranian democracy, and Ukranian Americans and other members of the Ukranian Diaspora rallied international support for the democratic rights of the people of Ukraine. Coming on the same day of our own presidential inauguration and celebration of democracy, I hope that Ukraine's democratic election will serve as an inspiration for all those who seek freedom."
