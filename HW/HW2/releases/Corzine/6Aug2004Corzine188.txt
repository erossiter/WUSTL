SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DISSAPOINTING UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine made the following statement in reaction to the disappointing unemployment numbers released today: 
   "Today's unemployment numbers represent serious trouble for American workers and the American economy. We should be doing a lot better. In addition to the dismal employment numbers released today, job numbers for May and June have been revised downward, making this announcement a double-whammy for an already squeezed middle class. 
   Middle class families are being squeezed by flat wages and rising costs for healthcare, education, energy and property taxes. Continued weakness in the labor market will only compound these problems. 
   A strong economy begins with a strong middle class. And the economy will only turn around when we reverse the failed policies of President Bush and make a change in leadership in November."
