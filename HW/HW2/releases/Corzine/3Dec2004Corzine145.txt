SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF BERNARD KERIK TO HEAD HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) released the following statement on the nomination today by President Bush of Bernard B. Kerik to head the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "I know Mr. Kerik to be an accomplished and well respected law enforcement official. I am pleased that a New Jersey native, someone from this region who bore witness to the tragedy of 9/11and served on the front lines of the response has been nominated to head the Department of Homeland Security. 
   "I have spoken to Mr. Kerik and I know he understands that the New York-New Jersey region is at a higher risk for a future terrorist attack than any region in the country. Today, Homeland Security funds are not allocated based on the level of risk faced by a particular state or region. I told Mr. Kerik this simply must change. 
   "I also told Mr. Kerik that the White House and the Department of Homeland Security must get serious about chemical plant security - one of the most pressing Homeland Security issues facing our nation. One catastrophic terrorist attack on a chemical plant could kill or harm millions of people, yet currently, there are no federal security standards for chemical plants. I told Mr. Kerik that this too must change. I look forward to working with the future Homeland Security Secretary on these important priorities."
