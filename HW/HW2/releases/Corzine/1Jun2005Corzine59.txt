SEN. CORZINE COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF SEC CHAIRMAN DONALDSON
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine, a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, today released the following statement concerning the resignation of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William H. Donaldson:  
   "Bill Donaldson has carried out his role as chairman of the SEC with both intellectual and personal integrity. He deserves our gratitude for the outstanding job he has done steering our nation's financial markets through a very challenging period. 
   "Under his leadership, the SEC helped restore public confidence in our markets after serious scandals. With their focus on accountability and investor protection, he and his staff have worked diligently to promote transparency, liquidity, and efficiency in our nation's markets. 
   "I hope that the president will appoint a successor who is as vigilant and effective at protecting U.S. markets." 
   Donaldson, the 27th Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was appointed by President Bush in 2003. In the wake of several corporate and financial scandals, Chairman Donaldson played a crucial role in strengthening investor protections and making regulatory institutions more responsive to the changing marketplace. 
   Donaldson's resignation is effective June 30, 2005.
