SEN. CORZINE: IT'S TIME FOR REAL DIALOGUE ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today called on President Bush to engage the American people in real, meaningful dialogue on Social Security following the Bush Administration's two-month social security tour.  
 Later this morning, the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to begin its first hearings on the President's privatization plan. 
   Sen. Corzine's full statement follows: 
   "This weekend marks the end of the Bush Administration's '60-day, 60-city Social Security Tour,' a taxpayer-funded traveling troupe of scripted discussion and canned dialogue. 
   "President Bush and Vice President Cheney have traversed the nation - including two stops in New Jersey - to peddle a product no one wants to buy. Nearly sixty days and sixty cities later, the American people are still waiting for real dialogue on the future of Social Security. The truth is, the more Americans-and the more New Jerseyans-learn about the risks, complexities and ideology of the Bush Administration's privatization scheme, the less they like it. Why it took the President 60 days to figure this out is beyond me. 
   "On Sunday, the Bergen Record, a major newspaper in New Jersey, reported that less than one-third of people surveyed think privatizing Social Security is a good idea. The paper's headline was 'N.J. wants no part of Bush plan.' 
   "Hopefully, it won't take the President another 60 days to start a real dialogue on Social Security's future - a dialogue that truly addresses Social Security's solvency without risky privatization schemes."
