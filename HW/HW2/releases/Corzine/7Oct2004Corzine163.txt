SEN. CORZINE CRITICIZES CONGRESS' FAILURE TO PROTECT AGAINST DISASTERS AT CHEMICAL PLANTS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today issued the following statement about the likelihood that Congress will adjourn without establishing security standards for chemical plants: 
   "I am profoundly disappointed that Congress apparently will soon adjourn without addressing the serious threat of a chemical plant disaster. The lives of literally millions of people are at risk. Yet currently there are no federal standards for chemical plant security. That does not make sense, and there is no good excuse for Congress's inaction.
   "It would be hard to find a more egregious and outrageous example of special interests triumphing over the public interest. Unfortunately, the Bush Administration has been AWOL. Let us all hope we don't look back on this missed opportunity and ask ourselves 'why?'
   "I am not done with this issue. I will be reintroducing legislation in the next Congress, and will do all I can to protect the United States from this type of potential disaster."
   Senator Corzine introduced the Chemical Plant Security Act in 2001 and again in 2003. He recently tried to attach a related amendment to the Intelligence Reform bill that passed the Senate this week, but the amendment was blocked by a parliamentary maneuver. Also, in September, the senator offered an amendment to spend $75 million to help state and local communities prevent and respond to a chemical plant attack. The amendment was narrowly defeated.
