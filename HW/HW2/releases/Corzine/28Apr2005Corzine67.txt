SEN. CORZINE CALLS FOR SEVERE PUNISHMENT OF EMPLOYERS WHO VIOLATE SAFETY LAWS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today introduced legislation that would increase criminal penalties for employers who willfully violate work-place safety laws. Sen.  
 Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) are co-sponsors of the bill. The bill - the Workplace Wrongful Death Accountability Act - was introduced on Workers Memorial Day, a day which marks the anniversary of the establishment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and recognizes workers who were killed or injured on their jobs in the last year. It is similar to legislation Sen. Corzine introduced in the last session of the Congress. 
   Under current law, employers who violate safety laws are subject to fines and six months imprisonment. This bill would increase the maximum penalty to ten years. It would also increase from six months to two years the penalty for giving advance notice of a safety investigation, and would increase from six months to one year the penalty for intentionally misleading a safety investigator 
   "Causing the death of an employee on the job through willful violation of worker safety standards should not be treated as a trivial federal offense," Senator Corzine said. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, non-fatal injuries and illnesses in private industry totaled more than 4.3 million in 2003 and 5,575 people died in all sectors as a result of workplace injuries. 
   "In my view, employees have a fundamental right to a safe work environment, and more needs to be done to ensure that businesses that deliberately put the lives of their workers at risk are held accountable for their actions," Corzine said.
