SEN. CORZINE ACKNOWLDGES LOSS OF REP. MATSUI, FORMER REP. CHISHOLM
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) issued the following statement today on the passing of former Rep. and Presidential Candidate Shirley Chisholm and Rep.  
 Robert T. Matsui. 
   "This week, our nation suffered the loss of two of the finest Americans to grace the public stage in my life time. 
   "Congressman Matsui and I served together, and as a result of our passionate efforts to preserve and protect Social Security, and from leading our respective caucus's campaign efforts last tear, Bob and I became friends. Bob was a man of strong beliefs and principles and a tireless advocate for children, women, minorities, seniors and virtually every segment of society that too often has been left behind. I am saddened by his passing and my heart goes out to his family, friends and constituents. Those of us who knew Bob are richer for the experience, and the institution of Congress is poorer now that he is gone." 
   "Shirley Chisholm too was a woman of strong belief and character. I am deeply saddened by her death and my thoughts and prayers are with her family. When Shirley Chisholm was elected the first African-American woman to Congress in 1968 America was in the midst of dramatic change. Congresswoman Chisholm's refusal to be labeled or marginalized by what she called, 'a small group of old men' in Washington challenged the status quo and changed America for the better. Her barrier-breaking run for the 1972 Democratic Presidential nomination represented the best qualities of our democracy. Her unique friendships, bi-partisan style and staunch advocacy for the people she represented are a lesson to us all. She will be missed."
