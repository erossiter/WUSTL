SEN. CORZINE CONDEMNS ANTI-ISRAEL ACCUSATIONS BY SAUDI LEADER
  Sen.  
 Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today issued the following statement condemning accusations by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz that "Zionist hands" were responsible for recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. 
   "I am deeply disturbed by the Crown Prince's statement," said Senator Corzine. "Charges such as these are as inflammatory as they are unfounded. They contribute to anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiments, and undermine efforts to combat global terrorism."
