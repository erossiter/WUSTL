SEN. CORZINE CALLS FOR MORE DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS
  "Unfortunately, while our largest, most successful, public companies have a tremendous record of innovating, creating and optimizing the most efficient use of financial capital, they've yet to take full advantage of the vast pool of human capital in American society," said Sen. Corzine.  
   Corzine pointed to a number of statistics about women and minorities illustrating the need for diversity. He noted that women account for nearly half the nation's workforce and half of our college graduates but only 14 percent of the board seats of Fortune 1000 companies. He also pointed out that minorities make up 25 percent of the population but only 7 percent of those board seats. 
   "Diversity isn't just sound social policy. It's good business, smart economics, and ultimately will mean more money in the pockets of all Americans," said Corzine.
