SEN. CORZINE INTRODUCES TOUGHER RAIL SECURITY LEGISLATION
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today introduced legislation requiring stricter rail safety and security measures following several fatal and near-fatal train derailments and accidents this year alone. Sen. Corzine has consistently been the chief Senate advocate for tougher regulations since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack against the United States, repeatedly calling for tougher legislation related to rail security standards and procedures for transporting extremely hazardous materials.  
   "Efforts to secure chemical and nuclear facilities are inadequate if we don't secure the trains that transport these materials through American towns and cities," said Corzine. "This bill will make American families safer." 
   The Extremely Hazardous Material Rail Transport Safety Act of 2005 will implement several security measures aimed at enhancing rail car integrity and ultimately making Americans communities safer from hazardous materials transported on trains. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) introduced a similar measure in the House of Representatives. 
   "We cannot rely on luck as a substitute for keeping hazardous shipments secure," said Markey. "Across the country, enough chlorine to kill 100,000 people in half an hour is routinely contained in a single rail tanker car that rolls right through crowded urban centers without adequate security protections. The industry, with the encouragement of the Bush Administration, claims it can't afford to beef up security. The reality is that we can't afford not to." 
   Earlier this year, a freight car carrying toxic chlorine gas derailed in Graniteville, South Carolina. The collision was caused when a switch was accidentally left open and the 42 car train was diverted to the wrong track, where it collided with a parked train. The collision caused the train to derail and rupture. The South Carolina acident occurred on a line operated by Norfolk Southern, which operates about 900 miles of rail in New Jersey. 
   "The Granitesville accident exposes fundamental failings in the transport of hazardous materials on America's rail system," said Corzine. "Because of these failings, our nation's freight rail infrastructure remains vulnerable to the release of hazardous materials either by accident or due to deliberate attack." 
   Included in the Extremely Hazardous Material Rail Transport Safety Act of 2005 are measures that would: 
   * Establish a definition of "extremely hazardous material" to include materials that when released, as the result of an accident or terrorist attack, could lead to fatalities like those in Graniteville, South Carolina; 
   * Establish new safety standards for the physical condition of rail cars to ensure the safety and physical integrity of pressurized tank cars that are used to transport extremely hazardous materials; 
   * Establish a definition of "area of concern communities" where the transport of hazardous material through or near poses a specific risk to the public; 
   * Establish basic training requirements in the area of general safety, emergency preparedness and terrorism response for first responders, law enforcement and individuals involved in the shipping of hazardous material; 
   * Provide civil penalties for violations of rail security regulations and whistleblower protections for employees who report them.
