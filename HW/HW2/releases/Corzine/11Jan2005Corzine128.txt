FIRE GRANT AWARDED TO HOPE FIRE COMPANY #1 IN ALLENTOWN BOROUGH IN MONMOUTH COUNTY
  Sens. Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg announced today a $68,746 Federal Emergency Management Administration grant to the Hope Fire Company #1 in Monmouth County.  
 The grant is part of an on-going effort by the federal government to fund first responders. 
   "Providing local jurisdictions with the resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe is of the highest importance," said Senator Corzine. 
   More than $449 million was awarded to fire departments across the country in 2004. This includes $8,585,063 to New Jersey fire departments. 
   "This vital program supports departments by providing them with the tools and resources necessary to protect the health and safety of the public and firefighting personnel," said Senator Lautenberg. 
   According to Chief Brad Carter, the grant will be used to purchase between 10 and 15 new air packs that will bring the department up to current National Fire Protection Agency standards. 
   "This is a great thing for the department because we would have been unable to upgrade our equipment without the help of the federal government," Chief Carter said. 
   Fire grant money is awarded on a 90/10 basis. The federal government provides 90% of the funds, and the local jurisdiction contributes the remaining 10%.
