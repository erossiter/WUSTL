STATEMENT FROM SEN. CORZINE ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  President Reagan was a strong leader who would set a course of action and not waver, remaining true to his core beliefs and values. He had a great gift for putting people at ease, and what was always most apparent to me was his great love for his country. His life, rising from humble beginnings to ultimately leading our nation, stands as a powerful example of the extraordinary promise of the American Dream.
   Today is a sad day, and I extend my deepest condolences to Mrs. Reagan and the President's children and family.
