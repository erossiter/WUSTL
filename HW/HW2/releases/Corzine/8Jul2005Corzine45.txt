SEN. CORZINE FIGHTS FOR NEW JERSEY BASES AT BRAC HEARING
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) today led the New Jersey delegation in testifying before the Mid-Atlantic region's Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission hearing on the importance of Fort Monmouth to our national defense and homeland security. In his testimony before the commission, Corzine stressed the base's critical missions to develop new technologies designed to protect soldiers serving overseas.  
   "Closing Fort Monmouth is bad for New Jersey and bad for America. Fort Monmouth and each one of the six other military installations in New Jersey is a vital component of the current War on Terrorism and key to the future transformation of our armed services," said Senator Corzine. 
   In his testimony, Senator Corzine joined members of the New Jersey delegation in citing concerns over the BRAC process, including the lack of consideration given to the loss of intellectual capital that would inevitably follow closing the fort. 
   "Their scientific ingenuity, energy, innovation and excellence are second to none. We're proud that they are New Jerseyans, and we want to keep them home in New Jersey," he said. 
   Fort Monmouth, which develops communications technologies and other systems critical to our modern military infrastructure, is home to a large community of scientists and engineers; it is estimated that up to 80 percent of the workforce would not relocate if the base were closed and its mission relocated to Aberdeen in Maryland. 
   In May, several members of the commission expressed their concerns over Fort Monmouth's inclusion on the initial closure list, given the importance of the base to homeland security and the nature of the work being done onsite. Commissioner James Bilbray said in testimony that he disagreed with the decision, and Commissioner Phillip Coyle and Chairman Anthony Principi also expressed their reservations regarding the loss of highly trained personnel. 
   The BRAC hearing, which took place at Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland, allowed delegations from Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey to address the BRAC commission. 
   A fact sheet on Fort Monmouth is included. 
   Fort Monmouth is Vital to America and New Jersey 
   Fort Monmouth and all New Jersey bases have substantial mission capability and considerable impact on total force readiness, including joint-operations training and preparedness. Fort Monmouth's proximity to New York and Washington D.C. makes it strategically vital to protecting the United States in the ongoing War on Terror. The base is also home to an unparalleled community of engineers and scientists. 
   Fort Monmouth: An unparalleled workforce 
   Ft. Monmouth is home to a community of technologists and systems developers working to ensure that our capabilities are responsive to military needs and can be upgraded with the latest technology. 
   * Approximately 33% of the civilian workforce is made up of engineers and scientists. 
   * It is estimated that, if closed, the base would lose up to 80% of its highly qualified work force. 
   Fort Monmouth: Ready to expand and evolve 
   Fort Monmouth has the ability to accommodate new and greater force requirements. The surrounding community is also able to support added forces, missions and personnel. 
   * Base can accept an additional 3,000 personnel without construction, and has extensive acreage to construct more buildings if needed. 
   * Uses facilities and ranges at Lakehurst Naval Air Station, McGuire Air Force Base, and Fort Dix for field-testing and demonstrations. 
   * Surrounded by industrial giants such as AT&T, Lucent, Sarnoff, and Telecordia, as well as nationally recognized academic centers. 
   Fort Monmouth: Essential to Homeland Security 
   Fort Monmouth's close proximity to New York, only 30 miles, and accessibility by air and sea make it a natural location for homeland security activity. 
   * Fort Monmouth has already proven that it is a major force in homeland defense, deploying technologically advanced systems to aide search and rescue missions following the September 11th terrorist attacks. 
   * Miniaturized infrared cameras from the base were essential in the aftermath of September 11th; Fort Monmouth technology was used extensively to search wreckage and locate survivors and sources of heat. 
   Fort Monmouth: Important to New Jersey's economy 
   Fort Monmouth is the largest employer in Monmouth County, employing over 5,500 civilian and members of the military. 
   * Total payroll $842 million 
   * Supports 22,000 jobs statewide 
   * Total economic impact: $2.5 billion 
   Fort Monmouth: Essential to the War on Terror 
   Fort Monmouth's systems have played a direct role in helping our troops in the ongoing Global War on Terror. 
   * Firefinder Radar developed at the base helps our soldiers confront enemy threats quickly and efficiently. 
   * Jamming systems, including Shortstop Systems, cause enemy weapons to miss targets and detonate prematurely. 
   * Much of today's modern weaponry depends on software, electronics developed and supported at the base. 
   * Electronics developed at the base are crucial to the safe operation of advanced Army helicopters which continue to play a vital role in operations abroad.
