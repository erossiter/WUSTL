FIRE GRANT AWARDED TO NORTH BERGEN
  Sens. Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg announced today $318,039 in Federal Emergency Management Administration grant funding to the North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue Company located in North Bergen in Hudson County.  
 The grant is part of an on-going effort by the federal government to fund first responders. 
   "Providing local jurisdictions with the resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe is of the highest importance," said Senator Corzine. 
   More than $200 million has been awarded to fire departments across the country in 2004. This includes more than $3.4 million to New Jersey fire departments. 
   "This vital program supports departments by providing them with the tools and resources necessary to protect the health and safety of the public and firefighting personnel," said Senator Lautenberg. 
   According to Captain Jonathan Rush, the grant will be used to purchase 90 new self contained breathing apparatuses. "This equipment will make it much safer for our firefighters to operate," Captain Rush said. "Some of the features of this new equipment will allow us to better monitor our air supply. Furthermore, in this day and age of weapons of mass destruction, these bottles are C.B.R.N certified, which means they allow us to operate in chemical, biological or nuclear environments." 
   Fire grant money is awarded on a 90/10 basis. The federal government provides 90% of the funds, and the local jurisdiction contributes the remaining 10%.
