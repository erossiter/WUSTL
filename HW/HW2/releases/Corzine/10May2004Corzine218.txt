SEN. CORZINE SAYS BUCK STOPS WITH RUMSFELD
  Following the testimony of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the abuse of Iraqi detainees, Sen.  
 Jon S. Corzine said that while he was pleased that Rumsfeld had apologized for the abuse, the Secretary had not yet taken real responsibility for the full extent of the damage. He issued the following statement: 
   "While I am pleased that Secretary Rumsfeld apologized today, he has not yet taken real responsibility for the case or for its serious ramifications for our national security. Ultimately, the buck stops with the Secretary himself, for the conditions which contributed to the abuse, the mishandling of the case once internal reports were available, and the serious risks and setbacks we are currently suffering as a result of these failures. Our troops are at greater risk, our ability to stabilize Iraq has been undermined, and our nation's reputation has suffered incalculable damage. 
   "The abuse of Iraqi detainees is only the latest chapter in a long pattern of mismanagement, including misjudgments about the number of troops needed and the costs of the war, as well as an unplanned and confused approach to Iraq's political transition. The best way to send a message to the American people, the Iraqis and the rest of the world that we take these matters seriously and are truly changing direction is to appoint new leadership. It is in this total context that I continue to call for Secretary Rumsfeld's resignation."
