SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PAY-TO-PLAY
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) released the following statement regarding legislation which has been intrduced in the House and Senate in reaction to the Federal Highway Adminstration's interference with New Jersey's pay-to-play law.  
 The legislation would allow states to ban political donors from landing transportation contracts, an issue that temporarily blocked the distribution of federal aid to the state. Reps. William J. Pascrell Jr. (D-NJ) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) have introduced the legislation in the House and Senator Corzine is joining Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) in introducing the legislation in the Senate. 
   The Federal Highway Administration New Jersey's law unfairly blocks competition for contracts and withheld more than $250 million in aid to New Jersey. Last week, Gov. Richard J. Codey issued an executive order loosening the rules on highway contractors so the state could receive critical federal highway funds. 
   "The federal government should not stand in the way of efforts in New Jersey to have the highest ethical standards possible," said Corzine. "Limiting the influence of campaign contributions should not disqualify New Jersey from receiving much needed highway funds. It is nonsensical to suggest that New Jersey can't clean up its campaign finance laws without interference from the federal highway administration. I'm hopeful that we can get this legislation enacted to keep the federal government out of an area of New Jersey policy where it had no business intervening in the first place."
