SENATORS CALL ON KARL ROVE TO RETRACT HURTFUL PARTISAN REMARKS ON 9/11 VICTIMS
  New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut home state senators called on chief White House Advisor Karl Rove to retract his divisive partisan comments that exploited the memories of the 9/11 victims at a conservative fundraiser.  
   A letter signed by New Jersey senators Jon Corzine and Frank Lautenberg, New York senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Connecticut senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman asks Rove to retract his comment last night that "liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers." 
   The letter further reads, "Your comments were inaccurate and inflammatory. To come into the heart of New York City, which has suffered so deeply and is still recovering from those savage attacks, to try to score partisan, political points at the expense of the 3,000 victims and their families was unacceptable and opportunistic. It was a slap in the face to the unity that America achieved after September 11, 2001. The tragic events of 9/11 have not been, and should never be, used for partisan purposes. 
   "The attacks of 9/11 united our states and our country like no other singular event in this generation. Republicans and Democrats - indeed all Americans - were united in a determined and passionate belief that we must put an end to terrorism and to those who would do our nation harm. When the terrorists who planned these attacks were identified, we all came together to quickly and overwhelmingly authorize your Administration to seek those terrorists out and to destroy them where they hid."
