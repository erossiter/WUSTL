SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON HARRIET MIERS
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today released the following statement regarding Harriet Miers' withdrawal of her nomination to the Supreme Court:  
   "My dealings with Harriet Miers have always been professional and courteous. She has been a dedicated public servant and I look forward to working with her in the future. 
   "While I respect Ms. Miers' decision to withdraw her name from consideration, I fear this episode demonstrates that the White House is beholden to the extreme right wing of the Republican Party, which seeks to pack the Supreme Court with radical conservatives. 
   "President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers exposed a deep rift between mainstream America and the conservative base of the Republican Party, who would not even allow Ms. Miers a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee before they disavowed and eventually derailed her nomination. 
   "In replacing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate voice on the High Court, President Bush must not use the Miers' withdrawal as a chance to appease his conservative base. He ought to choose a judge for Justice O'Connor's seat that will respect established precedent and the fundamental constitutional rights of all Americans. 
   "He must select a nominee that all Americans will respect; one who will protect the right to privacy, a woman's right to choose, civil liberties and rights, and one who will respect the importance of precedent and settled law."
