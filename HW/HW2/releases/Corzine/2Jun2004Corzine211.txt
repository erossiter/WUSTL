SEN. CORZINE HONORS D-DAY VETERANS ON 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INVASION
 Sen. Jon S. Corzine today recognized the 60th Anniversary of the historic D-Day invasion of Normandy by entering a statement in the Congressional Record which honors the courageous members of our armed forces who participated in that decisive battle.  
   "The invasion known as Operation Overlord was to become the largest air, land and sea operation any military force had ever undertaken," Senator Corzine said in his statement. "Moving and fighting under stormy skies, the invasion force, led by the United States, Great Britain and Canada, and including Free French and Free Polish units, consisted of over 1 million service personnel. 
   "The dangers were grave, and the stakes almost incalculable. Our troops' skill and determination won our nation a world-changing success, a military victory which today remains a keystone of the liberties and security Americans and their partners still enjoy," he said. 
   "The soldiers who fought their way ashore in Normandy and the soldiers who were dropped behind enemy lines under heavy fire demonstrated unsurpassed tenacity and valor. Their superb performance and their sacrifices in the cause of freedom and democracy will always be remembered and appreciated by a grateful nation. May our D-Day veterans' memory and deeds be a constant reminder of Americans' courage, resolve and devotion to duty in World War II."
