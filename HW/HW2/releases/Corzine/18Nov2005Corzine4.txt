SEN. CORZINE COMMENTS ON REPUBLICAN REFUSAL TO HONOR BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) this evening released the below statement on Republican refusal to consider his joint resolution with Sen.  
 Frank R Lautenberg to honor New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen's contribution to American culture. Specifically, Corzine and Lautenberg's resolution was introduced to congratulate New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen on the 30th anniversary of his masterpiece record album Born to Run, and to commend him on a career that has touched the lives of millions of Americans. 
   "Apparently, for Republicans in the Senate, Bruce Springsteen's best was not good enough," said Sen. Jon Corzine. "No matter what Republicans say, Bruce Springsteen is more than just a lucky man who was born in the U.S.A. Frank Lautenberg and I, and people across this country, appreciate his contributions to American culture; we'll never surrender looking for ways to honor our local hero who made it big in this land of hope and dreams."
