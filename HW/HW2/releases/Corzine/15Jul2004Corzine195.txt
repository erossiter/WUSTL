NEW JERSEY SENATORS CALL ON PRESIDENT TO QUICKLY DECLARE ?DISASTER AREA' TO REGION HIT HARD BY STORMS
  In a letter sent today, New Jersey Sens.  
 Frank R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine called on President Bush to quickly approve Gov. McGreevey's request for federal disaster relief for parts of Burlington and Camden Counties hit hard by heavy rains and flooding earlier this week.
   "We are writing to urge your swift review and approval of Governor McGreevey's request that you declare a major disaster for New Jersey as a result of the devastating storms and flooding that has hit parts of Burlington and Camden Counties," the lawmakers wrote in their letter to the President. 
   A mix of rural, agricultural, suburban and historic communities were hit hard by what the National Weather Service classified as a "1,000 year storm." More than 13 inches of rain fell in a brief period, causing dams to burst, roadways and bridges to collapse, massive flooding and enormous destruction to homes and businesses. More than 230 families had to be evacuated since the storms began on Monday. Currently, more than a dozen roads and bridges remain closed. 
   "We know that the rebuilding of these areas and of people's lives will take a long time. Southern New Jersey has not seen devastation like this in over half a century. So we urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to immediately establish Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the area so that our constituents can quickly get the answers and assistance they need," stated Lautenberg and Corzine.
