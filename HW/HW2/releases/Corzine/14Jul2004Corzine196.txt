SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEC VOTE TO REQUIRE HEDGE FUNDS TO REGISTER WITH THE COMMISSION
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine made the following statement following the 3-2 vote of the Securities and Exchange Commission to require hedge funds to register with the commission:  
   "I applaud the leadership of Chairman Donaldson and today's vote by the Securities and Exchange Commission in favor of rules that would require hedge funds to register with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act. 
   "While hedge funds have provided innumerable benefits to our economy and have been a vital source of liquidity to our capital markets the explosive growth of the industry, in terms of the number of advisers and the assets they manage (currently $800 billion), coupled with the opaque nature under which most hedge funds operate, poses a risk to investors and our markets that frankly can no longer be ignored. 
   "If adopted, these rules will improve the public transparency, accounting and record-keeping, and regulatory scrutiny of hedge funds in the interest of investor protection, market stability and the prevention of fraud and abuse. Each of these objectives are part of the SEC's mission, and they should be commended for their efforts in that pursuit as demonstrated by today's vote."
