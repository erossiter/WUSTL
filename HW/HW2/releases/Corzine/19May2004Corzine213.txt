GAO FINDS BUSH ADMINISTRATION MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR MEDICARE TV
 The General Accounting Office issued a report today that concluded that the Bush administration misappropriated funds to produce video news releases designed to inform the public about the new Medicare prescription drug law.  
   The GAO, in a report that had been requested by a number of senators, including New Jersey Senators Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg, said video news releases that were produced in connection with the changes in the Medicare law violated restrictions built into a 2003 appropriations act that were related to publicity campaigns. 
   The GAO concluded there was no available appropriation for the media campaign. 
   "This is just one more instance in which the administration has turned an effort to reform Medicare into a disaster," Senator Corzine said. "Our goal was to create a meaningful and worthy prescription drug program for senior citizens through Medicare. Instead, we got a program that only a private insurance company can love, we were mislead by the administration about the true cost of the new Medicare bill, and we get propaganda from the administration that was improperly funded. 
   "We need to go back and set things right," the senator added. "We need to create a Medicare prescription drug plan that will help seniors, not confuse them."
