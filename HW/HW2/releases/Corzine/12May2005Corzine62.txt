SEN. CORZINE BLASTS BUSH SCHEME TO REDUCE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FOR WIDOWS, CHILDREN
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today responded to the newly released details of President Bush's Social Security privatization plan.  
 According to Bush economic advisor Allan Hubbard and other administration officials, the president's privatization scheme would cut benefits not only for retirees, but also for survivors. These cuts would apply to 70 percent of families who lose a loved one. 
   "I am outraged that the Administration would propose cutting benefits to widows and orphans. In my home state of New Jersey, over 127,000 widows and widowers and over 50,000 children received Social Security benefits as survivors in 2003. We have a duty to these families," said Corzine. "The American people rely on Social Security, especially during tough times when they've lost a spouse or parent. The Federal government should not short change struggling families at their very time of need." 
   The benefit cut for survivors is just another example of how the burden of President Bush's scheme would fall disproportionately on the backs of average, middle-income workers. In high cost-of-living states like New Jersey, many of the people counted as "middle-" or "high-income" by the Bush plan are in fact far from rich. 
   "New Jerseyans want nothing to do with this privatization scheme, and with every detail released that sentiment grows even stronger," said Corzine. "We need a real, honest dialogue on Social Security - and solutions that won't break Social Security's promise to the American people."
