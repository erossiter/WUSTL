SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH SPEECH MARKING FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) tonight released the following statement regarding President George W. Bush's remarks in Fort Bragg, NC.  
 Bush's speech marked the first anniversary of Iraqi sovereignty after the American-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in the spring of 2003. 
   "The president failed to give the American people and our troops the specific plan for success they deserve. He appropriately offered a more sober assessment of the war than Vice President Cheney and others in his Administration. But he provided no new information about how the insurgency will be defeated, how many U.S. troops will eventually be deployed or how much it will cost. 
   "We must prevail. Contrary to what the Administration told us before the war, Iraq was not a central front in the War on Terrorism. But it is now. The president has much more work to do to overcome the concerns of the American people. We need a realistic but clear plan, including measurable benchmarks with regard to Iraqi political progress, the training of Iraqi troops and Iraq's economic reconstruction. And most importantly, we need assurances that our troops have all the equipment and resources they need."
