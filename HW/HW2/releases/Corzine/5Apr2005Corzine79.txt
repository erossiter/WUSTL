SEN. CORZINE TO GIVE KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FORUM ON 'GENOCIDE IN THE 21ST CENTURY: REMEMBERING RWANDA, CONFRONTING DARFUR'
  This week, as the world commemorates the 11th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, we are reminded that 'never again' has become 'once again' in Darfur, Sudan where nearly 300,000 people have died and almost 2 million have been displaced in a brutal campaign by the Sudanese government. With the memory of Rwanda still with us, and with acknowledgments from the Bush administration and Congress that genocide is occurring, Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) will continue his rallying cry for bold action to the current atrocities in Darfur.  
   Today at 9 a.m. in Washington D.C., Sen. Corzine will be the keynote speaker at the Center for American Progress forum entitled, Genocide in the 21st Century: Remembering Rwanda, Confronting Darfur. Joining Corzine will be Dr. Zac Nsenga, Rwandan Ambassador to the United States and Gayle Smith, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.

   Background on Corzine Efforts to Stop the Genocide in Darfur 
   Senator Corzine has led the fight in the Senate to stop the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Last July, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Corzine and Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS), declaring that the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan are genocide and calling on the President to lead an international effort to rescue the hundreds of thousands of lives at risk. Later that summer, Corzine visited Darfur to witness the crisis firsthand and to find practical solutions to stopping the genocide. In September, the Senate passed a resolution by Corzine and Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) to provide $75 million to assist peacekeepers from the African Union. 
   Moreover, Corzine was an early leader in drawing attention to the crisis in Darfur. On June 24, 2004, he joined with Brownback, Congressman Donald Payne (D-NJ), a Holocaust survivor, and a member of the Darfur community in exile at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to bear witness to the genocide. 
   Last month, Corzine and Brownback introduced the Darfur Accountability Act, which provides the tools and authorities to end the genocide currently occurring in Darfur, Sudan. The bipartisan legislation - which now has 22 co-sponsors - calls for U.S. and international action to confront the crisis. It includes a battery of measures aimed at ending the Darfur genocide, restoring normalcy to life for hundreds of thousands of displaced Muslims and for the criminal prosecution of those responsible for these crimes against humanity. 
   Specifically, the bill seeks: 
   * An extension of the current arms embargo to cover the Government of Sudan; 
   * A military non-fly zone in Darfur; 
   * The freezing of assets and denial of visas to those responsible for genocide, crimes and humanity, and war crimes; 
   * Accelerated assistance to the African Union mission; 
   * Concerted U.S. diplomacy to achieve an effective UN Security Council resolution; 
   * A new UN Security Council resolution with sanctions; and 
   * A Presidential Envoy for Sudan. 
   An estimated 300,000 people have died in Darfur as a result of policies by the Government of Sudan and attacks by government-backed militias. These killings are ethnically based, targeting the Zaghawa, Masalit, Fur and other African tribes. Nearly two million Muslim civilians of African descent have been displaced by the attacks and are living in refugee camps in Darfur or in neighboring Chad.
