SEN. CORZINE: NEW UNION SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR ACTION ON CHEMICAL SECURITY BILL
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) said today a new survey by a chemical workers union reinforced the critical need to establish security standards at chemical facilities throughout the nation.  
 The senator, the author of the Chemical Security Act which would require the Department of Homeland Security to enact uniform security standards for chemical plants, said the survey confirmed the vulnerability of plants to potential terrorist attacks. 
   The survey, released today by the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical & Energy Workers (PACE) International Union, found that almost half of workers surveyed at high-risk plants where hazardous materials are present believe that their facility is inadequately prepared to handle a catastrophic terrorist attack. 
   "This new survey reinforces the critical need to establish security standards for chemical plants," Senator Corzine said. "A single terrorist attack against a chemical facility could endanger millions of people. Yet almost half of workers at vulnerable plants believe that their company's preparations for a possible attack are ineffective. That is deeply disturbing." 
   "Currently, there are no federal security standards for chemical plants. That needs to change," Corzine added ."There's just no excuse for continued inaction. We need to act now, before disaster strikes."
