SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO BE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE
  Condoleezza Rice is an honorable and experienced person.  
 That said, she has stood with the president and an administration that has chosen to end 50 years of bipartisan consensus on foreign policy replacing it with an ideologically-driven, go-it-alone approach: an approach that has cost the nation dearly in lives and a treasured reputation. The United States needs a pragmatic, effective foreign policy that strengthens our alliances, develop global strategies for winning the war on terrorism, halt nuclear proliferation in places such as Iran and North Korea, and deliver a real exit strategy for Iraq. The next Secretary of State must also address global problems such as HIV-AIDS and climate change and confront immediately the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. The administration has a lot to answer for, and I look forward to Dr. Rice's confirmation hearings to discuss these issues.
