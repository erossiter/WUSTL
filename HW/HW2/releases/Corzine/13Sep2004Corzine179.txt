SEN. CORZINE ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR COLLEGES TO REDUCE VIOLENT CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today announced a federal grant totaling $400,181 to reduce violent crimes against women on college campuses. Seton Hall University in South Orange will serve as the lead institution and administer the grant funds and coordinate grant activities for this project, which is formally known as the Grant to Reduce Violent Crimes Against Women on Campus Program. Other universities involved are New Jersey City University in Jersey City, New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, William Paterson University in Wayne, and Ramapo College in Mahwah.  
   The Grants to Reduce Violent Crimes Against Women on Campus Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice. The program is designed to encourage institutions of higher education to adopt comprehensive, coordinated responses to violent crimes against women on campuses, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence, and dating violence. 
   "In order for students to learn they deserve a safe environment," Senator Corzine said. "This program will enable five New Jersey universities to work together to protect women on their campuses." 
   Many campuses are addressing the issue of violent crimes against women by developing campus-based victim services and coordinating the responses of campus law enforcement, health services, housing authorities, administrators, student organizations, and disciplinary boards to attacks against women. A coordinated community response, in cooperation with municipal police and prosecutors, is vital to protecting women and holding offenders accountable. 
   Dr. Gail Pakalns, Director of Health/Counseling Services at Seton Hall University and Principal Investigator for the Consortium Violence Prevention Project said, "Seton Hall University is excited to be the lead institution in this consortium project to prevent violence against our female college students. As part of the project, we will create educational DVDs for incoming freshmen and hold expert training sessions on our campuses in partnership with law enforcement and community agencies. Together we can make a difference!" 
   Each of the five schools will use grant funds to: 
   * Train campus security personnel, local police, campus judicial board personnel, campus administrators, and student leaders to better understand policies and procedures so that reported incidents are dealt with in an effective and coordinated manner. 
   * Develop a mandatory education and prevention program for all incoming first year students so that the students can help create campus cultures that are intolerant of violence and appropriately responsive to a victim's needs. 
   * Develop a coordinated campus-community response to violence against women. 
   * Create a consortium steering committee which will coordinate efforts between campuses in the implementation of this grant project.
