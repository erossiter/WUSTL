SEN. CORZINE: BUSH TERROR SPEECH MISSING 'CRITICAL ISSUES'
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today called on President Bush to offer more details on the continuing War on Terror, specifically asking how the President would address the perilous crisis in Darfur, as well as plans for neutralizing the threats posed by North Korea and Iran. 
   Bush delivered a speech on the War on Terror earlier today at the National Defense University on the Ft. McNair military base. Corzine is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and previously served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Sen. Corzine's full statement regarding President Bush's speech is as follows: 
   "President Bush delivered a good speech on democracy today, although there was one glaring omission: Darfur. If there is country where our values and our national security interests coincide, it is Sudan, where Osama bin Laden was once harbored and where the government is now engaged in genocide. 
   "The President also omitted many critical issues related to our national security. He did not mention North Korea's nuclear program, black market nuclear proliferation, or the unsecured nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. He left our strategy for stopping Iran's nuclear program unclear. And he did not mention the two great, unfinished reform projects we must complete if we are to be safer: reform of our intelligence capabilities, and the protection of our biggest homeland security vulnerabilities."
