SENS. LAUTENBERG, CORZINE CALL ON USDOT TO IMMEDIATELY AUTHORIZE ALL FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS FOR NEW JERSEY
  In a letter sent today to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, New Jersey Sens. Frank. R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine expressed their serious concerns over the Bush administration's decision to hold up vital transportation infrastructure funds, and called on Secretary Norm Mineta to take the steps necessary to provide the $350 million allocated by Congress for New Jersey.  
   "New Jersey's transportation infrastructure is vital to millions of travelers and the entire East Coast economy. Every day that new safety, maintenance, and capacity initiatives are delayed means travelers and the flow of commerce throughout the region face needless risks. In short, the Administration's actions could have lasting negative impacts on the entire region....Furthermore, it seems to us that any efforts to improve the integrity of the contracting process can only protect the notion of fair competition, not injure it," the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Secretary Mineta. 
   The Bush administration has taken the position that New Jersey's recent reforms in its contracting processes, known as 'pay-to-play' reforms, are inconsistent with federal law. Specifically, the Administration claims that this effort to restore the integrity of the competitive bidding process actually limits competition by shrinking the pool of qualified bidders. 
   In separate action to shake lose the federal highway funds for a number of important ongoing infrastructure projects in the state, Lautenberg last week spoke with the head of the Federal Highway Administration, Mary E. Peters, who explained that Secretary Mineta alone retains the authority to approve the authorization of the $350 million in federal funds set aside for New Jersey.
