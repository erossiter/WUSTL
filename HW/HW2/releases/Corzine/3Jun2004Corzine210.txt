AS TENET RESIGNS, SEN. CORZINE CALLS FOR FULL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR INTELLIGENCE FAILURES
  With the resignation of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, Sen.  
 Jon S. Corzine today called for full accountability for intelligence failures. 
   "Director Tenet's resignation today is a reminder of a long pattern of intelligence failures, from September 11th to the purported threat from Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and links to al Qaeda. It is not, however, an excuse for a less than thorough examination of every aspect of these failures or for shielding other responsible parties from accountability," Senator Corzine said. 
   "We are currently fighting a war that was justified to the American people as necessary to confront a dire and imminent threat. Director Tenet's resignation does not bring us any closer to knowing why the Administration's intelligence assessments were so off the mark. Nor does it provide us with any understanding of the role of other Administration officials, including those at the Department of Defense, the Office of the Vice President, and the White House, in formulating and disseminating those assessments. Unless we develop a full picture of how we went to war in Iraq, we cannot be sure that we are directing our national security resources, and deploying our men and women in uniform, toward confronting the most serious threats we face," the senator said.
