FIRE GRANT AWARDED TO MORRISTOWN
  Sens. Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg announced today $196,380 in Federal Emergency Management Administration grant funding to the Morristown Fire Department in Morris County.  
 The grant is part of an on-going effort by the federal government to fund first responders.
   "Providing local jurisdictions with the resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe is of the highest importance," said Senator Corzine. 
   More than $100 million has been awarded to fire departments across the country in 2004. This includes more than $1.5 million to New Jersey fire departments. 
   "This vital program supports departments by providing them with the tools and resources necessary to protect the health and safety of the public and firefighting personnel," said Senator Lautenberg. 
   According the Chief David Barter, the Morristown Fire Department will use the grant to purchase 35 new air packs that will replace ones that are 15 years old. In addition, the funds will be used to buy a new breathing air compressor and an oxygen cascade system which is used to fill oxygen bottles. 
   "We're extremely excited to be awarded this grant," Chief Barter said. "We're looking forward to upgrading our equipment to provide a better safety margin for our firefighters," he added. 
   Fire grant money is awarded on a 90/10 basis. The federal government provides 90% of the funds, and the local jurisdiction contributes the remaining 10%.
