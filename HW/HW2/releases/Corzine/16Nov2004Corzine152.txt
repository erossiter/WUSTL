SEN. CORZINE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL
  "Secretary Powell served our country with enormous distinction, promoting multi-lateral approaches in an administration satisfied with isolation.  
 He performed his duties as a good solider and represented our nation with class. He was often the sole voice of reason on a foreign policy team dominated by hard-liners who rejected the Powell Doctrine - the use of overwhelming force and a clear mission. He brought his vast experience and stature to bear on otherwise neglected issues such as genocide in the Sudan. It is unfortunate that he sometimes was a spokesman and defender of faulty intelligence analysis and policy miscalculations.
   As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to President Bush's nomination of a new Secretary of State. The United States needs a Secretary of State who is experienced, broad-minded and pragmatic and who understands the importance of alliances and thoughtful analysis to our national security."
