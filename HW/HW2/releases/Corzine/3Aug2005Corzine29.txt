SEN. CORZINE ANNOUNCES $226,428 GRANT TO HELP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today announced a $226,428 U.S. Department of Justice Grant for the City of New Brunswick.  
 The grant is the second award allocated to the Domestic Violence Response Team in the Office of Domestic Violence within the New Brunswick Police Department. The Department received a prior grant for $202,596 in 2003. Each grant runs for two years. 
   The New Brunswick Domestic Violence Response Team is composed of 15 volunteer community members. The team's goal is to ease the trauma of women who are victims of domestic violence. In the instance a domestic violence situation is reported to the police dispatcher during the hours when Family Court is not in session, a team member is subsequently contacted and will meet the victim at police headquarters. The team member helps console the victim, offers a friendly ear and provides referrals for counseling and further assistance. 
   "Domestic violence is, unfortunately, a reality of life for many women," Senator Corzine said. "Fortunately, this important program goes a long way in alleviating the pain and suffering of women who are trapped in a cycle of violence." 
   The federal funds help defray the cost of training, cell phones, pagers and other support that is essential to the operation of the Domestic Violence Response Team. 
   "New Brunswick is fortunate to receive this two-year grant to continue the success of our Domestic Violence Response Team. Through the assistance of Senator Corzine, the funding from this grant is a critical component in directly assisting the victims of domestic violence," said New Brunswick Mayor James M. Cahill.
