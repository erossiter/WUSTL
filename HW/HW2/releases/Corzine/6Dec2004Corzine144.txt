SEN. CORZINE COMMENTS ON DEAL TO PASS INTELLIGENCE BILL
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ), who was appointed to the Senate Intelligence Committee for the 109th Congress today, released the following statement on the deal reached today between congressional negotiators to pass the intelligence reforms proposed by the 9/11 Commission.  
   "Today's agreement to pass the 9/11 bill, while long overdue, is welcome news to the 9/11 families who have fought so hard for these reforms and to a nation which is the primary target in this age of international terror," said Corzine. "I have been in frequent contact with the 9/11 families in the past several weeks and I can tell you without their passion, persistence and vigilance we would have not reached this point. The 9/11 families have literally and selflessly turned tragedy into triumph. These reforms, once implemented, will be vital in ensuring that our intelligence community successfully coordinates its efforts to foil terrorist plots before more American lives are lost. 
   "While these reforms are important, they are no silver bullet to ensuring that the turf wars and bureaucratic intransigence which made us vulnerable in the first place comes to an end. Increased congressional oversight of the intelligence community is the key ingredient to making sure these reforms are successfully implemented. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee beginning next year, I will be watching closely and asking a lot of questions to make sure that every facet of our intelligence community is working to meet the letter and spirit of these reforms and working overtime to keep America safe from terror."
