SEN. CORZINE SAYS NEW CBO REPORT SHOWS SOCIAL SECURITY STRONG FOR DECADES
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine today issued the following statement in response to a new report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on the outlook for Social Security:  
   "CBO's new report is good news for Social Security and bad news for those who would privatize the program. Contrary to privatizers' repeated claims, Social Security is not in crisis, and will be solvent for many decades. 
   "The Federal government faces real fiscal challenges, but there is no excuse to make deep cuts in guaranteed benefits, as President Bush's Social Security Commission proposed. Privatizing the program would take the security out of Social Security. That would be wrong, and it would break our promise to millions of working Americans who are contributing to the system in good faith." 
   The new CBO report found that the 75 year shortfall in the Social Security Trust Fund is only 1.00 percent of taxable payroll. The CBO findings contradict an earlier projection by the Social Security's trustees that the shortfall is 1.86 of taxable payroll. According to CBO, the Social Security Trust Fund is likely to remain solvent until 2052, ten years later than projected by the trustees.
