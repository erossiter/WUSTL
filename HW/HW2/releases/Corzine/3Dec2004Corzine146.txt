SEN. CORZINE SAYS 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF BHOPAL GAS LEAK HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR CHEMICAL PLANT SECURITY STANDARDS IN AGE OF TERROR
  Sen. Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) said that today's 20th anniversary of a devastating gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India is a reminder that chemical plant safety and security standards must be improved in the age of terrorism. Corzine is the author of the Chemical Security Act which would require the Department of Homeland Security to enact uniform security standards for chemical plants.  
   "Twenty years ago today a disgruntled employee of a pesticide plant in India tried to sabotage a batch of gas and wound up killing nearly 4,000 people," Corzine said. "Imagine how many millions of people a determined terrorist could kill or harm with a single catastrophic attack on one of our nation's thousands of chemical plants. Today's anniversary of the Bhopal tragedy is but another reminder of why chemical plant security must be one of the highest priorities of our government in protecting our Homeland. Currently, there are no federal security standards for chemical plants. That must change. There's just no excuse for continued inaction. We need to act now, before disaster strikes the U.S. and makes what happened in Bhopal small by comparison." 
   On December 3, 1984 a toxic cloud of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas enveloped the homes surrounding the plant in Bhopal. Residents in Bhopal and surrounding communities awoke gagging, coughing and rubbing their eyes. Four months after the leak more than fourteen hundred people had died as a result of the tragedy and by 1991 the count was updated to 3,800. Eleven thousand were struck with disabilities as a result of the gas leak. The gas formed as a result of a disgruntled plant employee who added water to a storage tank in an apparent attempt to spoil a batch of methyl isocyanate.
