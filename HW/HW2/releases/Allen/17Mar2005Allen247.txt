SEN. ALLEN VOICES SUPPORT FOR SCHIAVO BILL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that he will support the Incapacitated Person's Legal Protection Act of 2005 which would extend habeas corpus rights to individuals who are incapacitated.  
 The bill, sponsored by Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL), was drafted in response to the case of Terri Schiavo, an incapacitated Florida woman who is set be starved to death by court order on Friday. 
   Senator Allen released the following statement today: 
   "In this situation, when I see the video tapes of Terri Schiavo, it is clear she is conscious and has feelings. I realize this is an extraordinary measure to properly protect Terri. I have spoken with her brother and Senator Martinez and when this bill comes before me, I will vote for it." 
   "I believe in the sanctity of human life. I cannot in good conscience sit by and let this innocent woman be starved to death. Just because she has lost the ability to audibly communicate, doesn't mean she has lost her desire or right to live. When in doubt, it is appropriate and logical to presume that people want to live." 
   "For similar situations that may arise in the future, the very best and appropriate solution would be for the people in the States to move their Governor and legislature to adopt strong guardian ad litem laws to afford an incapacitated person such as Terri Schiavo to be represented by an independent attorney."
