SEN. ALLEN LAUDS ADOPTION OF AMENDMENT TO INCREASE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR NATIONAL GUARD, RESERVES, FAMILIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) lauded passage today of an amendment that he co-sponsored to increase members of the Reserves and National Guard who are eligible for military health (TRICARE) benefits. The amendment, lead by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), passed by a 75-25 vote as part of the Defense Reauthorization Act. 
   "I believe that the federal government should find reasonable ways to improve benefits to our members of the National Guard and Reserves. Health insurance is an important benefit for Guard and Reserves families. As we prosecute the War on Terror, the men and women in the National Guard and Reserves are being called on more frequently to help protect our freedoms around the world. Often, this service comes at a great financial and emotional cost to these brave soldiers and their families. This reasonable benefit will help address the concerns of our troops in the Reserves and National Guard by expanding eligibility for health care coverage and assisting in recruitment and retention as these men and women are called up for longer and more frequent tours," Allen said.
   This health benefit will expand TRICARE services to members of the Guard and Reserves who are on inactive status. Currently, only members who are called to active duty are eligible for TRICARE. The amendment would also expand access to TRICARE to the member's family. Also, it allows a service member to keep their private insurance when "called up" with payments made by the Defense Department of the same amount as if the member was covered by TRICARE.
   "In passing legislation such as this, we as a nation can show our appreciation for all that our Reservists and Guardsmen are doing to defend the ideals of liberty and freedom," Allen concluded.
