SEN. ALLEN REQUESTS FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR BRISTOL EMPLOYEES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) has contacted the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, Elaine Chao, to request federal assistance for the 290 employees of Bristol Compressors, who are recently laid off at the company's plant in Bristol, Virginia. Sen.  
 Allen's request references the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance which provides job training and education programs.
   "I want to get this federal assistance to these hard-working Virginians as soon as possible so that they can get the training necessary to find new jobs and provide for themselves and their families. I'm committed to doing everything possible under this program for the fine workers of Bristol Compressors who lost their jobs through no fault of their own and deserve our help," Senator Allen said.
   Price increases in the costs of steel, copper and utilities, have impacted the company's ability to align its cost structure and remain competitive. Employees will receive severance pay commensurate with service time with the company. Bristol Compressors has also made a commitment to offer laid off employees jobs as they come available in the future. 
   Bristol Compressors provides compressors to original equipment manufacturers and wholesale distributors in 6 continents and over 50 countries around the world. Bristol, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., employs approximately 1,650 employees in Bristol, Va.
