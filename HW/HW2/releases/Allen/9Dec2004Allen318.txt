SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $4.2 MILLION AWARDED TO HELP BUILD MEDICAL HEALTH CLINIC IN ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Office has awarded a Community Facility Direct Loan in the amount of $4,259,000 to the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board to help them build and renovate a Medical Health Clinic.  
   "These federal funds will allow the folks in Rockbridge County to offer better medical services to the community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to help improve the quality of life for Virginians." 
   This project will consolidate 6 of the 15 service sites into one site saving operational costs and allow them to become more efficient. The Medical Health Clinic will provide clinical services, mental retardation services, medical support services, continuing care and crisis intervention, medical records storage and administrative services. The goal is to provide clients with a facility where everything they need is located in one place. 
   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, childcare, hospitals, medical clinics, assisted living facilities, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, public buildings and transportation. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
