Senator Warner and I view our recommendation of persons to serve as Federal judges as one of the most important responsibilities we undertake. After interviewing several candidates and evaluating their credentials Senator Warner and I were confident in our recommendation of Liam O'Grady to serve on the Eastern District Court. Liam will bring nearly three decades of legal experience to the bench. I have great faith in this nominee and as my colleagues examine his record I am sure they will join me in supporting his nomination to the federal bench."
