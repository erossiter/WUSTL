SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEAD START PROJECTS IN ALEXANDRIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded two grants to organizations in Alexandria, VA for the continuation of their work with children and parents involved with the Head Start program.  
 Campagna Center, Inc received $486,552 for their Early Head Start program and the Alexandria City Office of Economic Opportunity received $1,294,943 for their Head Start program. 
   "These groups in Alexandria are making a significant impact on families in their area through the Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life." 
   More specifically, this grant will allow these two organizations to continue their comprehensive child-focused development programs that are designed to serve the children of low-income families. In all its programs, Head Start focuses on incorporating parents, community and students as partners in education.
