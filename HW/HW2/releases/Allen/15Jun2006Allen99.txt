SEN. ALLEN APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) joined other members of Congress today as President Bush signed the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act into law. Sen. Allen was an original co-sponsor of the legislation which will impose stiffer penalties on those broadcasters that air programming that is indecent. The new law signed by President Bush today raises the maximum penalty on broadcasters to $325,000, a tenfold increase over the previous $32,500. 
  "The First Amendment is very important but also has standards and those standards have been violated. As parents and grandparents, we need to make sure that our children are watching television shows that do not have inappropriate content for their eyes and ears," said Senator Allen.
  In the past six years, the number of indecency complaints reported to the Federal Communications Commission has risen dramatically. Children are most likely to watch television during the 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM time slot. The amount of profanity reported during that hour on television has risen 95% according to one study. Some broadcasters have been applauded for recently developing more ways for parents to make good decisions about the programs their children are viewing. Still, broadcasters shoulder the responsibility of keeping the airways free of indecent material, especially during the hours that children are most likely to be watching.
  "I speak as a parent trying to make sure our children are watching the right television shows, and not watching inappropriate programming," said Senator Allen. "There are standards, but those standards have been violated from time to time. When standards are violated, we need appropriate penalties to deter such behavior, and this new law is a reasonable approach on the industry."
