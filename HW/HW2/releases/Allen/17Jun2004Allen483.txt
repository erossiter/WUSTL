SEN. ALLEN ENCOURAGES VIRGINIA STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Defense Education Activity office is accepting applications for the United States Senate Youth Program (USSYP). 104 student delegates from around the nation will be chosen to participate in a week-long immersion program which introduces studen9 to the functions of the federal government and, in particular, the United States Senate.  
   "Giving students a chance to walk the halls of their Capitol, talk to the people who make their laws and see their government at work is a great way to enrich their educational experience as well as reward their excellent work back home," said Senator Allen. "Educating the next generation is one of the greatest investments we can make and I continue to believe that it is vitally important that our children receive a good educational foundation in order to prepare them for a lifetime of success." 
   Two high school junior or senior students from each state and the District of Columbia will be selected for the program based solely on their outstanding ability and demonstrated qualities of leadership as elected or selected high school student officers of the 2004-2005 school year. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation is again making a $5,000 scholarship award available to each of the participating delegates. The foundation will also provide $1,000 to each state-level department of education to assist with the selection process. 
   Interested students should contact their high school principal or Ms. Colleen Bryant at cbryant@mail.va12ed.edu or 804-786-4640 by September 22, 2004. Students may also visit the USSYP website at www.ussenateyouth.org.
