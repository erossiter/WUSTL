SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $11.8 MILLION AWARDED TO VIRGINIA FOR BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has allocated $11,890,053 for the Commonwealth of Virginia to use to strengthen the response of hospitals and other health care facilities to bioterror attacks, infectious diseases, and natural disasters.  
   "Virginia's hospitals and health care facilities are among the nation's finest and play an integral role in the defense against acts of bioterrorism," said Senator Allen. "With the help of grants like this one, Virginia will be better prepared to protect its families and communities." 
   The Virginia health department will use this grant to improve the readiness of hospitals and other health care facilities that would respond to and deal with large numbers of casualties. This grant will also allow hospitals and local and state health departments to increase coordination on disease reporting and to enhance communication between public health laboratories and hospital-based laboratories. Virginia hospitals and health care facilities will further use the funds to provide behavioral health services and trauma and burn care and to purchase communications equipment and personal protective gear.
