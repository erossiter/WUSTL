SEN. ALLEN LAUDS HUNTING HERITAGE PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. George Allen, (R-VA) today enthusiastically co-sponsored the Hunting Heritage Protection Act S.1522. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), requires that federal public lands be open to access and use for recreational hunting. The bill includes two notable exceptions: (1) if the federal agency with responsibility over such lands has national security or public safety concerns or if applicable federal statutes apply, or (2) if such hunting is limited by the State in which the lands are located. The bill declares that new federal land management decisions and actions should result in no net loss of land area available for hunting opportunities on federal public lands.  
   "As a sportsman myself, I appreciate the chance for responsible hunting and fishing to take place on our public land," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the States will have a more active role in determining the use of their public lands. This common sense legislation will allow more sportsmen to enjoy more of the natural beauty that is America and the great tradition that is hunting." 
   The Hunting Heritage Protection Act also requires the heads of federal agencies who oversee recreational hunting lands to report annually to specific congressional committees. In addition, federal agencies must submit a written notice to Congress when pursuing a withdrawal, change of classification, or change of management status that effectively closes 5,000 or more acres of federal public land that is used for recreational hunting.
