SEN. ALLEN RESPONDS TO KERRY FILIBUSTER THREAT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today responded to media reports that Sen.  
 John Kerry (D-MA) called for a filibuster against Judge Samuel Alito as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During his floor statement in support of Judge Alito on Wednesday, Senator Allen stated, "if they move forward with such a filibuster, my reaction is: 'make my day.'" 
   "Well, hearing this news today, Senator Kerry must be feeling lucky because he wants to make my day. If Senate Democrats follow his advice, then I say we must pull the trigger on the Constitutional option. Senators should vote on this nomination and not hide behind partisan political processes to deny this exemplary nominee the fairness of a vote. Senators can vote 'yes' or vote 'no', but it is our responsibility to vote," said Senator Allen. 
   "I understand Senator Kerry is in Davos,. He shouldn't be wasting taxpayer's hard-earned money on long distance phone charges calling for such obstruction. I was hopeful that this nomination process would be of a civil nature. I doubt that all the Democrat Senators will follow Sen. Kerry's long-distance advice."
