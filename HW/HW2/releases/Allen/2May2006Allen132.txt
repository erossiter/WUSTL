SEN. ALLEN INTRODUCES BILL HONORING FORMER VIRGINIA DELEGATE HARRY J. PARRISH
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today introduced a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 8801 Sudley Road in Manassas, Virginia, as the "Harry J. Parrish Post Office." A similar bill has been offered in the House by Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA 10th). 
   "Harry set an example for all of us in elected office by his gentlemanly approach to debating and resolving important issues," Senator Allen said. "His dedication to the people of Manassas, the 50th District, and all of Virginia has positively impacted the lives of countless thousands of people. Yet, Harry was never too busy to focus on the needs of an individual. Preserving the memory of his life and work in this way would be a small sign of our appreciation."
   Delegate Parrish was one of the most respected leaders in Richmond, due to his position as chairman of the House Finance Committee. He served as Manassas city councilman from 1963 to 1981 and the mayor of Manassas from 1951 to 1981. Known for his moderate stances--which won him friends and allies among Democrats on the other side of the aisle--Parrish was in his 13th term in the General Assembly, having served as a delegate since 1982.
