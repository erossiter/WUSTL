SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAID-OFF WEBB FURNITURE EMPLOYEES IN GALAX
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Labor Department for the 151 employees of Webb Furniture Enterprises, Inc in Galax, Virginia after the company announced last week that they will be closing permanently separating workers in two of their four plants on June 28, 2004.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in the Galax area have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the U.S. Labor Department to help provide vital federal assistance for all Webb employees affected by this closing," Senator Allen said. 
   Allen sent a letter yesterday to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing his strong support for the expeditious review and grant of a Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) Older Workers Program filed by Webb. TAA would provide displaced workers with important re-employment benefits and tax credits for continued health coverage. ATAA extends additional assistance to employees over the age of 50.
