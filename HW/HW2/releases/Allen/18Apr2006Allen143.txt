SEN. ALLEN PRAISES BUDGET DIRECTOR NOMINEE REP. PORTMAN
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised U.S Trade Rep. Rob Portman, the President's nominee to head the Office of Budget and Management. If confirmed by the Senate, Portman would replace former OMB Director Josh Bolton who took over this week as the new White House Chief of Staff.  
   "Rob Portman's vast experience and highly effective leadership skills will make him an excellent choice to succeed Josh Bolton. I've always found Rob to be a sharp, refreshing, respected, and truly likeable person. As the U.S. Trade Representative, Rob demonstrated clear priorities and determination and will now be a leader in one of the most difficult and tough jobs which I liken to trench warfare in spending limits and budget priority battles. In addition, Rob has always been a clear realist and determined leader in moving forward to enforce trade agreements and I am confident that the nation will be well served by his steady, principled stewardship of OMB," said Senator Allen.
