SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON RETIREMENT OF FEDERAL JUDGE J. MICHAEL LUTTIG
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement on the retirement of Judge J. Michael Luttig from the federal bench.  
   "Judge J. Michael Luttig's resignation from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is a very big loss of solid, respected, principled and experienced judicial leadership on the court. Judge Luttig's 15 years on the bench have been marked by sound, fair and thoughtful decisions. His absence on the court will no doubt be felt, but I'm sure that Boeing Corporation is gaining an exceptional vice president and general counsel in Judge Luttig and I wish him well and thank him for his laudatory service to our nation. I look forward to receiving the President's nominee as we seek to fill Judge Luttig's seat on the bench with another jurist of the same judicial philosophy and quality. I am glad that Virginian Judges J. Harvey Wilkinson, H. Emory Widener and Roger Gregory will continue to anchor this 4th Circuit Court, but we have lost a key judicial leader for exemplary judicial temperament and principles."
