SEN. ALLEN SPEAKS AGAINST NASA-LANGLEY BUDGET CUTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today spoke out against the proposed budget cuts to the aeronautics research program at NASA-Langley in Virginia.  
   "The proposed cuts to the important aeronautical vehicle systems program at NASA-Langley are detrimental to the thousands of talented highly-skilled employees who have been the backbone of our nation's aeronautics capabilities. 
   "Since the Clinton Administration there have been harmful cuts in aeronautics research and development. The result is that the U.S. has lost its lead in aircraft sales. We should be reversing this trend rather than becoming less competitive in aeronautical innovations. 
   "I have always advocated for funding and programs that increase our productivity and competitiveness. The work that is done at NASA-Langley is essential for our nation to stay on the cutting edge of air and spacecraft development. To cut these programs would seriously undermine America's ability to compete militarily and commercially as the next generation of aircraft is developed. 
   "I intend to join with my colleagues in Congress to work not only for this aeronautics research which is so vital for our future competitiveness and military capability, but also for the Virginia workers affected by these proposed cuts," said Senator Allen.
