SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAID-OFF SARA LEE EMPLOYEES IN MARTINSVILLE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Labor Department for 23 employees of Sara Lee Branded Apparel - VSC (Sara Lee) in Martinsville, Virginia after the company permanently separated those workers on March 22, 2004.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Henry County have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the U.S. Labor Department to help provide vital federal assistance for these Sara Lee employees who have lost their jobs," Senator Allen said. 
   Allen sent a letter yesterday to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing his strong support for the expeditious review and grant of a Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) Older Workers Program filed by Sara Lee. TAA would provide displaced workers with important re-employment benefits and tax credits for continued health coverage. ATAA extends additional assistance to employees over the age of 50.
