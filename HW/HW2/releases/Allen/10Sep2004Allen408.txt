SEN. ALLEN REMINDS VIRGINIA STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM BEFORE DEADLINE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the United States Senate Youth Program (USSYP) is accepting applications for Virginia students through September 22, 2004.  
 Two outstanding Virginia high school students will be selected to spend a week in Washington, DC observing the federal government in action. 
   "Giving students a chance to walk the halls of their Capitol, talk to the people who make their laws and see their government at work is a great way to enrich their educational experience as well as reward their excellent work back home," said Senator Allen. "Educating the next generation is one of the greatest investments we can make and I continue to believe that it is vitally important that our children receive a good educational foundation in order to prepare them for a lifetime of success." 
   Each of the student delegates will receive a $5,000 college scholarship from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, in addition to the all-expenses paid trip to the nation's capitol. Students will be selected based on their outstanding academics, impressive qualities and demonstrated leadership. 
   "I encourage Virginia high school students to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Senator Allen. 
   Virginia students should contact their high school principal or Ms. Colleen Bryant at the Virginia Department of Education via email cbryant@mail.vak12ed.edu or phone 804-786-4640. Students may also visit the USSYP website at www.ussenateyouth.org.
