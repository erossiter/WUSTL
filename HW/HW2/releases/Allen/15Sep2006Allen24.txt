SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS TO FIVE VIRGINIA COUNTIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded five Community Facility grants to Campbell, Carroll, Dickenson, Giles, and Grayson counties to improve their emergency response services.  
   The Brookneal Rescue Squad, Inc. in Campbell County received $6,000 to purchase training equipment. 
   The Cana Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. in Carroll County received $30,000 to purchase a fire truck. 
   The Clintwood Volunteer Rescue Squad in Dickenson County received $50,000 to purchase a crash truck. 
   The Town of Pembroke in Giles County received $7,870 to purchase a police vehicle. 
   Mt. Rogers Volunteer Fire & Rescue Squad, Inc. in Grayson County received $4,000 to purchase floating fire pumps. 
   "I'm very pleased that these counties have received this vital funding to address the safety and security of Virginians," said Senator Allen. "With this equipment, the local emergency response services will be better prepared to handle crisis situations within their communities. I'm committed to improving the quality of living across the Commonwealth so that Virginia will continue to grow into a better place to live, learn, work and raise a family." 
   USDA's Rural Development office administers public safety programs designed to focus on the needs of first responders in rural areas. These programs in part provide grants for the purchase of emergency vehicles and training equipment. Through its Community Programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that these resources are readily available to all rural communities.
