SEN. ALLEN URGES VIRGINIA DEPARTMENTS TO ATTEND FREE GRANT WORKSHOPS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today urged Virginia fire departments to attend the upcoming workshops hosted by the Department of Homeland Security.  
 These free workshops were designed to help fire departments apply for funding through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. 
   "The brave men and women who serve as Virginia's fire and emergency responders have a great opportunity to learn about the grants available to them," said Senator Allen. "Our communities rely on the faithful protection of our local fire departments and those who serve us so well deserve to have the best equipment, supplies, training and resources possible." 
   The following locations will be hosting workshops: 
   * February 23, 2005 Albemarle County Public Safety Facility 
  6:00pm 460 Stage Coach Road, Charlottesville, VA 
   * February 24, 2005 Amissville Volunteer Fire Department 
  6:00pm 14711 Lee Highway, Amissville, VA 
   * February 28, 2005 Tappahannock-Essex Volunteer Fire Department 
  6:00pm 620 Airport Road, Tappahannock, VA 
   "I encourage all interested fire, rescue and emergency medical personnel to attend one of these workshops and then let me know how I can assist them as they apply for funding," said Senator Allen. 
   Lori Bainbridge, Regional Representative for the Assistance to Firefighters Program, will be the guest speaker at the workshops. She will explain the competitive 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, explain the application process and answer questions. A representative from Senator Allen's office will be present at each workshop, ready to explain how Senator Allen can assist those applying for grants.
