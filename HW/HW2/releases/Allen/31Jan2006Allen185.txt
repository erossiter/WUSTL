SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FIRE GRANT WORKSHOP IN SOUTH BOSTON
  In conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security, Sen.  
 George Allen (R-VA) announced today that he is sponsoring Assistance to Firefighters grant workshops across the Commonwealth in order to ensure that they are available at convenient locations. The workshops will enable representatives from all of the local fire department/EMS units to attend and learn how to apply for additional federal funding for their departments. 
   "Our Virginia emergency personnel should have every opportunity to compete for additional federal funding to support them in their important homeland security work. I would heartily encourage local fire departments, EMS , and their associated personnel to take advantage of this informative workshop," said Senator Allen. "Our Commonwealth relies on the bravery of our dedicated firefighters, EMS and those that work with them. I am altogether very pleased to provide the opportunity for them to receive help in acquiring much-needed federal funding through these workshops." 
   There is no cost for attending the workshop which will provide an overview of the 2006 Assistance to Firefighters grant program. The seminar will cover application changes, new programs and eligible activities, local regional applications, as well as frequently asked questions and requirements. 
   The workshop will be held at the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center, 820 Bruce Street in South Boston on February 27, 2006 at 6:00 PM. For more information please contact Tucker Watkins at (804) 347-2587.
