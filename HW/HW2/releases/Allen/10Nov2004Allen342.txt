SEN. ALLEN PRAISES REMOVAL OF FIFTH GHOST FLEET SHIP
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the removal of the Donner, a dock landing ship, from the James River Reserve Fleet.  
 The vessel is scheduled to leave on Friday, November 12 and will be dismantled in Brownsville, TX. The Donner will be the fifth high priority vessel to leave the "Ghost Fleet" since the end of July. The rest of the high priority ships which are cleared for disposal will be removed by December 2004.
   "The removal of the Donner is another promise kept by the Maritime Administration and another positive step toward the day when the Ghost Fleet no longer endangers the health of the James River and the many workers who rely on it for commerce, tourism and fishing," said Senator Allen. "I will continue to work with the members of the Virginia delegation and Captain Schubert by remaining vigilant until the economic and environmental threat posed by these ships is completely removed from the James River and its surrounding region."
   The Donner was built by the Naval Shipyard at Boston in 1945 and commissioned in July 1945. It transported landing craft from Norfolk to New York, and then operated boat pools along the east coast until November 1946 when it sailed for the Mediterranean and similar duty. Later, operating from Norfolk, it took part in training exercises in the Caribbean and made several cruises to the waters off Greenland for replenishment and cold weather operations. During the summer of 1959, it took part in Operation "Inland Sea," the first passage of a Navy task force into the Great Lakes through the newly dedicated Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Donner was decommissioned in 1970.
