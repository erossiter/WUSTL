SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT AWARDED TO CITY OF PETERSBURG
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs has awarded a grant of $225,000 to the crime prevention and intervention Weed and Seed site in Petersburg.  
   "Improving the safety and security of our nation and its citizens is one of my top priorities," said Senator Allen. "By giving local cities and law enforcement agencies the resources to prevent criminal activity, we are moving in the right direction. I am pleased that these federal funds will help our hard-working police officers be better equipped to protect people in communities throughout Virginia ." 
   During this project period, law enforcement efforts will focus on coordinating with federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to combat violent crime, drug trafficking, gang crime, and enhancing the prosecution of crimes committed with a firearm. Community policing goals include increasing the community's confidence in the criminal justice system through formal and informal efforts to educate citizens and law enforcement officers on the core principals of community-oriented policing and partnerships. Prevention, intervention, and treatment goals include coordinating with social service organizations to offer educational and recreational opportunities for youth and adults. Neighborhood restoration goals include coordination with public and private organizations to foster community development/revitalization, residential rehabilitation, environmental management services, home ownership, and infrastructure improvements, among neighborhood-based service providers.
