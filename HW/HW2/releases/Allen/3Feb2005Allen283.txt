SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEAD START PROJECTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant in the amount of $1,497,394 to the Monticello Area Community Action Agency in Charlottesville, VA for the continuation of its work with children and parents involved with the national Head Start program.  
   "This group of people is making a significant impact on families in their area through the Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life." 
   More specifically, this grant will allow the Monticello Area Community Action Agency to continue their comprehensive child-focused development programs that are designed to serve the children of low-income families. In all its programs, Head Start focuses on incorporating parents, community and students as partners in education.
