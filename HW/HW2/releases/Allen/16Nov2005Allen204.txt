SEN. ALLEN 'STRONGLY INCLINED' TO SUPPORT JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today met with President Bush's nominee to be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Samuel Alito, in his Capitol Hill office. Sen.  
 Allen made the following remarks regarding their meeting: 
   "I was very impressed by Judge Alito in our meeting today. I felt the judge was a good, decent, solid individual who respects the rule of law in this country. He understands that laws are to be made by those who are elected by the people and that the role of a judge is to apply the law, not invent it. He also has respect for the will of the people in the States to determine their own laws. 
   "One of the great values in analyzing Judge Alito's judicial capabilities is that he has served fifteen years on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe one of the best ways to determine a person's future actions as a Supreme Court Justice is to look at their past record of performance as a judge. I am very impressed by Judge Alito's judicial record and proven judicial philosophy and I am strongly inclined to support his nomination when it comes to a vote before the Senate. I look forward to a fair and dignified confirmation hearing."
