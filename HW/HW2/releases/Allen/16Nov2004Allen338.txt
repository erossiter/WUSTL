SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES OVER $2 MILLION AWARDED TO TOWN OF KENBRIDGE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Office awarded a grant in the amount of $1,070,000 and a loan in the amount of $1,318,300 to the Town of Kenbridge in Lunenburg County to upgrade and expand the town's existing wastewater treatment plant.  
   "These important funds will help the folks in Kenbridge update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is able to provide such significant support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   This grant is part of the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program and will allow the Town of Kenbridge to update their sewer system by installing a grit chamber, pump station, trickling filter, clarifier, digesters, and related equipment. The town's sewer system serves approximately 543 residences and 96 businesses. 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans is to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
