SEN. ALLEN SECURES FUNDING FOR KENBRIDGE FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fire Administration's Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program has awarded a grant in the amount of $23,985 to Kenbridge Fire Department in Kenbridge, VA as part of the Fire Prevention program.  
 Senator Allen helped to secure this funding. 
   "Improving the safety and security of Virginians and our communities is one of my top priorities. By enhancing the training and support of our emergency crews, we are making great strides in this important mission," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that firefighters in Kenbridge will be better equipped and prepared. Their community will be safer because of this assistance." 
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. These funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations and for firefighter health and safety programs, new fire equipment, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention and safety programs. 
   In November 2004, Senator Allen wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security expressing his strong support for Kenbridge Fire Department's application. The full text of the letter is attached.
