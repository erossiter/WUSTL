SENS. ALLEN, WARNER ANNOUNCE $1.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIA, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
  U.S. Sens. George Allen (R-VA) and John Warner (R-VA) today announced that the United States Senate has approved $1.8 million for vital projects in the Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. areas. These funds were also approved by the House of Representatives and now await President Bush's signature.  
   * $850,000 for The Women's Center founded in 1974, which provides immediate and affordable counseling, education and information to women and their families with respect to their psychological, legal and career needs. It also provides low-cost and no-charge bilingual services to low income and immigrant neighborhoods. The Center has locations throughout Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
   * $450,000 for Second Chance Employment, a non-profit organization, providing at-risk women and their dependents financial security through comprehensive training and employment placement services. 
   * $200,000 for the All Faith Consortium, Inc for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP). This program is designed to assist District of Columbia Veterans with housing, substance abuse treatment, job training, and case management and to equip them with the necessary skills to accommodate their quest for self sufficiency. 
   * $300,000 for The Capitol Area Food Bank to go towards acquiring a new warehouse and meet the growing demands of the hungry in the Washington Metropolitan Area. These funds will be put together with revenue generated from a capital campaign targeting individuals, companies and foundations. Last year alone they had to turn away two million pounds of food and other products due to the limits of its current facility. 
   "I am pleased that we have approved funding for these important training and services for our fellow citizens in need," Senator Allen said. "These funds will help people, of all backgrounds have a better opportunity to succeed."
   Senator Warner said, "These projects will help many residents get a leg up toward future success and rewarding careers. I am pleased that Congress has approved this funding."
