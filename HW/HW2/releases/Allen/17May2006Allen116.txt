SEN. ALLEN TO ATTEND DEDICATION FOR A NEW SPAN OF WOODROW WILSON BRIDGE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) will be a featured speaker during the dedication ceremony celebrating the opening of the new span of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge this Thursday, May 18th at 11:00am. The opening of the new span will mark the beginning of the final phase of construction and the culmination of 11 years of work by Virginia's leaders to ensure a more functional Wilson Bridge. 
  In 1995, as Governor of Virginia, Senator Allen signed legislation to establish the "Woodrow Wilson Bridge and Tunnel Authority." Its purpose was to own, finance, construct, and operate a bridge to replace the existing Woodrow Wilson Bridge. In addition, throughout his time in public office, Senator Allen has supported funding for and the completion of the new bridge. When complete, the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge will help ease the burden of the heavy flow of traffic in Northern Virginia while increasing safety and decreasing the commute time for many Virginians who travel across it each day.
  "In 1995, when I was Governor of Virginia, we wanted the whole world to know that 'Virginia is open for business,' and we wanted Northern Virginia families to travel without fearing for their safety and without enduring costly, aggravating delays," said Senator Allen. "I signed legislation to establish the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and Tunnel Authority, a mutually-beneficial interstate compact that paved the way for a new bridge. Our actions were followed up by Senator John Warner whose principled, dedicated leadership secured federal funds for this vitally important project.
  "Now, 11 years later, all of that hard work is paying off with opening of the new span of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. When complete, the new bridge will help make the commute for many Northern Virginians shorter and safer than before and continue to open up the economic highway into Northern Virginia," said Allen.
