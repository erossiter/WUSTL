SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES BOTETOURT COUNTY NOW ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL DISASTER AID FOR TROPICAL DEPRESSION JEANNE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that President Bush has designated Botetourt County as eligible for federal disaster assistance following Tropical Depression Jeanne. This declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people recover from the impact of severe storms and flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne that occurred September 27, 2004 and continuing. 
   "I am glad to see Botetourt County added to the list of localities who are receiving assistance," said Senator Allen. "This storm had a terrible effect on families in that county who suffered damage to their businesses and their homes. I will continue to do whatever I can on the federal level to ensure that these fine folks are able to get back on their feet as quickly as possible."
   Homeowners, renters and business owners in Botetourt County are now eligible to apply for a wide range of state and federal disaster assistance. This includes housing grants, U.S. Small Business Administration low-interest loans, grants to help meet serious disaster-related needs and disaster-related unemployment assistance. Affected residents are encouraged to apply immediately by calling the toll-free registration number, 1-800-621-FEMA. Those with a speech or hearing impairment may call TTY 1-800-462-7585. Those with Internet access can register by logging on to www.FEMA.gov. After registering, victims can visit the Disaster Recovery Center at 2145 Apperson Drive in Salem. It is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. except Sunday, when the hours are noon until 5 p.m.
   On October 5, 2004 Senator Allen wrote a letter to President Bush requesting a federal disaster declaration. The cities of Salem and Roanoke as well as the counties of Alleghany, Craig, Floyd, Giles, Montgomery, Patrick and Roanoke were designated disaster areas on October 18, 2004.
