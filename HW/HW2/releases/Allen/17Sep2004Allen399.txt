SEN. ALLEN HAILS STRONG JOB GROWTH IN VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the nation's improving economy that resulted in continued good news in the August employment figures, especially for the Commonwealth of Virginia.  
 According to the U.S. Department of Labor, unemployment has fallen in 45 States with Virginia ranking fourth in the largest jump in non-farm payroll.
   "This is great news for the hard working men and women of Virginia and their families. President Bush's positive economic plan, which I strongly supported and worked for, is putting people to work all across America," said Senator Allen as he participated in the grand opening of a new Sara Lee facility in Suffolk that will add 100 new jobs once fully operational. This facility will produce packaged coffee products under the Douwe Egberts brand by Sara Lee.
   "I am especially pleased that Virginia continues to be a leader in the nation in employment and job growth. We are fourth in non-farm payroll growth and continue to enjoy one of the lowest overall unemployment rates in the country," said Senator Allen. The U.S. Department of Labor report puts Virginia's unemployment rate at 3.5%. 
   "Today's latest economic good news confirms we are headed in the right direction and will further bolster business confidence. I am committed to working for positive, constructive solutions that will create even more jobs, investment and improve competitiveness in Virginia and America," said Senator Allen.
