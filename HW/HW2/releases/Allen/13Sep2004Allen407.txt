SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES PORT SECURITY GRANTS TO HAMPTON ROADS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $2,541,867 in Port Security Grants to five locations in the Hampton Roads area.  
 These grants will provide resources for security planning and projects to improve dockside and perimeter security. 
   "I believe it is absolutely imperative for America to protect its seaports during these dangerous times. I know firsthand from my experience as Governor the instrumental role that the Port of Virginia, the Port of Richmond and others play in the economic health of the Commonwealth," said Senator Allen. "As we proceed in the War on Terror, it is vitally important that we protect our homeland from terrorist threats and ensure the safety and security of high-risk targets, such as seaports." 
   The following recipients were awarded grants from this round of funding: 
   * Apex Oil Company, Inc Chesapeake $225,035 
  * Center Terminal Company Norfolk $196,350 
  * Virginia Port Authority Newport News $270,400 
  * Virginia Port Authority Norfolk $1,221,792 
  * Virginia Port Authority Portsmouth $628,290 
   The Port Security Grant Program represents one layer of the Department of Homeland Security's system of defenses for our nation's ports that includes monitoring the people, cargo and vessels entering our ports from the time they leave a foreign port to the time they arrive in the United States. 
   Senator Allen is currently a co-sponsor of the Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaport Act of 2004, a piece of legislation that is aimed at securing seaports around the country from terrorist activities.
