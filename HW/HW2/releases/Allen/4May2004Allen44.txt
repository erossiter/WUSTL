SEN. ALLEN LAUDS SENATE ACTION ON HOMESTEAD PRESERVATION ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the adoption of his Homestead Preservation Act as an amendment to the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill and urged his colleagues to support its passage, later this week. Allen's amendment would provide home-mortgage assistance to workers who lose their jobs as a result of international competition. 
   "This is commonsense, compassionate legislation which will help working families, who through no fault of their own, are adversely affected by international competition," Allen said. "The Homestead Preservation Act will provide hardworking Americans and their families with vital temporary financial assistance that will enable them to keep their homes and protect their credit ratings as they work toward strengthening and updating their skills and continue their search for a new job."
   Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act:
   * Authorizes the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to administer a low-interest loan program (loans of 4 percent), for workers displaced due to international competition, for up to the amount of 12 monthly mortgage payments. The program is authorized at $10 million per year for five years.
   * Distributes the loan through an account, providing monthly allocations to cover the amount of the worker's mortgage payment.
   * Allows for a loan-duration of up to one year, or after the borrower has worked full-time for six consecutive months. Repayment would be completed after five years. The loans are available only for the cost of a monthly mortgage payment and cover only workers who are displaced due to international competition. 
   * Requires individuals to be: certified that they have been adversely impacted by international competition; a borrower under a loan which requires the individual to make monthly mortgage payments on a primary residence; and enrolled in a job training or job assistance program. 
   "These are uneasy times for those who have lost their jobs. And regions such as the Southeast, Midwest, Northeast, and in Southside and Southwest Virginia, with heavy concentrations in manufacturing - especially the textile, apparel and furniture industries - have been especially hard hit. Understanding no government program or assistance can substitute for a secure, well-paying job, I believe the U.S. government can reasonably assist families as they transition from one career to another and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation," Allen concluded.
