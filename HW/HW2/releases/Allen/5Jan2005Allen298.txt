SEN. ALLEN VOICES SUPPORT FOR JAN. 30 ELECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today voiced support for continuing with plans for elections on January 30th in Iraq: 
   "I think it's very important that the elections go forward on January 30th so that the people of Iraq can exercise their right to vote. Granted, in the Sunni triangle area, it will be very difficult for everybody to vote because there are remnants of Saddam's regime and a number of religious terrorist hornet's nests. But, we should not deny the rights of the Kurdish people in the north or the Shiites in the south, the right to vote. The Iraqi interim government wants to proceed with the elections and I believe the people of Iraq should not be intimidated or thwarted in their ability to cast a vote to determine the future of their nation.  
   "If we delay the January 30th election, we would be backing down to the terrorists who hope that if they continue with these types of intimidating acts of murder and destruction, they'll be able to gain power in Iraq. 
   There is no doubt that this election will be held under very difficult circumstances. But, I think that what we'll see - and this is my faith in human beings - is a large turnout by a determined nation that has spent decades under the repressive rule of Saddam Hussein. We've seen these sorts of threatening situations in the past in Afghanistan, Latin America and Central America. Yet people came out by the millions, men and women, which was especially unique in Afghanistan. And, I think the same will be true in Iraq on January 30th. The terrorists cannot stop the right of the people in Iraq to form their government for their own freedom and opportunity."
