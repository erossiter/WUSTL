SEN. ALLEN BLASTS COURT FOR BANNING PLEDGE IN SCHOOLS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following comments regarding the U.S. District Court ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance in classrooms is unconstitutional: 
   "The decision today by a California federal judge prohibiting the Pledge of Allegiance in California schools because of the words 'under God' is a prime example of activist judges," said Senator Allen. "Ignoring the will of the people and striking down the Pledge of Allegiance, which is a patriotic act in schools, because of the words 'under God,' is why we need judges that understand that their role and responsibility is to apply the law, not invent the law. 
   "This ruling is another example of why we need judges who understand that their role is to respect the laws, the will, the views and the values of the people and their representatives. This is an absurd precedent of the Ninth Circuit Court to strike down such a wholesome act as having the Pledge of Allegiance in school every day because of the words 'under God'. 
   "I am hopeful that this case will eventually get to the U.S. Supreme Court and they will strike down this judicial activism. It will help to have Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court to bring some common sense and judicial restraint to such errant rulings."
