SEN. ALLEN INVITES MEDIA TO ATTEND TOUR OF THREE NEWLY RENOVATED MULTIFAMILY HOUSING PROPERTIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office is inviting the media to attend a press conference followed by a tour of three newly renovated multifamily housing properties.  
 The event will be held on Friday, December 3, 2004 at 10:00am at the Lawrenceville Manor Apartments, 501 Walnut Street, Lawrenceville, VA. 
   "There are many good deeds being done around our Commonwealth, and the renovations and assistance provided by the USDA Rural Development is one of them," said Senator Allen. "I encourage members of the media to attend this event so they can get a chance to see money well-invested and people well-served. These new housing facilities will make Southside Virginia a better place to live, learn, work and raise a family." 
   The three-stop tour will begin at the Lawrenceville Manor Apartments in Lawrenceville, VA, continue to Reese Village in Emporia, VA and conclude at Brookside Apartments in Boykins, VA. All of the properties have been recently renovated by the owner T.M. Associates, Inc in order to improve the neighborhood and the quality of life for its residents. Both the USDA Rural Development and VHDA have provided assistance to enable the renovations and provide affordable housing to the area citizens through grants and low-interest loans.
