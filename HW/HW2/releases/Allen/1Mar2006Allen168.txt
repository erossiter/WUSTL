SEN. ALLEN SUPPORTS SOUTH KOREA'S INCLUSION IN VISA WAIVER PROGRAM
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) has sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to express his support for the inclusion of South Korea in the United States Visa Waiver Program. Currently South Koreans who wish to visit the U.S on business or as tourists are required to undergo a lengthy examination before being granted a visa for entry. The visa waiver program would eliminate that process as long as relations between South Korea and the U.S. remain favorable. 
   In his letter Senator Allen advocates that South Korea has been a strong ally throughout both the Cold War and the Global War on Terror and that the United States is home to a large Korean-American population. "The United States and South Korea have a long history of friendship going back over 100 years," said Senator Allen.
   "Today, the United States is home to over 2 million people of Korean ancestry. These are people who, as individuals and as a community, have contributed greatly to American life and society in enterprise, education, professions and sports." Senator Allen indicated it would be a significant help to Korean-Americans if members of their family did not need to obtain a visa to visit them in the United States. 
   "I encourage the State Department to act swiftly to bring South Korea under the umbrella of the Visa Waiver Program as soon as it meets all of the eligibility requirements."
