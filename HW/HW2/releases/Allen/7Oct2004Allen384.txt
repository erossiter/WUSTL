SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $4.6 MILLION TO AID CHILDREN IN AFGHANISTAN
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Agency for International Development has awarded a grant in the amount of $4,600,000 to the Christian Children's Fund (CCF) in Richmond, VA in an effort to assist vulnerable and at-risk children and youth in Afghanistan.  
 This is one of the largest grants CCF has received for a cooperative program effort. 
   "Once again the good folks at the Christian Children's Fund are playing a key role in getting struggling families back on their feet," said Senator Allen. "By helping children get access to education and healthcare, CCF is making a significant impact on the internal progress in Afghanistan. It's good to know that Virginians are positioned to help those who are in desperate need." 
   CCF is serving as the lead agency in a consortium partnership with the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children Federation aiming to strengthen Afghanistan's overall education and health by helping over 200,000 children and youth in 169 suburban and rural communities through community-based programs such as literacy classes and vocational training. CCF hopes to serve a variety of children including orphans, disabled children, working children and former child soldiers.
