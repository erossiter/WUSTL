SEN. ALLEN INTRODUCES LONG-TERM CARE ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today introduced in the Senate the Long-Term Care Act of 2004 which will allow individuals to use their IRAs, 401(k), and 403(b) plans to purchase long-term care insurance with pretax dollars at any age and without early withdrawal penalty. Under the Long-Term Care Act, the consumer has the option to purchase long-term care insurance at the most appropriate amounts for their own needs and their spouses. Sen. Allen released the following statement regarding the legislation:  
   "In 2010, baby boomers will begin to turn 65 years old and by 2030, all 77 million baby boomers will have reached retirement age and the over 65 population will have doubled. The practicality of these conditions will require the federal government and most State governments to spend more money on health care. Presently, federal and State governments are spending billions of dollars to ensure the health and well being of our fellow citizens. 
   "If more people purchased private long-term care insurance, we could reduce Medicaid's future institutional-care expenses by more than $40 billion each year, while giving those who are insured alternatives to nursing homes: including home care, adult day care, foster care and assisted living. 
   "This legislation is a commonsense approach that will encourage individuals to plan for their future health care needs and help make long-term care insurance more affordable. While this may not be the solution for some people, it is another option for the millions of Virginians and Americans to help provide for their health and well-being or the health and well-being of loved ones. 
   "I look forward to the Senate's action on this legislation early on in the 109th Congress because it not only encourages Americans to plan for their future health needs but will also help sustain the viability of our nation's health care system."
