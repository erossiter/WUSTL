SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR ARLINGTON EMERGENCY RESPONSE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded a Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) grant in the amount of $400,000 to Arlington County to write plans, develop training and conduct exercises related to terrorist attacks.  
   "In today's world we have to be prepared for whatever rolls our way. This grant enables the volunteer and emergency responders in Arlington to work more closely together in the event of a large-scale terrorist attack," said Senator Allen. "With the help of grants like this one, Virginia will continue to be a leader in security, preparedness and dedication to safety." 
   Arlington County received money for two categories under the MMRS grant program. The first sum of $250,000 was awarded to respond to new threats caused by weapons of mass destruction events such as the detonation of a dirty bomb. The second sum of $150,000 was awarded to cover the planning, training and equipment needed to maintain their capability to the human health needs of community members impacted by a mass casualty incident. 
   MMRS establishes linkages among first responders, medical treatment resources, public health officials, emergency management offices, volunteer organizations and other local elements working together to reduce the mortality and morbidity that would result from a terrorist act.
