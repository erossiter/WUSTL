SEN. ALLEN PRAISES TAX LAW CHANGES HELPING MOTOR SPORTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised a provision of a tax relief bill approved by the Senate that gives owners of motor sports racetracks a seven-year recovery period for depreciation on facilities such as the Richmond International Raceway, the Martinsville Speedway, and other smaller tracks throughout the Commonwealth.  
   "NASCAR and motor sports fans enjoy tracks as places where friends and families can gather for great and thrilling sporting events. This measure reclassifies a section of the tax code and will allow owners much needed tax relief in the constant improvements and upgrades to these exciting venues," said Senator Allen, an original co-sponsor of the legislation. 
   The provision is part of the multifaceted tax relief bill or JOBS Act approved by Congress. Specifically, the tax code change firmly establishes motor sports racetracks as an "entertainment complex" similar to amusement and theme parks. Currently, like amusement and theme parks, raceways invest an enormous amount of money on renovations and capital improvements to attract and benefit their fans as well as their race teams. The tax code change will provide some relief, by allowing the seven-year recovery period for depreciation, allowing for greater investment and potential expansion. 
   "This common sense corporate tax relief puts these tracks into victory lane, thereby making it easier to create even more jobs and opportunities for Virginians while providing tens of thousands of fans first-rate facilities to watch these growing and exciting sports," said Senator Allen.
