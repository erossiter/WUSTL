  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program has awarded a Community Facility Direct Loan in the amount of $14,600,000 to Ferrum College in Ferrum, VA to renovate three residence halls, a classroom building, an office building, expand the student activities and cafeteria building, and add a 120 bed residence hall. 
   "These federal funds will allow the folks in Franklin County to offer a better living and learning environment to these college students" said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide needed support to improve the lives of Virginians."
   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, childcare, hospitals, medical clinics, assisted living facilities, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, public buildings and transportation. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
