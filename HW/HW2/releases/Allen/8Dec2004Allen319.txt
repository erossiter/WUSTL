SEN. ALLEN VOTES FOR INTELLIGENCE REFORM
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today voted in favor of the conference report on the Intelligence Reform bills that have been debated in the House and Senate.  
   "This measure addresses the major intelligence management, oversight, and information sharing concerns expressed in the 9/11 Commission Report and with candid discussion and effective compromise ensured that our troops in the field won't have to fight a bureaucracy to get intelligence. The measure streamlines the elements of our intelligence operations and makes sure that there are individuals with clear authority and clear responsibility for managing this important information. This bill has also prompted a valuable national discussion about other issues that must be addressed to keep America secure. I am confident that the upcoming 109th Congress will act to address those concerns," said Senator Allen. 
   "The Congress has moved with deliberate speed to examine the major issues at hand and craft an effective law that will have real and positive effects on our efforts to protect the nation from terrorist threats," Allen concluded.
