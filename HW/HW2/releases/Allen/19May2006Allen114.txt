SEN. ALLEN HELPS DEDICATE THE 'PORT OF NEW RIVER VALLEY'
  Speaking to an audience of community leaders in Dublin today, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) hailed the dedication of the New River Valley Airport as an official federal port of entry as showing that "the New River Valley and western Virginia is much better able to conduct business with the rest of the World." 
  As Governor of Virginia, Senator Allen and members of Congress began the process that led to today's opening. The facility becomes the 325th official port of entry in the United States and will serve the area that includes Montgomery, Pulaski and Roanoke Counties. The designation enables the New River Valley Airport to receive federal funding to operate and maintain is customs office.
  "This port of entry and 'foreign trade zone' allow this region to keep innovating, adapting, and clearly improving the desirability of businesses to conduct their enterprises here as well as attract new business and investment to this beautiful area," Senator Allen told this morning's audience.
  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection office will expedite the free flow of goods and services, collect duties, clear passengers, and enforce custom and border protection laws. Local economic development officials expect the designation to make regional businesses more comfortable using the airport and to dramatically increase the number of entries.
  "We are in competition with the rest of the world and this was a grassroots initiative where local and regional leaders came together to look for ways to spur international trade, investment, job creation and opportunities for all families in the region. It was really a team effort which will help the great future of the New River Valley, the Roanoke Valley , western Virginia, and indeed promoting all of Virginia as being 'open for business," Senator Allen said.
