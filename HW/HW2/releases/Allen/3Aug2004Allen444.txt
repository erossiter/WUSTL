SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEAD START PROJECTS IN FAIRFAX
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded two grants totaling $2,248,485 to Fairfax County Board of Supervisors for the continuation of their work with children and parents involved with the Head Start program.  
   "The people in Fairfax County are making a significant impact on families in their area through the Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life." 
   More specifically, these grants will allow Fairfax County to continue their comprehensive child-focused development programs that are designed to serve the children of low-income families. In all their programs, Head Start focuses on incorporating parents, community and students as partners in education.
