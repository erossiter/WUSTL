SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES GRANTS TO PROTECT CHESAPEAKE BAY
  Sen. George Allen announced (R-VA) today that the National Park Service has awarded a total of $512,565 to Chesapeake Gateways in Virginia - areas consisting of parks, wildlife refuges, museums, historic communities, and trails. These grant funds will be used to enhance the public's ability to learn about and enjoy the Bay's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed.
