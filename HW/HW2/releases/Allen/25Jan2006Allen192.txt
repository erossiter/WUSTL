SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES HUD GRANT OF $400,000 TO LONESOME PINE OFFICE ON YOUTH
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded funds in the amount of $400,000 to Lonesome Pine Office on Youth through the YouthBuild Program.  
 Founded in 1990, YouthBuild is a national nonprofit organization that works to unleash the positive energy of low-income young people to rebuild their communities and their lives. 
   "This funding will assist students in Virginia to gain construction skills while providing vital assistance to low-income families," said Senator Allen. "I'm altogether very pleased that the folks in Big Stone Gap will be able to use this funding to encourage productive community involvement in their local area." 
   This funding will go toward enabling young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 to complete their high school education and achieve on-the-job training in construction skills. Students build or renovate single-family homes and multi-family apartments, which are sold at affordable prices, to low- and very low-income persons as well as homeless individuals and families.
