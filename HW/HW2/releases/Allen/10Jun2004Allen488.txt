SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES APPROVAL OF NEW PHASE FOR DULLES RAIL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has approved the request of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDRPT) to move the Dulles Corridor Rail Project a step closer to completion by allowing the process of preliminary engineering to begin.  
 The preliminary engineering stage is the second of a three-part process in which the project's design, scope and cost are refined before actually beginning construction. 
   "I am pleased that the FTA and the VDRPT are making solid progress in this important project to bring rail to the Dulles Corridor," Senator Allen said. "In the future, I will continue to work to ensure that the Dulles Corridor Rail Project is completed to help improve the lives of the people of Northern Virginia by addressing the traffic aggravation in the region." 
   According to the FTA, the approval does not guarantee that the project will be approved to enter the Final Design phase of project development. The FTA will continue to monitor and evaluate the project throughout the developmental process as information concerning costs, benefits and impacts is refined. In order to be considered for any grants, all federal requirements must be met as rail to Dulles continues through the FTA's rigorous project development process.
