SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $15,000 RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT AWARDED TO BRUNSWICK COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded a grant of $15,000 to the Town of Alberta in Brunswick County to develop preliminary engineering and environmental reports that will address improvements to the town's existing sewer system. 
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Brunswick County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians."
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans are to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
