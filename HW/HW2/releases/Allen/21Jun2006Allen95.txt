SEN. ALLEN APPLAUDS ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION'S 'COMMITTMENT TO PARENTS'
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) spoke at the Entertainment Software Association's Ratings Board's (ESRB) "Commitment to Parents" news conference today. The ESRB's "Commitment to Parents" initiative is aimed at enhancing compliance with retailer enforcement policies regarding the sale of mature-rated video games, educating customers about ESRB video game ratings, and providing parents with the ability to return or exchange games sold to their children in violation of those policies. This initiative will work to ensure that children will not be exposed to inappropriate content in their video game selection. 
  "I commend the Entertainment Software Association and its Ratings Board not as a U.S. Senator, but as a parent," said Senator Allen. "Susan and I have three children ranging from 8 - 18. We, as parents, want to know who they're online with, what they're watching on TV, what is on their IPods, and what video games they're playing. It is a hard thing to do, but what is easy to do is to follow the "Commitment to Parents" program outlined today. The Entertainment Software Ratings Board and Enforcement is helping to educate and empower parents to determine what is appropriate."
  Retailers are already working hard to enforce their restriction of mature-rated video games. According to a recent Federal Trade Commission report, national retailers refused to sell mature-rated video games to minors 65% of the time. This percentage is on par with movie theatres, which also restrict access to mature-rated movies to minors.
  "This is the way things ought to work in that the private sector is being responsive and responsible to the demands and desires of parents for their children," said Senator Allen. "I commend the Entertainment Software Association for taking the initiative and hope they will serve as a model for others."
