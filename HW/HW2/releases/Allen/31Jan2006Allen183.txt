  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement regarding the death of Coretta Scott King:  
   "I was very saddened to learn of the passing of civil rights hero Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King carried on the wonderful legacy of her beloved husband, Dr. King, with dignity and exemplary leadership. She will be remembered in American history as an inspirational leader for equality and justice. 
   "Earlier this month I was privileged to attend a Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration in Petersburg, Virginia which featured some moving performances of writings by Dr. King and Coretta Scott King. Although they are no longer with us in body, I believe their spirits will live on in this country and their remarkable lives will be remembered as a tribute to 's unending quest for a more perfect union."
