SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON LONDON TERROR ATTACKS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA), Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on European Affairs, today made the following statement regarding the series of terrorist bombings that took place this morning in London:  
   "This morning, our thoughts and prayers are with our great friends across the Atlantic. The attacks that were perpetrated against the people of the United Kingdom today were dastardly, vile acts of terror. Today, as we mourn the tragic loss of life in London, the people of the United States stand shoulder to shoulder with the British people and, indeed, all of our allies in the War on Terror. 
   "These barbaric acts of terrorists, whether they occur in New York, Madrid, London or elsewhere in the world, aim to destroy human lives and the freedoms that democratic nations hold dear. But let there be no doubt: the resolve of the American and British people and our many allies to preserve our free and just societies in this war against terrorism is infinitely stronger than the resolve of murderous, hate-filled terrorists."
