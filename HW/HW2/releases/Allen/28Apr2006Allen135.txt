  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announce today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded a grant of $748,300 and approved a loan of $47,000 to Accomack County. Sen. Allen's office worked with leaders in Accomack County to obtain this grant funding. 
  "This vital support will allow the folks in Accomack County to update, improve, and extend water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am very pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians. I'm also pleased that my office was able to be of assistance in pursuing this vital funding." 
  Rural Development funds will be used to improve the source, treatment, and distribution aspects of the Town's existing water system, including improving pressure, fire protection, and increasing storage volume. The improvements include a new 300,000 gallon elevated water storage tank; replacing existing 2 and 4-inch water main with an 8-inch water main and accessories; the drilling of three new wells; abandonment of two existing wells; and the construction of a water treatment building.
