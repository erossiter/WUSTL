  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a total of $3,850,000 to the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Newport News, VA for projects that will enhance the efficiency, safety and value of the airport.  
   "The Newport News/Williamsburg Airport is vital to the economy of the Tidewater region," said Senator Allen. "It's important to keep airports like this one in top condition so that it can continue to generate business and create jobs while maintaining a standard of excellence in safety and service." 
   Senator Allen worked to secure $1,000,000 of the total amount for the specific purpose of expanding the terminal ramp. In addition, the airport received $2,850,000 specifically to improve the runway safety area. 
   "We would like to express our appreciation to Senator Allen for his leadership and hard work in obtaining these grants," says Jim Smith, Executive Director of the Peninsula Airport Commission. "Newport News/ Williamsburg International Airport is one of the fastest growing airports in the United States. The funds made available by these grants will allow us to continue to make our airport convenient and safe for travelers." 
   The Airport Improvement Program is a federal grant-in-aid program that represents a major source of funding for airport development and planning.
