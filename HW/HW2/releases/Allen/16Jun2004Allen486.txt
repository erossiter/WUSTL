SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL DECLARATION FOR THREE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA COUNTIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that President Bush has declared a major disaster for the Commonwealth of Virginia, triggering the release of federal funds to help people recover from the impact of severe storms, tornadoes and flooding that occurred since May 24, 2004.  
 Individuals and households in Lee, Russell and Tazewell Counties are now eligible to apply for a Hazard Mitigation Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Individuals and Households Program (IHP). 
   "The devastation in these counties caused by the excessive rain this spring has had an enormous effect on farmers, businesses and families," said Senator Allen. "This much-needed federal assistance will help Virginians in Lee, Russell and Tazewell counties get back on their feet after this latest set of storms." 
   The IHP provides financial help or direct services to those who have necessary expenses and serious needs and are unable to meet those needs through other means. Up to $25,000 is available in financial help (adjusted each year) although some forms of IHP assistance have limits and flood insurance may be required. Applicants may be eligible to receive funds for temporary housing, home repairs, home replacement, home construction or for uninsured, disaster-related necessary expenses and serious needs. For more information call 1-800-FEMA or TTD 1-800-462-7585. 
   Senator Allen wrote a letter to President Bush on June 2, 2004 asking for his expeditious review and approval of this disaster declaration.
