SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAID-OFF VAUGHAN FURNITURE COMPANY EMPLOYEES IN STUART
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Labor Department for 14 employees of Vaughan Furniture Company in Stuart, Virginia after the company announced that it will permanently separate those workers on June 17, 2004.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Patrick County have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the U.S. Labor Department to help provide vital federal assistance for these Vaughan Furniture Company employees who have lost their jobs," Senator Allen said. 
   Allen sent a letter today to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing his strong support for the expeditious review and grant of a Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) Older Workers Program filed by the Vaughan Furniture Company. TAA would provide displaced workers with important re-employment benefits and tax credits for continued health coverage. ATAA extends additional assistance to employees over the age of 50.
