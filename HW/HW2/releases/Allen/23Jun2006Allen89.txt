SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $464,211 GRANT AWARDED TO HIGHLAND MEDICAL CENTER
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $464,211 to Highland Medical Center, Inc. in Monterey, which serves as the only primary care medical facility in Highland County . This grant will be used to fund the Center's services in the 2006 fiscal year.  
   "This funding will greatly benefit low-income families in Highland County and the surrounding area," said Senator Allen. "I'm thrilled that this facility is continuing its dental program as a part of their services to underinsured and uninsured Virginians. This grant will most surely promote the health and wellbeing of Virginians and make Virginia a better place to live, learn, work and raise a family." 
   The Highland Medical Center in Monterey became a Federally Qualified Health Center in 2003 with 330e funding from Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health Care. Their service area is designated as "Medically Underserved" and a "Health Professional Shortage Area." Funds to date have allowed them to accomplish many goals in service to the community including bringing dentistry to the county. Their goals as stated in the original application included healthcare and business plans designed to improve access of their entire community to much needed comprehensive and preventive primary care at an affordable cost.
