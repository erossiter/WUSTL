SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ROBERTS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement following the first day of hearings on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to become the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "I'm glad the American people finally got to hear from Judge Roberts. I was impressed today just like I was when I met him in August. He promised to be fair and objective as Chief Justice and I especially liked that he said that he would call balls and strikes as an umpire and not try to be the pitcher or batter. 
   "He understands that a judge should apply the law, not invent it and that the rule of law protects the rights and liberties of all Americans. That's why I support John Roberts' nomination and believe a strong majority of Senators will as well."
