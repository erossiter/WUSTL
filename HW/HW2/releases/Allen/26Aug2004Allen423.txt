SEN. ALLEN PRAISES REMOVAL OF SHIP FROM GHOST FLEET
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the removal of the freighter, American Ranger, from the James River Reserve Fleet.  
 The ship is being towed out of the river so that it can be dismantled. 
   "Today's removal of the American Ranger is another positive step toward the day when the Ghost Fleet no longer endangers the health of the James River and the many workers who rely on it for commerce, tourism and fishing," Allen said. "Along with members of the Virginia delegation, Maritime Administrator Schubert and other government officials, I will continue to work hard and remain vigilant until the economic and environmental threat posed by these ships is completely removed from the James River and its surrounding region."
