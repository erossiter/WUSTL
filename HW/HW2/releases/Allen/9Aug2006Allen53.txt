SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $357,900 IN FEDERAL GRANTS TO ASSIST FOUR VIRGINIA FIRE DEPARTMENTS WITH TRAINING, EQUIPMENT
  During the third day of his annual R-V tour across Virginia, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today took time out from stops in Appomattox, Lynchburg, Amherst and Charlottesville to announce welcome news that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is awarding $357,900 to four Virginia Fire Departments in Buckingham, Martinsville, Norton and Wytheville. The funding comes from the DHS Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which Senator Allen says "helps better protect the brave firefighters who devote their lives to safeguarding individuals and families, their property and our communities throughout Virginia ."  
   Senator Allen --who once was a volunteer firefighter in Earlysville--has made protecting the health and safety of firefighters one of his top priorities since his days as Governor. In 1995, the Virginia Professional Firefighters Association awarded Governor Allen an ax as a token of their appreciation, which hangs on the wall of his Senate office. Since coming to the Senate in 2001, Senator Allen has worked closely with Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program to announce millions of dollars to help increase the effectiveness of Virginia 's firefighters and their operations through enhanced health, safety and medical awareness, more advanced equipment, and fire prevention and safety programs. "This vital assistance that I am announcing today," says Senator Allen , "will help outstanding firefighters in Buckingham, Martinsville , Norton, and Wytheville to be even better prepared, equipped and trained as they go about their noble job of protecting their communities." 
   The four fire departments received funding through the Operation and Safety program: 
   * Toga Volunteer Fire Department: $99,272 Dillwyn, VA ( Buckingham County ) 
   * Dyers Store Volunteer Fire Department: $63,593 Martinsville, VA ( Martinsville City ) 
   * City of Norton Fire Department: $117,135 Norton, VA ( Norton City ) 
   * Wytheville Fire Department: $77,900 Wytheville, VA ( Wytheville City ) 
   "Improving the safety and security of Virginians and our communities is one of my top priorities. By recruiting firefighters and enhancing the fire prevention training and support of our emergency crews, we are making great strides in this important mission," said Senator Allen as his R-V continued along the back roads of Virginia on his 11th annual "Listening Tour."
