SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN AWARDED TO WESTMORELAND COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded a loan of $295,700 to Westmoreland County to construct a grinder collection system to serve approximately 550 residential and 2 commercial users in the Cherry Grove, Travelers Rest and Mud Bridge areas of the county.  
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Westmoreland County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans is to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
