SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL TAX CUT EXTENSION MEASURE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today will join his Republican colleagues in extending federal tax cuts which had been set to expire soon. During a press conference at the United States Capitol today Sen. Allen said the following: 
   "This afternoon the Senate is going to do something good for the American people. We are going to extend these tax cuts to keep more money in the pockets of the American taxpayer and to keep the American economy growing. It's clear we need these tax cuts and these tax cuts have worked. In the technology and innovation sector, our economy is moving forward strongly. The worst thing the government could do is allow the imposition of a $70 billion tax increase which would just put the brakes on our strong and growing economy. This is going to be an outstanding moment for improving and continuing the growth and competitiveness of our country. It's going to improve job opportunities for all Americans, and of course, for those who care about it, it will give more revenue to the government because more people will be working and more businesses will be prospering. We do need to put circuit breakers on spending here in Washington, but remember the deficit is not a problem because of revenues; it is a problem because of spending."
