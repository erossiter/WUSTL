SEN. ALLEN LAUDS U.S. MOVE TO IMPOSE IMPORT DUTIES ON CHINA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today commended President Bush and the U.S. Department of Commerce for proposing strong action against China for illegally "dumping" more than a billion dollars in wooden furniture into the nation's economy.  
 Senator Allen first urged such action last year citing the devastating impact of China's illegally priced products on the nation's furniture industry including manufacturers in Virginia. 
   "This is the right step for the United States to take in protecting our furniture companies including those in the Commonwealth of Virginia," Allen said. "The clear facts show that China is cheating on furniture manufacturing and this aggressive stand goes a long way to safeguarding America's furniture workers." 
   Senator Allen urged that the United States take such action last December in a letter to Secretary of Commerce Don Evans. "The American residential wood furniture industry, including numerous small and mid-sized companies across the United States, is being devastated by the surge of unfairly priced imports to China," wrote Senator Allen who joined The Committee for Legal Trade in petitioning both the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to stop the Chinese import practices. 
   "These illegal practices have been particularly damaging for the hardworking people making furniture in Southside and Southwest Virginia," said Senator Allen, who believes such practice by the Chinese violate World Trade Organization rules. "This move protects American furniture companies and their employees by expecting China to play by the same rules as law abiding nations."
