SEN. ALLEN ENCOURAGES EDUCATORS TO APPLY FOR MENTOR GRANT PROGRAM
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Education is accepting applications for the MENTOR grant program which provides funding for mentoring programs in local school systems. Sen.  
 Allen played a key role in securing this funding and making it available to schools across the nation.
   "Improving the educational environment for the children of our nation continues to be one of my top priorities," said Senator Allen. "One of the greatest investments we can make is in educating the next generation, and it is vitally important that our children receive a good educational foundation to prepare them for a lifetime of success."
   The purpose of the MENTOR program is to provide competitive federal grants in order to support organizations that provide high-quality mentoring services to 4th- 8th grade children who live in rural areas, high-crime areas, troubled home environments or who attend schools with violence problems.
   "I encourage all schools - including private schools, faith and community based organizations and partnerships between the two - to apply for this grant. Contact Ethel Henry in my Richmond office at 804-771-2221 or at ethel_henry@allen.senate.gov to receive information on how to develop and write a grant proposal, as well as to request a letter of support for your application." Allen said.
   The application, program guidance and additional information can be found at the Department of Education's website www.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/grantapps/index.html or www.ed.gov/programs/dvpmentoring/applicant.html. Applications must be received by July 7, 2004.
