SEN. ALLEN LAUDS NEW AMERICAN JOB NUMBERS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today lauded the continued growth of our nation's economy as the newly released job figures showed 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the last 12 months with 56,000 coming in the month of October.  
   "Today, we received the encouraging news that the economy has created 1.9 million news jobs in America in the last year," said Senator Allen, "with 56,000 jobs being created in October despite the considerable blows our economy has taken in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the subsequent rise in energy prices. These encouraging numbers show the continued strength and resiliency of our economy. 
   "The lasting economic growth we've seen in our economy demonstrates the importance of tax cuts for individuals, families and small business owners. I believe that these signs of strength and resilience in our economy will bolster business confidence and efforts as we continue working for positive, constructive solutions and action to help create even more jobs and investment growth for the people of this country."
