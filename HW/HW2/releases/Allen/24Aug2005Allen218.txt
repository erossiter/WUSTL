SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON BRAC MANDATES FOR NAS OCEANA'S FUTURE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today issued the following statement on the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's decision to keep Oceana Naval Air Station (NAS) in Virginia Beach, Virginia open with mandates that regional governments and State officials dramatically address perceived encroachment issues.  
   "The BRAC commission has apparently granted NAS Oceana a reprieve from closure," Senator Allen said. "Clearly the numerous stipulations attached to the commission's decision are challenging and I will spend the coming days fully examining these requirements and consulting with local and State officials as to how they are prepared to proceed. 
   "This has the potential to be a painful process and will require regional cooperation, teamwork, great care and cost. I will be analyzing this issue and acting in conjunction with leaders from Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and the Commonwealth of Virginia in our unified effort to save Oceana in the long term. "
