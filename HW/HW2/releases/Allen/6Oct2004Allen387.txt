SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO IMPROVE SCHOOL SAFETY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has awarded a total of $153,852 through the COPS Secure Our Schools program to help five localities improve security at their schools and on their school grounds.  
   "Improving the safety of Virginians is one of my top priorities. Supporting local law enforcement through grants like these will help them make great strides in accomplishing this important mission," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that these hard-working men and women will be better equipped for serving people in their community." 
   The following five agencies received money to enhance school safety: 
   Albemarle County Police Department $30,000 
   Frederick County Sheriff's Department $33,852 
   Hopewell Bureau of Police $10,000 
   City of Manassas $50,000 
   City of Winchester $30,000 
   The Secure Our Schools program will provide up to 50 percent of the total cost for municipalities to install metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other equipment to help deter crime. The grants can also be used to pay half of the cost of security assessments, security training, and other measures that will provide a significant improvement in security.
