   Senator Warner said, "This funding will provide important resources for key projects in Hampton Roads. I am particularly pleased that we were able to continue the work in scrapping the environmentally dangerous ships of the James River Fleet. By the end of this year, all of the high risk ships will be gone, and these funds will move us ever closer to our goal of removing all of the obsolete vessels." 
   "In addition, the funding obtained for An Achievable Dream Academy in Newport News is vital, as this fine school works to close the achievement gap and stands as a national model for such schools." 
   Senator Allen said, "These significant federal funds will help to support and continue efforts to improve the lives of the people of the Hampton Roads area and the Eastern Shore and make this vibrant region a more desirable area for maritime commerce while improving the environment of the Bay and its tributaries." 
   "These projects will provide a number of wonderful educational opportunities for people of all ages in the Hampton Roads area. In addition, there are several projects which will positively affect the health and welfare of the people of the Tidewater region. I'm thrilled that we were able to get significant funding to raise containment dikes and to insure sufficient capacity of Craney Island. This added funding allows Maersk to continue on schedule with its port expansion as well as the essential 50-foot channel dredging. Hampton Roads Harbor and its thousands of related jobs depend on this vital dredge repository. I strongly believe that Craney Island must have the capacity to receive the dredge materials from our Hampton Roads maritime projects." 
   Now passed by the Senate as part of the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, the legislation will await action by the House of Representatives on an enrolling correction which is expected on Wednesday before being sent to the President's desk to be signed into law.
