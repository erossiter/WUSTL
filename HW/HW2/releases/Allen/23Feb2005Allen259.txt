SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $1.1 MILLION GRANT AWARDED TO EASTERN SHORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Economic Development Administration has awarded a grant in the amount of $1,100,000 to Eastern Shore Community College in Melfa, VA (Accomack County) to aid in the construction of a new Business Development and Workforce Training Center.  
 This investment will help create over 300 jobs and attract more than $35 million in private sector investment. 
   "I am excited about this new Training Center on the Eastern Shore because it will extend the resources of the Community College, enhance the education of the local workforce and enlist the skills of many businesses needed to create the facility," said Senator Allen. "I look forward to seeing economic growth and development on the Eastern Shore due to this project." 
   The EDA grant, combined with $2.3 million from the Virginia Community College System, $787,000 in local funds, and $500,000 from US Department of Agriculture Rural Development, provides funds for the estimated cost of the new twenty-one thousand square foot Business Development and Workforce Training Center. The Accomack County Planning District Commission assisted in the grant application process and will administer the funds from the USDA and EDA. 
   The new center will enable the Eastern Shore Community College to expand its workforce training programs and will include state-of-the-art distance learning technology to provide training that specifically focuses on higher skill and wage employment in aerospace, biomedical, telecommunications, and maritime trades. Construction is estimated to begin this year, and the completion of the Training Center is anticipated in 2007.
