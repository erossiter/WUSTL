  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of the Interior under President Bush's Cooperative Conservation Initiative has awarded $350,400 in federal grants to eight Virginia wildlife conservation projects. The Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have partnered with local organizations to make these projects possible. 
   "This program brings federal attention to Virginia's beautiful natural resources by working with local experts whose knowledge and ingenuity are invaluable for the protection of those resources," said Senator Allen. "Enabling Virginia's conservationists to invest time and money into these eight projects ensures that our Commonwealth will be in good hands and stay in good shape."

   * Restoration of Wildlife Habitat on Mason Neck Peninsula $5,100;
   * Removal of Materials from the Mason Neck Peninsula $10,200;
   * Controlling Stiltgrass on the Eastern Shore $5,100.

   The goal of the Cooperative Conservation Initiative is to foster partnerships between federal land managers and local communities to promote the preservation, restoration and enhancement of the land and wildlife through cost-share grants. Local partners will contribute $555,400 in matching funds to the $350,400 in federal grants, bringing the total for the conservation projects to $905,800. The projects supported by these grants have restored millions of acres of habitat, removed harmful exotic species, improved habitats along thousands of miles of streams, conserved limited water resources and developed conservation plans for endangered species and habitats.
