SEN. ALLEN URGES TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY TO REEXAMINE COALFIELDS EXPRESSWAY DECISION
  In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, Sen.  
 George Allen (R-VA) today urged the Federal Highway Administration to re-examine its recent decision ending federal involvement in the 51 mile Virginia Coalfields Expressway. The divided highway would link Wise, Dickenson, and Buchanan Counties to a planned expressway near Paynesville, West Virginia. 
   "In addition to providing a needed modern and safe highway in Southwest Virginia, the Coalfields Expressway is expected to spur economic growth and development for families who want more job opportunities. 
   "As Governor of the Commonwealth, I saw the great potential that the Coalfields Expressway held for access to, from and through this region of Southwest Virginia. I continue to believe strongly that the project is a vital component to improving jobs and commerce opportunities for people in the coalfields as well as a new route for interstate travel," wrote Senator Allen. 
   In addition, Senator Allen directed his staff to work with the Federal Highway Administration, the Virginia Congressional delegation, local and State elected officials and interested members of the public to find a way to bring the project back into compliance with the guidelines established when the project was approved. 
   "I will continue to keep fighting for the good, hardworking people of Wise, Dickenson, and Buchanan counties to finally provide a highway that allows them to attract diversified investment and good paying jobs for workers in the area to provide for themselves and their families. I look forward to talking with my colleagues Senator Warner, Congressman Boucher and Secretary Mineta on finding a way to get the Coalfield Expressway back on track," said Senator Allen.
