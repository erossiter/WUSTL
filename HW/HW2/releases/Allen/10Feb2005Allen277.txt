SEN. ALLEN CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION FOR POSSIBLE CREATION OF JOHN SMITH WATERTRAIL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) this week joined Sens. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), John Warner (R-VA), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to introduce the "Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Watertrail Study Act of 2005."  
 This legislation would explore the possibility of designating the route of Captain John Smith's exploration of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as a National Historic Trail. 
   "The designation of a John Smith Watertrail would expand educational and recreational opportunities, protect natural resources and provide economic growth for our tourism industry," said Senator Allen "The eyes of the world will be on Virginia in 2007 as we commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. The John Smith Watertrail is a fitting tribute to the birthplace of American democracy and the cradle of American liberty." 
   The purpose of the John Smith Watertrail is to help celebrate the 400th anniversary of Jamestown as well as to help focus attention on the Chesapeake Bay through new recreational and educational opportunities. A proposed National Historic Trail must provide for recreational opportunities, be nationally significant and have a documented route through maps and journals. 
   Captain John Smith was a key founder of the settlement at Jamestown, VA. Captain Smith spent three years (1607-1609) exploring and mapping the Chesapeake Bay and it's tributaries in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware covering some 3,000 miles. These maps are some of the most accurate maps of the Bay region.
