SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR RURAL HEALTH OUTREACH AT JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the Department of Health & Human Services has awarded a grant in the amount of $580,654 to James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA as part of the Rural Health Outreach Special Initiative program which works to expand access to, restrain the cost of and improve the quality of essential health care in rural areas.  
   "Providing individuals with a basic education on healthy living and disease prevention is a key aspect to building a healthy community," said Senator Allen. "The Rural Health Outreach Grant Program is making a positive impact on rural families all over Virginia, improving the quality of life by making medical services accessible to those who need it most." 
   This grant allows James Madison University to continue its work with the Virginia Center for Health Outreach. The Center, established within JMU's Institute for Innovation in Health and Human Services, serves a coordinating role to support community health workers and their projects across Virginia. These workers promote health by educating people on disease and injury prevention and by helping community residents understand and access formal health and human service systems. 
   The Rural Health Outreach Grant Program encourages the development of health care strategies for rural areas lacking essential health care services. Using creative strategies, this program emphasizes service delivery to these areas by funding networks that allow rural communities to work on projects such as creating hospice care, bringing health check-ups to children and providing prenatal care to women in remote areas.
