SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA STUDENTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced the students who have been nominated to attend United States Service Academies. 
   "I am honored to have the privilege to nominate these students to our nation's Service Academies," said Senator Allen. "These fine young men and women are the very best of Virginia and I am confident that they will represent our Commonwealth and nation well."  
   The following students from Southwest Virginia received Academy nominations from Senator Allen: 
   * Chester Watts, of Radford, has been nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy. Watts currently attends Radford High School where he is a member of the National Honor Society and a section leader in the band. In addition, Watts is a Virginia Boys State nominee. Watts is the son of Chester and Libby Watts. 
   * Jonathan Wright, of Cedar Bluff, has been nominated to the U.S. Military Academy. Wright currently attends Richlands High School where he is a section leader and Captain in the Marching Band. In addition, he is a member of the National Honor Roll and a Boy Scout. Wright is the son of Kathy Wright 
   Every year, Senator Allen can nominate one up to ten students to each Service Academy, with the exception of the Coast Guard Academy which does not require a congressional nomination for appointment. Senator Allen's nomination process is detailed and highly competitive. After each prospective nominee returns a completed application, Senator Allen's Service Academy Review Board evaluates and interviews the applicants who make it to the final round. The applications, along with the Review Board's recommendations, are then given to Senator Allen who determines the final list of nominees. All nominees must also receive an offer of appointment by their respective Academy in order to gain admission.
