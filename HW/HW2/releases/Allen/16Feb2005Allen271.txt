SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION TO ELEVATE 21 FLOOD-PRONE HOUSES IN CITY OF HAMPTON
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved a grant in the amount of $1,040,990 for the City of Hampton to raise 21 houses above flood level.  
   "Although we cannot be certain of the damage that future flooding may cause, we can work together to be as ready as possible for an emergency," said Senator Allen. "These federal funds will help the Hampton community protect their homes and belongings. I am pleased to see the City, the Commonwealth and FEMA working together to improve the lives of so many families." 
   The 21 houses which will be elevated are on Beach Road, Bonita Drive, Bowen Drive, Canal Point, Canal Road, Dandy Point, Gildner Road, Harbor Drive, Lighthouse Drive, West Preston Street, River View Drive and Windmill Point Road. All are in the floodplain of the Chesapeake Bay, James River and New Market Creek. Under the plan, these houses will be raised from nine and one-half feet to eleven feet, so that all are one foot above the base flood elevation. 
   Hampton will receive $1,040,990, the 75 percent federal share of the $1,387,987 project. In addition, FEMA will provide $5,329 to the Commonwealth of Virginia and $24,880 to Hampton to cover administrative costs of the grant. The money comes from the FEMA Hazard Mitigation grant Program, which funds projects intended to reduce the potential for damage from future disasters.
