SEN. ALLEN DISAPPOINTED ACCUSED UAE EMPLOYEE ALLOWED TO FLEE COUNTRY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) this afternoon expressed great disappointment in the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates for allowing one of its employees to claim diplomatic immunity and then hurriedly leave the U.S. before addressing the criminal accusations against him.  
   "Sheriff Brown and prosecutors in Bedford County have shown great professionalism in their handling of this case. I am greatly disappointed, however, that embassy officials deemed it acceptable to allow their employee and citizen to leave in the midst of negotiations on how to proceed with this matter. Surely no one in either country would suggest that attempting to contact and meet a child for sexual reasons is acceptable. This individual, while innocent until proven guilty, should have faced a trial and the appropriate consequences if convicted. This fleeing strikes me as an inappropriate use of the International laws governing diplomatic immunity. I will continue to communicate with diplomatic officials in Washington to ensure that this fugitive will never be allowed to return to the United States unless he is prepared to stand trial for the charges against him," said Senator Allen.
