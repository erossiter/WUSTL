SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $325,000 RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN AWARDED TO NELSON COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has approved a loan of $325,000 for the Nelson County Service Authority to construct a water impoundment facility and an on-site water treatment facility which will serve approximately 2,500 residences and 40 businesses.  
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Nelson County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans is to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
