SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $150,000 RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT AWARDED TO HIGHLAND COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded an emergency and imminent community water assistance grant of $150,000 to the Town of Monterey in Highland County to make repairs to the town's existing water system.  
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Highland County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   Repairs are needed in Monterey as a result of the drought suffered during 2002. Improvements include placing a third well into production and rehabilitation of the existing water storage tanks and will serve approximately 253 residences and 12 businesses. 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans are to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
