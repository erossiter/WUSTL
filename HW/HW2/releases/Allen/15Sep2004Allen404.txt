SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $2.7 MILLION GRANT FOR RICHMOND ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE JOBS TRAINING IN LIBERIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Agency for International Development has awarded a cooperative agreement grant in the amount of $2,677,000 to the Christian Children's Fund in Richmond, VA to provide a major vocational skills training program and other assistance for women and children affected by the war in Liberia.  
   "By providing job training and medical assistance, the good folks at the Christian Children's Fund are playing a key role in getting families back on their feet in Liberia," said Senator Allen. "It's good to know that Virginians are being positioned to help those who are in desperate need." 
   With this new USAID grant, Christian Children's Fund (CCF) will assist 3,000 women and children as part of the community reintegration and rebuilding process. Specifically, grant beneficiaries will include 750 women associated with fighting forces, 1,500 children associated with fighting forces and 750 war-affected children who were non-combatants. The three-year program will also include literacy training, mentorship with skilled craftsmen, creation of new jobs, job placement and psychosocial support for women and children. 
   CCF has been working in Liberia since October of 2003, when a UN brokered ceasefire halted 14 years of civil war. As a lead child protection agency partnering with UNICEF, CCF has established six interim care centers for children, providing literacy training, sports, recreation, psychosocial interventions, pre-vocational training, medical assistance and reuniting children with their surviving family members.
