SEN. ALLEN MOURNS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S DEATH
  Today, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) released the following statement on the death of former President Ronald Reagan: 
   "Susan and I mourn the loss of one of America's greatest leaders and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Reagan family after the 10 year ordeal they have endured with the President's illness. Just as she was in The White House, Nancy Reagan has been a symbol of grace and dignity as she cared for her husband and we wish her strength and peace in this moment of sadness.
   "On a personal note, I am moved today because Ronald Reagan is the man who inspired me to enter into politics while I was a law student at The University of Virginia. Although we have lost President Reagan in body today, his indomitable spirit of optimism and trust in the goodness of free men and women will be with us for generations. Ronald Reagan's determination and strength truly changed our nation and our world for the better. There are millions of people around the globe who are living in freedom today because Ronald Reagan had the courage to stand up against oppression and communism when others lacked the fortitude to do so. His legacy is a freer world and a generation of Americans who recommitted themselves to the important principles that made this nation great.
   "I grieve today for the loss of my modern day philosophical hero. But I am forever grateful that America, and indeed the world, was blessed with his common sense leadership and unwavering commitment to expanding freedom and democracy throughout the world."
