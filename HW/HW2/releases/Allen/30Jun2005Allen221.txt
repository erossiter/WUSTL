SEN. ALLEN LAUDS 'SALUTE AMERICA'S HEROES' ORGANIZATION
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today hosted an event at Russell Park in Washington, D.C. to salute America's heroes in uniform.  
 The Senator was joined by representatives of The Coalition to Salute America's Heroes, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia which provides severely wounded War on Terror veterans the assistance they need to reestablish a normal life. This 4th of July holiday weekend, the coalition will be selling awareness bracelets for $2; funds from the sales will be used to provide emergency financial aid, family support services and job training and placement for wounded soldiers who've recently returned to the U.S. from service in the War on Terror. 
   Senator Allen was joined by B.J. Jackson, a national spokesperson for The Coalition to Salute America's Heroes. Jackson was a National Guard soldier who lost both his legs below the knees in August 2003 after his vehicle struck a land mine and was hit with a rocket propelled grenade in Baghdad. Jackson had been a roofer before he was deployed to Iraq. 
   "As President Bush suggested in his national address this week, I think it's important this July 4th weekend that all Americans look for ways to honor our men and women in uniform. These awareness bracelets are a great way for Americans on our Independence Day to publicly thank and support our troops, particularly those who have sacrificed so much," Senator Allen said.
