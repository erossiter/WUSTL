STANDING STRONG FOR JOBS
  On May 17, Sen. Allen, Rep. Virgil Goode and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Nat Wienecke hold up a check for $6 million to fund broadband development in Southside Virginia. The funds made up one of the largest grants in the Commerce Department's history. "Today's announcement is a giant leap forward for Southside Virginia to reap the benefits of the Silicon Dominion that has made Virginia a hub for technology and investment. This empowering grant is projected to create 1,560 new jobs and $70.2 million in new wages from the $143 million in projected new investments," Rep. Allen said.
