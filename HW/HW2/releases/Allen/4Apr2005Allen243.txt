SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES TRANSPORTATION GRANT TO TWIN COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a total of $950,000 to the Twin County Airport for projects that will enhance the efficiency, safety and value of the airport.  
   "The Twin County Airport is vital asset to the Carroll County, Grayson County and the City of Galax," said Senator Allen. "When we make improvements to the airport, we are promoting Southwest Virginia as an attractive and accessible place for investment and jobs." 
   The funds will be used to provide an additional crosswind component to the existing runway by increasing the width from 60 feet to 75 feet. This project will help the airport meet design standards and improve safety. 
   The Airport Improvement Program is a federal grant-in-aid program that represents a major source of funding for airport development and planning.
