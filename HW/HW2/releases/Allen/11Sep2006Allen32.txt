SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11TH ATTACKS ON AMERICA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement as the United States marks the 5th Anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  
   "On September 11, 2001 the lives of all Americans changed as radical terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon," said Senator Allen. "As we mark the fifth anniversary of that day we do so with heavy hearts as we reflect on the loss of friends, family and loved ones. Across our nation today we will remember those who were lost and honor those who died while trying to help others. 
   "While that day brought great tragedy to our nation it also showed the strong will and resolve of the American people. On this anniversary I ask that all Americans renew their commitment to remain strong and vigilant as we continue to fight a war on terror against the hate-filled, radical, extremists who attacked us that day. The future may be difficult but we must be resolved in the outcome in this war on terror. We win, they lose and there is no substitute for victory. 
   "Today I will attend a Memorial Service at the Pentagon and join the families of so many Virginians who lost loved ones in the attack there. To all the men, women and children who have suffered since that day you have my promise that I will join with leaders of goodwill from both parties and do everything I can to protect this nation and her people.
   "I will continue to support our nation's effort to defeat those who so vehemently attacked us on September 11, 2001 and will work in Congress to provide our military and intelligence agencies with the tools and resources that are necessary to win this war."
