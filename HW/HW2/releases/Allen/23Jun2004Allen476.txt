  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement after the Senate confirmed Walter DeKalb Kelley, Jr. by a vote of 94-0 to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia: 
   "Today, I was extremely pleased to see Walt Kelley's strong confirmation vote by the U.S. Senate to serve as a federal judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. 
   "Walt Kelley is an outstanding individual who understands the proper role of a judge, to adjudicate disputes based upon the evidence and the law; not invent new law. I believe he has both the experience and the temperament to be an outstanding judge for many decades to come in the Norfolk division of the Eastern District of Virginia. 
   "I have known Walt for a long period of time now and he has always impressed me. No matter the situation, no matter how fractious things might be, Walt always has a good, steady demeanor. In addition, I believe he has the necessary experience and judicial philosophy to make an outstanding judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. I'll be proud to support and watch him as a judge."
