SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEAD START PROJECTS IN FRANKLIN
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant in the amount of $289,152 to The Children's Center in Franklin, VA for the continuation of their work with children and parents involved with the Early Head Start program.  
   "The people in the city of Franklin are making a significant impact on families in their area through the Early Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Early Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life." 
   More specifically, this grant will allow The Children's Center to continue their comprehensive child-focused development programs that are designed to serve the children of low-income families. In all of their programs, Early Head Start focuses on incorporating parents, community, and students as partners in education.
