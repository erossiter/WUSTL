SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today issued the following statement regarding the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina:  
   "All of America's hearts and prayers are with the people of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as they endure the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I'm grateful for all the emergency personnel who have been working around the clock this week to assist and save the victims of this devastating storm and subsequent flooding. The police, healthcare, National Guard and indeed all emergency workers are true heroes and they are doing everything they can in an extremely difficult situation. 
   "America is a good and compassionate country. Last night, Congress passed $10.5 billion in emergency aid for disaster relief. Today, there are many who are wondering what they can do personally to help their fellow citizens in need. I encourage Virginians and all Americans who are capable to donate to the Red Cross, Salvation Army and other charities who can lend a helping hand in the effected areas. 
   "In this time of great heartbreak for our country, it's important that we stand behind our leaders as they respond to this catastrophic situation. The people of New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast need Americans to stand together in our efforts to relieve their pain and suffering. The strength of this great nation comes from its citizens and I believe America will rise to meet this extraordinary challenge."
