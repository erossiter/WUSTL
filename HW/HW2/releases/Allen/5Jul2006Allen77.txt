SEN. ALLEN URGES U.S. TO KEEP UP GUARD; REASSURES ALLIES
  As a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. George Allen (R-VA) this morning continued to watch developments in N. Korea as at least seven ballistic missiles were test fired into the Sea of Japan including one long range weapon in an act that Sen. Allen called "provocation" by a "repressive regime" and reminds "us of the need for an effective missile defense system." 
  "Beginning with yesterday's launch and further test-firings today, I am urging the U.S. and our allies to keep up our guard and stay calm in the face of this provocatory ineptitude. We should assure our trusted allies, especially the Japanese of our determination to defend them," said Senator Allen.
  One of the missiles fired by N. Korea was its Taepodong-2, capable of carrying a warhead to Alaska. That missile failed, falling into the sea separating the Korean peninsula from Japan. In early May, Senator Allen met with the South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Tae-Sik Lee. In that meeting, Senator Allen reiterated his strong support of South Korea and reaffirmed his commitment to our allies in the region.
  "Any missile that potentially threatens America or our allies," Senator Allen said today, "should be intercepted, if possible. This provocative action by the repressive North Korean regime is another indication of their recalcitrance. This action also is a test of the genuineness and reliability of China's leaders who prop up the N. Korean regime. Their tangible reaction will be telling of their true intentions"
