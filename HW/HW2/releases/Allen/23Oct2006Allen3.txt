SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT AWARDED TO GALAX POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Bureau of Justice, a component of the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs, has awarded a grant of $2,307.50 to the Galax Police Department for the purchase of bullet-resistant vests.  
   "Even before my days as Governor, the safety and security of our nation and its citizens has been one of my top priorities," said Senator Allen. "Galax police officers will be better prepared to prevent criminal activity with these resources to protect themselves when confronted with dangerous situations in the line of duty. I am pleased that these federal funds will allow officers' friends and families to rest assured that they are well protected as they perform their duties." 
   Chief of Police Rick Clark responded very enthusiastically when informed of this funding. "The $78,000 we have received so far this year in grant funding we have heard about through Senator Allen's office," he said. "We are grateful for his efforts to keep us abreast of the grant opportunities available to us and then assisting us in acquiring those we are eligible for. These vests will offer protection and security for the families and officers of the Galax Police Department." 
   The Galax Police Department will receive matching funds from the local community to bring the total funding to $4,615, allowing for the purchase of 8 pairs of concealable body armor and 3 pairs of tactical body armor for the local officers.
