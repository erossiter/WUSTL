SEN. ALLEN TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR OCEANA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today responded to the announcement by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense that Virginia Beach has not met the federal BRAC requirements to keep jet operations fully functional and the Master Jet Base open at Naval Air Station Oceana. Below is Sen. Allen's statement: 
  "The Deputy Inspector General has examined this situation with very strict scrutiny and has not allowed much latitude. There were six criteria and five and half of those six criteria were met. I think Virginia Beach took an extraordinarily creative approach, sticking to the principles that really reflect the views of the people of Virginia Beach, and actually put together and adopted, working with the State government, a very effective plan to acquire the property around Oceana. Most importantly as far as the criteria that are in this agreement, they have come up with the 15 million dollars a year to voluntarily purchase those properties.
  "The legal saga of the BRAC process and Oceana continues but the base remains open and fully operational. One other thing that's going to continue will be my efforts to ensure that Oceana stays open for generations to come. I will join the entire Virginia Congressional delegation, the State legislature, the Governor, and the Attorney General in doing whatever we can to keep Oceana open as the Master Jet Base for the Eastern part of our country. It is co-located perfectly close to the fleet and the Navy wants to stay there and those facts and attributes do not change with today's ruling. Neither does our resolve to do whatever we can to keep Oceana serving the national security of our country, training the next generation of U.S. Naval Aviators and also being the neighbor that all of us appreciate in the South Hampton Roads area."
