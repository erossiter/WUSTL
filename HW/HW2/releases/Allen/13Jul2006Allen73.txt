SEN. ALLEN PRAISES DISASTER FUNDS FOR VIRGINIA RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY RECENT FLOODINGS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today enthusiastically welcomed news that President Bush has officially declared Northern and Western Virginia counties hit hard by last month's torrential floods as "Disaster" areas. The designation means that residents affected by the heavy rains in June will be able to receive federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Shortly after the storms, Sen. Allen joined the members of the Virginia Congressional Delegation and Gov. Tim Kaine in requesting such assistance from the President. 
   "I'm extremely pleased that deserving families in Northern and Western Virginia will be able to get financial assistance for the terrible damage they suffered due to these floods," Sen. Allen said. Original estimates indicated that the disastrous floodwaters caused more than $22 million dollars in damage in Northern and Western Virginia .
   "As a former Governor, I know firsthand the importance and positive impact federal assistance can have for individuals, families, and businesses after such emergencies. It's vitally important that we help these folks in Northern and Western Virginia get back on their feet and so they can clean up their homes and businesses," said Senator Allen .
