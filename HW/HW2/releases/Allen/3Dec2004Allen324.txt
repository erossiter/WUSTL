SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $38 MILLION IN HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS DESIGNATED TO VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is now accepting applications for a new round of grants as part of the Homeland Security Grant Program. Through this program, Virginia's emergency prevention, preparedness and response personnel will receive over $38 million in grant funding to enhance and improve our nation's homeland security efforts.  
   "In today's world we have to be prepared for whatever rolls our way. Grants like these help us to be better equipped for responding to emergency situations," said Senator Allen. "As Virginia continues to be a leader in security, preparedness and dedication to safety, I encourage localities and organizations to take advantage of this federal assistance by applying for these grants" 
   The Homeland Security Grant Program provides a single application kit and program guidance for the following grant programs: 
   * State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) - Formula grants to prevent, respond to and recover from acts of terrorism. Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) - To assist selected high-threat, high-density urban areas in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to prevent, respond to and recover from acts of terrorism. Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) - To support prevention activities such as information sharing, target hardening, threat recognition, interoperable communications and interdiction. 
   * Citizen Corps Program (CCP) - To support activities involving citizens in prevention, preparedness, and response to terrorism, natural disasters and other threats. 
   * Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) - To support comprehensive state and local emergency management as well improve mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery for all hazards. 
   * Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) - To support local jurisdiction enhancement and sustainment of integrated, systematic preparedness to response to mass casualty events during initial response. 
   These six programs have been integrated into a single FY05 application to better facilitate the management of state and local homeland security funding as well as to coordinate prevention, preparedness and response efforts across the nation. 
   Local jurisdictions and organizations must apply in coordination with the Commonwealth of Virginia and submit their applications by January 16, 2005.
