SENATE PASSES SEN. ALLEN BILL SUPPORTING TAIWAN 'OBSERVER STATUS' IN WHO
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the Senate's passage last night of his resolution (S. 2092) in support of Taiwan receiving 'observer status' in the World Health Organization's (WHO) upcoming World Health Assembly meeting. 
   "It is tantamount to medical malpractice to continue to exclude Taiwan's participation in the assessment, treatment and cure of the world's dangerous diseases," Allen said. "The People's Republic of China should care more about addressing diseases than political pride. As Co-Chairman of the Senate Taiwan Caucus, I am very pleased that the Senate has approved this important effort to grant WHO 'observer status' to Taiwan. I believe that the entire world health community will benefit greatly from Taiwan's valuable participation at the World Health Assembly as the world community of nations combats diseases, particularly SARS in East Asia."
   Senator Allen's legislation calls on the Secretary of State to endorse and obtain 'observer status' for Taiwan at the week-long summit of the 2004 World Health Assembly, which will begin on May 17th, in Geneva, Switzerland. The bill also includes a multi-year provision that stipulates that the U.S. will continue to endorse 'observer status' for Taiwan in future years.
