   Every year, Senator Allen can nominate one up to ten students to each Service Academy, with the exception of the Coast Guard Academy which does not require a congressional nomination for appointment. Senator Allen's nomination process is detailed and highly competitive. After each prospective nominee returns a completed application, Senator Allen's Service Academy Review Board evaluates and interviews the applicants who make it to the final round. The applications, along with the Review Board's recommendations, are then given to Senator Allen who determines the final list of nominees. All nominees must also receive an offer of appointment by their respective Academy in order to gain admission.
