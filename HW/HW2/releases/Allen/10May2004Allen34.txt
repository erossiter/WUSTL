SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $25,000 RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT AWARDED TO BATH COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program has awarded a Community Facility Grant in the amount of $25,000 to Millboro Area Rescue Squad, Inc in Bath County to purchase a rescue squad crash vehicle.  
 Because the nearby Dominion Power plant and dam presents a possible terrorist target, this purchase will better equip the county for emergency preparedness in case of a disaster.
   "These federal funds will allow the folks in Bath County to expand the resources available to the men and women who serve the community as first responders" said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide needed support to improve the safety of Virginians."
   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, childcare, hospitals, medical clinics, assisted living facilities, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, public buildings and transportation. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
