SENS. ALLEN, WARNER VOW TO FIGHT FOR AERONAUTICS RESEARCH
  Sens. George Allen (R-VA) and John Warner (R-VA) today, along with Sens.  
 George Voinovich (R-OH), Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Chris Dodd (D-CT), signed onto a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) requesting increased funding for the NASA Aeronautics account. 
   "I have always advocated for funding and programs that increase our productivity and competitiveness," Allen said. "The work that is done at NASA Aeronautics, particularly at Langley, is essential for our nation to stay on the cutting edge of aircraft development. I believe that to cut these programs would seriously undermine America's ability to compete militarily and commercially as the next generation of aircraft is developed." 
   The Senators' letter noted that increased funding was 'essential' for U.S. competitiveness and national security. Since 1998, aeronautics funding has been reduced by 50%. European competitors now lead U.S. firms in the global aviation market. 
   "I think that increasing aeronautics funding from the proposed budget amount is necessary and beneficial for our Commonwealth and America; I will always fight for Virginia jobs and the future security and competitiveness of this nation," Allen added. 
   "The recent decline in investment in NASA basic research, especially aeronautics R&D, has contributed to the loss of thousands of jobs in the aviation industry," said Senator Warner, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Reversing this decline in funding would help America continue its important leadership in space travel and military aviation."
