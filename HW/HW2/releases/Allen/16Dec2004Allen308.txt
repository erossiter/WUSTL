  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant in the amount of $227,833 to STEP, Inc in Rocky Mount, VA for the continuation of its work with children and parents involved with the Head Start program.  
   "STEP is making a significant impact on families in their area through the Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life."
