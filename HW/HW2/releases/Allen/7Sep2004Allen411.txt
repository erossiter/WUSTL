SEN. ALLEN URGES SENATE PASSAGE OF EMERGENCY FEMA FUNDING
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate recalling the destruction caused last week as Tropical Storm Gaston crossed through Central Virginia.  
 Allen inspected the damage during a visit to Richmond and Chesterfield County yesterday. 
   "It is important that we all come together as quickly and expeditiously as possible to assist these individuals and business owners who have a lot of worrisome hurt, a lot of work to do, but also a great deal of spirit," Allen said. "It [Shockoe Bottom in Richmond] is one of the first cities in our country and I think as they clean up and get back in business it'll be stronger than ever. The SBA is out of money and this bill includes 30 million dollars for their assistance to business owners like the men and women I met yesterday." 
   Upon passage, the supplemental funding will secure two billion dollars in funding for FEMA and the Small Business Administration to use for relief in Virginia, Florida and other States affected by recent storms. 
   "This funding is going to be key to the clean up and restoration of the historic Shockoe Bottom area and the industrial and residential sites affected in the surrounding areas. Most importantly this emergency funding will keep the commitments made by our federal government to be supportive of citizens in times of crisis," Allen said.
