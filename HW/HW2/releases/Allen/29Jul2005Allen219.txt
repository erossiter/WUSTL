SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO SHENANDOAH REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a grant in the amount of $1,963,147 to the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport Commission for renovations and repairs on their air field.  
   "The Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport is vital to the economy of the surrounding communities," said Senator Allen. "It's important to keep this airport in top condition so that its staff can continue to generate business and create jobs through out the valley while maintaining a standard of excellence in safety and service." 
   The funds will be used to repair and repave Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport's twenty five year old taxi-way, the final project in the airport's airfield renovations. 
   The Airport Improvement Program is a federal grant-in-aid program that represents a major source of funding for airport development and planning.
