SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HIS DECISION TO REGRETFULLY DECLINE THURGOOD MARSHALL SCHOLARSHIP FUND AWARD
  On August 3rd Sen. George Allen (R-VA) was honored to receive word that the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund had decided to honor him, along with four others, with their 2006 Community Leadership Award recognizing his leadership on behalf of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Today Sen. Allen was also informed that some individuals and groups have objected to this honor and have threatened to withhold donations from the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund and potentially damage the future of the students who benefit from the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund. Because of this disturbing news Senator Allen has issued the following statement: 
   "While I am very honored to have been chosen to receive this prestigious award it has come to my attention that there are some during this election year who plan to exploit my selection and do harm to the fundraising efforts of the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund. I believe in this program and in the importance of our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities to educate the next generation of American entrepreneurs, teachers, engineers, chemists, technicians and leaders. I regret that there are those who would put their personal or political dislike of me ahead of the needs of deserving students and I do not want to be the cause of any controversy which could in any way harm the efforts to help these young people. For that reason I have decided to decline the award with a true thank you to those who chose to honor me and with the promise that I will continue to be a leader for America's HBCUs. I hope this action will demonstrate my sincere commitment to our common goal of making America a land of opportunity for all of her citizens regardless of their race, ethnicity or gender."
