SEN. ALLEN HAILS CO-OP PURCHASE OF PILGRIM'S PRIDE PLANT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised efforts to save hundreds of jobs in the Shenandoah Valley through the purchase of the Pilgrim's Pride plant by the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative.  
 The co-op announced the purchase following a promise of financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   "This is great news for nearly 1,300 employees of Pilgrim's Pride who faced the prospect of losing their jobs if a solution could not be reached," said Senator Allen who last month met with Sonny Meyerhoeffer, chairman of the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative. Pilgrim's Pride announced last Spring that it planned to shutdown the processing plant if it could not find a buyer. 
   Senator Allen worked to find funding sources including available USDA financial assistance to help the co-operative complete the $35-million dollar purchase price. "This shows real resourcefulness by caring community leaders and turkey producers concerned about a potential loss of jobs and the need to secure the future of this industry in Virginia. This public private partnership works for the good of hard working men and women whose families and communities depend on the jobs that this plant provides. I congratulate Sonny and his group for being persistent in finding a solution to save these jobs in the Shenandoah Valley. It was a pleasure to work with the group knowing how many hardworking people and their families were depending on our success in this creative effort," said Senator Allen.
