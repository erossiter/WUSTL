  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today applauded last night's Senate Confirmation of Sean Connaughton to be the new administrator of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration. 
   "I have no doubt that this is the beginning of a great new era for MARAD as Sean begins as its new leader" said Senator Allen. "I have known Sean for years and have every faith in his abilities. His vast experience as both an elected official in Virginia and as a graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy make him an outstanding choice to head the Maritime Administration.
