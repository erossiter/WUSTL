SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA PROJECTS IN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that vital funding needed for a number of important projects in the Commonwealth of Virginia are included in the Defense Appropriations Bill.
   "The top responsibility of the Federal Government is our national defense. These projects will help to advance the readiness of our men and women in uniform to make sure that they have the most technologically-advanced weapons and armaments," Senator Allen said.  
   The following Virginia projects are included in the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Bill which is waiting for final approval by the Senate: 
   * $10 million to Aerojet (formally ARC) in Gainesville to fund the High Speed Anti-Radiation Demonstration (HSAD) program to develop and demonstrate an advanced weapon capable of engaging and destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses and other high priority time critical targets. 
   * $2 million to Bea Maurer in Fairfield for rapidly deploying shelter systems to be utilized as Combat Operations Centers (COCs) for the U.S. Marine Corps. 
   * $3 million to the Ethyl Corporation in Richmond to fund the Manganese Health Research Program (MHRP) which develops an improved understanding of the relationship between exposure to manganese and health effects. 
   * $2 million to General Dynamics in Arlington to fund the SOLIC Special Reconnaissance Program to expand its capability to identify the threat posed by the increased amount of data coming from foreign countries over American telephonic and data networks. This foreign data can potentially be used against American economic and governmental entities. 
   * $10 million to fund the environmentally safe disposal of ships, such as the 38 in the James River National Defense Reserve Fleet. 
   * $4 million to Anteon Corporation in Fairfax to fund the Fluorescence Activated Sensing Technology (FAST) Chem/Bio Integrated Threat Management System, which provides rapid, simultaneous detection and identification of at least 20 biological agents, chemicals and toxins. 
   * $2 million Alion Science and Technology (located in Maryland), Prime Photonics, University of Virginia and Carilion Biomedical Institute in Charlottesville, Blacksburg and Roanoke to fund the Automated Medical Emergency Intravascular Access (AutoCath) system which permits rapid intravascular access for emergency interventions ranging from simple fluid replacement and blood product delivery to advanced capabilities for targeted organ hypothermia and delayed resuscitation. 
   * $7 million to Magellan in Richmond to fund the optimization of the M5 fiber production process. The M5 fiber is a new ultra high performance fiber which shows great promise to reduce battlefield casualties when integrated into body armor.

   * $6.5 million to The Institute of Advanced Learning in Danville to fund the Joint Unmanned Systems Test and Research Center (JOUSTER Center) which will be the first test and research joint site and center dedicated to the scientifically based evaluation, comparison and development of UGA systems and software and to the integration of such systems with small, low flying UAVs. 
   * $1.5 million to Argon Engineering Associates in Fairfax to fund the Anti-Terrorism Technology Surveillance System (ATTSS) to provide low cost detection and geolocation sensors for shore sites using Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies and sophisticated software and firmware. 
   * $3.5 million to General Motors Corporation at Ft. Belvoir to provide the military with operational knowledge of state of the art hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and further the understanding of hydrogen as a transportation fuel in an overall plan for a 21st Century Military Base Concept.
