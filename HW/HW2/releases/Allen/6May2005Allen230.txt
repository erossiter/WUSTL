   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, childcare, hospitals, medical clinics, assisted living facilities, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, public buildings and transportation. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
