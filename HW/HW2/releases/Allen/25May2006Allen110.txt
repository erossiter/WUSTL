SEN. ALLEN STANDS AGAINST REWARDING ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today voted against the massive and convoluted Immigration Reform bill that extends amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. In casting his "no" vote on the complex and complicated three-tiered scheme to reward those who have come into this country illegally, Senator Allen stated that "we are a nation of immigrants, and a nation of laws. Both ideals can be achieved in a compassionate, appropriate and effective way, but this bill falls well short of that goal."
  For many months, Senator Allen has talked with not only Virginians, but many Americans about their concerns over the massive influx of illegal immigrants into our country who have flaunted the nation's laws. Like many citizens, Senator Allen believes that the federal government has failed in its primary responsibility to secure its borders saying, "A nation that cannot control its own borders, cannot control its own destiny." 
  Throughout debate on the bill, Senator Allen has made it clear that his top priority was to secure the borders through more enforcement, border patrol personnel, detention centers capacity, as well as actual and virtual fences. He voted and supported various amendments to enhance border security, make sure that felons and criminals are not given citizenship, protect the integrity of Social Security, establish English as the official language of the United States, and other reasonable changes to the legislation. However, in the end, Senator Allen made it clear that the measure voted on today fell short of and violated his principles.
  "This is a country that has been settled, built and improved by immigrants and it will continue to be. My mother is an immigrant, so I appreciate the value of immigrants to our country. However, the reality is that this bill that we voted on today did not meet my two foundational principles: First, I believe the American people deserve borders that are secure. If we don't secure the border, none of the reforms included in this bill will have any meaningful impact whatsoever. We need to stop the flow of illegals across our border and get it down to a trickle. Second, we should not reward illegal behavior. If the U.S. government rewards illegal behavior with amnesty, we'll get more illegal behavior," Senator Allen stated during a news conference this morning.
  Among the amendments that Senator Allen supported during this debate:
  * Increasing the mileage of permanent fencing and barriers;
   * Prohibiting felons and those convicted of 3 misdemeanors and illegal immigrants who overstay deportation orders from gaining legal citizenship;
   * Protecting American workers by requiring the Department of Labor to attest that no American is able to take a job before a "guest worker" is eligible for a green card;
   * Establishing English as national language of the United States;
   * Improving integrity of Social Security by ensuring that illegal immigrants don't receive Social Security benefits for work done while they were illegal;
   * Codifying President Bush's call for National Guardsmen to backup Border Patrol surveillance and operations;
  "This bill is amnesty. There is no doubt about it. The best source I point to is Ed Meese who was Attorney General during the Reagan Administration the last time such a bill was passed. He said about this bill, 'we called it amnesty twenty years ago. This is amnesty now. At least we were honest about what we called it twenty years ago,'" said Senator Allen. 
  Senator Allen remains hopeful and optimistic that the Congress can eventually devise a true, immigration reform bill that "respects the rule of law and makes sure that we have a government that reflects the values and views of those people I talk to out there in the real world who desire meaningful immigration reform that secures our borders, does not reward illegal behavior and allows those who want to come to this country legally to make a better life for themselves and their family to do so as my mother did after World War II."
