SEN. ALLEN'S HOMESTEAD PRESERVATION ACT PASSES IN SENATE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the final passage of his legislation, the Homestead Preservation Act, as an amendment to the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill, which passed last night in the Senate. The legislation will provide home-mortgage assistance to workers who lose their jobs as a result of international competition. 
   "I'm extremely pleased to see passage of this commonsense, compassionate legislation which will help working families, who through no fault of their own, are adversely affected by international competition," Allen said. "The Homestead Preservation Act will provide hardworking Americans and their families with vital temporary financial assistance that will enable them to keep their homes and protect their credit ratings as they work toward strengthening and updating their skills and continue their search for a new job." 
   Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act: 
   * Authorizes the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to administer a low-interest loan program (loans of 4 percent), for workers displaced due to international competition, for up to the amount of 12 monthly mortgage payments. The program is authorized at $10 million per year for five years. 
   * Distributes the loan through an account, providing monthly allocations to cover the amount of the worker's mortgage payment. 
   * Allows for a loan-duration of up to one year, or after the borrower has worked full-time for six consecutive months. Repayment would be completed after five years. The loans are available only for the cost of a monthly mortgage payment and cover only workers who are displaced due to international competition. 
   * Requires individuals to be: certified that they have been adversely impacted by international competition; a borrower under a loan which requires the individual to make monthly mortgage payments on a primary residence; and enrolled in a job training or job assistance program. 
   "Although we've seen tremendous job creation these last twelve months in the economy as a whole, these have been uneasy times for those who have lost their jobs in the manufacturing industry. I've been particularly concerned about the men and women who have lost their jobs in Southside and Southwest Virginia. Indeed, many regions across the country with heavy concentrations in manufacturing - especially the textile, apparel and furniture industries - have been hard hit. Understanding no government program or assistance can substitute for a secure, well-paying job, I believe the U.S. government can reasonably assist families with legislation such as this as they transition from one career to another," Allen said. 
   "The tobacco quota buyout passed yesterday in the Senate will also help people in Southside and Southwest Virginia communities. Between falling tobacco revenues and manufacturing job losses, Southside Virginia has been hit hard these past five years. I will keep advancing positive solutions from the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville to Rural Broadband to allow Virginians in these regions to compete and succeed," Allen added.
