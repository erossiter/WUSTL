SEN. ALLEN LAUDS AGREEMENT TO ELIMINATE CHINA'S ILLEGAL TAX DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AMERICAN COMPANIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today voiced strong support for the announcement by the U.S. Trade Representative that China will eliminate its Value Added Tax (VAT) on imported semiconductors, which had placed the country in violation of its World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations. 
   "This settlement, at long last, levels the playing field for the global semiconductor community by forcing China to play by the same rules as law abiding nations," Senator Allen said. "In recent years, the industry has experienced great difficulty as a result of a number of illegal trade subsidies. With China now agreeing to meet its WTO obligations and finally providing fair and equitable access to its market, I am hopeful that U.S. manufacturers can once again compete without facing discriminatory taxation.
   Currently, China charges a 17% VAT on all semiconductors sold in the country. However, if the semiconductors are designed and/or produced in China, the government provides an 11%-14% rebate. This preferential trade practice makes it nearly impossible for foreign firms to access the Chinese market unless they agree to manufacture in the country. Today's decision will end the practice of tax discrimination for semiconductor business in China.
   "It is important realize that trade barriers like the one China has agreed to eliminate can cost American jobs. China has a dubious record for adhering to its international trade agreements and has in some cases cheated to gain an advantage. I commend USTR for its work to right this inequity and help protect the jobs of hundreds of Virginians and thousands of Americans."
