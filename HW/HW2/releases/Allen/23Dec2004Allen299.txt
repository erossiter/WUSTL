SEN. ALLEN CALLS FOR SOLDIERS' DEATH GRATUITY TO BE RAISED
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today urged Congress to do more to help the families of soldiers killed in action by raising what is called the "Death Gratuity" to $100,000. The benefit is a cash payment to the survivor of soldiers killed in battle to help them cope with their immediate needs following the loss of their loved one. Currently, families receive $12,000 under the program.  
   "I think the people of a grateful nation want to be able to help the families who lose their sons or daughters in defense of our freedoms. The current amount of $12,000 is a miserly and paltry amount that I strongly believe should be much higher. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue when the 109th Congress convenes in January," said Senator Allen. 
   The Death Gratuity is a tax-exempt payment that provides immediate cash to Active, Guard and Reserve troops killed in combat zones. In January 2005, the amount will be increased to $12,420 which is a 3.5% increase. 
   "Clearly, that is not enough for families to be able to start putting their lives back together. I guarantee you that any family would rather have their loved one over any amount of money, but $12,000 is too low to deal with funeral arrangements, the loss of a breadwinner and all the associated burdens of losing a spouse, father, or mother," said Senator Allen. 
   To adjust the amount, Senator Allen plans to work with other Senators who have similar interests to introduce a bill that can be moved quickly through Congress. He hopes that an adjustment would be created retroactively to extend back to September 11, 2001. However, specifics of any legislation won't be worked-out until after the 109th Congress convenes on January 4, 2005.
