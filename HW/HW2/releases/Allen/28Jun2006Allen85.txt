SEN. ALLEN HAILS VICTORIES IN TELECOM BILL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today hailed the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee passage of the Communications, Consumers' Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act which included four key amendments that Sen. Allen sponsored. The Communications, Consumers' Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act will now move to the Senate floor after passing committee by a 15-7 vote. 
   The four amendments which Senator Allen sponsored include:
   * Ban access taxes on the Internet by a permanent extension of the Internet Tax Moratorium.
   * Protect children from online pornography by making it more difficult for children to access sexually explicit websites.
   * Facilitate the development of wireless broadband Internet access by allocating certain areas within the broadcast spectrum known as "white spaces" that are otherwise unassigned or unused.
   * Define the term "facilities-based" with regards to IP-enabled voice services to ensure VoIP providers can interconnect with other telephone providers and therefore, compete on a level playing field with other services.
  Senator Allen released the following statement concerning the bill's passage:
  "Today's decisions in the Senate Commerce Committee are victories for American taxpayers, consumers, businesses and for all of us who want to insure that the latest communications technologies are harnessed to expand services and to keep our children safe from vile online pornographers who target children. 
  "With the committee's acceptance of the permanent Internet tax moratorium we are now one step closer to keeping the Internet free from avaricious State and local tax commissars who have tried to saddle consumers with higher Internet bills which would have slowed down the spread of high speed Internet and thereby exacerbated the economic digital divide in our country. 
  "As a parent of three children, I am especially gratified to see the inclusion of an amendment I cosponsored that will make it illegal for online pornographers to show explicit sexual images on their home page. This amendment will also stop vile pornographers from tricking children into visiting their sites with words that are designed to attract innocent young people.
  "The addition of the Wireless Innovation Act will unleash the power of advanced technological innovations and allow valuable unused "white spaces" to facilitate the development of wireless broadband Internet services. Anyone who uses their computer wirelessly today in places as diverse as airports and coffee shops will testify to the importance of expanding our nation's wireless capabilities and I am glad to help move towards that goal.
  "After pressing hard for the passage of these key amendments I am very pleased to see that they have been included in the final committee version of the telecommunications bill. My colleagues and I will now work hard to push for final passage when it comes to the full Senate for a final vote."
