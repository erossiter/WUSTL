SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES IN SCOTT COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Agriculture Office of Rural Development has awarded a Rural Business Enterprise Grant in the amount of $98,400 to the Scott County Economic Development Authority to support small businesses.  
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Scott County to boost their local economy by supporting both emerging and established businesses in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The Scott County Economic Development Authority will use this grant to administer a revolving loan fund which will support new and existing small businesses in Scott County. 
   The USDA Rural Development office makes grants under the Rural Business Enterprise Grants (RBEG) Program available to public bodies, private nonprofit corporations, and federally-recognized Indian Tribal groups. These organizations are then able to finance and facilitate the development of small and emerging private business enterprises located in areas that have a population smaller than 50,000 residents.
