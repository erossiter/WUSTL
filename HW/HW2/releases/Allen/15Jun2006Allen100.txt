SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES GALAX POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES $13,020 FOR THERMAL IMAGING EQUIPMENT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded $13,020 to the Galax Police Department for the purchase of thermal imaging equipment.  
   "I'm very pleased that my office was able to be of assistance in directing the folks in Galax to this grant opportunity and supporting them through the process," said Senator Allen. "This vital funding will help to increase the safety of families and individuals living in and around Galax. I will always look to offer any assistance I can to promote the safety and security of Virginians." 
   These Homeland Security funds will be used by the Galax Police Department to purchase thermal imaging equipment. This equipment will greatly aid in surveillance and search and rescue applications by giving police additional information. Thermal imaging penetrates smoke, fog, and dust by sensing the heat of the environment and displaying various heat ranges as different colors. This technology has been extremely useful in past search and rescue efforts and will be a great asset to the Galax Police force.
