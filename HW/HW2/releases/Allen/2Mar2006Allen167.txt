SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBAI PORTS WORLD
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) released teh following statement regarding the sale of terminals at U.S. seaports to Dubai Ports World: 
   "On February 16th, I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow expressing my concern about the potential sale of the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Company to Dubai Ports World (DP World), an operation owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). If this acquisition is finalized, DP World would operate terminals at some of the busiest seaports in the U.S. 
   "My view on this potential sale is "trust but verify." I trust the President on matters of national security, but I'm gathering information to determine if there is a convincing case that this deal is appropriate. I'm pleased that the Bush Administration and DP World worked out a compromise to allow for an additional 45-day security investigation by the federal government. Ultimately, there will need to be adequate scrutiny and transparency in the operation of a government-owned company as there is with privately-held companies. 
   "Our ports are an essential part of our nation's continued economic prosperity; they are the hubs of the global economy and are vital to moving American products to markets around the globe. However, they are also vulnerable to terrorist attacks, and while the UAE has been a valuable ally in the War on Terror since 9/11, I believe it's important that we thoroughly review the effects of this sale and ensure that our security is not compromised. I believe with proper precautions and reporting our security goals can be achieved."
