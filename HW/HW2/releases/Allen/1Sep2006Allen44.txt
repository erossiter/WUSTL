SEN. ALLEN APPLAUDS AMTRAK DECISION TO CONTINUE SERVICE TO HAMPTON ROADS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today applauded Amtrak for their decision to continue daily service to the Hampton Roads region, including stops in Williamsburg and Newport News. Last week upon hearing that daily service in Hampton Roads was under review, Senator Allen contacted officials at Amtrak to stress the importance of the daily commuter rail service to the region. News of Amtrak's review had concerned commuters who rely on their daily service to and from Hampton Roads. 
   "This is the right decision both for Amtrak and for Hampton Roads," said Senator Allen. "As I expressed to Amtrak, rail is and will only continue to grow as one of the solutions to our growing transportation needs. As the population in the region continues to grow, it will become increasingly important to have reliable public transportation available to all Virginians. Every day, residents in Hampton Roads rely on Amtrak to commute up and down the east coast. In addition, as we approach the 400th Anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, more and more tourist will flock to the region. Amtrak's service will be important in providing transportation to those who will be coming to the Commonwealth to participate in the historic festivities."
