SEN. ALLEN AMENDMENT HELPS FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE HOTSPOTS
  The United States Senate has approved an amendment offered by Sens.  
 George Allen (R-VA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that provides local law enforcement battling Methamphetamine "hotspots" an additional $20-million dollars. The funds were approved as part of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill currently being debated by the Senate. Like other States, Virginia law enforcement has seen a dramatic increase in Methamphetamine use, especially in the Shenandoah Valley. 
   "It's vitally important to provide local law enforcement in Virginia and other States additional resources to combat those involved in the production of these insidious labs that are producing highly addictive methamphetamines that threaten to ravage the health and lives of so many young people," said Senator Allen. 
   Methamphetamine "hotspots" are areas in Virginia and other States with an increased presence of both drug users and clandestine make-shift labs that manufacture the drug. In "rave" and nightclub venues across the U.S., Methamphetamine is considered by the Drug Enforcement Agency as the drug of choice. The Allen-Cantwell amendment boosts the amount of funding to fight "Meth" to $80-million dollars. 
   "In talking with local law enforcement from around Virginia, I'm convinced that this additional funding is needed to combat those who jeopardize the futures of our young with the lure of this dangerous and relatively cheap drug," said Senator Allen.
