SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ALITO NOMINATION
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement regarding the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.  
   "I appreciate President Bush's solid nomination. I'm impressed by Judge Alito's extensive legal and judicial record which will give me the ability to discern his judicial philosophy. 
   "I look forward to meeting with Judge Alito and reviewing his commitment to the rule of law and the proper, restrained role of judges in our representative democracy. The judge has a distinguished record of public service and a solid reputation in the legal community. I believe there is ample time for the Senate to move forward in a fair and dignified confirmation process with a vote before the end of the year. 
   "This is a crucial judicial vacancy for our nation with so many important cases coming before the Supreme Court. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act on this nomination, rather than dawdling into next year."
