SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $2.3 MILLION RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN AWARDED TO RADFORD INDUSTRIAL PARK
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program has awarded a Community Facility Direct Loan in the amount of $2,300,000 to Virginia's First Regional Industrial Facility Authority in Radford, VA to purchase additional land for an existing industrial park which exists in order to stimulate economic development and expansion. 
   "These federal funds will allow the folks in the Radford area to increase their service to the community by their investments in local businesses and through expanding the local job market," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide needed support to improve the lives of Virginians."
   More specifically, Virginia's First Regional Industrial Facility includes the participating counties of Wythe, Bland, Giles, Pulaski, Montgomery, Roanoke and the cities of Radford, Salem and Roanoke. The industrial park was created to enhance the economic base for the member localities by developing, owning and operating one or more facilities on a cooperative basis involving member localities.
   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
