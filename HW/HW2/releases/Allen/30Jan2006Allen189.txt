SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO SUPPORT STONY CREEK COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $301,447 to Stony Creek Community Health Center.  
   "This vital funding will be of great benefit to the folks in , Dinwiddie and Prince George Counties as well as the vicinity around Stony Creek," said Senator Allen. "This health center has been a valued health service provider to the folks in Southeastern Virginia who would have either gone without care or would have been forced to drive a significant distance for help." 
   With a large disadvantaged and/or disabled elderly population in these areas, any loss of health services would be a devastating blow. In 2004 alone, the Center provided medical and preventive care to over 2,600 individuals, many of whom are uninsured or underinsured.
