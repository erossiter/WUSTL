SEN. ALLEN LAUDS RECOGNITION OF HEARTLAND CORRIDOR CONNECTOR INITIATIVE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today joined Virginia officials in formally recognizing the start of the Heartland Corridor Connector initiative. As previously announced in August of 2005, $90 million has been authorized in the federal highway bill, H.R. 3 SAFETEA-LU. This project includes multiple intermodal facility improvements to facilitate the movement of intermodal freight from Virginia to Ohio. 
   "Today's recognition event in Roanoke is the culmination of 2 years of work. I'm very pleased that Senator Warner and I were able to secure the funding for this project. I have made funding for The Heartland Corridor Connector project a priority and I'm thrilled to see this project get underway," Senator Allen said. "The ability to transport large amounts of material efficiently and cost-effectively through intermodal rail will greatly benefit the local economy, as well as reduce traffic on major roadways."
   Intermodal rail refers to the movement of containers, preferably double-stacked, or the movement of trailers on flatcars or spine cars. The rail movement of containers is efficient for shippers and rail carriers to the extent that payload to overall train costs can be maximized. Generally, this requires that containers be moved in a double-stack configuration. A new intermodal facility (the exact location of which has yet to be determined), to handle the transfer of containers back and forth between rail cars and semi-trailers, is also a recipient of these funds.
