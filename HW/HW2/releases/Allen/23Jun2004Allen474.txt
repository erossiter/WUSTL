SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $495,500 IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AWARDED TO FRANKLIN COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded a grant of $345,500 and an emergency and imminent community water assistance grant of $150,000 to Franklin County to construct a public water system to serve the Forest Hills area of the county. 
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Franklin County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The Franklin County project consists of the installation of water distribution lines and water meters. Water will be purchased from the town of Rocky Mount and will serve approximately 35 residential users. 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans are to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
