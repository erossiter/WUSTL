SEN. ALLEN RELEASES STATEMENT ON IRAN
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement concerning the build up of nuclear arms by Iran :  
   "Iran is a pressing, dangerous situation," said Senator Allen. "We must continue the ongoing diplomatic process, working with our allies and the international community to prevent the Iranians from developing a nuclear weapon. Should they be necessary, I am hopeful that sanctions or embargos would convince the Iranian regime to give up its nuclear ambitions. And while clearly it is the absolute last resort, we cannot take the military option off the table. It is not desirable, but if necessary it should remain an option."
