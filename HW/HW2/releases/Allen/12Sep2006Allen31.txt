SEN. ALLEN PRAISES THANKSUSA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) recognized ThanksUSA for their continued support of spouses and children of active-duty military personnel. ThanksUSA is a non-partisan organization that provides spouses and children of active military personnel post-secondary education scholarships. ThanksUSA recently awarded 1,000 scholarships, 68 of whom are Virginians, totaling $3.5 million. 
   "A grateful nation must provide the best opportunities for our brave soldiers and their family members because they are truly the best of America," said Senator Allen. "ThanksUSA is working hard to ensure that the family members of these brave soldiers, who are sacrificing so much for the cause of freedom, have access to educational opportunities. The education of its citizens is vital for America to retain its status as the World Capital of Innovation." 
   ThanksUSA is an acronym for Treasure Hunt Aiding Needs of Kids (and Spouses) of those Serving the United States of America. The organization was founded by two Virginia public school students and is funded by federal, corporate and private contributions. The scholarships have benefited military families in all 50 states. 
   "I want to applaud ThanksUSA for supporting our nation's troops and their families, as well as providing educational opportunities," said Senator Allen.
