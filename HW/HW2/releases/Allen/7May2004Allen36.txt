SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES HENRICO COUNTY RECEIVES $2.4 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved $2,483,985 to reimburse the state for debris removal in Henrico County as a result of Hurricane Isabel. 
   "The devastation caused by Hurricane Isabel across Virginia from rural areas, to small towns, to cities was enormous," said Senator Allen. "This much-needed federal assistance will help the folks in Henrico County get back on their feet again."
   FEMA's Public Assistance program will reimburse the state for $2,483,985 - 75 percent - of the total $3,311,000 project cost for the collection, reduction, storage and final disposal of massive amounts of vegetative debris in Henrico County.
   Since Hurricane Isabel struck last September, FEMA has obligated more than $120 million in Public Assistance funds for debris removal in Virginia.
