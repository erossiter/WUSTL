SEN. ALLEN CO-SPONSORS BILL TO PROVIDE SIMPLER TAX FORM FOR SENIORS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that he has signed on as a cosponsor to the Simple Tax for Seniors Act (S. 2502).  
 The bill, sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID), would allow seniors who are disqualified from using the 1040-EZ form to use a new 1040-S form when filing their income taxes. 
   "This is a good, logical way for the federal government to make it easier for our seniors to file their income tax returns," Senator Allen said. "I'm always pleased to support common sense legislation that is friendly to taxpayers rather than government bureaucracy." 
   Under current law, taxpayers 65 or older are disqualified from using the 1040-EZ form simply by their age, or by receipt of Social Security funds or other retirement income. The Simple Tax for Seniors Act would not make any changes to the actual tax code, so seniors would pay the same amount as they would under the standard 1040 form. But a 1040-S form would allow seniors to file in less time, on a simplified form no more than two pages long, without being forced annually to disclose more information on their retirement savings and pension plan than necessary to determine the proper taxes due. It is estimated 11 million seniors would be eligible to use the new form.
