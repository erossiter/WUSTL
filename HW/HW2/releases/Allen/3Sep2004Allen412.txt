SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL DISASTER AID AVAILABLE TO VIRGINIA LOCALITIES IMPACTED BY TROPICAL STORM GASTON
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that President Bush has designated the cities of Colonial Heights, Hopewell, Petersburg and Richmond as well as the counties of Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Hanover, Henrico and Prince George as disaster areas due to the damage caused by Tropical Storm Gaston on August 30, 2004.  
 On Monday, September 6, Senator Allen will be inspecting the damage in downtown Richmond along with SBA and FEMA officials. 
   "I am grateful for the quick response and generous attention that President Bush has given the needy folks in Central Virginia," said Senator Allen. "By getting our boots on the ground we will be able to get a direct, human response to promptly assist distressed small business owners. I am working to bring the expertise and the assistance of the SBA directly to those businesses affected by the storm. Our top priority is to get them dried out, disinfected and back in business." 
   On September 1, 2004 Senator Allen wrote a letter to President Bush requesting federal assistance.
