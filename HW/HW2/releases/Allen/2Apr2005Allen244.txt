SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement regarding the death of Pope John Paul II:  
   "Today, the world has lost one of the great spiritual leaders of our time. Pope John Paul II has been an inspirational figure throughout his life not only to Catholics but to people of all faiths around the world. His courageous spirit and stirring passion to serve God and his beloved Church never wavered, even in his final days. 
   "I will always remember Pope John Paul II as one of the true giants, along with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, who provided the leadership to win the Cold War by standing up against the Communist repression of the human spirit. In addition to his steady support of freedom, Pope John Paul II was a strong voice of moral clarity during a time when popular culture has devalued life. 
   "During his truly historic life, Pope John Paul II was an inspirational, transformational and admired servant of God and mankind. He will be remembered always as a man of strength and peace, courage and principles. He helped change the world for the better and we will be forever grateful."
