SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES ETHAN ALLEN EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY BENEFITS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced a Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) certification from the U.S. Department of Labor has been successfully secured to aid the workers at Ethan Allen, Inc in Bridgewater, Virginia who have been totally or partially separated from their employment and are now eligible to receive income support in the form of cash payments, retraining or remedial education, relocation and health benefits. In addition, Ethan Allen workers over the age of fifty will be eligible for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA).  
   "This significant federal certification will tangibly help the hardworking employees at Ethan Allen, who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own, with monthly household expenses, health insurance, retraining and, if necessary, relocation," said Senator Allen. "Any time a factory in Virginia closes, it is a devastating blow to the families and businesses throughout the community. I will continue to work hard to make sure that the voices of Virginians are heard, and will advocate methods to attract new investment and jobs." 
   The Department of Labor's investigation determined that the workers at Ethan Allen in Bridgewater met requirements for federal assistance because their termination is directly related to a loss in sales due to the impact of imports produced in a foreign country. 
   On May 6, 2004 Senator Allen sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao to request that the displaced Ethan Allen employees receive all available assistance. 
   A trade-affected worker certified by the Department of Labor is eligible to apply for TAA/ATAA and may receive one or more of the following services and benefits: 
   * Reemployment Services: Employment Registration, Employment Counseling, Case Assessment, Job Development, Supportive Services, and Self-Directed Job Search Services.
   * Job Search Allowances: For costs of a job search outside of the local commuting area. 
   * Relocation Allowances: For costs of relocating to a job outside of the local commuting area. 
   * Trade Readjustment Allowances: Up to 104 weeks of income support for eligible workers enrolled in full-time training. 
   * Health Insurance Coverage Assistance: Tax credits covering up to 65% of the monthly health insurance premium paid by an eligible participant. 
   * Training Services: Up to 104 weeks of approved training, including classroom training, on-the-job training, employer-based customized training, and basic or remedial education.
