SENATE, HOUSE PASS BILL APPROVING DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL BRINGING FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA PROJECTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that funding for vital defense projects has been passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and has been sent to President Bush to sign into law.  
   "The top responsibility of the federal government is our national defense. These projects will help to advance the readiness of our men and women in uniform to make sure that they have the most technologically-advanced weapons and armaments," Senator Allen said. 
   The following Virginia projects are included in Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005 which is now awaiting the President's signature: 
   * $5 million to Aerojet (formerly ARC) in Gainesville to fund the High Speed Anti-Radiation Demonstration (HSAD) program to develop and demonstrate an advanced weapon capable of engaging and destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses and other high priority time critical targets. 
   * $1.5 million to Bea Maurer in Fairfield for rapidly deploying shelter systems to be utilized as Combat Operations Centers (COCs) for the U.S. Marine Corps. 
   * $2.25 million to the Ethyl Corporation in Richmond to fund the Manganese Health Research Program (MHRP) which develops an improved understanding of the relationship between exposure to manganese and health effects. 
   * $1 million to General Dynamics in Arlington to fund the SOLIC Special Reconnaissance Program to expand its capability to identify the threat posed by the increased amount of data coming from foreign countries over American telephonic and data networks. This foreign data can potentially be used against American economic and governmental entities. 
   * $7 million to fund the environmentally safe disposal of ships, such as the 38 in the James River National Defense Reserve Fleet. 
   * $4 million to Anteon Corporation in Fairfax to fund the Fluorescence Activated Sensing Technology (FAST) Chem/Bio Integrated Threat Management System, which provides rapid, simultaneous detection and identification of at least 20 biological agents, chemicals and toxins. 
   * $1 million to Alion Science and Technology (located in Maryland), Prime Photonics, University of Virginia and Carilion Biomedical Institute in Charlottesville, Blacksburg and Roanoke to fund the Automated Medical Emergency Intravascular Access (AutoCath) system which permits rapid intravascular access for emergency interventions ranging from simple fluid replacement and blood product delivery to advanced capabilities for targeted organ hypothermia and delayed resuscitation. 
   * $5.3 million to Magellan in Richmond to fund the optimization of the M5 fiber production process. The M5 fiber is a new ultra high performance fiber which shows great promise to reduce battlefield casualties when integrated into body armor. 
   * $16 million to the Radford Army Ammunition Plant Modernization (RFAAP) for needed modernization of manufacturing facilities, including replacement of the acid plant that supports propellant production for nearly all small, medium, and large caliber ammunition used by the Army and U.S. Marine Corps. RFAAP is owned by the Army, and operated by ATK - Alliant Techsystems. 
   * $5.1 million to The Institute of Advanced Learning in Danville to fund the Joint Unmanned Systems Test and Research Center (JOUSTER Center) which will be the first test and research joint site and center dedicated to the scientifically based evaluation, comparison and development of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) systems and software and to the integration of such systems with small, low flying Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV). 
   * $1.1 million to Argon Engineering Associates in Fairfax to fund the Anti-Terrorism Technology Surveillance System (ATTSS) to provide low cost detection and geolocation sensors for shore sites using Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies and sophisticated software and firmware. 
   * $2.6 million to General Motors Corporation at Ft. Belvoir to provide the military with operational knowledge of state of the art hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and further the understanding of hydrogen as a transportation fuel in an overall plan for a 21st Century Military Base Concept. 
   * $1.7 million to the Naval Sea Cadet Corps (NSCC) which has branches in Richmond, Alexandria and Norfolk to fund daily operations. The NSCC promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation, but also instills in every Cadet qualities that mold strong moral character in the anti-drug and anti-gang environment. 
   * $6.8 million to Sperry Marine of Charlottesville to fund an Integrated Bridge System (IBS). When installed on Naval Ships, the IBS automates underway voyage planning and management, improves the ship handling, reduces the risk of collisions and groundings. 
   * $348 million to fund Ballistic Missile Defense System Interceptor which will impact the Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI). This Northrop Grumman-led project is designed to destroy mid- and long-range enemy missiles during their boost/ascent phase of flight. 
   In June, the Senate, by unanimous consent, passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. John Warner (R-VA) and co-sponsored by Senator George Allen, to restore $250 million to the President's budget to be used for work on nuclear aircraft carriers. This funding was cut in the Senate Defense Appropriations Bill but restored completely on the Senate floor and maintained when the bill came out of Conference. The money will impact shipbuilders in the Hampton Roads Area. 
   * $628 million for the Carrier Replacement Program 
  * $333 million for CVN Refueling Overhauls.
