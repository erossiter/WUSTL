SEN. ALLEN LAUDS PROJECTS FOR VIRGINIA IN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today lauded funding for several important defense projects in Virginia included in the fiscal year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. The legislation provides $436.54 billion in new budgetary authority for the U.S. Department of Defense including $70 billion dollars in additional appropriations for the Global War on Terror.  
   Following is the list of projects:
   $95,560,000 to Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) to provide an efficient and highly mobile sea-based defense against short and medium range ballistic missiles in their midcourse phase.
   $32,700,000 for modernization to the Radford Army Ammunition Plant.
   $19,500,000 to Directed Energy Research to develop electronic weapons systems including a free electron laser, rail-gun research, a high lethality laser and counter IED research.
   "These are important projects for our Commonwealth and indeed our nation as well," said Senator Allen. "These appropriations will continue to keep some of Virginia's military facilities on the leading edge of our national defense as they continue to innovate and advance our nation's military advantage."
   Senator Allen also commented on the project's impact in the Global War on Terror:
   "In this global war against radical, hate filled terrorists it is important that we have all the resources available to us to win the fight. We must continue to adapt, advance and innovate to ensure we continue to keep a technological advantage over our enemies to keep Americans safe and secure our nation's future."
