SEN. ALLEN URGES FCC TO LOWER 'PHONE HOME' RATES FOR U.S. TROOPS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today enthusiastically co-sponsored legislation offered by Sen. Ted Stevens, (R-AK), chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that directs the Federal Communications Commission to reduce telephone rates for U.S. Armed Forces deployed overseas. The measure extends to all troops stationed around the world in support of military operations including training exercises and other duties as directed by the Department of Defense. 
  "A grateful nation should help our brave men and women serving in harm's way to stay in touch with loved ones and family back home. This measure is a common sense approach that I believe will allow our troops to hear the voices of those who love and support them with less of a financial burden at time when our military families need help with household expenses," said Senator Allen.
  In addition, the measure entitled, "Call Home Act of 2006," directs the FCC to evaluate methods for reducing telephone rates for soldiers including the use of new, advanced technologies such as voice over internet protocol (VOIP) to connect troops with their families. 
  "This is a perfect example of adapting and innovating new technologies to help us achieve an old-fashioned, family need to tell our brave troops that they are in our thoughts and prayers and that our friends, families and nation are so grateful for their unflinching service in this war on terror," said Senator Allen.
