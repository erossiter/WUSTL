SEN. ALLEN INSPECTS GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION CENTERS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) returned yesterday from his fact finding mission to Guantanamo Bay. He was accompanied by Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL). Sen. Allen inspected detention facilities, received comprehensive briefings from U.S. military commanders at the base and met with soldiers from Virginia who are stationed at Naval Base Guantanamo Bay.  
  Senator Allen released this statement upon his return:
  "The Active, Reserve and Guard troops, FBI and other interrogation experts, medical staff and the whole combined team at Guantanamo are performing an outstanding job protecting Americans," said Senator Allen. "They are patiently and honorably detaining men who intend to harm Americans. Guantanamo is a transparent facility where our interrogators exceed the Geneva Convention requirements in their treatment of these enemies. In fact the releasing of enemy combatants in the midst of an on-going war is unusual. I admire their honorable efforts to defend our freedom. As we develop legislation to abide by the recent United States Supreme Court decision, I believe that we can achieve security for Americans and abide by acceptable due process while gleaning information from these enemies. For our security, detainee operations in Guantanamo should continue with reasonable comportment of our actions with U.S. Laws and treaties. Anyone who questions the importance of the Guantanamo Bay facilities should know most importantly that we are also deriving useful information from many of the detainees," Allen said.
