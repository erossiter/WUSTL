SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES OVER $3.2 MILLION RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AWARDED TO SCOTT COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office has awarded a grant of $1,800,000 and a loan in the amount of $1,457,000 to the Scott County Public Service Authority to expand the existing Holston regional wastewater treatment plant.  
   "These important funds will allow the folks in Scott County to update and improve water services for the individuals in their community," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide support to improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The project includes replacing head works, construction of an additional ring on the oxidation ditch, secondary clarifier, aerobic digester, and the installation of a UV disinfection system. The town of Gate City will abandon their existing wastewater treatment plant and sewerage will be pumped to the Scott County PSA's expanded plant, which will serve approximately 825 residences and 30 businesses. 
   The purpose of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loans are to develop water and waste disposal (including solid waste disposal and storm drainage) systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and corporations not operated for profit. The Water and Waste Disposal Grants are specifically designed to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for rural users.
