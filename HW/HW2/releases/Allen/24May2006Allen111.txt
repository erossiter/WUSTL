SEN. ALLEN HAILS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH WATER TRAIL
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the unanimous vote of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to approve legislation designating the route of Captain John Smith's exploration of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as a National Historical Water Trail. Sen. Allen introduced the legislation with his colleagues, Sens. John W. Warner (R-Va), Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). 
  "In Virginia, we are all so proud that we are coming up next year on the 400th anniversary of the founding of America's representative democracy at Jamestown, the oldest permanent English settlement in the New World. As part of that celebration we should remember the fascinating, exploratory voyages of Captain John Smith and his vital charting and mapping of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York and James," said Senator Allen. "As we move closer each day to this historic Jamestown anniversary I am happy to see this legislation has moved one step closer to final passage."
  Captain John Smith was a key founder of the settlement in Jamestown, VA. He spent three years (1607-1609) exploring the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware covering some 3,000 miles. To this day, these maps are some of the most accurate maps of the Bay region.
  Last year, the Senate approved legislation sponsored by Senators Allen, Warner, Sarbanes and Mikulski that requested a study by the U.S. Parks Service as to an appropriate route for such a trail. That study is near completion.
