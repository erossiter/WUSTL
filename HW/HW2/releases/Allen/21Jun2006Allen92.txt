SEN. ALLEN AMENDMENT ENSURES FREE CREDIT CHECK/FRAUD MONITORING FOR VETERANS
  Sens. George Allen (R-VA) Larry Craig (R-ID) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) Monday offered an amendment to S. 2766 the Defense Authorization Bill which will help provide financial protection to the 26.5 million veterans and active duty military personnel whose personal data and Social Security Information was stolen from the home of a Veterans Administration employee in May of this year. 
  It has always been Senator Allen's belief that the federal government should respond to its errors with the same level of customer service that a major national company would for its customers. That is why Senator Allen introduced this amendment to provide a free credit check and fraud monitoring service for veterans who are trying to protect their credit following this theft.
  In keeping with that customer service philosophy, today Senator Allen is clarifying his amendment to ensure that while the government may negotiate a low fixed price for these credit check/monitoring services; the final cost will be paid for in-full by the federal government and not by individual veterans.
  "I think the federal government needs to make sure that our veterans and their credit are protected after this incident. Veterans did nothing wrong and they should not incur one cent of the cost to clean up this mess. This amendment needs to be crystal clear on that point and today I am going to make sure that's the case," said Senator Allen.
  Today Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Conrad Burns (R-MT) also announced their support of the amendment by becoming co-sponsors.
