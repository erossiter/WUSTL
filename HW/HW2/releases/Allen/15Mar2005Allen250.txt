SEN. ALLEN URGES EU TO PUT HEZBOLLAH ON TERROR LIST
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today introduced a resolution in the Senate urging the European Union to add Hezbollah to its wide-ranging list of terrorist organizations.  
 Allen's resolution is co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT). 
   "I believe that the European Union must recognize Hezbollah as the murderous terrorist organization that it is. For 23 years, Hezbollah has led a campaign of terror against the citizens of the U.S. and our allies. Hezbollah's long-held and well established ties to terrorism themselves and to other terrorist groups underscores the importance of this action from our allies in Europe," Allen said. 
   The Senate resolution urges the European Union to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization for the purposes of prohibiting funding to the group and recognizing it as a threat to national security. The resolution also calls on the European Union to condemn the organization for its continuous perpetration of and support for terrorist attacks. Two other U.S. allies, Canada and Australia, have classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The United Kingdom has placed the Hezbollah External Security Organization on its terrorist list. 
   "Hezbollah is a clear and present enemy of the U.S. and our allies as we continue to fight terrorism and promote peace around the world. The European Union needs to officially recognize Hezbollah as an enemy of freedom and place it on its list of terrorist organizations. All freedom respecting countries should want to cut off aid, comfort and sustenance to this terrorist organization which targeted United States, German, French, British, Italian, Israeli, Kuwaiti, Argentine, Thai, Singaporean, and Russian civilians among others," Allen said.
