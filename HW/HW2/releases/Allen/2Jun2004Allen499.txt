SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES AWARD OF US-VISIT CONTRACT TO ACCENTURE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has selected Accenture LLP in Reston, VA as the prime contractor for the US-VISIT program.  
 The contract, with a minimum value of $10 million and a maximum value of $10 billion, is directed towards strengthening security at America's borders and enhancing the border management process.
   "Improving the security of the nation is one of my top priorities," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that a fine Virginia company will be able to play a key role in keeping our families and communities safe while helping to ensure legitimate travel across our borders."
   The US-VISIT contract covers a base period of five years, with five one-year options. Under the contract, Accenture will perform a variety of professional activities ranging from strategic support, technical solutions, design and integration activities, training, and organizational change management.
   The US-VISIT program is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security, intent on enhancing the security of U.S. visitors and citizens, facilitating legitimate travel and trade, ensuring the integrity of the immigration system, and safeguarding the personal privacy of visitors. US-VISIT is part of a continuum of security measures that extends overseas and applies to all visitors holding non-immigrant visas.
