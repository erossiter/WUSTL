SEN. ALLEN MEETS WITH CITY OF HAMPTON OFFICIAL ON FUTURE OF AERONAUTICS AT NASA LANGLEY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today met with Jesse Wallace, Hampton City Manager and a member of the NASA Aeronautics Support Team on efforts to further strengthen NASA Langley Research Center's advanced aviation and aeronautics budget which is so vital to the city and surrounding communities. In recent years, Sen. Allen has vigorously opposed any proposed cuts in federal funding of aeronautics research and development and helped shape legislation requiring NASA to develop a future Aeronautics Research Policy. 
  "Aeronautics research and development is vital to the competitiveness of our country and important to our national security and economy. But unfortunately, the U.S. is falling behind our competitors in advanced aviation and I'm concerned about the impact for the future of our country as well as those hard working men and women who are so important to NASA's team in Hampton," said Senator Allen.
  Among the issues discussed at today's meeting was finding a way to off-set any potential budget cuts until after the Aeronautics Research Policy is released. As Senator Allen stated, "it's only logical to hold the line on this budget until after the Aeronautics Research Policy is released so we can see what the priorities will be as set forth by the policy."
  In Fiscal Year 2007, the U.S. is slated to spend only $724.4 million on aeronautics research with the out years of the budget reflecting a further net reduction in funding.
  "It's important that we had this dialogue with Mr. Wallace and others today and I think we are in total agreement to keep fighting to maintain adequate funding levels to keep America leading in aeronautics and aviation, and NASA strong in Hampton Roads," said Senator Allen after the meeting.
