SEN. ALLEN LAUDS STRONG JOB GROWTH IN MAY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement regarding newly released jobs figures which showed that the U.S. economy added 248,000 new jobs in May: 
   "Today, we received the encouraging news that 248,000 new jobs were created in America in May. These solid job gains highlight the great news we are consistently hearing about the growing strength of the American economy. For the past nine months, our economy has posted steady job gains; in fact, since August we've seen the creation of 1.5 million jobs. That's great news for 1.5 million families across our country.
   "The outstanding economic growth we've seen this year demonstrates the importance of tax cuts for individuals, families and small business owners. These positive actions that a majority of us in Congress have taken along with President Bush have strengthened the U.S. economy and helped improve the lives of the American people.
   "I believe that the consistent flow of this economic good news will bolster business confidence and efforts as we continue working for positive, constructive solutions and action to help create even more jobs and investment growth for the people in this country."
