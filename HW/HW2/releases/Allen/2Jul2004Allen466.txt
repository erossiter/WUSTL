   Created by Congress in 1996, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District encompasses Augusta, Clarke, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockingham, Shenandoah, and Warren counties and the cities of Harrisonburg, Staunton, Waynesboro and Winchester. Local stewardship is a hallmark of the Management Plan for the National Historic District and Implementation Grants Program serves as a catalyst to help local organizations fulfill that role. Encouraging and enabling local groups and governments to be strong custodians of this national resource is a mandate of the congressional legislation that created the National Historic District.
