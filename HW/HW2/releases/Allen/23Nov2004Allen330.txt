SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $1.7 MILLION TO RESTORE GRACE STREET
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded a grant in the amount of $1,719,629 to help pay for the restoration of the recreation grounds near Grace and 31st Streets in the City of Richmond due to damage caused by Tropical Depression Gaston.  
   "The damage caused by Gaston this summer was widespread in its scope, affecting both commercial and residential areas alike," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the City of Richmond is getting such substantial assistance on this restoration project. The time and money invested in this property will help make the neighborhood cleaner and safer." 
   FEMA has awarded this grant as part of the Public Assistance program to help pay for the complete restoration of Grace Street, including the repair of the playground site, the street and surrounding utilities. The work will be completed by the City of Richmond. 
   Since Tropical Storm Gaston hit Richmond in August, Senator Allen has been actively involved in securing funds and assistance for homes and businesses that sustained damage by the storm.
