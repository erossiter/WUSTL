SEN. ALLEN WORKING TO SECURE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR BRISTOL EMPLOYEES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor for 290 employees of Bristol Compressors in Bristol, Virginia after the company announced plans to reduce its workforce in March.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Bristol have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Secretary Chao and the U.S. Department of Labor to help provide vital federal assistance for these Bristol Compressor employees who have lost their jobs," Senator Allen said. 
   Price increases in the costs of steel, copper and utilities, have impacted the company's ability to align its cost structure and remain competitive. The reductions will result in the elimination of one production line from its plant in Bristol, Va. Employees will receive severance pay commensurate with service time with the company. Bristol Compressors has also made a commitment to offer laid off employees jobs as they come available in the future.
   Bristol Compressors provides compressors to original equipment manufacturers and wholesale distributors in 6 continents and over 50 countries around the world. Bristol, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., employs approximately 1,650 employees in Bristol, Va.
