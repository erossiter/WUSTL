SEN. ALLEN SPONSORS SENATE 'GIVE' ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that he has joined as a cosponsor of the Good Samaritan Liability Improvement and Volunteer Encouragement (GIVE) Act of 2005, legislation that will provide needed legal protections for disaster relief volunteers and those providing goods and services for disaster relief.  
   "In cleaning up and rebuilding the areas of the Gulf Coast region affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and in any future national disasters it is important that the many volunteers and relief workers who donate their time and energy to help others recover are protected from frivolous lawsuits that undermine their efforts and discourage others from joining the relief effort," said Senator Allen. 
   "By enacting legal liability protection to volunteers, we can ensure that Americans will continue to step forward, as they have throughout our nation's history, to help their neighbors in their greatest time of need. 
   "This legislation will offer a comprehensive solution to frivolous litigation that unnecessarily burdens volunteers and often prevents the provision of necessary goods and services to victims of natural disasters. I encourage my Senate colleagues to support the GIVE Act and ensure that the volunteers who are so vital to recovery continue to be able to lend a helping hand without fear of costly, debilitating lawsuits."
