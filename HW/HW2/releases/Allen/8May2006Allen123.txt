  Sen. George Allen (R-VA), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today made the following statement on the nomination of General Michael Hayden to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency: 
  "In my conversations with General Hayden as the Director of the National Security Agency, I've been impressed by his knowledge and respectful demeanor in protecting Americans from terrorists.
  "He strikes me as a reasonable, dependable, even-tempered and trustworthy leader. I am inclined to support General Hayden's nomination as Director of the CIA. However, before making a decision, I wish to closely review General Hayden's attributes and capabilities to lead the CIA which is a vitally significant agency of unknown patriots who are key to our winning the Global War on Terror."
