SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $11 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO IMPROVE DRINKING WATER IN VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen announced today that the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) will receive $11,473,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to improve local drinking water systems. 
   "This grant will allow the Virginia Department of Health to update and improve water services for the individuals in 32 communities across the Commonwealth," said Senator Allen. "I'm pleased to see this federal funding from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund used to help improve the lives of Virginians." 
   The VDH selects projects based on environmental, technical and public health criteria. This project will use $9.6 million of the federal grant money as well as the $2.3 million from the State matched loans to upgrade treatment plants, replace distribution lines, improve pumping stations and construct wells and transmission mains. The final $1.8 million of federal funds will be used to manage the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, provide technical assistance to small drinking water systems, protect drinking water supplies from contamination and ensure that drinking water systems remain viable. 
   The DWSRF was authorized by the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This program works to ensure that public drinking water supplies remain safe and affordable while ensuring that the drinking water systems are properly operating and well maintained.
