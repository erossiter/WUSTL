SEN. ALLEN REQUESTS FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOR THREE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA COUNTIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today sent the following letter to President George W. Bush to request a federal disaster declaration for storm-damaged Tazewell, Russell and Lee counties:  
   June 2, 2004 
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  President of the United States
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
  Washington, D.C. 20472
   Dear Mr. President:
   I am writing to support Governor Warner's request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration in the Virginia counties of Tazewell, Russell and Lee as a result of severe storms and a tornado touchdown.
   Prior major floods in the past five years, including five Presidential Declarations for Major Disaster since 2000, compound the effect of this disaster of May 25, 2004 in Southwest Virginia. In addition, this region continues to struggle economically as they suffer from high unemployment and low family incomes. I also write in support of Governor Warner's request that Individual Assistance, including the Individuals and Household Program and hazard mitigation assistance be implemented for the above referenced localities. Additionally, the governor anticipates the need for federal assistance with removal of debris and I ask your positive review of this request.
   Due to the severity and magnitude of this incident, in particular to family residences and sanitary systems, I would ask that an expeditious review of this request be given.
   Thank you for your assistance to my constituents.
   With warm regards, I remain
   Sincerely,
   George Allen.
