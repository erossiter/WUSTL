SEN. ALLEN PRAISES MCNULTY NOMINATION FOR DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL POST
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of Paul McNulty who has been nominated by President Bush as Deputy Attorney General. McNulty has served as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia since September 14, 2001where he has played a central role in the War on Terror including prosecuting September 11th terrorist, Zacharias Moussaoui. Earlier in his career, McNulty was a key advisor in shaping then-Gov. Allen's abolition of parole in Virginia. In his statement in support of McNulty, Senator Allen told the Judiciary Committee:  
   "Since my days as Governor of Virginia when we were abolishing the lenient, dishonest parole system, I have had the benefit of Paul McNulty's loyal, expert advice as we instituted truth in sentencing and as a result, Virginians are safer. As the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Paul has been a thoughtful, important leader for combating terrorism, as well as working with local and State law enforcement against gangs, drugs and dismantling a high-tech piracy group that operated servers around the world distributing millions of dollars worth of illegal software and movies. President Bush has made an outstanding, perfect choice in selecting Paul as Deputy Attorney General where he will be an experienced, proven and considerate leader in the Department of Justice as it continues to fight the global war on terror, fairly enforce our laws and protect law abiding citizens," said Senator Allen.
