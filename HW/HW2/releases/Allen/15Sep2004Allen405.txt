SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO SEVEN WATERSHED PROJECTS IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Chesapeake Bay Program in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded 32 grants to Virginia projects as part of the Community Legacy Grants initiative. This initiative is intended to encourage the establishment of partnerships that will create a conservation legacy in communities throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Seven of the grants were awarded to projects in Northern Virginia.  
   "The health of the Chesapeake Bay has a direct effect on the jobs and lives of thousands of Virginians who live on its shores and rivers," said Senator Allen. "As stewards of our great Commonwealth, it is our responsibility to properly protect these areas through preservation and education. I am confident that these funds will help us make great strides in that endeavor." 
   The following projects received funding: 
   * Fauquier County received $35,000 to establish a county-wide water resource management plan and create an electronic database of over 40,000 well permits issued by the Department of Health.

   The Chesapeake Bay Small Watersheds Program promotes community-based efforts to develop and implement conservation strategies to protect and restore the diverse natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. The program provides grants to local governments and community organizations working to improve the condition of their local watersheds while building citizen-based resource stewardship. The Small Watershed Grants program encourages the sharing of innovative ideas among the many organizations wishing to be involved in watershed protection.
