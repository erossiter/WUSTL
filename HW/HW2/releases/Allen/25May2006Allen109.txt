SEN. ALLEN LAUDS DECISION BY U.S. TREASURY TO END LONG-DISTANCE TELEPHONE EXCISE TAX
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today lauded an announcement made by Secretary of the U.S. Treasury John Snow that the U.S. Department of Treasury is conceding the legal dispute over the federal excise tax on long-distance telephone search and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will issue refunds of tax on long-distance service for the past three years. In addition, Secretary Snow called on Congress to eliminate the excise tax on local phone services. 
  The three percent federal excise tax on phone services was originally put in place in 1898 to help fund the Spanish-American War. In the past few years businesses have questioned its continued legality and lawmakers have called for its repeal.
  Last fall Senator Allen introduced S. 758 which would prohibit the government from applying the federal excise tax on telecommunications to Internet access service and also joined as a co-sponsor to S.1321 that would eliminate the federal excise tax entirely. In addition, Senator Allen wrote a letter to Secretary Snow last September in which he urged the IRS to discontinue application of the federal excise tax on communications services.
  "This is a great victory for tax payers and American business. In my view the federal excise tax is a regressive and counterproductive tax in an economy that is so heavily reliant upon communications services and technologies," said Senator Allen. "This tax is contrary to the national goal of having an advanced, highly efficient, low cost communications network to serve the American people. I am glad to see that the Department of Treasury will no longer continue to burden the American tax payers with this out-dated, unnecessary strain on their wallets and I will continue to support the termination of the federal excise tax on all communications services."
