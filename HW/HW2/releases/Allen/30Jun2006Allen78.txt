SEN. ALLEN WORKS TO BRING FLOOD RELIEF TO VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) is requesting today that the federal government provide counties in Virginia with emergency funding to recover from the disastrous floods that have plagued the State recently. Sen. Allen is working with Sen. John Warner (R-VA) and members of the Virginia Congressional Delegation in seeking the necessary funding by signing a joint Congressional petition asking President Bush to grant Gov. Tim Kaine's (D-VA) request that affected regions in Virginia be declared federal disaster areas. 
  "As a former Governor of Virginia I know firsthand the importance of and impact federal funding can have during an emergency" said Senator Allen. "It is my job to do everything thing I can to ensure that Virginians receive the federal funds they need to make a full recovery, and that's why today I am joining my Virginia colleagues on both sides of the aisle to petition President Bush for this disaster declaration."
   Virginia authorities estimate that the floods have caused up to $22 million dollars in damage in Northern and Western Virginia.
