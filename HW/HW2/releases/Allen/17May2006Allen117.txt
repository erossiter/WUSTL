SEN. ALLEN SPONSORS AMENDMENT BLOCKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS FROM PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP
  The U.S. Senate today unanimously approved an amendment co-sponsored by Sen. George Allen (R-VA) that prevents felons and repeat criminal offenders from being placed on a pathway to citizenship. The Cornyn-Kyl amendment to S. 2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 closes a loophole and denies amnesty to immigrants who were ordered deported but fled underground or those who left but reentered illegally. 
  "We are a nation of laws and no one who breaks them should be rewarded with citizenship to this great country. While I do not support the underlying, convoluted citizenship path for those in this country illegally, this measure will preclude felons and repeat offenders from such reward of citizenship," said Senator Allen.
  According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of the 1.1 million illegal aliens apprehended on the border in 2005, 139,000 had criminal records. The amendment clarifies that any illegal alien who has been convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors, was the subject of a final order of removal, or constitutes a danger to the US (as determined by DHS), is ineligible for legal status.
  "My mother came to this country legally after World War II from Tunisia. I personally realize that America is a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws and should remain both. As we go forward in this debate, my guiding principle continues to be that we must first and foremost secure our borders because I believe that a nation that can not control its own borders can not control its own destiny," said Senator Allen.
