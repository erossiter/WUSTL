   Senator Allen lauded these appropriations and the above projects as essential to the future of Virginia: 
   "Since my days as Governor developing Craney Island as a future Virginia port facility has been a top priority," Senator Allen said. "Continued expansion and dredging improvements for our harbor is important for providing new jobs and opportunities to Virginians. This is a great victory for the future of Virginia." 
   Allen also pointed to the environmental projects included as a key success. 
   "The health of the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia's many natural resources has a direct effect on the jobs and lives of thousands of Virginians who live on our shores and rivers," said Senator Allen. "As stewards of our great Commonwealth, it is our responsibility to properly protect these areas through preservation and education. I am glad to assist in providing funds to several preservation and restoration projects, in particular the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Restoration Project. I am confident that these funds will help us make great strides in that endeavor." 
   Senator Allen also lauded the forward looking energy research that will be supported through this funding. 
   "Rising oil and natural gas prices and supply volatility have hurt all Americans including Virginia families, farms, manufacturing plants, small businesses, and all motorists. I am pleased to be able to assist continued nuclear physics research at Jefferson Lab and BWXT and clean coal development research at Virginia Tech. Increased energy development and research projects across our Commonwealth will help create a cleaner environment, lower fuel prices and secure a safer nation for all Virginians and Americans," said Senator Allen. 
   The Fiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill will now go to the President to be signed into law.
