SEN. ALLEN LAUDS MCDOWELL NOMINATION TO FCC
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement regarding President Bush's nomination of Robert M. McDowell of Virginia to be a Commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission:  
   "Today I applaud President Bush''s nomination of Robert McDowell to serve as a Commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission. Rob and I have enjoyed a friendship that spans three decades. Having appointed him to two boards while I was Governor of Virginia, I know him to be a dedicated, hard-working and insightful public servant in addition to being a thoughtful common sense Jeffersonian conservative. His 16 years of private sector experience in the telecommunications industry will be an invaluable asset to the American people while he serves on the FCC. Rob has my steadfast support and I believe that my colleagues, after close examination, will join me in my enthusiasm for his nomination."
