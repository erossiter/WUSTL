SEN. ALLEN REACTION TO DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) this morning welcomed news that in a U.S.-Iraqi military operation yesterday, al Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed. 
  "Having just returned from Iraq less than a week ago, I believe this is truly a significant development for the future of Iraq and the global war on terror.
  "al-Zarqawi was more than the thuggish voice we heard on video tapes threatening heinous acts against innocent men, women and children. He was the vile mastermind, operational leader and murderous participant in a vast number of terrorist activities that beheaded, bombed, maimed and killed not only Americans but other peace-loving people in Iraq and elsewhere. His death is a blow to the insurgency in Iraq, although we must continue to stand strong against those who seek to undermine the duly elected government in Iraq and terrorize freedom loving people around the world.
  "I am so pleased that this operation was conducted in conjunction with Iraqi forces. This is an indicator that Iraq is taking an active and vital role in its own destiny. The more the Iraqis stand up, the more the U.S. and its coalition forces can stand down.
  "Last week when I was in Iraq, I heard nothing but gratitude and appreciation toward Americans and our allies from Iraqi citizens and its leaders. As I watched reaction to death of al-Zarqawi, it was good to see photos of celebrating Iraqi security people. Congratulations to U.S. and Iraqi forces for this tangible success," said Senator Allen.
