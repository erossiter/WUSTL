SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $14 MILLION GRANT TO ARLINGTON-BASED BUSINESS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has awarded an extension grant in the amount of $14,045,952 to CARANA Corporation, based in Arlington, VA.  
 CARANA is a provider of global development solutions and will use these funds to work with the West African Trade Hub (WATH) implementing programs that help West African countries compete in the global market. 
   "As U.S. citizens, we have a great opportunity to help smaller nations be successful in the world market by passing on the common sense principles that made our country what it is today," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that CARANA Corporation is continuing this noble mission by investing their resources in improving West African economic development. I look forward to seeing a lot of growth and progress because of this grant." 
   More specifically, this grant enables CARANA Corporation to help WATH enhance their ongoing work, develop a more effective communications strategy, be more responsive to West African stakeholders and modernize West African customs technology. CARANA will continue to provide resources which will help expand the private and public sector's understanding of African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the World Trade Organization's opportunities, procedures and processes in order to encourage economic development and growth.
