SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON JUDGE ALITO CONFIRMATION
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as the 110th Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  
 In voting for confirmation, Sen. Allen made the following statement: 
   "I am very happy for our country today. I think Samuel Alito is going to be an outstanding justice on the Supreme Court. That's because I believe there are three key areas that really matter to the American people: security, competitiveness for economic opportunity for all and values. And we see our values eroded by judges who do not respect the will of the people in our representative democracy. We have judges who strike down the pledge of allegiance because of the words 'Under God" or allow local commissars to take homes-not for a road or school but to derive more tax revenues-who actually are amending our Bill of Rights by judicial decree. With Justice Alito on the Supreme Court, we have a person who I know understands that the role of a judge is to apply the law, not invent it. As the American people saw through his confirmation hearings, Justice Alito has a stable judicial demeanor with impeccable scholarship and integrity. This was a great vote today and I look forward to seeing Justice Alito tonight at the State of the Union Address."
