SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEAD START PROJECTS IN LEE COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant in the amount of $639,639 to the Lee County School District for the continuation of its work with children and parents involved with the Head Start program. 
   "Lee County Schools are making a significant impact on families in their area through the Head Start program," Senator Allen said. "A quality education is the foundation for our children's future success. Head Start affords children the opportunity to build a solid set of skills so they can better compete and succeed in life."
   More specifically, this grant will allow the Lee County School District to continue its comprehensive child-focused development programs that are designed to serve the children of low-income families. In all of its programs, Head Start focuses on incorporating parents, community and students as partners in education.
