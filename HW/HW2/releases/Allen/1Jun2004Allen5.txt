SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE'S RULING ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement after a federal district judge in San Francisco ruled that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is unconstitutional: 
   "Late term, Partial Birth Abortion is a rare, gruesome procedure that the American Medical Association says is akin to infanticide. It seems to be fairly typical that an unelected federal judge in San Francisco tries to stop a law that received such broad bipartisan support in Congress. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is a reasonable measure which reflects the sensibilities and will of most Virginians and Americans. I'm confident that eventually the Supreme Court of the United States will uphold the law as passed by the people's representatives in Congress."
   Last year, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and it was signed into law soon thereafter by President Bush.
