SEN. ALLEN HAILS PASSAGE OF AMENDMENT TO SAVE USS KENNEDY
  The Senate today passed an amendment that will provide funding to repair and maintain the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, allowing the carrier to remain in service.  
 The amendment, which was introduced by Sens. John Warner (R-VA), George Allen (R-VA), Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Mel Martinez (R-FL), was added to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill now being debated by the Senate. Sen. Allen released the following statement: 
   "For the security of the U.S., this was a great team victory! I thank Senator Warner for his leadership on this important matter. This was a bi-partisan success to provide our Navy with the maximum flexibility to project our power in East Asia. In 2002, Admiral Clark said that a force of at least fifteen carriers was necessary to meet the requirements for carrier presence in all regions of importance to the U.S. What has happened in the last few years? We're still in a War on Terrorism and China's Navy is expanding. 
   "To reduce the number of carriers now would be illogical and shortsighted, especially in this time of war and the rapid build up of the Chinese Navy. This was the wise approach for the sake of our security and the flexibility that we need for projecting our power and protecting our interests in the Far East."
