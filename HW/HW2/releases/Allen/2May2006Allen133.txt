SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO SUPPORT RAPPAHANNOCK AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $179,629 to the Rappahannock Area Health Education Center in Montross.  
  "This vital funding will be of great benefit to the folks in Westmoreland County as well as the Northern Neck as a whole," said Senator Allen. "This health center has been a valued healthcare and education facility to the folks in the Northern Neck who would have either gone without care or would have been forced to drive a significant distance for help and information."
  The Rappahannock Area Health Education Center (RAHEC) is an independent, non-profit corporation first established in 1994. Based out of the Northern Neck, it is led by a board of 20 community members from health care, education, faith organizations, and civic groups. RAHEC seeks to increase access to health care and improve the health status of the region through education and workforce development.
