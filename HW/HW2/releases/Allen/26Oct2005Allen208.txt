REP. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON OCEANA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA), today commented on the decision by leaders in Florida to halt their efforts to acquire the Navy's jets from NAS Oceana:  
   "Today's announcement appears to be good news for our efforts to keep the Navy's jets at Oceana. It throws a well-deserved wrench into the controversial, unwise and unusual BRAC order. However, I would urge caution before anyone suggests that the encroachment problems in Virginia Beach and Chesapeake are of no concern to the Navy. We must not be distracted from addressing the issues that have caused this discussion in the first place. We must aim to make sure that Oceana remains the best location for the Master Jet Base on the East Coast."
