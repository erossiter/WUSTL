SEN. ALLEN LAUDS CREATION OF 8,300 NEW JOBS FOR VIRGINIA IN MAY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement regarding newly released jobs figures by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that Virginia added 8,300 new jobs in May:  
   "Today, we received the encouraging news that 8,300 new jobs were created in Virginia this past May. The solid job gains we've seen recently in our Commonwealth and around America highlight the great news we continue to hear about the growing strength of our economy. In the last year, the unemployment rate in America has gone down in 46 of the 50 States and we've seen the creation of almost a million jobs in the last 100 days alone. I'm especially pleased that 88,000 new jobs have been created in Virginia this past year. In fact, during the last twelve months, Virginia saw the third highest job creation rate (2.5%) in the entire country (behind Nevada's 4.6% and Arizona's 2.7%)! 
   "The outstanding economic growth we've seen this year demonstrates the importance of tax cuts for individuals, families and small business owners. These positive actions that a majority of us in Congress have taken along with President Bush have strengthened the U.S. economy and helped improve the lives of the American people. 
   "I believe that the consistent flow of this economic good news will bolster business confidence and efforts as we continue working for positive, constructive solutions and action to help create even more jobs and investment growth for the people in this country."
