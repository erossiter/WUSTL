SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $1.14 MILLION IN GRANTS TO ENHANCE BRIDGES IN FAUQUIER, SCOTT COUNTIES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a total of $1,147,167 to the Virginia Department of Transportation in order to work on projects in Fauquier and Scott counties as part of the Innovation Bridge Research and Construction Program.  
   "I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Transportation is helping Virginia make solid progress in addressing traffic aggravation in these parts of the Commonwealth," said Senator Allen. "By using innovative construction materials we are not only improving the roads, but we are improving the lives of the people who travel those roads every day because construction will be more efficient and less intrusive for commuters. I look forward to seeing these new projects completed." 
   Scott County was awarded $400,000 to build a bridge on Route 58 over Cove Creek and $347,167 to build a bridge on Route 58 over Big Moccasin Creek. Both bridges will use innovative materials and technology to achieve a quality structure. 
   Fauquier County was awarded $400,000 to build a bridge on Route 17 that crosses over Route 15 and Route 29. This bridge will be comprised of two spans, each 98 feet long, and will also be constructed of state-of-the-art materials. 
   The Innovation Bridge Research and Construction Program (IBRC) is an initiative by the Federal Highway Administration to provide direction and funding to help state, county and local bridge owners incorporate innovative materials and technologies into their building projects. The intent of the program is to reduce congestion associated with bridge construction and maintenance, to increase productivity by lowering the life-cycle costs of bridges, to keep Americans and America's commerce moving and to enhance safety.
