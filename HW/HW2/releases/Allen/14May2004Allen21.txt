SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $14.4 MILLION AWARDED TO DULLES AIRPORT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a grant in the amount $14.4 million to Washington Dulles International Airport to rehabilitate a runway and bring it up to the standards needed to accommodate today's aircraft. 
   "Dulles Airport is one of the nation's fastest-growing airports and as such it plays a vital role in the community and local economy," said Senator Allen. "It's important to keep this airport in top condition so that it can continue to generate business and create jobs while maintaining a standard of excellence in safety and service."
   The rehabilitation project will include pavement demolition, reconstruction, drainage, marking, in-pavement lighting and environmental improvements for the entire length of the 10,500-foot runway. This runway, one of three at the airport, has been in continuous service since it was completed in 1962. Federal funds will cover 75 percent of the total cost of the project.
   The Airport Improvement Program is a federal grant-in-aid program that represents a major source of funding for airport development and planning. The grant comes from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration. Nearly $140 million in AIP funding has been provided to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority for the development at Dulles since the authority was created in 1987.
