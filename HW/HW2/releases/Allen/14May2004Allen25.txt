SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES BULLETPROOF VESTS FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN HAMPTON ROADS AREA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded grants to 10 jurisdictions in the Hampton Roads area for the purchase of bullet-resistant vests.  
 Altogether, 94 jurisdictions in Virginia received funding from the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program.
   "Keeping our law enforcement officers safe is key to keeping our families and communities safe. One of my top priorities in the Senate is the continued protection and security of our homeland here in Virginia," said Senator Allen. "It is reassuring to know that all across our great Commonwealth, law enforcement officers will have this new equipment, making Virginia a safer place to live, learn, work and raise a family."
   Hampton Roads localities and the amounts they received are as follows:
   * Chesapeake City $3,764.52;
   * Hampton City $2,037.84;
   * Newport News City $9,485.66;
   * Norfolk City $3,900.18;
   * Portsmouth City $2,708.16; 
   * Suffolk City $5,932.50;
   * Virginia Beach City $19,893.88;
   * Warsaw Town $349.99;
   * Williamsburg City $1,830;
   * York County $5,718.88
   The purpose of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program is to help localities equip their law enforcement officers with bullet-resistant and stab-resistant vests, thus protecting the men and women who serve to protect their communities. Jurisdictions with a population under 100,000 received priority funding, thus insuring that even small communities are adequately equipped.
