SEN. ALLEN SADDENED OVER LOSS OF MARINES IN IRAQ
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement regarding the loss of four members of the Marine Reserve Unit based in Lynchburg, Virginia who were killed in combat in Iraq on Wednesday:  
   "The lives of these young Virginia Marines and all the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the War on Terror will always be remembered in the hearts and minds of their families and friends, their communities, our Commonwealth and indeed, our great nation. They are true patriots and heroes. May God bless them and their families in this time of tremendous grief. 
   "This attack was conducted by vile terrorists who fear individual freedom and are attempting to thwart Iraq's advance toward free elections and representative democracy. But our brave troops and those of our coalition forces will not be deterred in the advancement of freedom for long-repressed Iraqis who look forward to casting ballots this Sunday for the future of a free and democratic Iraq. America must persevere in this important mission to spread peace through liberty. 
   "As Americans, we must do everything we can to ensure that we take care of our soldiers killed in action and their surviving families. I'm hopeful that this Congress will live up to our nation's obligation to help the families of the great patriots who have sacrificed their lives to protect our freedom and security. 
   "I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to provide more appropriate death benefits for the families of our fallen soldiers. And I will continue to strongly advocate raising the "death gratuity" from the paltry $12,420 to $100,000 to at least financially assist the surviving families. Clearly these families hurt the most on days like today. I believe the people of our grateful nation want to help these families who have also made the ultimate sacrifice with the loss of their loved one."
