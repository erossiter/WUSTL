SEN. ALLEN CALLS REP. GOSS 'OUSTANDING CHOICE' TO HEAD CIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) made the following comments after President Bush announced today that he would nominate Rep.  
 Porter Goss (R-FL) to be the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA): 
   "In my view, Porter Goss has the reputation, credibility and credentials to make an outstanding CIA Director. Clearly, he has the right experience for this position after serving in the CIA and as the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman Goss is well-respected for his knowledge, competence and steady personal demeanor. In addition, he has the important ability to be non-partisan. 
   "Currently, the U.S. is looking for ways here to enhance the CIA's ability as well as that of the entire counterintelligence community. I think Porter Goss is the perfect choice to head this effort. 
   "The President, in his decision today, is acting responsibly by putting a person with competence, great credentials and the proper experience into this vital position for our national security. In this time when our intelligence gathering is of heightened importance, we must improve these intel capabilities to better defend America from terrorism and other threats to our liberty."
