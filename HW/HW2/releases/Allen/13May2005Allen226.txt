SEN. ALLEN SECURES SERVICE MEDALS FOR LOCAL WWII VETERANS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that he successfully secured military service awards for Virginia veterans who served honorably in the U.S. Army during World War II. Sen.  
 Allen requested and secured these medals from the National Personnel Records Center and the U.S. Army on behalf of these veterans. 
   "Men and women like these veterans served courageously in our country's military and deserve not only our respect and thanks, but the medals that they earned while on Active Duty," said Senator Allen. "I am pleased to be part of the process which recognizes those who fought for our freedom, protected our homeland and promoted the ideals of liberty to the world." 
   Senator Allen's Representative will present the awards at the annual breakfast hosted by the VFW Floyd County Post 7854 and American Legion Post 127. The breakfast will be held at Ray's Restaurant in Floyd at 7:30 a.m. on May 28, 2005. The press is invited and encouraged to attend this event. 
   "I encourage veterans who need assistance obtaining military service awards to write to my Roanoke office at 3140 Chaparral Drive, Suite 101, Roanoke, VA 24018 so that we can assist you," Allen said.
