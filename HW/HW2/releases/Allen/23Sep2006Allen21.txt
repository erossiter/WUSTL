SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that President Bush has issued a major disaster declaration for the Commonwealth of Virginia, initiating the release of funds to help communities recover from Tropical Depression Ernesto, and severe storms and flooding that occurred between August 29 - September 7, 2006.  
   "This storm caused severe damage across the Commonwealth, disrupting many local communities with power outages and flooding due to heavy rain," said Senator Allen. "I personally witnessed the flooding in Norfolk during my inspection of the storm's damage earlier this month. The release of this federal funding will surely provide much-needed assistance to Virginians who were affected by this storm. I'm very pleased that President Bush has responded favorably to the Virginia Delegation's request for expedited federal support for our constituents." 
   On account of the damage caused by Ernesto, the following localities have been designated as eligible to receive Public Assistance funding: the counties of Accomack (including the town of Chincoteague), Caroline, Charles City, Dinwiddie, Essex, Gloucester, Isle of Wight, James City, King William, Lancaster, Mathews, Middlesex, Northampton, Northumberland, Richmond, Surry, Sussex, Westmoreland, and York and the independent cities of Richmond and Poquoson. All jurisdictions in the Commonwealth of Virginia are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Additional designations may be made at a later date after further evaluation.
