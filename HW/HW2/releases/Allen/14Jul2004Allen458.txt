SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES OVER $1.5 MILLION FOR VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) has selected the Virginia Department of Education to receive $1,555,000 in funding for State Program Improvement Grants.  
 The DOE grant will fund Virginia's State Improvement Grant program to aid students with disabilities.
   "I'm very pleased that this significant federal funding will be used to help provide tangible results in the classroom for our young students in need of special care," Senator Allen said. "This is an important grant program for Virginia's schools and is particularly noteworthy for its contribution to the betterment of life for so many families here in the Commonwealth." 
   The Commonwealth of Virginia's State Improvement Grant initiative seeks to address the academic challenges faced by middle and high school youth with mild to moderate disabilities. Specifically, the program's purpose is to assist educators in reforming and improving their systems for providing educational, early intervention, and transitional services. This includes their systems for professional development, technical assistance, and dissemination of knowledge about best practices, to improve results for children with disabilities. The grant will be for the period of July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005.
