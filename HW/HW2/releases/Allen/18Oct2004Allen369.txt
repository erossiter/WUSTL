SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL DISASTER AID AVAILABLE TO VIRGINIA LOCALITIES IMPACTED BY TROPICAL DEPRESSION JEANNE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that President Bush has designated the cities of Salem and Roanoke as well as the counties of Alleghany, Craig, Floyd, Giles, Montgomery, Patrick and Roanoke as disaster areas due to the damage caused by Tropical Depression Jeanne.  
 This declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people recover from the impact of severe storms and flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne, that occurred September 27, 2004 and continuing. 
   "I am grateful for the generous attention that President Bush has given the folks in need in Western and Southwest Virginia," said Senator Allen. "This storm had a terrible effect on families that suffered damage to their businesses and their homes. My heart goes out to those families and I will continue to do whatever I can on the federal level to ensure that these fine folks are able to get help and get back on their feet as quickly as possible." 
   Residents in the designated areas may apply for business or individual assistance through the Individual Assistance program. In addition, all jurisdictions in the Commonwealth are eligible to apply for federal aid under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. This program provides assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for actions taken to prevent or reduce long-term risk to life and property from natural hazards. 
   On October 5, 2004 Senator Allen wrote a letter to President Bush requesting a federal disaster declaration.
