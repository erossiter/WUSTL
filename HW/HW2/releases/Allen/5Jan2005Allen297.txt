SEN. ALLEN PRAISES PRESIDENT'S CHOICE OF FORMER HHS DEPUTY SECRETARY ALLEN TO LEAD DOMESTIC POLICY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised President Bush's choice to head the White House Domestic Policy team, Claude Allen. Mr.  
 Allen served the Commonwealth of Virginia in the administrations of Governors George Allen and James Gilmore. In addition, Mr. Allen is a former Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. 
   "This is an outstanding decision by President Bush. I have known and worked with Claude and know him to be a person with the right principles, experience in State and federal government, and the depth of knowledge to serve the President and America very well," said Senator Allen. 
   During Senator Allen's tenure as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Allen served as Counsel to the Virginia Attorney General. He later served as Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Commonwealth under Governor Gilmore. In 2003, Mr. Allen was nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   "I believe Claude will be especially helpful in Welfare reform efforts and in perfecting the implementation of education standards under 'No Child Left Behind' and other important domestic policy initiatives that will be so important to a successful second term for President Bush," said Senator Allen.
