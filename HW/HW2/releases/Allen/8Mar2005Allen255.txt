SEN. ALLEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON TO BE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement on the nomination of John Bolton to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations: 
   "President Bush has once again sent to the Senate an outstanding nominee for one of our nation's most important positions. John Bolton is just the kind of man we need to represent the United States at the United Nations. He understands both the best hopes we all have for the future of the U.N. and that organization's failings and problems that have become painfully obvious in recent years. The American taxpayer expects their ambassador to scrutinize the actions and expenditures of the U.N. and John Bolton will do just that. Most importantly, Bolton is no newcomer to international politics and I expect that he will show dexterity in being both diplomatic and tough at the same time."
