SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES VAUGHAN FURNITURE WORKERS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY BENEFITS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced a Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) certification from the U.S. Department of Labor has been successfully secured to aid workers at Vaughan Furniture Company, Inc in Stuart, Virginia. Employees who have been laid-off are now eligible to receive financial assistance for monthly household expenses, health insurance, retraining and, if necessary, relocation. In addition, Vaughan Furniture workers over the age of fifty will be eligible for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA).  
   "This certification will provide tangible help to the hardworking employees at Vaughan Furniture Company, who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own," said Senator Allen. "Any time a factory in Virginia closes, it is a devastating blow to the families and businesses throughout the community. I will continue to work hard to make sure that the voices of Southside Virginians are heard, and will advocate methods to attract new investment and jobs." 
   The Department of Labor's investigation determined that the workers at Vaughan Furniture in Stuart met requirements for federal assistance because their termination is directly related to a loss in sales due to the impact of imports produced in a foreign country. 
   On June 22, 2004 Senator Allen wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao asking for an expeditious approval of Vaughan Furniture's petition. 
   A trade-affected worker certified by the Department of Labor is eligible to apply for TAA/ATAA and may receive one or more of the following services and benefits: 
   * Reemployment Services: Employment Registration, Employment Counseling, Case Assessment, Job Development, Supportive Services, and Self-Directed Job Search Services 
   * Job Search Allowances: For costs of a job search outside of the local commuting area. 
   * Relocation Allowances: For costs of relocating to a job outside of the local commuting area. 
   * Trade Readjustment Allowances: Up to 104 weeks of income support for eligible workers enrolled in full-time training. 
   * Health Insurance Coverage Assistance: Tax credits covering up to 65% of the monthly health insurance premium paid by an eligible participant.
