SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAID-OFF SOUTHERN GLOVE EMPLOYEES IN DUFFIELD
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Labor Department for the 32 employees of Southern Glove Manufacturing Company, Inc who work at the Cumberland Glove Plant in Duffield, Virginia after the company announced that they will be permanently closing the Cumberland Glove Plant on May 14, 2004.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Scott County have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the U.S. Labor Department to help provide vital federal assistance for all Southern Glove employees affected by this closing," Senator Allen said. 
   Allen sent a letter today to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing his strong support for the expeditious review and grant of a Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) Older Workers Program filed by Southern Glove. TAA would provide displaced workers with important re-employment benefits and tax credits for continued health coverage. ATAA extends additional assistance to employees over the age of 50.
