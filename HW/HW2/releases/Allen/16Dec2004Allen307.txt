SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION AWARDED TO HELP ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY BUY FLOOD-PRONE HOUSES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded over $1 million to help Rockbridge County buy and demolish 26 flood-prone houses in Buena Vista, Fairfield and Vesuvius.  
   "Although we cannot be certain of the damage that more flooding may cause, we can work together to be as ready as possible for another emergency," said Senator Allen. "These federal funds will help Virginians in Rockbridge County protect their homes and belongings by moving to higher, safer ground. I am pleased to see the County, the Commonwealth and FEMA working together to improve the lives of so many families." 
   The 26 houses in the current project are on Old Marvin, South River Road, Timber Ridge Road, Wet Bear Road and Wolf Lane, in an area subject to repeated flooding. The county will buy the houses at pre-flood fair market value, giving the former owners the means to relocate to safer areas. After the houses are torn down, ownership of the land will revert to the county where they can use it for recreation, but no permanent building may be erected on it. 
   FEMA will pay $1,358,284 of the total estimated $1,811,045 cost. The remaining expenses must be covered by the Commonwealth of Virginia and Rockbridge County. This grant money comes from the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) that funds projects to reduce the risks from future disasters.
