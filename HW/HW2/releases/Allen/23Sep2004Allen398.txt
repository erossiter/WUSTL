SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) tonight urged his Senate colleagues to pass H.R. 1308 to provide continued tax relief and financial security and stability for American taxpayers. 
   "We already know that the tax relief President Bush proposed and the Congress passed three years ago has helped families and small business owners. American families deserve to have those cuts remain firmly in place to help with all of the expenses they face in raising their children. This tax relief bill is another example of Republican economic leadership and keeping a promise to hard working families in Virginia and all across America so they can keep more of the money they earn," said Senator Allen.
