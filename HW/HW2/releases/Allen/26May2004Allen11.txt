SEN. ALLEN COMMENDS NFL FOR DECISION TO HONOR PAT TILLMAN DURING 2004 SEASON
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today commended the National Football League (NFL) for its decision to honor Pat Tillman during its 2004 regular season.  
 After Tillman's tragic death while serving in Afghanistan last month, Allen sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on NFL Draft Day, April 24, requesting him to dedicate the upcoming season to Tillman and his fellow soldiers serving in the War on Terrorism. Allen made the following remarks today: 
   "I'm very pleased that the NFL has decided to honor the memory of a true American hero, Pat Tillman, during the upcoming 2004 season. 
   "Like so many others, I was moved back in 2002 when Pat Tillman made a decision for his country that involved personal risk and great sacrifice professionally and financially. When Pat left his multimillion dollar contract with the Arizona Cardinals to train and become an Army Ranger it was a stunning statement about America and what kind of man Pat Tillman was. 
   "I know that NFL fans appreciated the fact that the league honored those who perished on September 11, 2001 and those who have been fighting for freedom ever since by putting the American flag on the players' uniforms. I commend the NFL today for its patriotic decision to honor one of its own, a soldier and a hero who has already found his place in the NFL history books and in the hearts of millions of Americans. We will never forget Pat and we cannot for a moment forget those who are currently serving in harm's way. I applaud the NFL for honoring the tremendous sacrifices of our brave troops."
