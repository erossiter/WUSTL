SEN. ALLEN WORKING TO SECURE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR CHESAPEAKE NOVA CHEMICALS EMPLOYEES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor for 150 employees of NOVA Chemicals after the company announced plans to permanently close its Chesapeake, Virginia manufacturing location this year.  
 This assistance would include Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance which provides job training and education programs to the employees. 
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Chesapeake have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Secretary Chao and the U.S. Department of Labor to help provide vital federal assistance for these NOVA Chemical employees who have lost their jobs," Senator Allen said. 
   All impacted employees will have access to NOVA Chemicals' Employment Transition and Continuity program (ET&C) that offers employees a number of program choices and a variety of support tools to help them manage in this difficult transition. They will also have an opportunity to receive one-on-one counseling to help support their transition choices and other local employers will be contacted who may benefit from these employees' skill sets. 
   NOVA Chemicals produces plastics and chemicals that are essential to everyday life. Their employees develop and manufacture materials for customers worldwide that produce consumer, industrial and packaging products. NOVA Chemicals works to ensure effective health, safety, security and environmental stewardship.
