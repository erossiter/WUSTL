SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES MATHEWS COUNTY LIBRARY SELECTED TO PARTICIPATION IN FREEDOM BOOKSHELF PROGRAM
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the National Endowment for the Humanities has selected the Mathews County Library to receive the "We the People" Freedom Bookshelf. The library was selected out of 500 libraries to receive a new set of classic books for young readers on the theme of freedom.  
   "As we face the many challenges in our world, it is vitally important that our children learn about our history so that they know what it means to be an American," said Senator Allen. "One of the greatest investments we can make is in educating the next generation, and it is essential that our children receive a good educational foundation to prepare them for a lifetime of success." 
   The Bookshelf is part of the NEH's "We the People" initiative, which supports projects that strengthen the teaching, study and understanding of American history and culture. In return for receiving a Bookshelf, libraries are asked to organize programs that highlight the theme of freedom and encourage young readers to explore these works. 
   "We were delighted to learn about this award," said Bette Dillehay, Director of the Mathews County Library. "Using the materials we received, we will be implementing a four month program focusing on the benefits of living in the United States. Children will have the opportunity to learn a great deal about our country and democracy." 
   The Mathews County Library Bookshelf will include titles such as "The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses" by Paul Goble, "The Complete Chronicles of Narnia" by C.S. Lewis, "Ben and Me" by Robert Lawson, "To Be a Slave" by Julius Lester, "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" by Elizabeth George Speare, "My Antonia" by Willa Cather, and "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
