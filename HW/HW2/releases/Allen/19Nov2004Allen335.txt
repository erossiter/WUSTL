CONGRESS APPROVES SEN. ALLEN INTERNET TAX BAN
  In a major victory for millions of consumers who use and rely on the Internet, Congress today gave final approval to legislation sponsored by Senator George Allen (R-VA) that extends the ban on multiple and discriminatory taxes on Internet access and online sales until October 31, 2007.  
 The Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act (S. 150) was co-sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden, (D-OR) and by Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA). It passed this afternoon in the U.S. House of Representatives and is being sent to President Bush for his signature.
   "Today, the winners are the American people. This legislation is a victory for those of us who stand for freedom, opportunity and prosperity rather than more taxation and burdensome regulations on the Internet. The Internet is one of our country's greatest innovations for individual empowerment, economic growth and jobs. Extending the tax moratorium and protecting all types of broadband technology platforms puts America one step closer to closing the economic digital divide," said Senator Allen.
   "I strongly believe that when something is taxed like the Internet, fewer--especially those with lower incomes-are able to afford it. This legislation is a victory for all families, students and small businesses that use the Internet to learn, disseminate ideas and thoughts, and create more opportunities in the marketplace for products and services. In addition, we want to get broadband from every part of our Commonwealth to rural areas and small towns across America. This law will keep the tax commissars at bay for the next four years," he said.
   Senator Allen's legislation now goes to the White House. It is expected to be signed into law by President Bush by year's end.
