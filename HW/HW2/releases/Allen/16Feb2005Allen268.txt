SEN. ALLEN RELEASES PHOTOS TAKEN WITH VIRGINIA TROOPS STATIONED IN IRAQ
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) released the following statement with photos from his recent trip to the Middle East in which he visited with Virginia National Guard troops stationed in Iraq.  
   "During my visit to Iraq, I had the pleasure of meeting with members of the Virginia National Guard stationed in Iraq, including the 111th Field Artillery, the 129th Field Artillery and the 3647th Maintenance Company," said Senator Allen. "It's always an invigorating experience spending time with the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who risk and sacrifice so much to keep us safe and defend our freedoms. The patriots I visited with in Iraq are truly some of the finest that our nation has to offer and I'm so proud of the way they represent Virginia and America. These troops and their fellow soldiers throughout Iraq and Afghanistan are all American heroes and they're leading the charge in the War on Terror. They have helped bring forth historic freedom to the long repressed people of Iraq and I told them all how proud we are of their service and dedication. I know that we all wish them Godspeed as they continue with their treacherous duty overseas." 
   Additional photos from Senator Allen's trip to Iraq are available upon request.
