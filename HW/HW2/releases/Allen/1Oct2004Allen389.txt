SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TWO MENTORING PROGRAMS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded MENTOR grants to two Virginia mentoring programs.  
 $153,965 was awarded to the Virginia Tech Office of Sponsored Programs in Blacksburg, VA and $159,167 was awarded to Rappahannock Big Brothers Big Sisters in Fredericksburg, VA. Senator Allen has worked to promote these grants and make them accessible to schools across the Commonwealth. 
   "Improving the educational environment for the children of Virginia continues to be one of my top priorities," said Senator Allen. "One of the greatest investments we can make is by educating the next generation, and it is vitally important that our children receive a good foundation to prepare them for a lifetime of success." 
   The MENTOR grants are awarded to programs that provide mentors, improve academic performance, improve interpersonal relationships between the children and others in the community, reduce the dropout rate, and reduce juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs. Grant funds will be used for programs and activities to serve children with the greatest need living in rural areas, high-crime areas, troubled home environments or who attend schools with violence problems.
