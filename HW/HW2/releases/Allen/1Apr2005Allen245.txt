SEN. ALLEN COMMENTS ON USS KENNEDY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today made the following statement upon learning that the Navy is canceling the RFP (Request for Proposal) for the bid to overhaul the U.S.S. Kennedy:  
   "I'm disappointed that the Navy has made this unfortunate and unwise decision to cancel the bid to overhaul the U.S.S. Kennedy. This decision will be difficult to reverse, but I will keep trying. 
   "I'm not convinced that reducing our carrier fleet is the best strategic decision in the midst of our global war against terrorism. Realistically, it looks like the Department of Defense and the Navy are maneuvering quickly to negate legislative oversight. Clearly, Congress will be weighing in on any proposal to shrink or weaken our naval fleet. For that reason it would be inappropriate for the Navy to proceed as if a decision has already been made."
