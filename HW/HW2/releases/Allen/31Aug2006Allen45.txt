SEN. ALLEN URGES HOMELAND SECURITY TO BE PREPARED FOR TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO
  In a meeting in Virginia Beach this morning with Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) urged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to do everything possible to assist in the event of Virginia flooding from Tropical Storm Ernesto. The Secretary assured Sen. Allen that he and his staff are closely monitoring the storm and are preparing in the event Virginia is affected. 
   "I want to ask all Virginians to monitor the path of Tropical Storm Ernesto closely and to be prepared as the storm moves on to the eastern seaboard," said Senator Allen. "This morning I met personally with Secretary Chertoff and asked him to make sure that DHS and FEMA are prepared in the event that parts of Virginia are affected by flooding from the storm. The secretary has assured me that FEMA is keeping a close track of the storm to determine where high levels of flooding may occur."
