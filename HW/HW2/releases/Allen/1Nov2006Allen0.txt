SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $928,000 SAFER GRANT TO SPOTSYLVANIA COUNTY FIRE, RESCUE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded a grant of $928,000 to Spotsylvania County Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Management.  
   "Improving the safety and security of Virginians and our communities is one of my top priorities. By recruiting firefighters and enhancing the fire prevention training we are making great strides in this important mission," said Senator Allen. "Since my days as Governor, I have worked hard to protect Virginians and their property. I'm sure that Spotsylvania communities will be safer because of this assistance." 
   The purpose of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants is to help fire departments increase the number of frontline firefighters. The goal is for fire departments to increase their staffing and deployment capabilities and ultimately attain 24-hour staffing, thus assuring that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. The SAFER grants support two specific activities: (1) the hiring of firefighters, and (2) recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. The hiring of firefighters activity provides grants to pay for part of the salaries of newly hired firefighters over the 5-year program. SAFER is part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants and is under the purview of the Office of Grants and Training of the Department of Homeland Security.
