SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES CONTRACTS FOR THREE COMPANIES TO HELP PREPARE FOR PORT SECURITY THREATS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has awarded contracts to three companies in Northern Virginia to conduct disaster response exercises at the nation's largest seaports.  
   "Once again Virginia gets the chance to play a key role in the security and safety of the nation," said Senator Allen. "These contracts are good news for the companies who will perform the work, but also for the citizens who will be better protected in the case of a disaster. This is another example of how we are actively guarding against terrorism, making every effort to keep Virginians safe." 
   The following companies received grants under the newly created Port Security Exercise Program: 
   Community Research Associates Alexandria, VA $571,119 
   Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc McLean, VA $398,611 
   UNITECH Centreville, VA $116,321 
   These three companies will conduct Phase I of "table top" transportation security-incident scenarios to evaluate and enhance security plans for the nation's largest seaports. Various scenarios could focus on how officials react to discovering a suspect cargo container or to an explosion near a fuel depot at a seaport. Phase I contractors will work toward developing transportation security-incident scenarios which may include simulation software and databases to monitor and evaluate exercises as well as a schedule for deployment.
