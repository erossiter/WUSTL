SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FEMA FUNDS FOR VIRGINIA PRE-DISASTER SAFETY PLANS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved more than $1 million in funding for the development of 15 local all-hazard mitigation plans in Virginia. 
   "Although we cannot be certain of the damage and chaos that a natural disaster like Hurricane Isabel might cause, we can work together to prepare a plan of action that will make us as ready as possible for another emergency," said Senator Allen. "These federal funds will help Virginians be better equipped to safely and confidently protect the people, homes and businesses in their communities."
