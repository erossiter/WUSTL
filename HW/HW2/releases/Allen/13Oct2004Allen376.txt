SEN. ALLEN COMMEMORATES THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF PAROLE ABOLITION IN VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen joined Virginia Attorney General Jerry Kilgore at a ceremony this morning in Richmond to commemorate the 10th anniversary of then-Governor Allen's signing of historic parole abolition legislation in Virginia.  
 Allen today released the following statement after the commemoration: 
   "Ten years ago, Virginia had a lenient, dishonest parole system for criminals. Three out of four violent crimes: murder, armed robbery, rape and assault, were committed by repeat offenders. It was clear that many lives were being lost, women were being raped and citizens were being assaulted because convicted criminals were being released early. 
   When I was running for Governor, I promised to slam shut the revolving door of justice that had caused such tragedy for victims of violent crimes and their families. Working with the Virginia General Assembly in a bipartisan effort, the call we made was very clear: Let's keep these violent criminals behind bars. 
   Today, because of the parole abolition legislation we passed ten years ago, first degree murderers, rapists and armed robbers complete 91% of their prison sentences, rather than the 30% sentence they completed prior to the law. This law was about protecting Virginians and it has worked; crime is down and Virginians are safer. I'm pleased today to commemorate this bipartisan legislation which continues to make Virginia a better place to live, work, learn and raise a family."
