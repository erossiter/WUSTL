SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO APPLY FOR FIRE PREVENTION, SAFETY GRANTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness is now accepting applications for the FY 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program.  
 Local fire departments may apply anytime between September 1, 2004 and September 30, 2004. 
   "Improving the safety and security of our nation and its citizens continues to be one of my top priorities. By making the funds available to enhance the training and support of our emergency first responders, we are making great strides in this important mission," said Senator Allen. 
   The program assists state, regional, national, or local organizations in addressing fire prevention and safety. The primary goal is to reach and prevent fire-related injuries among high-risk target groups including children, seniors and firefighters. 
   "I encourage all local fire departments to contact my office to receive information on how to develop and write a grant proposal, as well as to request a letter of support for your application. Please contact Ethel Henry in my Richmond office at 804-771-2221 or ethel_henry@allen.senate.gov so that we can assist you," Allen said.
