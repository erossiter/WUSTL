SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $75,000 GRANT AWARDED TO GOOD SHEPHERD ALLIANCE FOR SERVICE TO HOMELESS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that the Department of Labor has awarded a grant of $75,000 to The Good Shepherd Alliance Incorporated (GSA), for their "Career Advancement Now!" (CAN) project which seeks to improve the earning potential of Loudoun County 's homeless population.  
   "I am so pleased that these folks are receiving this funding. Providing training in the skills necessary to sustain themselves is truly an invaluable benefit to the homeless," said Senator Allen. "This project is of vital importance to the homeless in Northern Virginia and I'm glad that they will be able to continue offering their services to enable these individuals to get back on their feet again."
   The Good Shepherd Alliance manages homeless shelters throughout Loudoun County . The project guides clients from the moment of intake all the way through self-sufficiency in a maximum of 89 days, and expects to enroll at least 50 new clients in the CAN program within the next 18 months. They estimate the average wage will be up to $9.85 an hour for the work performed within the program. 50 percent of the new enrollees (25 clients) will be encouraged to obtain a GED and 100 percent of the new enrollees (all 50 clients) will be encouraged and assisted to enter skills training, apprenticeships, or higher education as a part of the program. Services include post-job placement mentoring and educational/skills advancement.
