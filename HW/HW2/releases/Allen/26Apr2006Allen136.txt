SEN. ALLEN LAUDS R.R. DONNELLEY'S $38 MILLION PLANT EXPANSION IN ROANOKE COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today lauded the announcement of R.R. Donnelley's plans to expand its Roanoke County printing and related services manufacturing facility. This expansion includes $30.5 million in new advanced equipment. In addition building improvements will total nearly $8 million. 83 new jobs will be created over the next two years with an average salary of almost $33,000. 
   "Like expansion by Dynax in nearby Botetourt County , I'm so pleased to see these outstanding companies thriving and growing in the Roanoke Valley and Virginia ," Senator Allen said. "This is great news for the economy, for the region, and indeed for the Commonwealth. Having worked on expansion plans with R.R. Donnelley as Governor, I know these are the kind of good-paying jobs that are vitally important in making Virginia a better place to live, work and raise a family."
   Expansion of the Roanoke County facility which will increase the book printing operations will result in a total investment of over $100 million by R.R. Donnelley since 1996. This represents the largest capital investment by an industrial partner in the last 10 years. The plant is a revolutionary digital facility that offers publishers the fastest, most profitable way to bring our four-color books to market. The Roanoke County facility currently employs approximately 220 people at its Glenvar plant.
