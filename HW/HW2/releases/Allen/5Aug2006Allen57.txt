SEN. ALLEN HAILS DEAL BRINGING WASHINGTON NATIONALS BACK TO COMCAST CABLE SYSTEM
  Like so many baseball fans and families in Northern Virginia, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) tonight enthusiastically welcomed the Washington Nationals back to the Comcast cable system, which serves a large portion of residents in the region. A late evening deal between Comcast Cable and the Mid-Atlantic SportsNet (MASN) allows Comcast to carry National's games to expanded basic cable customers in the Washington metropolitan area as well as Baltimore and Salisbury, Maryland. 
   "My family and I are among those in Northern Virginia who would much rather be at the ballpark to enjoy this great American pastime. Unfortunately, this summer, this complicated impasse prevented our family and many others from being able to watch on television when we were at home. I'm so pleased that finally, the parties involved were able to sit-down and resolve a complex dispute that lost sight of what really mattered, the fans," said Senator Allen this evening.
   In April, Senator Allen wrote a letter to Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. In that letter, the Senator urged MLB to help resolve the impasse on the cable television.
   "I believe that Major League Baseball bears a significant responsibility for creating this undesirable, unfair situation," wrote Senator Allen to Commissioner Selig. "I have never heard of a situation in which the telecast rights to a professional sports team have been owned by one of the other franchises, especially a competitor."
