SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $338,000 COMMUNITY FACILITY LOAN AWARDED TO CULPEPER COUNTY
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program has awarded a Community Facility Direct Loan in the amount of $338,000 to Reva Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company in Culpeper County.  
   "These federal funds will allow the folks in Culpeper County to expand the resources available to the men and women who serve the community as first responders" said Senator Allen. "I am pleased that the USDA is once again able to provide needed support to improve the safety of Virginians." 
   The funds will be used to purchase a new pumper fire truck which will provide public safety assistance and better fire protection. The new truck will replace an old truck that keeps breaking down on the way to fires. This purchase will remove a real and imminent safety concern to better serve the residents in this service area. 
   The USDA administers funds designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. These facilities include schools, libraries, childcare, hospitals, medical clinics, assisted living facilities, fire and rescue stations, police stations, community centers, public buildings and transportation. Through its Community Facility programs, the Department of Agriculture is striving to ensure that such facilities are readily available to all rural communities.
