SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR SARA LEE BRANDED APPAREL EMPLOYEES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that federal assistance for the 332 employees of Sara Lee Branded Apparel in Galax has been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. This assistance includes Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) which provide job training and education programs to the employees. 
   "Last March I was saddened to hear that many hardworking men and women in Galax who were employed at the Sara Lee Branded Apparel Plant in Galax would be losing their jobs. These workers have been faced with the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. Upon hearing of Sara Lee's closing I immediately sought the help of the U.S. Department of Labor in providing support for these folks. I'm pleased that Secretary Chao and the U.S. Department of Labor have approved this funding to help provide vital federal assistance for these Sara Lee employees who are facing the effects of losing their jobs," Senator Allen said.
   Chicago-based Sara Lee Corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, brand-name products for consumers throughout the world. Sara Lee Branded Apparel is one of four Sara Lee subsidiary business groups. The Galax plant closure is related to a shift in plant production of knit fabric to the Dominican Republic and El Salvador. The Galax plant began its closure process in March of 2005.
