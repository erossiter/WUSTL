SEN. ALLEN EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER FOREIGN OWNED COMPANIES OPERATING PORTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today sent a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow expressing his concerns over national security if the United Arab Emirates (UAE) owned company DP World acquires the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Company. Should the acquisition be finalized a foreign government-owned company would control some of the busiest ports in the . 
   "Our ports are an essential part of our nation's continued economic prosperity," wrote Senator Allen. "They are the hubs of the global economy and are vital to moving American products to markets around the globe. However, they are vulnerable to terrorist attacks... While the UAE has been a valuable ally in the War on Terror, there have been past circumstances that have raised concern."
