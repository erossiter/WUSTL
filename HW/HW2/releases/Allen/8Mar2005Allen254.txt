SEN. ALLEN ENCOURAGES FIRE DEPARTMENTS, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO APPLY FOR FIRE GRANTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is now accepting applications for the FY 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 Fire departments and emergency medical service providers may apply through Friday, April 8, 2005. 
   "Improving the safety and security of our nation and its citizens continues to be one of my top priorities. By making the funds available to enhance the training and support of our emergency first responders, we are making great strides in this important mission," said Senator Allen. 
   The purpose of this grant program is to assist local fire departments and non-affiliated emergency medical services providers with the acquisition of equipment, vehicles and training. Interested applicants are encouraged to apply electronically at www.firegrantsupport.com. Additional program guidance is available by calling the Fire Grant Help Line toll free at 866-274-0960. 
   "I hope Virginia's fire departments and emergency responders will contact my office to receive information on how to develop and write a grant proposal, as well as to request a letter of support for your application. Please contact Sarah Walker in my Richmond office at 804-771-2221 or at sarah_walker@allen.senate.gov so that we can assist you," Allen said.
