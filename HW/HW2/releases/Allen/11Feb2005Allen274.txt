SEN. ALLEN CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES OBTAIN SEASONAL WORKERS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today joined with Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Judd Gregg (R-NH) to introduce the "Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act" which addresses the shortage of H2B work visas available to employees of small and seasonal businesses.  
   "After hearing from business owners in Virginia, I am convinced that H2B visa reform is desperately and immediately needed," said Senator Allen. "While we must hold the line on immigration standards and restrictions, we must also secure the survival of businesses which are often the lifeline of their communities. I feel confident that this new piece of legislation will adequately address the immediate needs of seasonal businesses while paving the way for more permanent reforms down the road." 
   Many small businesses count on the H2B visa program to keep their companies alive by allowing them to hire temporary and seasonal positions when no American workers are available. Currently there is a cap of 66,000 workers per fiscal year who can apply for the H2B visa. For the past two years that cap has been reached early in the fiscal year, hurting many seasonal businesses that need workers in the later months. If these businesses cannot get the additional seasonal help they need they will be forced to limit services, lay off permanent American staff or even close their doors. 
   The "Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act" will accomplish four things: 
   * Exempts workers from the 66,000 H2B cap who have already successfully participated in the H2B Visa Program in one of the last three years. 
   * Makes sure that the government agencies processing the H2B visas have the resources they need to detect and prevent fraud, requires employers to pay a $150 fee on each H2B petition and creates sanctions for filing false H2B petitions. 
   * Reserves half of the 66,000 visas for employers needing workers in the winter and half for those needing workers in the summer. 
   * Creates new reporting requirements for the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that Congress knows how many people are using the program, how many are returning each year and/or had their visa status revoked or otherwise terminated.
