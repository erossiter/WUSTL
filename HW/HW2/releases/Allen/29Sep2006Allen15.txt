SEN. ALLEN WILL SUPPORT KENTUCKY DERBY HOSIERY WORKERS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today voiced support for the more than 60 workers to be laid off at a Kentucky Derby Hosiery plant in Carroll County  
   "I want to pledge my full support to these Kentucky Derby workers who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own," said Senator Allen. "As further information becomes available, I will work to ensure that they receive the federal assistance available to them including job adjustment training. I will continue to work hard to make sure that the voices of Southwest Virginians are heard, and will continue to advocate, as I have done since my days as Governor, methods to attract new investment and jobs to the region." 
   Kentucky Derby Hosiery purchased one of the first buildings in the Carroll County Industrial Park in 1994, and was recently acquired by Gildan Activewear Inc. Gildan has announced it will cut about 540 North American jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, as it continues to shift production to Central America and the Caribbean to cut costs. They also announced the closure and downsizing of sock manufacturing capacity in Mount Airy, North Carolina, and Hillsville, Virginia.
