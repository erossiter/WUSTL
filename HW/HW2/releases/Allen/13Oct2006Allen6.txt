SEN. ALLEN STANDS WITH KAINE ON SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION LOAN REQUEST
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced that he strongly supports Gov. Kaine's request for help from the U.S. Small Business Administration following this second refusal by FEMA to provide individual disaster assistance for Virginians affected by Tropical Depression Ernesto.  
   "Hundreds of individual Virginians suffered as a result of this storm and I will continue offering my support to the Governor as he works to provide individual assistance to those who were affected," Senator Allen said. "The availability of low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration would indeed make it possible for Virginians to get back on their feet as quickly as possible. I will work with my fellow Virginians in Congress to support the Governor's efforts on behalf of my constituents." 
   Senator Allen is committed to serving homeowners and renters as well as the business locations affected by Ernesto and he supports the request for SBA loans which would certainly help those affected recover more quickly. SBA can lend up to $200,000 to homeowners for restoring or repairing their primary home, as well as $40,000 in loans for the replacement of personal property. Senator Allen fully supports Governor Kaine in requesting this assistance for the counties of Gloucester and Northumberland, and the cities of Hampton, Newport News, and Richmond.
