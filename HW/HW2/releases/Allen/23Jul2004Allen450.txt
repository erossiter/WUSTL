SENS. WARNER, ALLEN GAIN SENATE PASSAGE OF COIN FOR JAMESTOWN 2007 CELEBRATION
  Sens. John Warner (R-VA) and George Allen (R-VA) today praised Senate passage of a bill that they sponsored to authorize a Jamestown Commemorative Coin to raise funds for the Jamestown 2007 celebration.  
 The Virginia senators secured the 67 co-sponsors necessary to authorize a congressional coin. Each year, only two commemorative coins are permitted to be created in Congress. The Jamestown coin passed by unanimous consent, with 72 co-sponsors. 
   Senator Warner said, "This coin will help bring national attention to this important anniversary and will serve as a fitting tribute to America's first settlers. It also gives every American a chance to help support our nation's hometown, Jamestown, Virginia." 
   "I'm very pleased to have helped secure broad bipartisan passage of this bill to commemorate the 2007 celebration in Jamestown," said Senator Allen. "Since the days I served as Governor, I've felt that the eyes of the world will be on Virginia in 2007 and secured early funding for the commemoration. These funds will help ensure that Jamestown's 400th Anniversary Celebration will be a fitting tribute to the birthplace of American democracy and Virginia, the cradle of American liberty." 
   There will be two versions of the Jamestown commemorative coin: a $5 gold version ($35 surcharge) and a $1 silver version ($10 surcharge). All congressional coins include a surcharge which is used to support the sponsoring organization(s). The surcharges created through the Jamestown coin will benefit the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, the Department of the Interior and the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.
