SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CARTER FAMILY MEMORIAL MUSIC CENTER
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded a grant in the amount of $500,000 to the Carter Family Memorial Music Center in Scott County, VA.  
 The grant will be used to expand the historical performance facility and enhance the tourism venue to generate an estimated $2.7 million impact on the region within five years. 
   "It is so important to preserve and promote our cultural history by investing in places like the Carter Center in Hiltons," said Senator Allen. "Because of this expansion, more people will be able to enjoy the famous Carter Family music and experience good old-fashioned Virginia hospitality." 
   This grant will be used to increase tourist traffic by expanding and upgrading the Carter Fold theater, rehabilitating the A.P. Carter Store and Museum, and installing parking and vending areas. The project will develop the Carter Fold into a major regional tourist attraction and ensure that future generations will be able to experience Appalachia's musical roots. 
   In addition to ARC funds, Rural Development is providing a $50,000 grant, the Virginia Tobacco Commission is providing $113, 583 and the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority is providing $113, 583, and the grantee has committed $248,102 for a total project cost of $1,025,268.
