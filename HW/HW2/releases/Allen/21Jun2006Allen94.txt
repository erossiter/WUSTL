SEN. ALLEN PRAISES SECRETARY NICHOLSON FOR APPROVING NO-COST CREDIT CHECK/FRAUD MONITORING FOR VETERANS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson for announcing that the Department of Veterans Affairs will offer no-cost credit checks and fraud monitoring for the 26.5 million veterans and active duty military personnel whose personal data and Social Security Information was stolen from the home of a Veterans Administration employee in May. On Monday Sen. Allen, with co-sponsors Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID) and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) offered an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that will provide at no-cost to veterans, the same protections and services the secretary agreed to provide today. Allen's amendment is supported by the V.A. Secretary and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
  "I applaud Secretary Nicholson for agreeing with us and taking the reasonable action to ensure the V.A. provides these veterans with free credit checks and fraud monitoring and I appreciate his support of my amendment to appropriately respond to the legitimate concerns of veterans. We owe these great patriots nothing less," said Senator Allen.
  "During meetings over the last several days my colleagues and I made it clear that the government should respond to this unfortunate situation with the same concern and action that a private business would for their customers. Today's announcement has shown that these concerns were heard loud and clear and action to protect our veterans is clearly on its way."
