SENATE PASSES HOMELAND SECURITY BILL; LEGISLATION INCLUDES SEN. ALLEN AMENDMENT
  The U.S. Senate last night passed the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2005.  
 The funding bill includes an amendment by Sen. George Allen (R-VA) directing the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assess the adequacy of the Shockoe Creek drain field in Richmond, Virginia, to determine the means of preventing future flooding and flood damage in the area. 
   "I'm pleased the Senate passed the Homeland Security appropriations bill to provide vital funding to the men and women who help keep our homeland safe and secure," Allen said. "I'm especially pleased because this legislation provided me the first opportunity to take action to help ensure that Richmond residents are protected in the future from the type of terrible damage and costly repair they suffered due to Tropical Storm Gaston. It's important that this gets to President Bush's desk promptly to ensure the federal government works with local officials to develop an action plan, so that entrepreneurs have confidence to continue investing in historic Shockoe Bottom." 
   The bill, which also passed in the House, will now move to a House-Senate conference to resolve differences before it heads to President Bush's desk.
