SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAID-OFF ETHAN ALLEN EMPLOYEES IN BRIDGEWATER
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today pledged to seek federal assistance from the U.S. Labor Department for the 220 employees of Ethan Allen, Inc. in Bridgewater, Virginia after the company announced that they will be permanently closing the Bridgewater Division on June 25, 2004.  
   "Today, many hardworking men and women in Rockingham County have tremendous worries about the expenses and costs associated with learning new skills, changing careers and finding new jobs. In the coming days, I will be working with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the U.S. Labor Department to help provide vital federal assistance for all Ethan Allen employees affected by this closing," Senator Allen said. 
   Allen sent a letter today to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing his strong support for the expeditious review and grant of a Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and for Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) Older Workers Program filed by Ethan Allen. TAA would provide displaced workers with important re-employment benefits and tax credits for continued health coverage. ATAA extends additional assistance to employees over the age of 50.
