SEN. ALLEN SECURES LOAN TO VIRGINIA RAILWAY EXPRESS
  Touting the importance of commuter rail to the Commonwealth's transportation infrastructure, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today praised the approval of a low interest loan to Virginia Railway Express that will allow it to purchase up to 50 new rail cars. The approval came after months of bureaucratic wrangling in which Sen. Allen took a lead role in negotiating between the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Railroad Administration. Late last week, the final details of the loan were approved, clearing the way for VRE to spend $72.5 million dollars buying rail cars from Sumitomo Corporation of America in a deal Senator Allen called "vital in enhancing and expanding our passenger rail system throughout Northern Virginia." 
   Virginia Railway Express first submitted a loan application for the planned purchase back in February. But because the deal was one of the first public transit agencies to apply for federal funding under the Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing Program, the loan hit unexpected hurdles and the delay threatened Sumitomo Corporation of America's ability to deliver under the original terms of the contract. Senator Allen encouraged the Office of Management and Budget--which had to approve the terms of the agreement--to issue a final decision last week, which it did, allowing federal funds to go towards the first purchases.
   "I'm thrilled that this federal loan program will allow the Virginia Railway Express to expand and upgrade its service, helping it to attract more passengers and ease traffic congestion on our roads," said Senator Allen. "This loan approval means that VRE will be better able to serve more Virginians and give them more time to spend at home with their families."
