SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES BULLETPROOF VESTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded grants to 11 jurisdictions in Northern Virginia for the purchase of bullet-resistant vests.  
 Altogether, 94 jurisdictions in Virginia received funding from the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program.
   "Keeping our law enforcement officers safe is key to keeping our families and communities safe. One of my top priorities in the Senate is the continued protection and security of our homeland here in Virginia," said Senator Allen. "It is reassuring to know that all across our great Commonwealth, law enforcement officers will have this new equipment, making Virginia a safer place to live, learn, work and raise a family." 
   Northern Virginia localities and the amounts they received are as follows: 
   * Alexandria City $1,891.91;
   * Arlington City $8,485.31;
   * Fairfax City $2,925;
   * Fairfax County $18,714.61;
   * Fauquier County $6,000;
   * Fredericksburg City $3,111.94;
   * Herndon Town $1,960;
   * Manassas Park City $990;
   * Spotsylvania County $4,850; 
   * Stafford County $42,675.50;
   * Vienna Town $13,080.
   The purpose of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program is to help localities equip their law enforcement officers with bullet-resistant and stab-resistant vests, thus protecting the men and women who serve to protect their communities. Jurisdictions with a population under 100,000 received priority funding, thus insuring that even small communities are adequately equipped.
