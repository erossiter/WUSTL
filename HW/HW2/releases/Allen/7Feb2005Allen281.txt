SEN. ALLEN CALLS ON CONGRESS TO KEEP USS KENNEDY IN SERVICE
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today demanded that Congress reject a plan by the Pentagon that would shrink the nation's aircraft carrier fleet from its current 12 to 11 by retiring the U.S.S. Kennedy from its long service to the nation.  
   "We are at war and now is not the time to do anything that will weaken our strategic military capability of responding quickly and decisively to project our power to predictable and unpredictable troubled areas anywhere in the world," says Senator Allen. Allen is co-sponsoring legislation that would keep the U.S.S Kennedy in service. 
   "I am one who believes that in a time of war, you don't start cutting our military capabilities. It is vital that we keep 12 carriers in service so that our Navy can respond to any contingency on any part of the globe. To do anything less is to lessen our commitment to the brave men and women of our armed forces who depend on aircraft carrier support and capabilities at a moment's notice," said Senator Allen. 
   "I will work to prevent not only the mothballing of the U.S.S. Kennedy but also the redeployment of any Virginia-based carrier to other ports to cover the Kennedy's retirement. Naval Station Norfolk is uniquely situated, equipped and staffed to handle America's Atlantic Fleet. It's important to me to not only protect America's military readiness, but also these vital Virginia jobs and the taxpayer's long-term investment in Naval Station Norfolk," said Senator Allen.
