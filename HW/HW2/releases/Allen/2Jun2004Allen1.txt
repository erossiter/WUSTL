Yesterday, Senator John Warner and I introduced a resolution into the Congressional Record expressing the congratulations of the United States Senate to these outstanding young women.
   "As a University of Virginia graduate and father of a daughter who plays lacrosse in high school, I express the pride felt by all students, faculty and alumni of the University of Virginia at this tremendous accomplishment by the women's lacrosse team. Coach Julie Myers and her superb coaching staff: Colleen Shearer, Heather Dow and Kateri Linville, deserve much of the credit for the accomplishment of these student athletes and should also be highly commended. The members of the 2004 University of Virginia's Women's Lacrosse team have indeed made Mr. Jefferson's University proud and should be applauded for their character and leadership, both on and off the playing field."
