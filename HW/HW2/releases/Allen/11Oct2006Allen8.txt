SEN. ALLEN PLEDGES SUPPORT TO FLOODING VICTIMS IN FRANKLIN
  When the Blackwater River rose, flooding Franklin and the surrounding areas over this past weekend, many residents and local businesses saw their property damaged and made temporarily uninhabitable. Today, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) vowed to support any efforts by the Governor if federal assistance is requested, stating, "it's important that we all come together as quickly and expeditiously as possible to assist individuals, families and business owners who have suffered as a result of this devastating flooding."  
   As Governor, Senator Allen directed State efforts in numerous such disasters and has worked closely with both the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration in helping Virginia residents rebuild and recover from recent storms. In September, Senator Allen experienced torrential floods in Hampton Roads first hand, vowing to bring quick assistance to individuals, families and businesses affected by Tropical Storm Ernesto. "I stand ready," said Senator Allen today, "to help people whose homes, farms, and businesses in Franklin, Southampton County and Surry, Isle of Wight County and elsewhere were damaged by this flood. I will work with local and State officials to assess the situation quickly, and look for all available State and federal resources to help those struggling to recover." 
   As the waters recede in Franklin , Senator Allen pledges to work with Governor Kaine and local officials if it's determined that the amount of damages require federal assistance. "My first priority in such times is safety. Then, the good hard-working folks in Franklin and the surrounding area who have lost property should contact their local officials to begin the process of cleaning up and rebuilding," said Senator Allen."
