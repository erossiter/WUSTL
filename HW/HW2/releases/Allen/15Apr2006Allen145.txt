SEN. ALLEN SEEKS OPTIONS FOR FORD PLANT AND EMPLOYEES
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today confirmed plans to join Virginia's Governor and Norfolk's Mayor on Monday as they meet to consider options for employees at the Ford Norfolk Assembly Plant. 
  "The news of this plant closing is similar to a family member on life support for the many generations of hard working, strong, and loyal people who have made this plant successful through the years," said Senator Allen. "Even though it's a long shot, I hope that our meeting on Monday will have some chance of putting the brakes on this closure. Since I first announced its expansion when I was Governor, I have visited this top quality plant regularly and have seen and felt the teamwork and pride of their work ethic and attitude. I really empathize with the employees since this decision will significantly change the lives of real people and their families. This closure, if completed, will reverberate for folks across this region. If this closure does occur I stand ready to work with State and local officials to help find incentives so this valuable plant won't sit idle and I will work with the U.S. Department of Labor and other federal agencies to help coordinate efforts for these workers to train and transition to new jobs."
  Senator Allen will meet with Governor Kaine, Mayor Fraim, other local and State officials, and representatives from the United Auto Workers at Norfolk City Hall on Monday morning. This meeting is closed to the public and press but it is expected that there will be a press availability or statements released at the conclusion of the meeting. (Tentatively 10:15 AM)
