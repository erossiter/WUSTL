SEN. ALLEN URGES FEMA TO BE READY TO ACT IN VIRGINIA AND THE CAROLINAS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today issued the following statement today in response to the hurricane watch and tropical storm warning that has now been extended north from the Virginia/North Carolina border to Cape Charles, Virginia:  
   "In the event that the storm does hit Virginia, I have been in contact today with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that their resources are pre-positioned and ready immediately to be available for Virginians should they be needed. While government can issue warnings and help with recovery and clean up, it is important that individual citizens also take advance steps to prepare themselves, their families and their property for this potential threat. I want all Virginians to be prepared for this storm so that we can lessen and avoid tragic losses from occurring. 
   "Remembering the Hurricane Katrina disaster, I want to warn and emphasize to Virginians to heed the possibility that Hurricane Ophelia could come ashore in or near Virginia in the next 36 hours. The National Weather Service has placed parts of Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore under a hurricane watch. It's vitally important for Virginians to pay attention to messages from local emergency authorities as the storm approaches, particularly those who live in close proximity to the coastal waters and the Chesapeake Bay."
