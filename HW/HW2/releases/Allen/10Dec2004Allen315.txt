SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS FOR WESTERN VIRGINIA STUDENTS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today announced the students who have been nominated to attend United States Service Academies. 
   "I am honored to have the privilege to nominate these students to our nation's Service Academies," said Senator Allen. "These fine young men and women are the very best of Virginia and I am confident that they will represent our Commonwealth and nation well."  
   The following students from Western Virginia received Academy nominations from Senator Allen: 
   * Michael Chidester, of Roanoke, has been nominated to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Chidester currently attends Giles High School where he is an ambassador and member of the award winning Chorale Ensemble. In addition, Chidester is an All-District baseball player and officer in his church youth group. Chidester is the son of Richard and Toni Chidester. 
   * Arden Cox, of Roanoke, has been nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy. Cox currently attends Byrd High School where she is an honor roll student and President of the French Club. In addition, Cox received the 2004 William and Mary Leadership award. She is the daughter of Ray and Sarah Cox. 
   * Michael Kearnes, of Harrisonburg, has been nominated to the U.S. Military Academy. Kearnes currently attends Turner Ashby High School where he serves as Captain of the Varsity Wrestling team. In addition, Kearns is an Eagle Scout and a member of the National Honor Society. He is the son of Douglas and Donna Kearnes. 
   Every year, Senator Allen can nominate one up to ten students to each Service Academy, with the exception of the Coast Guard Academy which does not require a congressional nomination for appointment. Senator Allen's nomination process is detailed and highly competitive. After each prospective nominee returns a completed application, Senator Allen's Service Academy Review Board evaluates and interviews the applicants who make it to the final round. The applications, along with the Review Board's recommendations, are then given to Senator Allen who determines the final list of nominees. All nominees must also receive an offer of appointment by their respective Academy in order to gain admission.
