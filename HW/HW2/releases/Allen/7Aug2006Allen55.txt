SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES RURAL FIRE ASSISTANCE GRANT TO BLUE RIDGE FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Department of the Interior has awarded a grant of $18,000 to Blue Ridge Fire and Rescue Department in Clarke County. These funds will allow the purchase of radios and protective clothing for local firefighters. Blue Ridge Fire and Rescue was the only fire department along the Appalachian Trail to submit a qualifying application. 
   "I am thrilled that Blue Ridge firefighters are receiving funds to purchase much needed radios and protective gear that will allow them to better serve their communities," said Senator Allen. "I'm very pleased that the taxpayer's money is being spent wisely by protecting our national parks and cherished lands. These volunteers play a vital role in protecting our safety and preserving the beauty of Virginia , and I'm honored to offer my assistance in this regard. I look forward to doing so again." 
   The Department of the Interior (DOI) receives an appropriated budget each year for a rural fire assistance (RFA) grant program. The maximum award is $20,000. This funding will enhance the fire protection capabilities of rural and volunteer fire departments through training, equipment purchases, and fire prevention work on a cost-shared basis. The DOI assistance program targets rural and volunteer fire departments that routinely help fight fire on or near DOI lands. One of these four agencies administers those lands: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Park Service (NPS).
