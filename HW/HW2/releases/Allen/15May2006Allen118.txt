SEN. ALLEN SUPPORTS NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ON BORDER ONLY AS A 'SHORT-TERM GAP APPROACH'
  In anticipation of the President's expected call tonight to use National Guard troops to bolster border security along the U.S-Mexico border, Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today released the following statement: 
  "A country that can not control its border can not control its own destiny. As I've been saying for a long while, the people of America expect their government to prevent and stop further illegal immigration. The President has come around to understanding that we must secure the border. Americans realize we have to secure the border. As a short-term stop gap approach, I believe that our National Guard troops can be used to support and backup U.S Border Patrol agents. 
  "As I've advocated and voted in the past, we need more border security personnel, detention facilities, actual and virtual fences to stop the flow of unaccountable, illegal entry into our country. 
  "President Bush is right to focus on better securing our border. However, that does not mean that the government should reward illegal behavior with amnesty. 
   This needed action needs to show results and does not justify the convoluted, three tiered scheme to reward those who have illegally entered our nation, which some have proposed. With a mother who legally came to this country after World War II, I personally realize that America is a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws and should remain both," said Senator Allen.
