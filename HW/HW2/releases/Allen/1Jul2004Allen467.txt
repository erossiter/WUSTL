  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded a grant in the amount of $5 million to the Southeastern Virginia Job Training Administration for the NEXStep Program.  
 The program provides job assistance to military personnel assigned to the Hampton Roads area as well as assistance to spouses of military personnel, reservists and National Guardsman returning from overseas who did not have a job prior to placement. 
   "It is always in the best interest of America when we support the families who sacrifice for our freedom," said Senator Allen. "The NEXStep program has been tremendously successful in Hampton Roads, and I believe that it can serve as a national model for assisting military spouses. It's a wonderful and cost-effective way to provide additional support to the families of our military at this perilous time in our nation's fight against terrorism." 
   Personnel and spouses from the Norfolk Naval Station, Oceana Naval Station, Little Creek Amphibious Base, Langley Air Force Base and Fort Eustis Army Installation are eligible to receive assistance. 
   The Department of Labor has teamed up with the Department of Defense to enable the Southeastern Virginia Job Training Administration to continue their training of military personnel who have been displaced. The services that NEXStep offers includes counseling, assessment, job search assistance, job development, job placement, basic skills training, on the job training and other supportive services. 
   On April 16, 2004 Senator Allen wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao in support of the grant application.
