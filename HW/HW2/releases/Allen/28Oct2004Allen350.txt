SEN. ALLEN ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION PROJECT TO PROTECT 2,000 ACRES OF WETLANDS
  Sen. George Allen (R-VA) announced today that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awarded a grant in the amount of $1,000,000 to the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation to protect Mark's and Jack's Islands off the Eastern Shore.  
   "The preservation of our beautiful Virginia wetlands and the protection of the wildlife that live there is a vital part of our jobs as citizens and stewards of our great Commonwealth," said Senator Allen. "It is our responsibility to invest properly in these natural resources and to make sure that they are available for future generations to enjoy. I am confident that this project will help us make great strides in that endeavor." 
   Together with the Nature Conservancy and Basic, Inc, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation will acquire 2,000 acres of salt marsh wetlands by the Chesapeake Bay in Accomack County. This acquisition will protect the spawning, nursery and feeding habitat for a variety of fish and shellfish, provide a habitat for threatened and endangered species, and create a habitat for numerous species of resident and migratory birds. The Nature Conservancy and Basic, Inc is providing an additional $1,021,750 bringing the total amount given for the project is $2,021,750. 
   This funding is part of the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program which awards grants to state and private partners to acquire, restore or enhance coastal wetlands for long-term conservation benefits to wildlife and habitat.
