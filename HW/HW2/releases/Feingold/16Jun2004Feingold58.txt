SEN. FEINGOLD URGES SENATE LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESS ENERGY MARKET MANIPULATION
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is urging U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) to place the Energy Needs Regulatory Oversight Now (ENRON) bill on the Senate calendar. The ENRON bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prohibit the use of manipulative practices that put both consumers and the reliability of the transmission grid at risk. The legislation, introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and cosponsored by Feingold, is similar to an amendment offered by Cantwell to last year's agriculture appropriations bill, which was easily passed by the Senate but was left out of the final conference report. In a letter to Frist, Feingold raised the importance of the issue citing the recent release of taped conversations between Enron energy traders bragging about stealing money from consumers, as well as the high energy costs the nation currently faces. 
   "We cannot let what happened to Enron consumers happen again," Feingold wrote in the letter. "(The ENRON legislation) is a simple bill that would ban a complicated practice - energy market manipulation - that has affected consumers across the country."
   Earlier this month, the Justice Department released tapes indicating that Enron corporation manipulated energy markets and gouged customers. The taped conversations also provide evidence that Enron made secret pacts with power producers and Enron traders deliberately drove up prices by ordering power plants to shut down.
   "We learned from the Enron crisis that electricity markets need close oversight to ensure that companies do not engage in risky and deceptive trading schemes leading to soaring energy prices and their own possible financial failure," Feingold said. "In both cases, consumers - the people who depend upon the electricity these companies generate or trade - are the losers. It is time for the Senate to take action on this legislation."
