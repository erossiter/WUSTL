SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE
  Sen. Russ Feingold is pushing for federal assistance to be given to the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Interior for the surveillance, management, research, and eradication of chronic wasting disease (CWD).  
 In letters to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture and Interior, Feingold called on appropriators to fund state wildlife and agriculture departments so they can adequately fight the fatal neurological disease that affects both captive and wild deer and elk. In April of this year, Feingold, along with the entire Wisconsin and Colorado congressional delegations, pressed the federal government to approve a national plan to address CWD.
   "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a serious problem affecting both wild and captive deer and elk populations," said Feingold. "People in Wisconsin, Colorado and other states have seen the effects of CWD, particularly on hunting and tourism, and it is clear that the federal government should work with the states to stop the spread of this troubling disease."
   Over the past few years, several federal agencies coordinated with state and local agencies to combat CWD across the country. While progress has been made on CWD research, management, and information dissemination, additional funding is required to continue these efforts.
   "State wildlife and agriculture departments' resources are spread too thin as they attempt to prevent the disease from spreading, treat infected or exposed populations, and conduct research for a cure," Feingold wrote in the letter. "The federal government needs to make CWD a high priority, providing the relevant federal agencies the additional funds they need to fight this troubling disease."
