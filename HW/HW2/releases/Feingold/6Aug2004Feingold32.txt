SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS FUNDS TO BATTLE LIVESTOCK DISEASE
  Sen. Russ Feingold is asking Senate appropriators to set aside funds to help manage Johne's disease.  
 The Johne's disease management program offers incentives to livestock producers to voluntarily begin testing for Johne's disease and to remove infected and exposed animals from their herds. Feingold sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture today, asking that adequate funding be appropriated to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for this program. This year, the administration's proposed budget would significantly cut the funding for the disease control program.
   "This devastating disease, for which there is no cure, could severely impact both the health of livestock and the dairy industry in Wisconsin and across the nation," Feingold said. "We must ensure that we provide the necessary funding to help farmers manage Johne's in their herds and stop it from spreading." 
   Johne's disease is a chronic infectious animal disease of the intestinal tract in livestock that causes losses in milk production and an eventual wasting away of the animal. If not detected and eliminated, the disease may spread throughout the herd. Johne's disease is projected to infect over 20 percent of dairy herds, costing U.S. dairy producers in excess of $200 million annually. 
   "I have long fought to help control this disease by securing funding for education regarding, and implementation of, Johne's disease management programs and will continue to press for funding in the future," Feingold said. "Hundreds of dairy farmers now participate in these voluntary programs to help keep our livestock and dairy industry safe, and we must do all that we can to ensure that this program continues."
