SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES FUNDING FOR 'GREEN JOBS'
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) is supporting ways to move the country toward energy independence through the creation of "green collar" jobs. Feingold has joined an effort led by fellow Senate Budget Committee member Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to urge their fellow Budget Committee members to fully fund a Green Collar Jobs Initiative, aimed at funding renewable energy and advanced technology polices included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The initiative would create jobs with the goal of producing energy efficient buildings, solar panels, wind turbines, advanced technology vehicles and renewable biofuels and energy. 
   "When I travel around Wisconsin holding my listening sessions, two of the most frequently raised domestic concerns are job losses and energy issues," Feingold said. "This green jobs initiative is exactly what our country should be doing to reduce our dependency on oil and slow climate change while providing jobs to hard-working Americans."
   In a letter to the Senate Budget Committee leadership, Feingold and the other senators called for the full funding of programs in last year's Energy Bill including:
   * Energy efficiency and conservation block grants
   * Weatherization and commercial building initiatives
   * Incentives for advanced battery production and storage capability 
   * Energy efficiency and renewable energy worker training program 
   * Loans for retooling factories for the production of advanced technology vehicles including hybrids, plug-ins hybrids, advanced direct injection gasoline, advanced diesel, and fuel cells.
   * Advanced biofuels production and infrastructure 
   "The United States has the opportunity to improve our economy and global competitiveness by creating green jobs at home, in a growing sector that produces clean and efficient homes, appliances, vehicles, fuels, and energy. Investing domestically now will ensure we do not have to import renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and advanced biofuels," the senators wrote.
