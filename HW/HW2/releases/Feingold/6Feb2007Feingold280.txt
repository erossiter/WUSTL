SENS. FEINGOLD, COLLINS WORK TO ENHANCE MEDICARE FOR RURAL BENEFICIARIES
  Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have introduced the Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007 to address Medicare's discrimination against rural America's seniors and health care providers. The legislation will change some of the inequitable payments that harm rural communities and provide rural areas the help they need to grow crucial health information technology infrastructures. It also offers incentives to help attract the nation's top medical talent to underserved rural areas and mandates rural representation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that is proportional to the nation's number of rural Medicare beneficiaries.  
   "It is time to change Medicare to ensure fairness for rural states like Wisconsin," Feingold said. "Rural Wisconsinites and all Americans living in rural areas have worked hard and paid into the Medicare program all their lives and deserve full access to the benefits that Medicare provides."
   "Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor urban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural states like Maine into account. This simply is not fair. The people of Maine pay the same payroll taxes to Medicare, and our seniors pay the same premiums, deductibles and copayments as Medicare beneficiaries in other parts of the country," Collins said. "The legislation we are introducing today will help to reduce these inequities and promote fairness in Medicare spending."
   Almost one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries currently resides in rural areas, where both geographic isolation and the scarcity of health care providers are serious barriers to accessing care. In these areas, physicians are paid at lower rates compared to their urban counterparts, hospitals have a more difficult time recruiting staff, and health information technology adoption lags. The Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007 will address some of the systemic inequities that exist within the Medicare program to improve access and quality for rural Medicare beneficiaries.
   The Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007 would:
   * Create fairer reimbursement for rural physicians through elimination of the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for work.
   * Take a first step to reform the unfair Medicare formulas for physicians by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to examine data reform for the practice expense GPCI.
   * Create a demonstration project to help rural hospitals to host educators and clinical practitioners in clinical rotations.
   * Create a demonstration project to allow for health information technology improvements in rural areas.
   * Require that the proportion of MedPAC members representing rural interests be no less than proportion of Medicare beneficiaries residing in rural areas.
