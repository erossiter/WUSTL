SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPPORTING PRESIDENT'S VETO OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  "The President's veto of the WRDA bill is a welcome opportunity for Congress to modify the flawed, bloated bill. Instead of trying to override the veto, Congress should take this opportunity to fix the bill. We must make sure that Americans' tax dollars are spent on the most important priorities, not just on members' pet projects. We don't do our constituents favors by spending their tax dollars on projects that are not justified or fully reviewed. We need to put the "independent" back into independent review, a critical component of reforming the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I will continue to push for Corps reforms that ensure fiscal responsibility, accountability, public safety, and environmental protections."
