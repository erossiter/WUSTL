SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS TO PROTECT AT-RISK CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING
  Sen. Russ Feingold is working to secure funding to protect children from lead poisoning and other home health hazards.  
 In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD, Feingold and a bipartisan group of Senators requested funding for the HUD healthy homes and lead hazard control program, including funding for the Healthy Homes Initiative. The city of Milwaukee is one of the communities in Wisconsin most affected by lead paint and has received funding through these programs in the past.
   "This highly competitive grant program is an extremely effective way to allocate scarce government resources to the communities most in need," the letter read. "This level of funding will also help maintain momentum towards the national goal of protecting all children from lead poisoning by 2010."
   The Healthy Homes Initiative is vital to protecting the health of children and preventing childhood asthma, lead poisoning and other diseases associated with housing-related hazards. It also recognizes that multiple health risks are interrelated, such as water damage causing paint deterioration while also encouraging the growth of mold and other agents responsible for childhood asthma.
   "No child should be subject to disease-causing hazards like lead paint, mold, and mildew, especially in their own home," Feingold said. "This funding would help communities identify dangerous conditions as well as prevent hazardous situations before children are harmed."
