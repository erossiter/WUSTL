SEN. FEINGOLD GOES TO BAT FOR WISCONSIN MILITARY BASES
  Sen. Russ Feingold met yesterday with the U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment Philip Grone to highlight Wisconsin's excellent military facilities and their important contributions to the security of the country.  
 Feingold called the meeting productive. He was pleased that he had the chance to tell the Defense Department about the important contributions Wisconsin's military facilities have made in the past three years and the strong support these installations have in Wisconsin.
   Mr. Grone is a key member of the Defense Department's team evaluating all military facilities throughout the United States as part of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. The key criterion they are using for this evaluation is military value. 
   "I was extremely pleased that I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Grone and highlight for the Pentagon the military value of Wisconsin's facilities," Feingold said. "Wisconsin's military facilities continue to be a tremendous asset for America's military and help to strengthen our national security. I will continue to support these facilities and the important service they provide local communities, Wisconsin, and the entire country."
