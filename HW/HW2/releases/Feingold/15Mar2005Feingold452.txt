SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR TORTURE VICTIMS
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is cosponsoring legislation supporting programs for victims of torture.  
 Feingold is cosponsoring the bipartisan Torture Victims Reauthorization Act (TVRA), which funds treatment programs for torture victims in the United States and abroad. The bill, introduced by Sens. Mark Dayton (D-MN) and Norm Coleman (R-MN), would reauthorize funding for the treatment programs which also work for the elimination of torture throughout the world.
   "After surviving horrific circumstances, victims of torture need treatment to help them recover and move on with their lives," Feingold said. "By providing treatment centers with more resources, these programs will be able to offer more victims of torture the critical care they need, while working to bring an end to torture worldwide." 
   The original Torture Victims Relief Act was adopted by Congress in 1998. The TVRA would increase the amount of support that treatment programs, like the treatment programs at the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis, receive under the legislation. Increased funds will allow for more access to both mental and physical care, as well as interpreters and other staff to assist victims all over the world.
