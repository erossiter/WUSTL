SEN. FEINGOLD OFFERS PAY-AS-YOU-GO AMENDMENT TO REIN IN DEFICIT
  Today, Sen. Russ Feingold introduced an amendment to the 2006 Budget Resolution restoring fiscal discipline to the budget process. Sen.  
 Feingold's pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) amendment would force Congress to find offsets to pay for new tax cuts or new spending on entitlement programs like Medicare. If offsets for spending or tax cuts were not included, Feingold's amendment would subject the proposals to a budget point of order. In the Senate, that would mean such proposals would need a 60-vote majority for them to pass. 
   "During the 1990s, we were successful in balancing the budget, largely in part to common-sense fiscal policies like PAYGO," Feingold said. "PAYGO does not mean we cannot cut taxes or strengthen mandatory programs. It just means that we should do what any American family does in order to be fiscally responsible - find ways to pay for the things they want."
   Last year, Feingold's PAYGO amendment passed with bipartisan support when it was offered on the Senate floor. However, congressional leaders' decision not to include the spending rule in the final version of the proposed budget resulted in no budget being passed last year.
   "The fiscally reckless policies of the federal government over the last few years have produced a mountain of debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay," Feingold said. "My amendment is a first step in restoring some fiscal sanity to a system that has created this mess."
