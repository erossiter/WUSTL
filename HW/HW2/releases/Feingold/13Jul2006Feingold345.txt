SEN. FEINGOLD CONTINUES EFFORT TO INCREASE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FUNDING
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is supporting an effort to increase funding for Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPGs). Feingold is part of a bipartisan group of Senators cosponsoring amendments to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that would increase funding for the grant program created to help state and local governments respond to emergencies of all types and sizes. The amendments were introduced by Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH). 
   "In recent years, our nation has seen natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina as well as terrorist attacks," Feingold said. "Emergency Management Performance Grants are vital to helping state and local governments make the necessary preparations to respond to any type of disaster and keep people safe."
   Feingold has consistently supported the EMPG program. In April 2006, Feingold was part of a bipartisan effort urging Senate appropriators to not only restore funding to the EMPG program that was cut in the Administration's budget request, but to increase the funding, as well. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the EMPG program has been used to increase state and local preparedness around the country. The EMPG program gives the flexibility to allocate funds according to risk in order to address the most urgent state and local needs.
   "Our national security must be our top priority," Feingold said. "We need to enhance our ability, at every level of government, to protect the families and communities in Wisconsin and all over the nation."
