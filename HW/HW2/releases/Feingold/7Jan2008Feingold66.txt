SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT CASE ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LETHAL INJECTION
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  On the Supreme Court Case on the Constitutionality of Lethal Injection
   "As the Supreme Court effectively halts executions nationwide to consider the constitutionality of lethal injection, we should take the opportunity to address just how deeply flawed the implementation of capital punishment in this country is. Racial disparities, convictions based on bad evidence, and grossly inadequate indigent defense systems are among the compelling reasons why state-sponsored executions have no place in a nation based on equal justice under the law. The recent abolition of the death penalty in New Jersey and the American Bar Association's call for a nationwide moratorium are positive signs of increasing support for ending the death penalty."
   Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), a longtime opponent of capital punishment, is the author of S.447 - the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act.
