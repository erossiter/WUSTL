SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE
  Today, Sen. Russ Feingold cosponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill, offered by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. Although the amendment failed, Feingold will continue working with Senator Kennedy and his colleagues to raise the federal minimum wage. 
   Feingold voted for the last minimum wage increase in 1997, which brought it to its current level of $5.15 an hour. Since then, twenty-one states, including the state of Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have responded to congressional inaction and raised their minimum wages. Feingold has consistently supported efforts to increase the federal minimum wage and believes that far more needs to be done to support hard-working American families.
   "Congress should follow Wisconsin's lead by passing legislation boosting the federal minimum wage," Feingold said. "People working full-time jobs should not have to worry about affording groceries, medicine or other basic necessities. This increase would help those hard-working wage-earners who scrimp and save to provide for themselves and their families."
   More than seventy percent of those who would benefit from an increase in the federal minimum wage are adults, and one-third of these are the sole breadwinners in the families. A minimum wage increase can help ease growing financial burdens, such as health care premiums and energy costs, on working Americans.
   "The minimum wage was created to ensure that American workers were fairly compensated for a day's work. But today the minimum wage isn't living up to that promise. I will continue fighting for a higher minimum wage because more work needs to be done to support hard-working American families."
