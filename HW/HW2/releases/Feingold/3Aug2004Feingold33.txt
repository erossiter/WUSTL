SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON NORTHERN UGANDA CRISIS RESPONSE ACT BEING SIGNED INTO LAW
  Sen. Russ Feingold today released the following statement regarding the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act being signed into law: 
   "I welcome the action that the President has taken to sign the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act into law. I authored this bill because the horrifying conflict in Northern Uganda - a conflict in which children have been singled out for appalling treatment - threatens the future of an important African ally and violates the most basic standards of human decency. This law signals the resolve of the United States to work with the Government of Uganda and the international community to address this crisis and to protect the innocent civilians who are suffering in the region. The bill also sends a crystal clear signal to the Government of Sudan - even in the midst of the crisis in Darfur and negotiations of a north-south peace, we will not forget the children of northern Uganda. I welcome the President's action, and look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and with colleagues on both sides of the aisle bring some hope to the people of Northern Uganda."
