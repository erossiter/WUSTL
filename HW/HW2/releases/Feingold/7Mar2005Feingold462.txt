SEN. FEINGOLD LEADS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO INCREASE MAXIMUM PELL GRANT AWARD
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is helping lead a bipartisan effort to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to $4,500. Sen.  
 Feingold, along with Sens. Norm Coleman (R-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues, sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee strongly urging them to increase the maximum award to help lower income students receive a college education. Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment to the Budget Resolution increasing the maximum Pell Grant award to $4,500 but the FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill set the maximum Pell award at $4,050. Feingold has helped lead several efforts in recent years to raise the maximum Pell Grant Award with an ultimate goal of more than doubling Pell Grant funding by 2010.
   "The Pell Grant award provides critical help to many young Americans who hope to continue their education," Feingold said. "Increasing the maximum Pell Grant award is an investment in both the future of our children and the future of this nation. A stronger economy and a more skilled workforce begin with getting more young people a college education."
   The Pell Grant program is one of the most successful programs in helping lower income students attend secondary education. In 2005 alone, an estimated 5.3 million students will receive Pell Grants. Despite continued increases in the cost of college tuition, the maximum Pell Grant award has been frozen for three years. 
   "Increases are needed to ensure that the door to a college education, and the future that it offers, is not shut on millions of needy Americans," the letter read.
