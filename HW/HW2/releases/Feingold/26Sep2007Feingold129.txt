SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
  "This month we honor the proud history of our nation's Hispanic community, and pay tribute to the extraordinary contributions that people of Hispanic heritage have made and continue to make to the United States. We are a richer nation in every sense because of those contributions, and because of what they represent - a country that draws strength from its great diversity. Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates people whose roots extend back to dozens of nations around the world and who are an integral part of America's communities. 
   As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, it is also time to address the challenges that face the Hispanic community, such as ensuring access to education and health care, improving working conditions, ending racial profiling, and updating our flawed immigration system. Congress must address these issues and other urgent matters for Hispanic Americans not just for one month, but all year long."
