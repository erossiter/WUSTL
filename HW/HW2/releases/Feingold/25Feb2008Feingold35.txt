SEN. FEINGOLD FIGHTS FOR PROTECTIONS FOR FAMILY FARMERS
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is continuing his fight to ensure family farmers and the self-employed remain eligible for the protections they deserve. Feingold is urging members of the Farm Bill conference committee to maintain in the final bill a provision similar to one he proposed to update the tax code so farmers and other self-employed individuals can remain eligible for Social Security and disability benefits. Currently, bad weather or low commodity prices can adversely affect farmers, putting their incomes and eligibility for benefits in jeopardy. The provision would update the tax code to allow farmers and other self-employed individuals the option to contribute more fully to Social Security and Medicare, thus enhancing their eligibility for benefits under those programs. 
   "Farming can be a tough business and I'm concerned when Wisconsin farmers tell me that the tax code is preventing them from receiving full protections under Social Security or hospital insurance under Medicare," Feingold said. "It is important for farmers and other self-employed individuals to be able to protect their families in the event of death or disability. The final Farm Bill should fix this injustice once and for all."
   The fair tax provision is similar to the Farmer Fair Tax Act of 2007 that Feingold introduced last year that gives farmers and self-employed individuals the option of contributing to Social Security and Medicare sufficiently to maintain eligibility for benefits. The provision would not force anyone to pay more into the programs; it simply updates the tax code so individuals can choose to keep their eligibility for much-needed protections. The provision would be indexed for inflation, to ensure that this problem does not happen again.
