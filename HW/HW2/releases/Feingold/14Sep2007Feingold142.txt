SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON LANDMARK LOBBYING AND ETHICS REFORM BILL BECOMING LAW
  "I am pleased the President decided to sign the lobbying and ethics reform bill. It is strong and serious reform and will make a real difference. The public is well aware that Washington lobbyists have too much influence in Congress. By banning gifts from lobbyists, ending the use of corporate jets, strengthening revolving door restrictions, and requiring disclosure of lobbyists' political contributions and bundling, this bill will provide significant protection against the kinds of abuses that brought us the Abramoff scandal. Ethical conduct by public officials should not just be an aspiration, it should be a requirement. I applaud my colleagues and the Democratic leadership for recognizing and acting on the public's demand for far-reaching reform."
