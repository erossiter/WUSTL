SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY FOR NATION'S DAIRY PRODUCERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is working to protect the right of individual dairy farmers to cast their vote on dairy policy issues.  
 After hearing from dairy farmers in Wisconsin, Feingold has introduced the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act, which provides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot if the individual farmers choose to vote differently than the cooperative's board of directors. Through "bloc voting," dairy marketing cooperatives cast votes on behalf of all cooperative members in the interest of saving time, even though it means that individual farmers have no chance to make their differing voices heard.
   "I heard from dairy producers in Wisconsin that they are barred from voicing their opinions if those opinions differ from those of their co-op," Feingold said. "Our farmers should have the right to freely express their opinions."
   Feingold's bill requires cooperatives to provide their members with important information to help them determine whether they wish to exercise their option to vote independently of the cooperative. Co-ops must provide a description of the questions presented in the referendum, a statement of the manner in which the cooperative association intends to cast its vote on behalf of the membership, and information regarding the procedures by which a producer may cast an individual ballot.
   "This bill will in no way slow down the process at USDA and I fully expect many farmers to go along with the co-ops that represent them," Feingold said. "But we must make sure that the system we have in place allows for all opinions to be rightfully heard. That is simply the American way."
