SEN. FEINGOLD ?JOBS WEEK' TO HIGHLIGHT INITIATIVES AIMED AT PROTECTING AMERICAN JOBS
  Sen. Russ Feingold will be highlighting portions of his agenda in the new Congress to save American jobs starting at local Listening Sessions scheduled over the weekend. Sen. Feingold has been a leader in efforts to fix flawed trade agreements, require the Federal Government to buy American-made goods whenever possible, and help displaced works get the training they need to compete in a new job market. Next week, Sen. Feingold will be introducing a number of these initiatives aimed at ensuring American workers are allowed to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world. 
   "Over the last few years, factories in Wisconsin and around the country, have closed their doors because they simply cannot compete with manufacturing overseas or across our border," Feingold said. "Wisconsin has been especially hard hit by job losses over the last 4 years and we cannot stand by any longer and let the hemorrhaging of jobs continue. The pieces of legislation that I will introduce next week present some good first steps toward ensuring that our workers have a fighting chance to compete."
   Last Congress, Feingold successfully pushed provisions that were enacted to require all federal departments and agencies to report to Congress and the American people on the amount of foreign-made goods that they purchase in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.
