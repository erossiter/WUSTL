SEN. FEINGOLD: 'RURAL AED PROGRAM BRINGS LIFE-SAVING MACHINES TO WISCONSIN'
  Sen. Russ Feingold today highlighted the recently announced Wisconsin recipients of the Rural AED (automated external defibrillators) Grant. These AED grants are made possible through a program that Feingold legislation created. Feingold and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) authored the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act that became law in 2000. In 2003, Feingold and Collins successfully got $10 million included in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill to fund the Rural AED Program for next year. 
   "I am pleased to hear that more people in rural communities across Wisconsin will have access to this invaluable equipment," Feingold said. "The Rural AED Program brings life-saving machines to Wisconsin, and to rural communities all over the country. 107 AEDs are headed to Wisconsin this year alone as part of the program. AEDs give people across America a fighting chance to stop cardiac arrest before another life is lost."
   AEDs are computerized devices that administer an electric shock which can return the heart from ventricular fibrillation (a sudden chaotic interruption of the heart's electrical impulses) to a normal rhythm. Quick access to AEDs in an emergency is vital because for every minute that the heart is in an abnormal rhythm a cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 percent. It is especially important to increase access to AEDs in smaller towns and rural areas where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. For his continued efforts in the fight against heart disease and stroke, Feingold has received the National Public Service Award from the American Heart Association.
   "Rural areas have been at a disadvantage in treating heart attack victims because of the lack of accessible AEDs and this program goes a long way in filling that need," Feingold said. "I will continue to fight for increased funding for and access to AEDs. Cardiac arrest victims are in a race against time and an essential step in treating these victims is early access to defibrillation." 
   Attached is a list of agencies and counties that will receive AEDs as part of this program. More information is also available at http://www.dhfs.wisconsin.gov/dph_emsip/
