SEN. FEINGOLD LEADS EFFORT TO HELP ACHIEVE HEALTH CARE REFORM
  The Senate Budget Committee adopted an amendment cosponsored by Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) which creates a health care reserve fund that will help our nation improve and provide health care coverage. The Health Care Reform Reserve Fund, offered by Feingold and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), both members of the Senate Budget Committee, will help break the logjam in Congress over health care and allow the country to move closer to achieving health care reform. This effort will allow the Senate to consider a variety of approaches to attaining health care for those who are uninsured and underinsured. It is also a fiscally responsible measure that requires any health care plan to remain deficit neutral. 
   "For too long, Congress has sat on the sidelines while the country's health care crisis has gotten worse," Feingold said. "I was pleased that my colleagues supported this important measure and used the budget resolution as a tool to help move the Senate forward on this necessary and critical debate." 
   Feingold is a strong supporter of guaranteed health care coverage for all Americans and favors a state-based approach to achieving reform. Last year he introduced the State-Based Health Care Reform Act that provides states the flexibility to choose their own way of covering their residents, provided they meet specified minimum requirements. Additionally, the legislation is aimed at breaking the stalemate in Congress that has prevented the enactment of meaningful health care reform. Feingold worked to ensure that The Health Care Reform Reserve Fund would not prohibit the consideration of a state-based approach. 
   "This is an important step to opening debate and helping find an approach to health care reform that is best for this nation," Feingold said.
