SEN. FEINGOLD URGES ADMINISTRATION TO PROTECT NATION'S WETLANDS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is leading an effort to help protect the nation's waterways by urging the administration to fully enforce the Clean Water Act. The administration policy, announced in January 2003, allows the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to unilaterally declare wetlands, streams and other waters, which have long been protected by the Clean Water Act, as now outside the law's jurisdiction. Without these protections, these waters would be vulnerable to sewage, animal waste, and other forms of pollution. Sen. Feingold was joined by 31 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the President requesting that the policy be rescinded. 
   "The Clean Water Act is the centerpiece of our nation's efforts to protect our wetlands," Feingold said. "With our nation's wetlands constantly being threatened by pollution, we need to enforce protections of these treasured lands to ensure the health and safety of the environment, wildlife, and our nation's citizens." 
   Feingold has long been a leader in wetlands protection. Last year, Feingold introduced the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act clarifying U.S. jurisdiction over isolated wetlands. In October 2003, Feingold also spearheaded the successful Senate effort to urge the administration to rescind a proposed rule that would have left these waters unprotected by the Clean Water Act. Although the administration got rid of that proposed rule in December 2003, the January 2003 policy directive remains in place.
   "This policy directive is inconsistent with your administration's Earth Day pledge to go beyond the goal of "no net loss" of wetlands," the letter read. "The Clean Water Act is the centerpiece of the nation's efforts to protect wetlands and other water resources. It is meant to be supplemented, not supplanted, by voluntary conservation programs."
