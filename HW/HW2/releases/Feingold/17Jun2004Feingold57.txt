SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO MAKE COLLEGE REALITY FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is part of a bipartisan group of Senators supporting increased funding to help disadvantaged students complete secondary school and enroll in higher education. Sen.  
 Feingold joined a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues in writing a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Education requesting the additional funds. The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) provides five-year competitive grants to both states and partnerships to provide services at high-poverty middle and high schools, as well as scholarships for low-income students. The GEAR UP initiative is unique in that it uses partnerships made up of school districts, post-secondary education institutions, community organizations, state agencies, and other public or private agencies to help students advance.
   "Millions of students have been able to attend college through GEAR UP who otherwise may not have had that opportunity because of economic reasons," Feingold said. "The desire to learn, and not financial status, should determine the amount of education someone receives." 
   This year, more than 1.2 million students will be served through GEAR UP's 280 local partnership grants and 36 state grants. In the letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Education, the Senators asked that funding for GEAR UP be increased in order to help more deserving students across the country.
   "The gap in college attendance rates between students from higher income families and those from lower income families is disturbing," Feingold said. "We must support GEAR UP and other programs that have proven to be effective in sending more of our young people to college."
