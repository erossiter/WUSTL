SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MOST RECENT REPORT TO CONGRESS BY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY
  Sen. Russ Feingold released the following statement today regarding the most recent report to Congress by the Inspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.  
   "I welcome the most recent report to Congress by the Inspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority. Over the past months, the CPA IG found evidence of missing contract data, weak contract monitoring, ineffective controls over cash resources, and inadequate record keeping relating to both people and property. 
   American taxpayers were asked to make a tremendous commitment to Iraq's reconstruction. Billions of taxpayer dollars are at risk of being lost to waste, fraud, and abuse. That is why I pushed to create this special Inspector General, and why I have been fighting to keep the IG on the job despite the dissolution of the CPA. Today, less than $800 million of the $18.4 billion that Congress appropriated for Iraq's reconstruction last year has actually been spent. This report makes it even more clear than ever before that now is not the time to diminish our oversight on the ground. The IG's report should encourage the conferees currently working to reconcile House and Senate versions of the Defense authorization bill to retain my amendment that provides ongoing authority for this important work."
