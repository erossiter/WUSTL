SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SENATE MAJORITY LEADER TAKING UP SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FISA BILL
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  In Support of the Senate Majority Leader Taking Up the Senate Judiciary Committee FISA Bill
   The FISA bill approved by the Judiciary Committee is a significant step toward protecting the privacy of innocent Americans. While further improvements are needed to win my support, the Judiciary bill corrects several of the most important problems with the badly flawed bill that came out of the Intelligence Committee.
   It is now up to the Majority Leader to decide what bill to bring to the floor. I hope he decides to make the Judiciary Committee bill the starting point for debate and amendment. Because that bill does not provide amnesty to companies that allegedly cooperated with the administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program, supporters of amnesty would need to make their case before the full Senate. Congress needs to stand up to the administration to pass a bill that allows wiretapping of foreign terrorists overseas but protects the communications of law-abiding Americans.
