SEN. FEINGOLD RECEIVES PERFECT SCORE ON CHILD ADVOCACY ISSUES
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold received a perfect score from the Children's Defense Fund Action Council (CDFAC) on child advocacy issues in 2007. In its annual nonpartisan Congressional Scorecard, CDFAC recognized Feingold for his record, where he voted in every case to protect the health and well-being of Wisconsin's children. Feingold's support for the first increase in the minimum wage in a decade, improving the quality of and access to the Head Start program, and providing additional funds forneed-based aid for college students factored into his perfect score. 
   "I am honored by this recognition from the Children's Defense Fund, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of children in Wisconsin and across the country," Feingold said. "While Congress made some important strides for children last year, there is much work left to do. With rising health care and education costs, I will continue to do everything I can to ensure all of our children have access to health care and the opportunity to receive a good education."
   "I applaud Senator Feingold for his commitment to improving the lives of children in Wisconsin," said CDFAC President Marian Wright Edelman. "With 9.4 million uninsured children in America and nearly 13 million living in poverty, it is critical that we have senators committed to making children a priority. Senator Feingold is a dedicated advocate for children and has truly earned the distinction of being one of the best senators for children."
   The Children's Defense Fund is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the nation about the needs of children. CDFAC developed an interactive map and other online tools to show how Members of Congress voted by state.
