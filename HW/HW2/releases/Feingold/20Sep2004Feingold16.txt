SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION IN SHAYS V. FEC
  Sen. Russ Feingold issued the following statement today on the federal district court's decision in Shays v. FEC. 
   "The federal district court's decision in Shays v. FEC underscores what Senator McCain and I have been saying - that the FEC is refusing to properly interpret and enforce the federal election laws. Senator McCain and I filed an amicus brief in this lawsuit, which was brought by Representatives Shays and Meehan. The court's ruling in our favor sends a powerful message to the FEC that it does not have the power to rewrite statutes passed by Congress.
   The court agreed with us that many of the regulations that the FEC put in place after McCain/Feingold passed in 2002 were contrary to the intent of the law. It is now up to the FEC to redo these rules and follow congressional intent."
