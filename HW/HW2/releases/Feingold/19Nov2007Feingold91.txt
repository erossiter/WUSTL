SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON STOPPING INCREASING CONSOLIDATION OF MEDIA OWNERSHIP
  Today, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold wrote Kevin Martin, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), regarding the FCC's proceeding with respect to media ownership rules. After sending the letter, Feingold released the following statement laying out his concerns and in support of S. 2332, the Media Ownership Act. 
   "I have been fighting for years against the increasing consolidation of media ownership in this country. The 1996 Telecommunications Act, which I voted against, allowed for significant consolidation in radio ownership silencing many of the exceptional voices that are the strength of local radio. In the decade since the law's passage, we have seen small and independent media outlets replaced by corporate monoliths. I have contacted FCC Chairman Kevin Martin with my concerns about the FCC's failure to adequately address the harmful effects of media consolidation on local ownership, including minority-owned and women-owned broadcast stations. I also strongly support Senator Dorgan's Media Ownership Act to improve transparency in media ownership rulemaking. I will push for adoption of Senator Dorgan's bill and continue my efforts to ensure diverse and open media."
