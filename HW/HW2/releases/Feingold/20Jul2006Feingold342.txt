SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF DENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced yesterday that the Dental Health Improvement Act, legislation he and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) helped pass into law in 2002, is now funded and the Health Resources and Services Administration is accepting applications from states for oral health grants. The program will award states a one-time grant of roughly $100,000 to help them develop or expand innovative dental workforce development programs specific to their state's individual needs. 
   "Right now in Wisconsin and around the country, thousands of people are on waiting lists for their dental care needs," Feingold said. "With all the advancements in dentistry, it is inexcusable at this point that as many as eleven percent of our nation's rural population has never been to the dentist."
   Since getting the legislation enacted in 2002, Feingold has fought to try to make sure it receives full funding, so that oral health improvements are available to underserved individuals and families. Although oral health has dramatically improved over the last 50 years, these advances have not occurred evenly across all sectors of the nation's population. Consequently, effective treatment and prevention programs are not being implemented in many of our communities.
   "I continue to hear about the negative impact that the lack of dental care is having on the health of families in Wisconsin, particularly in Milwaukee and our rural communities," Feingold said. "That is why I am pleased to see that this law will get urgently needed resources to the states so they can help residents in rural and underserved areas gain access to quality dental care."
