SENS. FEINGOLD, ALLARD MEASURE REQUIRES GROUND RULES FOR HANDLING CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE
  Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) have successfully added an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 agriculture appropriations bill to bring overdue baseline national standards for handling chronic wasting disease (CWD).  
 Under the current system there are various state regulations, but no set of basic procedures guiding the movement, handling, testing and permitting of captive-raised deer and elk. The amendment requires the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service to publish its uniform methods and rules concerning CWD within 90 days of enactment of the provision. With CWD being newly discovered in New York and West Virginia, it is clear that this disease requires a national response.
   \"With cases of CWD being discovered in places that have not previously been affected, it is clear that this disease is a national issue that requires a national response,\" Feingold said. \"This provision requiring a federal plan to address chronic wasting disease is an important step to prevent the further spread of CWD and help deer and elk farmers operate safely throughout the nation.\"
   \"CWD continues to be an issue in Colorado and throughout our nation. In order to prevent the spread of this disease, and eventually conquer it, it is vital that we have a uniform federal plan. This amendment will help create such a plan,\" Senator Allard said.
   CWD is a contagious neurological disease affecting deer and elk, causing emaciation, or wasting, of the animals and eventually death. Cases of CWD have been reported in Colorado, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Nebraska, New York, Utah, New Mexico, Illinois, Montana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, West Virginia and parts of Canada.
