   FEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you again, Secretary Kelly. We have been dealing with this aspect of this issue for over 1.5 years now. And I wonder if you could just say a little bit about what good time does for us. 
   Isn't it the case that as time passes, North Korea could be adding to its nuclear arsenal? And what do you see as any additional leverage that the United States gains as time passes? 
   KELLY: Time is certainly a valid factor in this. Obviously, it would be better to reach an agreement sooner. We don't know the details. But it's quite possible that North Korea is proceeding along, developing additional fissionable material and possibly additional nuclear weapons. 
   The idea is that we have to have an agreement that, in fact, really ends this program. And that is the challenge of peaceful solution through diplomatic means. 
   FEINGOLD: Are you confident that North Korea cannot transfer nuclear capacity or know-how to other actors while we wait for the next round of talks? And secretary, on what would you base that confidence? 
   KELLY: I do not have any such confidence. I would note that, after a remark of April 2003 by a North Korean interlocutor, that it might be possible for them to transfer nuclear material or weapons, but that they have gone in quite the other direction. And, in fact, in response to specific questions, have repeatedly stated that they would not transfer nuclear weapons or fissionable material to any other destination outside of their country. But that assurance, like all the assurances from North Korea, has unfortunately not an unlimited value. 
   FEINGOLD: I assume that part of the North Korean strategy at these talks is to drive a wedge between other parties at the talks. How do they try to do this? Have they had any success at it? 
   You could look at the bilateral efforts of South Korea and Japan to suggest that they may have had some success in this regard. Could you comment on that? 
   KELLY: Senator Feingold, I don't see the bilateral efforts that Japan and North Korea have and that South Korea and North Korea have as undercutting our efforts in any respect. I see them as enhancing our efforts. 
   This is something that didn't exist at all 10 years ago. And I think it very much puts this in a broader dimension of how to do it. 
   Yes, sir, there have been some attempts, particularly in I think the first round of the Six-Party talks. But they haven't worked. The fact is, if there was any change in the atmosphere in these talks, it was because the self-isolation that was so obvious in the first two rounds of the Six-Party talks was something that North Korea was trying to avoid, but they really couldn't entirely avoid it. 
   FEINGOLD: Thank you. Finally, how do North Korean officials react when human rights issues are raised? Just if you could characterize their reaction to discussion of these issues for me. 
   KELLY: They refuse to discuss them. And because our focus is on, in these particular talks, is on the nuclear weapons issue, we have not pressed the issue beyond that. 
   FEINGOLD: Thank you for your answers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
